37670110,A wild boar cathelicidin peptide derivative inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and its drifted variants.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a clear threat to humanity. It has infected over 200 million and killed 4 million people worldwide, and infections continue with no end in sight. To control the pandemic, multiple effective vaccines have been developed, and global vaccinations are in progress. However, the virus continues to mutate. Even when full vaccine coverage is achieved, vaccine-resistant mutants will likely emerge, thus requiring new annual vaccines against drifted variants analogous to influenza. A complimentary solution to this problem could be developing antiviral drugs that inhibit SARS CoV-2 and its drifted variants. Host defense peptides represent a potential source for such an antiviral as they possess broad antimicrobial activity and significant diversity across species. We screened the cathelicidin family of peptides from 16 different species for antiviral activity and identified a wild boar peptide derivative that inhibits SARS CoV-2. This peptide, which we named Yongshi and means warrior in Mandarin, acts as a viral entry inhibitor. Following the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its receptor, the spike protein is cleaved, and heptad repeats 1 and 2 multimerize to form the fusion complex that enables the virion to enter the cell. A deep learning-based protein sequence comparison algorithm and molecular modeling suggest that Yongshi acts as a mimetic to the heptad repeats of the virus, thereby disrupting the fusion process. Experimental data confirm the binding of Yongshi to the heptad repeat 1 with a fourfold higher affinity than heptad repeat 2 of SARS-CoV-2. Yongshi also binds to the heptad repeat 1 of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Interestingly, it inhibits all drifted variants of SARS CoV-2 that we tested, including the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa and omicron variants.","['von Beck T', 'Navarrete K', 'Arce NA', 'Gao M', 'Dale GA', 'Davis-Gardner ME', 'Floyd K', 'Mena Hernandez L', 'Mullick N', 'Vanderheiden A', 'Skountzou I', 'Kuchipudi SV', 'Saravanan R', 'Li R', 'Skolnick J', 'Suthar MS', 'Jacob J']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"von Beck T, et al.

37662119,"Drawing Parallels between SARS, MERS, and COVID-19: A Comparative Overview of Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Pathological Features.","BACKGROUND: Since November 2019, when the novel coronavirus arose in Wuhan City, over 188 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19. It is the third coronavirus outbreak in the twenty-first century. Until now, practically all coronavirus epidemics have occurred due to zoonotic spread from an animal or transitional host or through the consumption of their products. Coronaviruses can infect humans and cause severe illness and even death.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review was designed to help us recognize and harmonize the similarities and differences between these three coronaviridae family members.
RESULT: Measures aimed at containing the epidemic should be emphasized in this circumstance. Prioritizing and planning these activities require an understanding of the particulars of these three viruses. Given the pandemic's enormous death toll and rapid spread, we should be cognizant of the parallels and differences between these three viruses. Additionally, this pandemic warns us to be cautious against the possibility of a future pandemic.
CONCLUSION: We highlight the fundamental characteristics of coronaviruses that are critical for recognizing coronavirus epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathological features that reveal numerous significant pathological attributes and evolutionary patterns in the viral genome that aid in better understanding and anticipating future epidemics.","['Pustake M', 'Giri P', 'Ganiyani MA', 'Mumtaz K', 'Deshmukh K', 'Saju M', 'Nunez JV', 'Orlova N', 'Das A']",2023,48,4,Indian J Community Med,"Pustake M, et al.

37649125,"Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2: complexity, mechanism and associated disorders.","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with critical illnesses, including severe respiratory disorders. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the deadly COVID-19 illness, which has spread globally as a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 may enter the human body through olfactory lobes and interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor, further facilitating cell binding and entry into the cells. Reports have shown that the virus can pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in various disorders. Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 largely relies on TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, which activate S protein. TMPRSS2 is found on the cell surface of respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital epithelium, while cathepsin-L is a part of endosomes.
AIM: The current review aims to provide information on how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects brain function.. Furthermore, CNS disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, and encephalitis, are discussed. The many probable mechanisms and paths involved in developing cerebrovascular problems in COVID patients are thoroughly detailed.
MAIN BODY: There have been reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS), where it could cause a various illnesses. Patients suffering from COVID-19 experience a range of neurological complications, including sleep disorders, viral encephalitis, headaches, dysgeusia, and cognitive impairment. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients has been reported. Health experts also reported its presence in cortical neurons and human brain organoids. The possible mechanism of virus infiltration into the brain can be neurotropic, direct infiltration and cytokine storm-based pathways. The olfactory lobes could also be the primary pathway for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can lead to neurological complications, such as cerebrovascular manifestations, motor movement complications, and cognitive decline. COVID-19 infection can result in cerebrovascular symptoms and diseases, such as strokes and thrombosis. The virus can affect the neural system, disrupt cognitive function and cause neurological disorders. To combat the epidemic, it is crucial to repurpose drugs currently in use quickly and develop novel therapeutics.","['Tyagi K', 'Rai P', 'Gautam A', 'Kaur H', 'Kapoor S', 'Suttee A', 'Jaiswal PK', 'Sharma A', 'Singh G', 'Barnwal RP']",2023,28,1,Eur J Med Res,"Tyagi K, et al.

New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA 9-mers for binding A-U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly-modified PNA compared to known A-binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen-hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A-binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.","['Talbott JM', 'Tessier BR', 'Harding EE', 'Walby GD', 'Hess KJ', 'Baskevics V', 'Katkevics M', 'Rozners E', 'MacKay JA']",2023,,,Chemistry,"Talbott JM, et al.

37635100,The Next Generation COVID-19 Antiviral; Niclosamide-Based Inorganic Nanohybrid System Kills SARS-CoV-2.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious global threat with surging new variants of concern. Although global vaccinations have slowed the pandemic, their longevity is still unknown. Therefore, new orally administrable antiviral agents are highly demanded. Among various repurposed drugs, niclosamide (NIC) is the most potential one for various viral diseases such as COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome), influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), etc. Since NIC cannot be effectively absorbed, a required plasma concentration for antiviral potency is hard to maintain, thereby restricting its entry into the infected cells. Such a 60-year-old bioavailability challenging issue has been overcome by engineering with MgO and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), forming hydrophilic NIC-MgO-HPMC, with improved intestinal permeability without altering NIC metabolism as confirmed by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. The inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2  replication is confirmed in the Syrian hamster model to reduce lung injury. Clinical studies reveal that the bioavailability of NIC hybrid drug can go 4 times higher than the intact NIC. The phase II clinical trial shows a dose-dependent bioavailability of NIC from hybrid drug  suggesting its potential applicability as a game changer in achieving the much-anticipated endemic phase.","['Choi G', 'Rejinold NS', 'Piao H', 'Ryu YB', 'Kwon HJ', 'Lee IC', 'Seo JI', 'Yoo HH', 'Jin GW', 'Choy JH']",2023,,,Small,"Choi G, et al.

37634194,Investigation of the Host Kinome Response to Coronavirus Infection Reveals PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors as Betacoronavirus Antivirals.,"Host kinases play essential roles in the host cell cycle, innate immune signaling, the stress response to viral infection, and inflammation. Previous work has demonstrated that coronaviruses specifically target kinase cascades to subvert host cell responses to infection and rely upon host kinase activity to phosphorylate viral proteins to enhance replication. Given the number of kinase inhibitors that are already FDA approved to treat cancers, fibrosis, and other human disease, they represent an attractive class of compounds to repurpose for host-targeted therapies against emerging coronavirus infections. To further understand the host kinome response to betacoronavirus infection, we employed multiplex inhibitory bead mass spectrometry (MIB-MS) following MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung epithelial cell lines. Our MIB-MS analyses revealed activation of mTOR and MAPK signaling following MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 host kinome responses were further characterized using paired phosphoproteomics, which identified activation of MAPK, PI3K, and mTOR signaling. Through chemogenomic screening, we found that clinically relevant PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were able to inhibit coronavirus replication at nanomolar concentrations similar to direct-acting antivirals. This study lays the groundwork for identifying broad-acting, host-targeted therapies to reduce betacoronavirus replication that can be rapidly repurposed during future outbreaks and epidemics. The proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and MIB-MS datasets generated in this study are available in the Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) repository under project identifiers PXD040897 and PXD040901.","['Fritch EJ', 'Mordant AL', 'Gilbert TSK', 'Wells CI', 'Yang X', 'Barker NK', 'Madden EA', 'Dinnon KH', 'Hou YJ', 'Tse LV', 'Castillo IN', 'Sims AC', 'Moorman NJ', 'Lakshmanane P', 'Willson TM', 'Herring LE', 'Graves LM', 'Baric RS']",2023,,,J Proteome Res,"Fritch EJ, et al.

37632009,Phenothiazines Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Entry through Targeting Spike Protein.,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought an unprecedented public health crisis and continues to threaten humanity due to the persistent emergence of new variants. Therefore, developing more effective and broad-spectrum therapeutic and prophylactic drugs against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as future emerging CoVs, is urgently needed. In this study, we screened several US FDA-approved drugs and identified phenothiazine derivatives with the ability to potently inhibit the infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and distinct variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.617.2 (Delta) and currently circulating Omicron sublineages XBB and BQ.1.1, as well as pseudotyped SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Mechanistic studies suggested that phenothiazines predominantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) infection at the early stage and potentially bound to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which may prevent the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, thereby exhibiting inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our findings suggest that phenothiazines can serve as a potential broad-spectrum therapeutic drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the infection of future emerging human coronaviruses (HCoVs).","['Liang T', 'Xiao S', 'Wu Z', 'Lv X', 'Liu S', 'Hu M', 'Li G', 'Li P', 'Ma X']",2023,15,8,Viruses,"Liang T, et al.

Camels act as intermediate hosts for MERS-CoV. Currently, no licensed vaccine is available for this virus. We have developed a potential candidate vaccine for MERS-CoV using the cold adaptation method. We cultivated the vaccine in Vero cells at temperatures as low as 22 °C. This live-attenuated vaccine virus showed high attenuation levels in transgenic mice with the MERS-CoV human receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (K18-hDPP4). The inoculated K18-hDPP4 mice exhibited no clinical signs such as death or body weight loss. Furthermore, no traces of infectious virus were observed when the tissues (nasal turbinate, brain, lung, and kidney) of the K18-hDPP4 mice infected with the cold-adapted vaccine strain were tested. A single intranasal dose of the vaccine administered to the noses of the K18-hDPP4 mice provided complete protection. We did not observe any deaths, body weight loss, or viral detection in the tissues (nasal turbinate, brain, lung, and kidney). Based on these promising results, the developed cold-adapted, attenuated MERS-CoV vaccine strain could be one of the candidates for human and animal vaccines.","['Seo H', 'Jang Y', 'Kwak D']",2023,11,8,Vaccines (Basel),"Seo H, et al.

37631017,Covalent Conjugates of Allylbenzenes and Terpenoids as Antibiotics Enhancers with the Function of Prolonged Action.,"The drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria is often due efflux pumps-specific proteins that remove foreign compounds from bacterial cells. To overcome drug resistance, adjuvants are often used that can inhibit efflux pumps or other systems that ensure the resistance of bacteria to the action of antibiotics. We assumed that a new level of effectiveness with the use of an antibiotic + an adjuvant pair could be achieved by their joint delivery into the pathogen. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of molecular carriers based on poly-(olygo-, dendry)mers based on cyclodextrin-grafted PEI or mannan, as well as glycol chitosan, covalently bound to antibiotic, adjuvant, and the oligosaccharide ligand to the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206), which we studied earlier and showed high efficiency and selectivity of delivery of a therapeutic ""cargo"" to macrophages. Moxifloxacin was used as an antibiotic, and terpenoid and allylbenzene compounds were used as adjuvants, for which we previously discovered the ability to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps. We show that: (a) the resulting structures were stable in vitro for a long time (up to 10 days); (b) they were adsorbed on bacterial cells, providing a local increase in the concentration of the antibiotic and adjuvant in pathogen cells; (c) they were internalized by bacterial cells, ensuring the accumulation of both antibiotic and adjuvant inside bacterial cells; (d) the adjuvant, after entering the bacterial cell, provided inhibition of the efflux pumps; (e) due to this action of the adjuvant, combined with the targeted delivery by the carrier, the antibiotic's half-life in rats increased by more than 2 times, the effective concentration of the drug in the blood plasma (AUC) increased up to 8-10 times; (f) a significant increase in the effectiveness of the antibacterial action against Gram+ and Gram- cells was achieved (up to 3 times). Potentially, such an approach would significantly increase the effectiveness of therapies for a number of infectious and other diseases, reduce the dosage of antibiotics, shorten the duration of treatment, and reduce the risk of developing bacterial resistance. Moreover, the use of a polymer carrier with covalently bound organic molecules of different structures will avoid problems linked to different (suboptimal) solubility and bio-distribution of the administered molecules, which would be almost inevitable when using the same compounds separately. It would be very difficult to find antibiotic/adjuvant pairs that simultaneously achieve optimal concentrations in the same target cells. In our case, terpenoids and alkylbenzenes used as adjuvants are practically insoluble as individual compounds, and their unacceptable pharmacological properties would not allow them to be used as efflux pump inhibitors.","['Zlotnikov ID', 'Davydova MP', 'Danilov MR', 'Krylov SS', 'Belogurova NG', 'Kudryashova EV']",2023,16,8,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Zlotnikov ID, et al.

37626356,Using the Health Belief Model to assess COVID-19 perceptions and behaviours among a group of Egyptian adults: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: It is crucial to study the public's perceptions and behaviour during a pandemic as this will be the driving force for practicing recommended precautions. The current study aimed to identify perceptions of a group of Egyptian adults to COVID-19 using the Health Belief Model (HBM), to measure self-reported practice of preventive behaviours and to identify influencing factors.
METHODS: Cross sectional study was used, including Egyptian adults aged 18 + years. A structured anonymous online questionnaire was used including: a demographic section, the modified MERS- CoV Health Belief Model scale after addition of questions related to COVID-19 and questions on preventive behaviours to COVID-19.
RESULTS: Of the 532 study participants, 28.6% were males, age ranges (18 to 74 years). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between total practice score and all COVID-19 Health Belief Model constructs total scores except for perceived barriers score showing negative correlation (P value < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that older age, male gender and living inside Cairo were associated with lower practice score (P value < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, cues to action and perceived self-efficacy scores were associated with higher practice score in the current study. Additionally, results revealed that social media and websites can play an important role in shaping risk perception in the community.

37622144,Considering the Benefits Cliff Embedded in the Relationship between Housing and Health.,"This Commentary introduces the reality of the benefits cliff into the housing and health relationship. Improving both housing and health requires addressing the benefits cliff facing extremely low- and low-income people. Those living below the poverty line are at greatest risk of poor, inadequate, and unhealthy living conditions. They are also the group most at risk for losing benefits and economic supports on their journey toward economic self-sufficiency. Addressing the housing crisis in Delaware demands that we recognize the benefits cliff looming on the horizon for extremely low- and low-income families struggling toward self-sufficiency.

Following intense tracking, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of COVID-19 and the continuous evolution of the virus has given rise to several variants. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of the response to the pandemic over the first three-year period is provided, focusing on disease management, development of vaccines and therapeutics, and identification of variants. The transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron are compared. The binding characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and reproduction numbers are evaluated. The effects of major variants on disease severity, hospitalisation, and case-fatality rates are outlined. In addition to the spike protein, open reading frames mutations are investigated. We also compare the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Overall, this study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the global response to the pandemic, as well as the importance of prevention and preparedness. Monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is critical in identifying and potentially predicting the health outcomes of concerning variants as they emerge. The ultimate goal would be a position in which existing vaccines and therapeutics could be adapted to suit new variants in as close to real-time as possible.","['Pitsillou E', 'Yu Y', 'Beh RC', 'Liang JJ', 'Hung A', 'Karagiannis TC']",2023,,,Clin Exp Med,"Pitsillou E, et al.

37608223,Discovery and multimerization of cross-reactive single-domain antibodies against SARS-like viruses to enhance potency and address emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"Coronaviruses have been the causative agent of three epidemics and pandemics in the past two decades, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A broadly-neutralizing coronavirus therapeutic is desirable not only to prevent and treat COVID-19, but also to provide protection for high-risk populations against future emergent coronaviruses. As all coronaviruses use spike proteins on the viral surface to enter the host cells, and these spike proteins share sequence and structural homology, we set out to discover cross-reactive biologic agents targeting the spike protein to block viral entry. Through llama immunization campaigns, we have identified single domain antibodies (VHHs) that are cross-reactive against multiple emergent coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS). Importantly, a number of these antibodies show sub-nanomolar potency towards all SARS-like viruses including emergent CoV-2 variants. We identified nine distinct epitopes on the spike protein targeted by these VHHs. Further, by engineering VHHs targeting distinct, conserved epitopes into multi-valent formats, we significantly enhanced their neutralization potencies compared to the corresponding VHH cocktails.

37607224,SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 is required for IFN antagonism and efficient virus replication in cell culture and in mice.,"Several coronavirus (CoV) encoded proteins are being evaluated as targets for antiviral therapies for COVID-19. Included in these drug targets is the conserved macrodomain, or Mac1, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase and ADP-ribose binding protein encoded as a small domain at the N terminus of nonstructural protein 3. Utilizing point mutant recombinant viruses, Mac1 was shown to be critical for both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV virulence. However, as a potential drug target, it is imperative to understand how a complete Mac1 deletion impacts the replication and pathogenesis of different CoVs. To this end, we created recombinant bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing complete Mac1 deletions (ΔMac1) in MHV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. While we were unable to recover infectious virus from MHV or MERS-CoV ΔMac1 BACs, SARS-CoV-2 ΔMac1 was readily recovered from BAC transfection, indicating a stark difference in the requirement for Mac1 between different CoVs. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 ΔMac1 replicated at or near wild-type levels in multiple cell lines susceptible to infection. However, in a mouse model of severe infection, ΔMac1 was quickly cleared causing minimal pathology without any morbidity. ΔMac1 SARS-CoV-2 induced increased levels of interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene expression in cell culture and mice, indicating that Mac1 blocks IFN responses which may contribute to its attenuation. ΔMac1 infection also led to a stark reduction in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. These results demonstrate that Mac1 only minimally impacts SARS-CoV-2 replication, unlike MHV and MERS-CoV, but is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and is a unique antiviral drug target.","['Alhammad YM', 'Parthasarathy S', 'Ghimire R', 'Kerr CM', ""O'Connor JJ"", 'Pfannenstiel JJ', 'Chanda D', 'Miller CA', 'Baumlin N', 'Salathe M', 'Unckless RL', 'Zuñiga S', 'Enjuanes L', 'More S', 'Channappanavar R', 'Fehr AR']",2023,120,35,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Alhammad YM, et al.

37603771,Minmers are a generalization of minimizers that enable unbiased local jaccard estimation.,"MOTIVATION: The Jaccard similarity on k-mer sets has shown to be a convenient proxy for sequence identity. By avoiding expensive base-level alignments and comparing reduced sequence representations, tools such as MashMap can scale to massive numbers of pairwise comparisons while still providing useful similarity estimates. However, due to their reliance on minimizer winnowing, previous versions of MashMap were shown to be biased and inconsistent estimators of Jaccard similarity. This directly impacts downstream tools that rely on the accuracy of these estimates.
RESULTS: To address this, we propose the minmer winnowing scheme, which generalizes the minimizer scheme by use of a rolling minhash with multiple sampled k-mers per window. We show both theoretically and empirically that minmers yield an unbiased estimator of local Jaccard similarity, and we implement this scheme in an updated version of MashMap. The minmer-based implementation is over 10 times faster than the minimizer-based version under the default ANI threshold, making it well-suited for large-scale comparative genomics applications.

37596724,k-mer-based GWAS enhances the discovery of causal variants and candidate genes in soybean.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful statistical methods that detect associations between genotype and phenotype at genome scale. Despite their power, GWAS frequently fail to pinpoint the causal variant or the gene controlling a given trait in crop species. Assessing genetic variants other than single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alleviate this problem. In this study, we tested the potential of structural variant (SV)- and k-mer-based GWAS in soybean by applying these methods as well as conventional SNP/indel-based GWAS to 13 traits. We assessed the performance of each GWAS approach based on loci for which the causal genes or variants were known from previous genetic studies. We found that k-mer-based GWAS was the most versatile approach and the best at pinpointing causal variants or candidate genes. Moreover, k-mer-based analyses identified promising candidate genes for loci related to pod color, pubescence form, and resistance to Phytophthora sojae. In our dataset, SV-based GWAS did not add value compared to k-mer-based GWAS and may not be worth the time and computational resources invested. Despite promising results, significant challenges remain regarding the downstream analysis of k-mer-based GWAS. Notably, better methods are needed to associate significant k-mers with sequence variation. Our results suggest that coupling k-mer- and SNP/indel-based GWAS is a powerful approach for discovering candidate genes in crop species.","['Lemay MA', 'de Ronne M', 'Bélanger R', 'Belzile F']",2023,,,Plant Genome,"Lemay MA, et al. k-mer-based GWAS enhances the discovery of causal variants and candidate genes in soybean. k-mer-based GWAS enhances the discovery of causal variants and candidate genes in soybean. 2023; (unknown volume):e20374. doi: 10.1002/tpg2.20374",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596724/

These marine organisms are the most abundant primary consumers contributing significantly in the marine food web. Any effect on the abundance and diversity of copepods due to climate change is likely to have serious implications on the marine ecosystem functioning. Molecular studies that play a vital role in assessing the genetic changes under the influence of environmental imbalances are completely lacking for this species. Here we report the genetic variations in three generations of copepods through transcriptome sequencing. RNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq platform employing the 2 × 100 bp paired-end chemistry. Approximately, 10GB of data was obtained for all the samples. The raw sequences were assembled through Trinity 2.6.6 and mined for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). MIcroSAtellite Identification Tool (MISA) was used for SSR detection and Primer 3 (v 3.0) was utilized to design short oligonucleotide primers (18-20 mers). A total of 15,222 SSRs were identified and 28,944 primer pairs were designed against these motifs. The transcriptome possessed 413,890 SNPs at a frequency of 2.8 per kb.

37592287,Sequence dependencies and mutation rates of localized mutational processes in cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer mutations accumulate through replication errors and DNA damage coupled with incomplete repair. Individual mutational processes often show nucleotide sequence and functional region preferences. As a result, some sequence contexts mutate at much higher rates than others, with additional variation found between functional regions. Mutational hotspots, with recurrent mutations across cancer samples, represent genomic positions with elevated mutation rates, often caused by highly localized mutational processes.
METHODS: We count the 11-mer genomic sequences across the genome, and using the PCAWG set of 2583 pan-cancer whole genomes, we associate 11-mers with mutational signatures, hotspots of single nucleotide variants, and specific genomic regions. We evaluate the mutation rates of individual and combined sets of 11-mers and derive mutational sequence motifs.
RESULTS: We show that hotspots generally identify highly mutable sequence contexts. Using these, we show that some mutational signatures are enriched in hotspot sequence contexts, corresponding to well-defined sequence preferences for the underlying localized mutational processes. This includes signature 17b (of unknown etiology) and signatures 62 (POLE deficiency), 7a (UV), and 72 (linked to lymphomas). In some cases, the mutation rate and sequence preference increase further when focusing on certain genomic regions, such as signature 62 in transcribed regions, where the mutation rate is increased up to 9-folds over cancer type and mutational signature average.
CONCLUSIONS: We summarize our findings in a catalog of localized mutational processes, their sequence preferences, and their estimated mutation rates.","['Poulsgaard GA', 'Sørensen SG', 'Juul RI', 'Nielsen MM', 'Pedersen JS']",2023,15,1,Genome Med,"Poulsgaard GA, et al.

37587527,High-resolution strain-level microbiome composition analysis from short reads.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial strains under the same species can exhibit different biological properties, making strain-level composition analysis an important step in understanding the dynamics of microbial communities. Metagenomic sequencing has become the major means for probing the microbial composition in host-associated or environmental samples. Although there are a plethora of composition analysis tools, they are not optimized to address the challenges in strain-level analysis: highly similar strain genomes and the presence of multiple strains under one species in a sample. Thus, this work aims to provide a high-resolution and more accurate strain-level analysis tool for short reads.
RESULTS: In this work, we present a new strain-level composition analysis tool named StrainScan that employs a novel tree-based k-mers indexing structure to strike a balance between the strain identification accuracy and the computational complexity. We tested StrainScan extensively on a large number of simulated and real sequencing data and benchmarked StrainScan with popular strain-level analysis tools including Krakenuniq, StrainSeeker, Pathoscope2, Sigma, StrainGE, and StrainEst. The results show that StrainScan has higher accuracy and resolution than the state-of-the-art tools on strain-level composition analysis. It improves the F1 score by 20% in identifying multiple strains at the strain level.
CONCLUSIONS: By using a novel k-mer indexing structure, StrainScan is able to provide strain-level analysis with higher resolution than existing tools, enabling it to return more informative strain composition analysis in one sample or across multiple samples.

The aim of this study was to describe the viral aetiology of patients admitted to hospitals in the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah during the 2022 peri-Hajj period.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to hospitals with SARI. Patients were tested with multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the most common viral aetiologies.
RESULTS: In total, 179 cases of SARI were identified during the study period. Of these, 101 (56.4%) were males, 78 (43.6%) were females, and 78 (43.6%) were Saudi. The mean age was 58.60 years (standard deviation 20.5) years. The most common age group was ≥65 years (

37581590,Deep brain stimulation in a pediatric dystonia patient with cochlear implants and mitochondrial disorder: novel application of a frameless stereotactic system and navigating the anesthesia choice and neurosurgical complexities. Illustrative case.,"BACKGROUND: This report presents a case of medically refractory dystonia in a pediatric patient successfully treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) while under general anesthesia by using microelectrode recordings (MERs) with intraoperative computed tomography (CT).
OBSERVATIONS: The patient was an 18-year-old female with primary dystonia secondary to mitochondrial Leigh syndrome. Her past medical history was significant for complex partial epilepsy and hearing loss treated with cochlear implants. Her cochlear implants precluded anatomical targeting via magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, the patient could not tolerate awake surgery with MER. The decision was made to proceed with bilateral STN DBS with intraoperative CT with the patient under general anesthesia. The patient's cochlear implants made standard frame placement difficult, so navigation was performed with the Nexframe system. Recordings were obtained with the patient under general anesthesia with ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and remifentanil. At the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, the patient demonstrated marked improvement in dystonia without neurological complications.
LESSONS: This is the first case of dystonia secondary to Leigh syndrome treated with DBS. Additionally, the authors describe the novel use of the Nexframe for DBS lead placement in a pediatric patient. This demonstrates that STN DBS with the use of MER and intraoperative CT can be a safe and effective method of treating dystonia in certain pediatric patients.","['Grossen A', 'Shi HH', 'Schenk M', 'Stocco A', 'Ramsey J', 'Sahgal S', 'Conner AK', 'Desai VR']",2023,6,6,J Neurosurg Case Lessons,"Grossen A, et al.

Although the disease is difficult to diagnose by conventional MRI in the early disease phase, arterial spin labeling (ASL), a noninvasive MRI perfusion technique using magnetically-labeled arterial blood water protons, is considered promising.
CASE REPORT: We experienced three cases of MERS with cerebellitis. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed a high-intensity lesion at the splenium of the corpus callosum. ASL showed increased blood flow in the cerebellum in all three cases, despite cerebellar symptoms being inapparent or difficult to notice in the early phase of disease in all cases. Patients received methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin from the early phase of the disease and recovered without neurological sequelae.
DISCUSSION: ASL magnetic response imaging simultaneously showed an area of hyperperfusion in the cerebellum. At the same time, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the splenial lesion was decreased in all three cases. The successful diagnosis of cerebellitis in the acute phase led to early therapeutic intervention, which may be important for this condition.

In this work, we studied the fundamental properties related to the optical identification of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a key component of viral infection. The Raman modes of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were captured by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The observed Raman enhancement strongly depends on the excitation wavelength as a result of the aggregation of AuNPs. The characteristic Raman spectra of RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were analyzed by principal component analysis that reveals the role of secondary structures in the SERS process, which is corroborated with the thermal stability under laser heating.

This could be attributed to unique viral traits, allowing its rapid global dissemination following its emergence in October 2019 in Wuhan, China, which appears to be primarily driven by the emergence of highly transmissible and virulent variants that also associate, in some cases, with severe disease and considerable mortality caused by fatal pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in infected individuals. Mechanistically, several factors are involved in viral pathogenesis, and epigenetic alterations take the front seat in host-virus interactions. The molecular basis of all viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, tightly hinges on the transitory silencing of the host gene machinery via epigenetic modulation. SARS-CoV-2 also hijacks and subdues the host gene machinery, leading to epigenetic modulation of the critical host elements responsible for antiviral immunity. Epigenomics is a powerful, unexplored avenue that can provide a profound understanding of virus-host interactions and lead to the development of epigenome-based therapies and vaccines to counter viruses. This review discusses current developments in SARS-CoV-2 variation and its role in epigenetic modulation in infected hosts. This review provides an overview, especially in the context of emerging viral strains, their recombinants, and their possible roles in the epigenetic exploitation of host defense and viral pathogenesis.

EXPERIMENTS: In this study, we controlled the length (23, 45, 68 mers) and density (5, 10, 15 mol%) of PSar on liposomal coatings and, furthermore, investigated the effects of PSar length and density on the blood circulation time, biodistribution, immune response, and ABC phenomenon induction. Length-controlled PSar-bound lipids (PSar-PEs) were synthesized using a click reaction and inserted into bare liposomes at different combinations of chain lengths and proportions.
FINDINGS: Although all PSar-coated liposomes (PSar-lipos) had similar morphological, physical, and chemical properties, they had different blood circulation times and biodistribution, and exerted varied effects on the immune system. All PSar-lipos with different PSar length and density showed a similar anti-PSar IgM response. Liposomes modified with the longest PSar chain (68 mers) at a high density (15 mol%) showed the longest blood circulation time and, additionally, attenuated ABC phenomenon compared with PEG-lipo. The ex vivo analysis of the biodistribution of liposomes revealed that a thick PSar layer enhanced the blood circulation time of liposomes due to the reduction of the accumulation of liposomes in the liver and spleen. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between IgM expression and ABC phenomenon inhibition.","['Hu M', 'Taguchi K', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kobatake E', 'Ito Y', 'Ueda M']",2023,651,,J Colloid Interface Sci,"Hu M, et al.

37534910,An engineered recombinant protein containing three structural domains in SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein has potential to act as a pan-human coronavirus entry inhibitor or vaccine antigen.,"The threat to global health caused by three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV), SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, calls for the development of pan-HCoV therapeutics and vaccines. This study reports the design and engineering of a recombinant protein designated HR1LS. It contains three linked molecules, each consisting of three structural domains, including a heptad repeat 1 (HR1), a central helix (CH), and a stem helix (SH) region, in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. It was found that HR1LS protein automatically formed a trimer able to bind with heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region in the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit, thus potently inhibiting HCoV fusion and entry into host cells. Furthermore, immunization of mice with HR1LS, when combined with CF501 adjuvant, resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and MjHKU4r-CoV-1. These results suggest that HR1LS is a promising candidate for further development as a novel HR1-trimer-based pan-HCoV entry inhibitor or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also other HCoVs with the potential to cause future emerging and re-emerging infectious coronavirus diseases.","['Wang X', 'Sun L', 'Liu Z', 'Xing L', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu W', 'Xia S', 'Lu L', 'Jiang S']",2023,12,2,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Wang X, et al.

37523233,How heterogeneity in density dependence affects disease spread: when lifestyle matters.,"People's lifestyles play a major role in disease risk. Some employment sectors and transport modes involve fixed exposures regardless of community size, while in other settings exposure tracks with population density. MERS-CoV, a coronavirus discovered in Saudi Arabia in 2012 closely related to those causing SARS and COVID-19, appears to need extended contact time for transmission, making some segments of a community at greater risk than others. We model mathematically how heterogeneity in contact rate structure impacts disease spread, using as a case study a MERS outbreak in two Saudi Arabian communities. We divide the at-risk population into segments with exposure rates either independent of population density or density-dependent. Analysis shows disease spread is minimized for intermediate size populations with a limited proportion of individuals in the density-independent group. In the case study, the high proportion of density-independent exposure may explain the historical outbreak's extinction in the larger city.","['Kribs CM', 'Alharbi MH']",2023,17,1,J Biol Dyn,Kribs CM and Alharbi MH.

We aimed to investigate whether microstate k-mers could be used as neurophysiological biomarkers to differentiate between depressed patients and normal controls. We utilized a bag-of-words model to process microstate sequences, using k-mers with a k range of 1-10 as terms, and the term frequency (TF) with or without inverse-document-frequency (IDF) as features. We performed nested cross-validation on Dataset 1 (27 patients and 26 controls) and Dataset 2 (34 patients and 30 controls) separately and then trained on one dataset and tested on the other. The best area under the curve (AUC) of 81.5% was achieved for the model with L1 regularization using the TF of 4-mers as features in Dataset 1, and the best AUC of 88.9% was achieved for the model with L1 regularization using the TF of 9-mers as features in Dataset 2. When Dataset 1 was used as the training set, the best AUC of predicting Dataset 2 was 74.1% for the model with L2 regularization using the TF-IDF of 9-mers as features, while the best AUC of predicting Dataset 1 was 70.2% for the model with L1 regularization using the TF of 8-mers as features.

37515131,SARS-CoV-2 Inactivation in Aerosol by Means of Radiated Microwaves.,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause infections on the respiratory tract that can be fatal. These viruses can cause both mild illnesses such as the common cold and lethal illnesses such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Air transmission represents the principal mode by which people become infected by SARS-CoV-2. To reduce the risks of air transmission of this powerful pathogen, we devised a method of inactivation based on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the area to be sanitized. We optimized the conditions in a controlled laboratory environment mimicking a natural airborne virus transmission and consistently achieved a 90% (tenfold) reduction of infectivity after a short treatment using a Radio Frequency (RF) wave emission with a power level that is safe for people according to most regulatory agencies, including those in Europe, USA, and Japan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be inactivated through RF wave emission under conditions compatible with the presence of human beings and animals. Additional in-depth studies are warranted to extend the results to other viruses and to explore the potential implementation of this technology in different environmental conditions.","['Manna A', 'De Forni D', 'Bartocci M', 'Pasculli N', 'Poddesu B', 'Lista F', 'De Santis R', 'Amatore D', 'Grilli G', 'Molinari F', 'Sangiovanni Vincentelli A', 'Lori F']",2023,15,7,Viruses,"Manna A, et al.

37515117,Acetate-encapsulated Linolenic Acid Liposomes Reduce SARS-CoV-2 and RSV Infection.,"Emergent Coronaviridae viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 in 2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) in 2019, have caused millions of deaths. These viruses have added to the existing respiratory infection burden along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. There are limited therapies for respiratory viruses, with broad-spectrum treatment remaining an unmet need. Since gut fermentation of fiber produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral potential, developing a fatty acid-based broad-spectrum antiviral was investigated. Molecular docking of fatty acids showed α-linolenic acid (ALA) is likely to interact with CoV-2-S, NL63-CoV-S, and RSV-F, and an ALA-containing liposome interacted with CoV-2 directly, degrading the particle. Furthermore, a combination of ALA and a SCFA-acetate synergistically inhibited CoV2-N expression and significantly reduced viral plaque formation and IL-6 and IL-1β transcript expression in Calu-3 cells, while increasing the expression of IFN-β. A similar effect was also observed in RSV-infected A549 cells. Moreover, mice infected with a murine-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) and treated with an ALA-liposome encapsulating acetate showed significant reductions in plaque-forming units present in lung tissue and in infection-associated lung inflammation and cytokines. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ALA liposome-encapsulating acetate can be a promising broad antiviral therapy against respiratory infections.","['McGill AR', 'Markoutsa E', 'Mayilsamy K', 'Green R', 'Sivakumar K', 'Mohapatra S', 'Mohapatra SS']",2023,15,7,Viruses,"McGill AR, et al.

37515055,A Review: Understanding Molecular Mechanisms of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement in Viral Infections.,"Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of an infection has been of interest in the investigation of many viruses. It is associated with the severity of the infection. ADE is mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations, or cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies. Treatments like plasma therapy, B cell immunizations, and antibody therapies may trigger ADE. It is seen as an impediment to vaccine development as well. In viruses including the Dengue virus (DENV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, Zika virus, and influenza virus, the likely mechanisms of ADE are postulated and described. ADE improves the likelihood of productively infecting cells that are expressing the complement receptor or the Fc receptor (FcR) rather than the viral receptors. ADE occurs when the FcR, particularly the Fc gamma receptor, and/or complement system, particularly Complement 1q (C1q), allow the entry of the virus-antibody complex into the cell. Moreover, ADE alters the innate immune pathways to escape from lysis, promoting viral replication inside the cell that produces viral particles. This review discusses the involvement of FcR and the downstream immunomodulatory pathways in ADE, the complement system, and innate antiviral signaling pathways modification in ADE and its impact on facilitating viral replication. Additionally, we have outlined the modes of ADE in the cases of different viruses reported until now.","['Sawant J', 'Patil A', 'Kurle S']",2023,11,7,Vaccines (Basel),"Sawant J, et al.

A selection of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)-urethane methacrylate and acrylate resins, free-radical photo-initiator Omnirad 2100, and two distinct silane-based crosslinking agents were blended under a weight ratio of 75:20:5 (without crosslinker) and 70:15:5:10, respectively. The coatings were cured under a UV LED 4 × 3 matrix light emitting source, in a chamber under a controlled atmosphere, by means of an in-house developed conveyor belt type platform, at different conveyor belt speeds (5, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mm/s). The morphologies of fabricated coatings were characterized by FTIR revealing high conversion rates (e.g., from 98 to 100%) for increased exposure time as a result of the 5 or 50 mm/s values, on all combinations. Dynamic-mechanical and optical properties of UV LED-cured transparent coatings were also investigated. A negative shift of the glass transition temperature values with a decrease in exposure time, in all combinations, from about 60 °C to 30 °C, along with storage moduli lowering in the glassy plateau further favors higher exposure times for curing.

37506519,A triple-aptamer tetrahedral DNA nanostructures based carbon-nanotube-array transistor biosensor for rapid virus detection.,"Outbreaks of infectious viruses cause enormous challenges to global public health. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has severely threatened human health and resulted in the global pandemic. A strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 with both fast sensing speed and high accuracy is urgently required. Here, rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen using carbon-nanotube-array-based thin-film transistor (CNT-array-based TFT) biosensors merged with tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) and triple aptamers is demonstrated for the first time. Compared with CNT-network-based TFT biosensors and metal-electrode-based CNT-TFT biosensors, the response of CNT-array-based TFT biosensors can be enhanced up to 102% for SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) detection, which is supported by its sensing mechanism. By combining TDNs with triple aptamers, the biosensor has realized the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 RBD detection in a broad detection range spanning eight orders of magnitude with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10 aM (6 copies/μL) owing to the improved protein capture efficiency. Moreover, the triple-aptamer biosensor platform has achieved the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron RBD in a low LOD of 6 aM (3.6 copies/μL). Additionally, the CNT-array-based TFT biosensors have exhibited excellent specificity, enabling identification among SARS-CoV-2 antigen, SARS-CoV antigen and MERS-CoV antigen. The platform of CNT-array-based TFT biosensors combined with TDNs and triple aptamers provides a high-performance and rapid approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and its versatility by altering specific aptamers enables the possibility for rapid virus detection.","['Ma S', 'Ren Q', 'Jiang L', 'Liu Z', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang M']",2023,266,Pt 1,Talanta,"Ma S, et al.

Lessons from a Qualitative Study for the MERS Outbreak in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreak in Korea led to profound emotional and social burdens, especially in patients and health care professionals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted with 2 patients, 1 family member and 6 health care professionals about psychological distress related to MERS in 2017 and analyzed the interview data using the consensual qualitative research method.
RESULTS: Four domains and 17 core ideas were identified within three interview groups, including psychological distress during the outbreak, problems regarding the response to the outbreak, positive experiences, and future directions for enhancing intervention to improve mental health and prevent psychosocial problems during the outbreak. Psychological consequences were affected by the characteristics of the emerging infectious disease and the structure and process of institutional or governmental response to the MERS outbreak. Mental health services and psychosocial support reduced the negative impact on psychological distress.
CONCLUSION: The MERS outbreak in 2015 gave rise to emotional and social injuries to patients and health care professionals, some of which can be long-lasting constraints in their lives. Preparedness in a society's response to a pandemic considering mental health in related parties can minimize negative psychological consequences and enhance resilience at the individual and society levels.","['Park HY', 'Lee H', 'Lee JY', 'Song KH', 'Kim Y', 'Lee SH']",2023,,,Infect Chemother,"Park HY, et al.

37498934,Immunopeptidome profiling of human coronavirus OC43-infected cells identifies CD4 T-cell epitopes specific to seasonal coronaviruses or cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2.,"Seasonal ""common-cold"" human coronaviruses are widely spread throughout the world and are mainly associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections. The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 has prompted increased attention to coronavirus biology and immunopathology, but the T-cell response to seasonal coronaviruses remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report the repertoire of viral peptides that are naturally processed and presented upon infection of a model cell line with seasonal coronavirus OC43. We identified MHC-bound peptides derived from each of the viral structural proteins (spike, nucleoprotein, hemagglutinin-esterase, membrane, and envelope) as well as non-structural proteins nsp3, nsp5, nsp6, and nsp12. Eighty MHC-II bound peptides corresponding to 14 distinct OC43-derived epitopes were identified, including many at very high abundance within the overall MHC-II peptidome. Fewer and less abundant MHC-I bound OC43-derived peptides were observed, possibly due to MHC-I downregulation induced by OC43 infection. The MHC-II peptides elicited low-abundance recall T-cell responses in most donors tested. In vitro assays confirmed that the peptides were recognized by CD4+ T cells and identified the presenting HLA alleles. T-cell responses cross-reactive between OC43, SARS-CoV-2, and the other seasonal coronaviruses were confirmed in samples of peripheral blood and peptide-expanded T-cell lines. Among the validated epitopes, spike protein S903-917 presented by DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 and S1085-1099 presented by DRB1*15:01 shared substantial homology to other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and were targeted by cross-reactive CD4 T cells. Nucleoprotein N54-68 and hemagglutinin-esterase HE128-142 presented by DRB1*15:01 and HE259-273 presented by DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 are immunodominant epitopes with low coronavirus homology that are not cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the set of naturally processed and presented OC43 epitopes comprise both OC43-specific and human coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes, which can be used to follow CD4 T-cell cross-reactivity after infection or vaccination, and to guide selection of epitopes for inclusion in pan-coronavirus vaccines.","['Becerra-Artiles A', 'Nanaware PP', 'Muneeruddin K', 'Weaver GC', 'Shaffer SA', 'Calvo-Calle JM', 'Stern LJ']",2023,19,7,PLoS Pathog,"Becerra-Artiles A, et al.

A new strain emerged known as novel coronavirus (nCoV) causing fatal respiratory failure disease. This virus was characterized by rapid spread from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients to healthy people. Thus, vaccine should be considered as one of the important protective measures to control the spread of this virus.

37469978,Expression and function of estrogen receptors and estrogen-related receptors in the brain and their association with Alzheimer's disease.,"While estrogens are well known for their pivotal role in the female reproductive system, they also play a crucial function in regulating physiological processes associated with learning and memory in the brain. Moreover, they have neuroprotective effects in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, AD has a higher incidence in older and postmenopausal women than in men, and estrogen treatment might reduce the risk of AD in these women. In general, estrogens bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs)-mediated transcriptional machineries, and also stimulate signal transduction through membrane ERs (mERs). Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), which share homologous sequences with ERs but lack estrogen-binding capabilities, are widely and highly expressed in the human brain and have also been implicated in AD pathogenesis. In this review, we primarily provide a summary of ER and ERR expression patterns in the human brain. In addition, we summarize recent studies on their role in learning and memory. We then review and discuss research that has elucidated the functions and importance of ERs and ERRs in AD pathogenesis, including their role in Aβ clearance and the reduction of phosphorylated tau levels. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying ER- and ERR-mediated transcriptional machineries and their functions in healthy and diseased brains would provide new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Furthermore, exploring the potential role of estrogens and their receptors, ERs, in AD will facilitate a better understanding of the sex differences observed in AD, and lead to novel sex-specific therapeutic approaches.","['Sato K', 'Takayama KI', 'Inoue S']",2023,14,,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),"Sato K, et al.

37464673,Inverse percolation by removing straight semirigid rods from bilayer square lattices.,"Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out to study the problem of inverse percolation by removing semirigid rods from a L×L square lattice that contains two layers (and M=L×L×2 sites). The process starts with an initial configuration where all lattice sites are occupied by single monomers (each monomer occupies one lattice site) and, consequently, the opposite sides of the lattice are connected by nearest-neighbor occupied sites. Then the system is diluted by removing groups of k consecutive monomers according to a generalized random sequential adsorption mechanism. The study is conducted by following the behavior of two critical concentrations with size k: (1) jamming coverage θ_{j,k}, which represents the concentration of occupied sites at which the jamming state is reached, and (2) inverse percolation threshold θ_{c,k}, which corresponds to the maximum concentration of occupied sites for which connectivity disappears. The obtained results indicate that (1) the jamming coverage exhibits an increasing dependence on the size k-it rapidly increases for small values of k and asymptotically converges towards a definite value for infinitely large k sizes θ_{j,k→∞}≈0.2701-and (2) the inverse percolation threshold is a decreasing function of k in the range 1≤k≤17. For k≥18, all jammed configurations are percolating states (the lattice remains connected even when the highest allowed concentration of removed sites is reached) and, consequently, there is no nonpercolating phase. This finding contrasts with the results obtained in literature for a complementary problem, where straight rigid k-mers are randomly and irreversibly deposited on a square lattice forming two layers. In this case, percolating and nonpercolating phases extend to infinity in the space of the parameter k and the model presents percolation transition for the whole range of k. The results obtained in the present study were also compared with those reported for the case of inverse percolation by removal of rigid linear k-mers from a square monolayer. The differences observed between monolayer and bilayer problems were discussed in terms of vulnerability and network robustness. Finally, the accurate determination of the critical exponents ν, β, and γ reveals that the percolation phase transition involved in the system has the same universality class as the standard percolation problem.","['Pimentel FML', 'Félix NC', 'Ramirez LS', 'Ramirez-Pastor AJ']",2023,107,6-1,Phys Rev E,"Pimentel FML, et al.

37464669,Entropy-driven phases at high coverage adsorption of straight rigid rods on three-dimensional cubic lattices.,"Combining Monte Carlo simulations and thermodynamic integration method, we study the configurational entropy per site of straight rigid rods of length k (k-mers) adsorbed on three-dimensional (3D) simple cubic lattices. The process is monitored by following the dependence of the lattice coverage θ on the chemical potential μ (adsorption isotherm). Then, we perform the integration of μ(θ) over θ to calculate the configurational entropy per site of the adsorbed phase s(k,θ) as a function of the coverage. Based on the behavior of the function s(k,θ), different phase diagrams are obtained according to the k values: k≤4, disordered phase; k=5,6, disordered and layered-disordered phases; and k≥7, disordered, nematic and layered-disordered phases. In the limit of θ→1 (full coverage), the configurational entropy per site is determined for values of k ranging between 2 and 8. For k≥6, MC data coincide (within the statistical uncertainty) with recent analytical predictions [D. Dhar and R. Rajesh, Phys. Rev. E 103, 042130 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.103.042130] for very large rods. This finding represents the first numerical validation of the expression obtained by Dhar and Rajesh for d-dimensional lattices with d>2. In addition, for k≥5, the values of s(k,θ→1) for simple cubic lattices are coincident with those values reported in [P. M. Pasinetti et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 054136 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.104.054136] for two-dimensional (2D) square lattices. This is consistent with the picture that at high densities and k≥5, the layered-disordered phase is formed on the lattice. Under these conditions, the system breaks to 2D layers, and the adsorbed phase becomes essentially 2D. The 2D behavior of the fully covered lattice reinforces the conjecture that the large-k behavior of entropy per site is superuniversal, and holds on d-dimensional hypercubical lattices for all d≥2.","['Pasinetti PM', 'Ramirez-Pastor AJ', 'Vogel EE']",2023,107,6-1,Phys Rev E,"Pasinetti PM, et al.

37462319,Population Genomic Evidence for a Repeated Introduction and Rapid Expansion of the Fungal Maize Pathogen Setosphaeria turcica in Europe.,"Modern agricultural practices, climate change, and globalization foster the rapid spread of plant pathogens, such as the maize fungal pathogen Setosphaeria turcica, which causes Northern corn leaf blight and expanded into Central Europe during the twentieth century. To investigate the rapid expansion of S. turcica, we sequenced 121 isolates from Europe and Kenya. Population genomic inference revealed a single genetically diverse cluster in Kenya and three clonal lineages with low diversity, as well as one cluster of multiple clonal sublineages in Europe. Phylogenetic dating suggests that all European lineages originated through sexual reproduction outside Europe and were subsequently introgressed multiple times. Unlike isolates from Kenya, European isolates did not show sexual recombination, despite the presence of both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 mating types. For the clonal lineages, coalescent model selection supported a selectively neutral model with strong exponential population growth, rather than models with pervasive positive selection caused by host defense resistance or environmental adaptation. Within clonal lineages, phenotypic variation in virulence to different monogenic resistances, which defines the pathogen races, suggests that these races may originate from repeated mutations in virulence genes. Association testing based on k-mers did not identify genomic regions linked to pathogen races, but it did uncover strongly differentiated genomic regions between clonal lineages, which harbor genes with putative roles in pathogenicity. In conclusion, the expansion and population growth of S. turcica in Europe are mainly driven by an expansion of the maize cultivation area and not by rapid adaptation.","['Vidal-Villarejo M', 'Freund F', 'Hanekamp H', 'von Tiedemann A', 'Schmid K']",2023,15,8,Genome Biol Evol,"Vidal-Villarejo M, et al.

We aimed to summarise the assessment, levels and determinants of pandemic-related health literacy and its associated clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed in Medline
RESULTS: Of the 2,065 articles screened, 70 articles were included. Of these, 21, 17 and 32 studies evaluated health literacy related to COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. The rates of low pandemic health literacy ranged from 4.3% to 57.9% among medical-related populations and from 4.0% to 82.5% among nonmedical populations. Knowledge about the symptoms and transmission of infection, worry about infection, and practices related to mask usage and hand hygiene were most frequently evaluated. Sociodemographic determinants of health literacy were most frequently studied, among which higher education level, older age and female gender were found to be associated with better health literacy. No studies evaluated the outcomes associated with health literacy.

37442953,Integrative modeling of lncRNA-chromatin interaction maps reveals diverse mechanisms of nuclear retention.,"BACKGROUND: Many long non-coding RNAs, known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, are enriched in the nucleus and interact with chromatin. However, their mechanisms of chromatin interaction and the served cellular functions are poorly understood. We sought to characterize the mechanisms of lncRNA nuclear retention by systematically mapping the sequence and chromatin features that distinguish lncRNA-interacting genomic segments.
RESULTS: We found DNA 5-mer frequencies to be predictive of chromatin interactions for all lncRNAs, suggesting sequence-specificity as a global theme in the interactome. Sequence features representing protein-DNA and protein-RNA binding motifs revealed potential mechanisms for specific lncRNAs. Complementary to these global themes, transcription-related features and DNA-RNA triplex formation potential were noted to be highly predictive for two mutually exclusive sets of lncRNAs. DNA methylation was also noted to be a significant predictor, but only when combined with other epigenomic features.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our statistical findings suggest that a group of lncRNAs interacts with transcriptionally inactive chromatin through triplex formation, whereas another group interacts with transcriptionally active regions and is involved in DNA Damage Response (DDR) through formation of R-loops. Curiously, we observed a strong pattern of enrichment of 5-mers in four potentially interacting entities: lncRNA-bound DNA tiles, lncRNAs, miRNA seed sequences, and repeat elements. This finding points to a broad sequence-based network of interactions that may underlie regulation of fundamental cellular functions. Overall, this study reveals diverse sequence and chromatin features related to lncRNA-chromatin interactions, suggesting potential mechanisms of nuclear retention and regulatory function.","['Tabe-Bordbar S', 'Sinha S']",2023,24,1,BMC Genomics,Tabe-Bordbar S and Sinha S.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of vaccine clinical trials during active epidemic periods.
METHODS: We searched for Phase II and Phase III vaccine clinical trials initiated during the H1N1 influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika, and Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks from 2009 to 2019. Data were extracted from clinical trial protocols identified in the following registries: ClinicalTrials.gov, Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR), and all primary registries indicated by the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Published studies from registered clinical trials were located through PubMed. Data was extracted on eligibility criteria and pregnancy outcomes. Data from this study is available in the Center for Open Science Data Repository: https://osf.io/nfk2p/?view_only=47deb3b206724af9b46c9c0c0083a267.
RESULTS: We identified 96 vaccine clinical trial protocols and included 84 in analysis. 5 records were excluded in screening for irrelevant abstracts, 7 were excluded in full-text assessment (1 for a therapeutic drug trial, 3 for enrolling elderly adults only, 3 for enrolling children/adolescents only). There were no eligible trials for MERS-CoV or Zika virus vaccines. Overall, 8 protocols explicitly included pregnant people; of these, 3 were completed trials with published results. Incidental pregnancies and outcomes of pregnant participants were reported in 2 studies, 10 studies reported serious adverse events related to pregnancy without mentioning total incidental pregnancies. A total of 411 recorded pregnancy outcomes were reported, with 293 from the 3 pregnancy-eligible studies with results. 71 serious adverse events pertaining to pregnancy were reported from all clinical trials with results.

37442126,Computationally Designed Small Molecules Disassemble Both Soluble Oligomers and Protofibrils of Amyloid β-Protein Responsible for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the world's most pressing health crises. AD is an incurable disease affecting more than 6.5 million Americans, predominantly the elderly, and in its later stages, leads to memory loss, dementia, and death. Amyloid β (Aβ) protein aggregates have been one of the pathological hallmarks of AD since its initial characterization. The early stages of Aβ accumulation and aggregation involve the formation of oligomers, which are considered neurotoxic and play a key role in further aggregation into fibrils that eventually appear in the brain as amyloid plaques. We have recently shown by combining ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) that Aβ42 rapidly forms dodecamers (12-mers) as the terminal oligomeric state, and these dodecamers seed the early formation of Aβ42 protofibrils. The link between soluble oligomers and fibril formation is one of the essential aspects for understanding the root cause of the disease state and is critical to developing therapeutic interventions. Utilizing a joint pharmacophore space (JPS) method, potential drugs have been designed specifically for amyloid-related diseases. These small molecules were generated based on crucial chemical features necessary for target selectivity. In this paper, we utilize our combined IM-MS and AFM methods to investigate the impact of three second-generation JPS small-molecule inhibitors, AC0201, AC0202, and AC0203, on dodecamer as well as fibril formation in Aβ42. Our results indicate that AC0201 works well as an inhibitor and remodeler of both dodecamers and fibril formation, AC0203 behaves less efficiently, and AC0202 is ineffective.","['Jin Y', 'Downey MA', 'Singh A', 'Buratto SK', 'Bowers MT']",2023,14,15,ACS Chem Neurosci,"Jin Y, et al.

37439567,SARS-CoV-2 main protease cleaves MAGED2 to antagonize host antiviral defense.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent causing the global pandemic of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes a main protease (nsp5, also called Mpro) and a papain-like protease (nsp3, also called PLpro), which are responsible for processing viral polyproteins to assemble a functional replicase complex. In this study, we found that Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 can cleave human MAGED2 and other mammalian orthologs at Gln-263. Moreover, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mpro can also cleave human MAGED2, suggesting MAGED2 cleavage by Mpro is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of coronavirus infection in mammals. Intriguingly, Mpro from Beta variant cleaves MAGED2 more efficiently than wild type, but Omicron Mpro is opposite. Further studies show that MAGED2 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection at viral replication step. Mechanistically, MAGED2 is associated with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein through its N-terminal region in an RNA-dependent manner, and this disrupts the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and viral genome, thus inhibiting viral replication. When MAGED2 is cleaved by Mpro, the N-terminal of MAGED2 will translocate into the nucleus, and the truncated MAGED2 is unable to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication. This work not only discovers the antiviral function of MAGED2 but also provides new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 Mpro antagonizes host antiviral response. IMPORTANCE Host factors that restrict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain elusive. Here, we found that MAGED2 can be cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) at Gln-263. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mpro can also cleave MAGED2, and MAGED2 from multiple species can be cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Mpro from Beta variant cleaves MAGED2 more efficiently efficiently than wild type, but Omicron is the opposite. MAGED2 depletion enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting its inhibitory role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanistically, MAGED2 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication by disrupting the interaction between nucleocapsid and viral genomes. When MAGED2 is cleaved, its N-terminal will translocate into the nucleus. In this way, Mpro relieves MAGED2' inhibition on viral replication. This study improves our understanding of complex viral-host interaction and provides novel targets to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Ju X', 'Wang Z', 'Wang P', 'Ren W', 'Yu Y', 'Yu Y', 'Yuan B', 'Song J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu C', 'Tian B', 'Shi Y', 'Zhang R', 'Ding Q']",2023,14,4,mBio,"Ju X, et al.

Despite multiple vaccines, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza have caused a remarkable level of pathogenesis. The development of effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza remains a high priority. Inhibiting viral cell surface attachment represents an early and efficient means to block virus infection.

However, the role of specific UPR pathways in infection remains unclear. Here, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes marginal activation of signaling sensor IRE1α leading to its phosphorylation, clustering in the form of dense ER-membrane rearrangements with embedded membrane openings, and XBP1 splicing. By investigating the factors regulated by IRE1α-XBP1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified stress-activated kinase NUAK2 as a novel host-dependency factor for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and MERS-CoV entry. Reducing NUAK2 abundance or kinase activity impaired SARS-CoV-2 particle binding and internalization by decreasing cell surface levels of viral receptors and viral trafficking likely by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. IRE1α-dependent NUAK2 levels were elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected and bystander non-infected cells, promoting viral spread by maintaining ACE2 cell surface levels and facilitating virion binding to bystander cells.","['Prasad V', 'Cerikan B', 'Stahl Y', 'Kopp K', 'Magg V', 'Acosta-Rivero N', 'Kim H', 'Klein K', 'Funaya C', 'Haselmann U', 'Cortese M', 'Heigwer F', 'Bageritz J', 'Bitto D', 'Jargalsaikhan S', 'Neufeldt C', 'Pahmeier F', 'Boutros M', 'Yamauchi Y', 'Ruggieri A', 'Bartenschlager R']",2023,83,14,Mol Cell,"Prasad V, et al.

37410700,The KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 axis regulates susceptibility to diverse coronaviruses by mediating viral receptor expression.,"Identification of host determinants of coronavirus infection informs mechanisms of pathogenesis and may provide novel therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that the histone demethylase KDM6A promotes infection of diverse coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in a demethylase activity-independent manner. Mechanistic studies reveal that KDM6A promotes viral entry by regulating expression of multiple coronavirus receptors, including ACE2, DPP4 and Ceacam1. Importantly, the TPR domain of KDM6A is required for recruitment of the histone methyltransferase KMT2D and histone deacetylase p300. Together this KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 complex localizes to the proximal and distal enhancers of ACE2 and regulates receptor expression. Notably, small molecule inhibition of p300 catalytic activity abrogates ACE2 and DPP4 expression and confers resistance to all major SARS-CoV-2 variants and MERS-CoV in primary human airway and intestinal epithelial cells. These data highlight the role for KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 complex activities in conferring diverse coronaviruses susceptibility and reveal a potential pan-coronavirus therapeutic target to combat current and emerging coronaviruses.

37402431,Fibrolamellar carcinomas-growth arrested by paracrine signals complexed with synthesized 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.,"Fibrolamellar carcinomas (FLCs), lethal tumors occurring in children to young adults, have genetic signatures implicating derivation from biliary tree stem cell (BTSC) subpopulations, co-hepato/pancreatic stem cells, involved in hepatic and pancreatic regeneration. FLCs and BTSCs express pluripotency genes, endodermal transcription factors, and stem cell surface, cytoplasmic and proliferation biomarkers. The FLC-PDX model, FLC-TD-2010, is driven ex vivo to express pancreatic acinar traits, hypothesized responsible for this model's propensity for enzymatic degradation of cultures. A stable ex vivo model of FLC-TD-2010 was achieved using organoids in serum-free Kubota's Medium (KM) supplemented with 0.1% hyaluronans (KM/HA). Heparins (10 ng/ml) caused slow expansion of organoids with doubling times of ∼7-9 days. Spheroids, organoids depleted of mesenchymal cells, survived indefinitely in KM/HA in a state of growth arrest for more than 2 months. Expansion was restored with FLCs co-cultured with mesenchymal cell precursors in a ratio of 3:7, implicating paracrine signaling. Signals identified included FGFs, VEGFs, EGFs, Wnts, and others, produced by associated stellate and endothelial cell precursors. Fifty-three, unique heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharides were synthesized, assessed for formation of high affinity complexes with paracrine signals, and each complex screened for biological activity(ies) on organoids. Ten distinct HS-oligosaccharides, all 10-12 mers or larger, and in specific paracrine signal complexes elicited particular biological responses. Of note, complexes of paracrine signals and 3-O sulfated HS-oligosaccharides elicited slowed growth, and with Wnt3a, elicited growth arrest of organoids for months. If future efforts are used to prepare HS-oligosaccharides resistant to breakdown in vivo, then [paracrine signal-HS-oligosaccharide] complexes are potential therapeutic agents for clinical treatments of FLCs, an exciting prospect for a deadly disease.","['Zhang W', 'Xu Y', 'Wang X', 'Oikawa T', 'Su G', 'Wauthier E', 'Wu G', 'Sethupathy P', 'He Z', 'Liu J', 'Reid LM']",2023,121,,Matrix Biol,"Zhang W, et al.

37400825,Middle Eastern nurses' views/experiences of work and well-being with the support measures during past disease outbreaks and COVID-19: a qualitative systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The potential psychological health impact of pandemics on nurses has been increasingly widely recognised, as have recommendations to establish support measures for nurses' well-being. Despite the availability of support measures significant number of nurses still experienced burnout and mental distress during Covid-19. Few efforts have been made in the wider literature to understand how nurses experience well-being support or how they perceive it affects their well-being during pandemics. In the Middle East, understanding and exploring well-being support measures during pandemics from nurses' perspectives has not received significant attention.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate nurses' perspectives and experiences of well-being support measures during prior pandemics and the Covid-19 pandemic in the Middle East.
METHODS: A systematic qualitative review was undertaken utilising the JBI model as a framework. Searches were carried out in databases comprised CINAHL, MEDLINE, NUsearch Library of Nottingham University and Google Scholar. Moreover, a manual search through reference lists for relevant studies were carried out.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were included in the review. The findings from the included qualitative studies were extracted using the JBI-QARI data extraction tool for qualitative research. The results were synthesised using a meta-synthesis in line with the JBI approach.
RESULTS: The included studies yielded an aggregate of 111 findings and were categorised into 14 categories, followed by four synthesised findings. These were: [1] nurses experienced challenges during MERS, yet different strategies were implemented by leaders and nurses to manage these challenges; [2] some well-being support measures were unfulfilled during Covid-19; [3] additional aspects compounded negatively on nurses' well- being; and [4] nurses showed maturity during Covid-19.
CONCLUSION: In comparison to prior health emergencies, well-being support measures during Covid-19 were not sufficiently adopted. Nurse policymakers and managers should consider these support measures to correspond with nurses' needs and explore the contextual factors that affect their implementation.

His hemoglobin A1c level was as high as 11.0%. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a bacterial liver abscess, while head magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously showed a high-signal lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging and a low-signal lesion on the apparent diffusion coefficient map of the splenium of the corpus callosum. No significant findings were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. The latter findings led to a diagnosis of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesions. His impaired consciousness resolved on Day 5 after treatment with ceftriaxone and metronidazole infusion and intensive insulin therapy; magnetic resonance imaging on Day 20 showed that the lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared. We propose that when a person with poorly controlled diabetes develops a bacterial infection and presents with impaired consciousness and headache, clinicians should consider the complications of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion.","['Sekikawa N', 'Hirai H', 'Sugimoto K', 'Kusano Y']",2023,14,3,Diabetol Int,"Sekikawa N, et al.

The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 is still disputed. The risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on several risk factors as observed in many studies. The severity of the disease depends on many factors including the viral strain, host immunogenetics, environmental factors, host genetics, host nutritional status and presence of comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder mainly characterized by hyperglycemia. Diabetic individuals are intrinsically prone to infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with diabetes result in β-cell damage and cytokine storm. Damage to the cells impairs the equilibrium of glucose, leading to hyperglycemia. The ensuing cytokine storm causes insulin resistance, especially in the muscles and liver, which also causes a hyperglycemic state. All of these increase the severity of COVID-19. Genetics also play pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. This review article focuses from the probable sources of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 to its impacts on individuals with diabetes and host genetics in pre- and post-pandemic era.","['Nabi AHMN', 'Ebihara A', 'Shekhar HU']",2023,12,3,World J Virol,"Nabi AHMN, et al.

37389876,Assessment of Broadly Reactive Responses in Patients With MERS-CoV Infection and SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.,"IMPORTANCE: In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there remain unanswered questions regarding the nature and importance of the humoral immune response against other coronaviruses. Although coinfection of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with the SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented yet, several patients previously infected with MERS-CoV received the COVID-19 vaccine; data describing how preexisting MERS-CoV immunity may shape the response to SARS-CoV-2 following infection or vaccination are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cross-reactive and protective humoral responses in patients exposed to both MERS-CoV infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study involved a total of 18 sera samples collected from 14 patients with MERS-CoV infection before (n = 12) and after (n = 6) vaccination with 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Of those patients, 4 had prevaccination and postvaccination samples. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were assessed as well as cross-reactive responses to other human coronaviruses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes measured were binding antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Binding antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 main antigens (spike [S], nucleocapsid, and receptor-binding domain) were detected using automated immunoassays. Cross-reactive antibodies with the S1 protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and common human coronaviruses were analyzed using a bead-based assay. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 18 samples were collected from 14 male patients with MERS-CoV infection (mean [SD] age, 43.8 [14.6] years). Median (IQR) duration between primary COVID-19 vaccination and sample collection was 146 (47-189) days. Prevaccination samples had high levels of anti-MERS S1 immunoglobin M (IgM) and IgG (reactivity index ranging from 0.80 to 54.7 for IgM and from 0.85 to 176.3 for IgG). Cross-reactive antibodies with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were also detected in these samples. However, cross-reactivity against other coronaviruses was not detected by the microarray assay. Postvaccination samples showed significantly higher levels of total antibodies, IgG, and IgA targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared with prevaccination samples (eg, mean total antibodies: 8955.0 AU/mL; 95% CI, -5025.0 to 22936.0 arbitrary units/mL; P = .002). In addition, significantly higher anti-SARS S1 IgG levels were detected following vaccination (mean reactivity index, 55.4; 95% CI, -9.1 to 120.0; P = .001), suggesting potential cross-reactivity with these coronaviruses. Also, anti-S NAbs were significantly boosted against SARS-CoV-2 (50.5% neutralization; 95% CI, 17.6% to 83.2% neutralization; P < .001) after vaccination. Furthermore, there was no significant increase in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2 S protein postvaccination.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found a significant boost in cross-reactive NAbs in some patients exposed to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antigens. These findings suggest that isolation of broadly reactive antibodies from these patients may help guide the development of a pancoronavirus vaccine by targeting cross-reactive epitopes between distinct strains of human coronaviruses.","['Zedan HT', 'Smatti MK', 'Thomas S', 'Nasrallah GK', 'Afifi NM', 'Hssain AA', 'Abu Raddad LJ', 'Coyle PV', 'Grivel JC', 'Almaslamani MA', 'Althani AA', 'Yassine HM']",2023,6,6,JAMA Netw Open,"Zedan HT, et al.

Contrarily, camelids and bats are the main reservoir hosts, tolerant for MERS-CoV replication without suffering clinical disease. Here, we isolated cervical lymph node (LN) cells from MERS-CoV convalescent llamas and pulsed them with two different viral strains (clades B and C). Viral replication was not supported in LN, but a cellular immune response was mounted. Reminiscent Th1 responses (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-12) were elicited upon MERS-CoV sensing, accompanied by a marked and transient peak of antiviral responses (type I IFNs, IFN-λ3, ISGs, PRRs and TFs). Importantly, expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8) or inflammasome components (NLRP3, CASP1, PYCARD) was dampened. The role of IFN-λ3 to counterbalance inflammatory processes and bridge innate and adaptive immune responses in camelid species is discussed. Our findings shed light into key mechanisms on how reservoir species control MERS-CoV in the absence of clinical disease.","['Rodon J', 'Te N', 'Segalés J', 'Vergara-Alert J', 'Bensaid A']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Rodon J, et al.

37387137,Locality-preserving minimal perfect hashing of k-mers.,"MOTIVATION: Minimal perfect hashing is the problem of mapping a static set of n distinct keys into the address space {1,…,n} bijectively. It is well-known that n log 2(e) bits are necessary to specify a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) f, when no additional knowledge of the input keys is to be used. However, it is often the case in practice that the input keys have intrinsic relationships that we can exploit to lower the bit complexity of f. For example, consider a string and the set of all its distinct k-mers as input keys: since two consecutive k-mers share an overlap of k-1 symbols, it seems possible to beat the classic  log 2(e) bits/key barrier in this case. Moreover, we would like f to map consecutive k-mers to consecutive addresses, as to also preserve as much as possible their relationship in the codomain. This is a useful feature in practice as it guarantees a certain degree of locality of reference for f, resulting in a better evaluation time when querying consecutive k-mers.
RESULTS: Motivated by these premises, we initiate the study of a new type of locality-preserving MPHF designed for k-mers extracted consecutively from a collection of strings. We design a construction whose space usage decreases for growing k and discuss experiments with a practical implementation of the method: in practice, the functions built with our method can be several times smaller and even faster to query than the most efficient MPHFs in the literature.","['Pibiri GE', 'Shibuya Y', 'Limasset A']",2023,39,Supplement_1,Bioinformatics,"Pibiri GE, et al.

Here, we screened for coronaviruses in 48 faecal samples from 16 of the 17 bat species breeding in the UK, collected through a bat rehabilitation and conservationist network. We recovered nine complete genomes, including two novel coronavirus species, across six bat species: four alphacoronaviruses, a MERS-related betacoronavirus, and four closely related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that at least one of these sarbecoviruses can bind and use the human ACE2 receptor for infecting human cells, albeit suboptimally. Additionally, the spike proteins of these sarbecoviruses possess an R-A-K-Q motif, which lies only one nucleotide mutation away from a furin cleavage site (FCS) that enhances infectivity in other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, mutating this motif to an FCS does not enable spike cleavage. Overall, while UK sarbecoviruses would require further molecular adaptations to infect humans, their zoonotic risk warrants closer surveillance.","['Tan CCS', 'Trew J', 'Peacock TP', 'Mok KY', 'Hart C', 'Lau K', 'Ni D', 'Orme CDL', 'Ransome E', 'Pearse WD', 'Coleman CM', 'Bailey D', 'Thakur N', 'Quantrill JL', 'Sukhova K', 'Richard D', 'Kahane L', 'Woodward G', 'Bell T', 'Worledge L', 'Nunez-Mino J', 'Barclay W', 'van Dorp L', 'Balloux F', 'Savolainen V']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Tan CCS, et al.

Heart disease is an independent risk factor for severe COVID. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 infection is often complicated with myocardial injury, which is closely related to poor prognosis. The receptors of SARS coronavirus are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L, among which ACE2 is the main receptor, and ACE2 is abundant in the heart. The receptor of MERS-coronavirus is dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is not expressed in myocardial cells, but existed in vascular endothelial cells and blood.

Due to the lack of effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China and throughout the world, including drug repurposing. To identify the potent clinical antiretroviral drug candidate against pandemic nCov-19 through computational tools. In this study, we used molecular modelling tool (molecular modelling and molecular dynamics) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on protease proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that Saquinavir, an antiretroviral medication can be used as a first line agent to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saquinavir showed promising binding to the protease active site compared to other possible antiviral agents such as Nelfinavir and Lopinavir. Structural flexibility is one of the important physical properties that affect protein conformation and function and taking this account we performed molecular dynamics studies. Molecular dynamics studies and free energy calculations suggest that Saquinavir binds better to the COVID-19 protease compared to other known antiretrovirals. Our studies clearly propose repurposing of known protease inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

37348227,"Reconsideration of interferon treatment for viral diseases: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.","Periodic pandemics of coronavirus (CoV)-related pneumonia have been a major challenging issue since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The ongoing pandemic of CoV disease (COVID-19) poses a substantial threat to public health. As for the treatment options, only limited antiviral agents have been approved hitherto, and clinicians mainly focus on currently available drugs including the conventional antiviral interferons (IFNs). In clinical practice, IFNs, when used either alone or in combination with ribavirin and/or lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown promising outcomes, to some extent, in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV treatment. Although the efficacy and safety of IFNs in COVID-19 treatment remain unclear, their possible use merits further evaluation. We present a review that summarizes current evidence of IFN treatment for COVID-19 and elaborates on other challenges in terms of the timing of IFN treatment initiation, treatment duration, and IFN type to be used. The review findings suggested that IFN acts by directly inhibiting viral replication and activating immune cell subsets. However, there is a lack of well-designed and controlled clinical trials providing firm evidence for the efficacy or safety of IFN therapy for CoVs. Additionally, critically ill patients with multiple immunosuppression-associated comorbidities may not benefit from IFN therapy, necessitating screening of those patients who would most benefit from IFN treatment.","['Ma D', 'Wang X', 'Li M', 'Hu C', 'Tang L']",2023,121,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Ma D, et al.

37343710,Challenging level of rigid-body approach involving numerical elements (CHLORAINE) applied to repeated elastin peptides.,"Elastic proteins and derived biomaterials contain numerous tandemly repeated peptides along their sequences, ranging from a few copies to hundreds. These repetitions are responsible for their biochemical, biological and biomechanical properties. These sequences are considered to be intrinsically disordered, and the variations in their behavior are actually mainly due to their high flexibility and lack of stable secondary structures originating from their unique amino acid sequences. Consequently, the simulation of elastic proteins and large elastomeric biomaterials using classical molecular dynamics is an important challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach that allows the application of the DURABIN protocol to repeated elastin-like peptides (r-ELPs) in a simple way. Four large r-ELPs were studied to evaluate our method, which was developed for simulating extracellular matrix proteins at the mesoscopic scale. After structure clustering applied on molecular dynamic trajectories of constitutive peptides (5-mers and 6-mers), the main conformations were used as starting points to define the corresponding primitives, further used as rigid body fragments in our program. Contributions derived from electrostatic and molecular hydrophobicity potentials were tested to evaluate their influence on the interactions during simple mesoscopic simulations. The CHLORAINE approach, despite the thinner granularity due to the size of the patterns used, was included in the DURABIN protocol and emerges as a promising way to simulate elastic macromolecular systems.","['Depenveiller C', 'Wong H', 'Crowet JM', 'Debelle L', 'Baud S', 'Dauchez M', 'Belloy N']",2023,215,3,J Struct Biol,"Depenveiller C, et al.

37342672,Precise modification of the surface charge of antigen enhances vaccine immunogenicity.,"Aluminum (alum) adjuvant is the most extensively used protein subunit vaccine adjuvant, and its effectiveness and safety have been widely recognized. The surface charge of the antigen determines its electrostatic adsorption to alum adjuvant, which directly affects the immune efficacy of the protein vaccine. In our study, we precisely modified its surface charge by inserting charged amino acids into the flexible region of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), achieving electrostatic adsorption and a site-specific anchor between the immunogen and alum adjuvant. This innovative strategy extended the bioavailability of the RBD and directionally displayed the neutralizing epitopes, thereby significantly enhancing humoral and cellular immunity. Furthermore, the required dose of antigen and alum adjuvant was greatly reduced, which improved the safety and accessibility of the protein subunit vaccine. On this basis, the wide applicability of this novel strategy to a series of representative pathogen antigens such as SARS-RBD, MERS-RBD, Mpox-M1, MenB-fHbp, and Tularemia-Tul4 was further confirmed. Charge modification of antigens provides a straightforward approach for antigenicity optimization of alum-adjuvanted vaccines, which has great potential to be adopted as a global defense against infectious diseases.","['Zai X', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhou C', 'Zhao F', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X', 'Li R', 'Li Y', 'Zhao X', 'Wang S', 'Yang Y', 'Yin Y', 'Zhang J', 'Xu J', 'Chen W']",2023,4,4,Innovation (Camb),"Zai X, et al.

37342561,Machine learning on large scale perturbation screens for SARS-CoV-2 host factors identifies β-catenin/CBP inhibitor PRI-724 as a potent antiviral.,"Expanding antiviral treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 remains crucial as the virus evolves under selection pressure which already led to the emergence of several drug resistant strains. Broad spectrum host-directed antivirals (HDA) are promising therapeutic options, however the robust identification of relevant host factors by CRISPR/Cas9 or RNA interference screens remains challenging due to low consistency in the resulting hits. To address this issue, we employed machine learning, based on experimental data from several knockout screens and a drug screen. We trained classifiers using genes essential for virus life cycle obtained from the knockout screens. The machines based their predictions on features describing cellular localization, protein domains, annotated gene sets from Gene Ontology, gene and protein sequences, and experimental data from proteomics, phospho-proteomics, protein interaction and transcriptomic profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. The models reached a remarkable performance suggesting patterns of intrinsic data consistency. The predicted HDF were enriched in sets of genes particularly encoding development, morphogenesis, and neural processes. Focusing on development and morphogenesis-associated gene sets, we found β-catenin to be central and selected PRI-724, a canonical β-catenin/CBP disruptor, as a potential HDA. PRI-724 limited infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and IAV in different cell line models. We detected a concentration-dependent reduction in cytopathic effects, viral RNA replication, and infectious virus production in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1-infected cells. Independent of virus infection, PRI-724 treatment caused cell cycle deregulation which substantiates its potential as a broad spectrum antiviral. Our proposed machine learning concept supports focusing and accelerating the discovery of host dependency factors and identification of potential host-directed antivirals.","['Kelch MA', 'Vera-Guapi A', 'Beder T', 'Oswald M', 'Hiemisch A', 'Beil N', 'Wajda P', 'Ciesek S', 'Erfle H', 'Toptan T', 'Koenig R']",2023,14,,Front Microbiol,"Kelch MA, et al.

37340747,Severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women: a review on the potential role of regulatory T cells.,"As a physiological condition, pregnancy may cause temporary alterations in the hematological, cardiopulmonary, and immune responses, affecting the maternal susceptibility to viral infections. Pregnant women are vulnerable to infection with the influenza A virus, hepatitis E virus, MERS CoV, and SARS CoV. The agent of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), which affects the cells upon binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). However, ACE2 expression is elevated in the placental tissue. However, surprisingly, COVID-19 infection in pregnant women tends to have a lower severity and mortality. Therefore, it is interesting to find the immunological mechanisms related to the severity of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4+T cells that may play a central role in maintaining maternal tolerance by regulating immune responses. Pregnancy-induced Tregs are developed to control immune responses against paternal antigens expressed by the semi-allograft fetus. The role of uncontrolled immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis has already been identified. This review provides insight into whether pregnancy-induced regulatory T-cell functions could influence the severity of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy.","['Saghafi N', 'Mahmoudi M', 'Momtazi-Borojeni AA', 'Mirzaeian S', 'Tavasolian F', 'Sathyapalan T', 'Abdollahi E', 'Sahebkar A']",2023,,,Curr Med Chem,"Saghafi N, et al.

The refinement protocol benefited from the recurrent use of geometries of the dinucleotide conformer (NtC) classes as refinement restraints in regions of poor electron density. The restraints are automatically generated at the dnatco.datmos.org web service and are available for download. This NtC-driven protocol significantly helped to stabilize the structure refinement. The NtC-driven refinement protocol can be adapted to other low-resolution data such as cryo-EM maps.

Mortality remains high; therefore, there is a need to develop effective vaccines to prevent MERS-CoV infection. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a critical vaccine target. The latest mRNA technology has enabled rapid development of much-needed vaccines with high efficiency and scalable manufacturing capacity. Here, we designed a mRNA vaccine encoding the RBD of MERS-CoV S protein (RBD-mRNA) and evaluated its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a mouse model. The data showed that nucleoside-modified RBD-mRNA, but not RBD-mRNA lacking the nucleoside modification, was stable and elicited broadly and durable neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses, which neutralized the original strain and multiple MERS-CoV variants. Among all immunization routes tested, the intradermal route was appropriate for this RBD-mRNA to induce strong B-cell responses and the highest neutralizing antibody titers. Importantly, injection of nucleoside-modified RBD-mRNA through the intradermal route protected immunized mice against challenge with MERS-CoV. This protection correlated with serum neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, we have developed an effective MERS-CoV RBD-based mRNA vaccine (with potential for further development) that prevents infection by divergent strains of MERS-CoV.","['Tai W', 'Zheng J', 'Zhang X', 'Shi J', 'Wang G', 'Guan X', 'Zhu J', 'Perlman S', 'Du L']",2023,334,,Virus Res,"Tai W, et al.

37333350,What Strengthens Protein-Protein Interactions: Analysis and Applications of Residue Correlation Networks.,"Identifying critical residues in protein-protein binding and efficiently designing stable and specific protein binders to target another protein is challenging. In addition to direct contacts in a protein-protein binding interface, our study employs computation modeling to reveal the essential network of residue interaction and dihedral angle correlation critical in protein-protein recognition. We propose that mutating residues regions exhibited highly correlated motions within the interaction network can efficiently optimize protein-protein interactions to create tight and selective protein binders. We validated our strategy using ubiquitin (Ub) and MERS coronaviral papain-like protease (PLpro) complexes, where Ub is one central player in many cellular functions and PLpro is an antiviral drug target. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental assays were used to predict and verify our designed Ub variant (UbV) binders. Our designed UbV with 3 mutated residues resulted in a ~3,500-fold increase in functional inhibition, compared with the wild-type Ub. Further optimization by incorporating 2 more residues within the network, the 5-point mutant achieved a KD of 1.5 nM and IC50 of 9.7 nM. The modification led to a 27,500-fold and 5,500-fold enhancements in affinity and potency, respectively, as well as improved selectivity, without destabilizing the UbV structure. Our study illustrates the importance of residue correlation and interaction networks in protein-protein interaction and introduces a new approach that can effectively design high affinity protein binder for cell biology studies and future therapeutic solution.","['Chang CE', 'Hung TI', 'Hsieh YJ', 'Lu WL', 'Wu KP']",2023,,,Res Sq,"Chang CE, et al.

The representation is called a weighted dictionary of [Formula: see text]-mers and finds application in numerous tasks in Bioinformatics that usually count [Formula: see text]-mers as a pre-processing step. In fact, [Formula: see text]-mer counting tools produce very large outputs that may result in a severe bottleneck for subsequent processing. In this work we extend the recently introduced SSHash dictionary (Pibiri in Bioinformatics 38:185-194, 2022) to also store compactly the weights of the [Formula: see text]-mers. From a technical perspective, we exploit the order of the [Formula: see text]-mers represented in SSHash to encode runs of weights, hence allowing much better compression than the empirical entropy of the weights. We study the problem of reducing the number of runs in the weights to improve compression even further and give an optimal algorithm for this problem. Lastly, we corroborate our findings with experiments on real-world datasets and comparison with competitive alternatives.

37321968,Example of use of clock time-dependent targets for patient-based quality control.,"BACKGROUND: Running means for total calcium (Ca) results at our laboratory exhibit a stable time-of-day (TOD) periodic pattern. We examined use of TOD-dependent targets for running means in patient-based quality control (PBQC) for Ca.
METHODS: Primary data were Ca results over a 3 month interval, restricted to weekday data within the Ca reference interval (8.5-10.3 mg/dL; 2.12-2.57 mmol/L). Running means were evaluated as sliding averages of 20 samples (20-mers).
RESULTS: Data comprised 39,629 consecutive Ca measurements (75.3% inpatient (IP)) for which Ca was 9.29±0.47 mg/dL. The all data average for 20-mers was 9.29 ± 0.18 mg/dL. When parsed in 1 h TOD intervals, however, averages among 20-mers ranged from 9.1 to 9.5 mg/dL, with blocs of contiguous results above (0800-2300 h; 53.3% of results; IP = 75.3%) and below (2300-0800 h; 46.7% of results; IP = 99.9%) the all-data mean. There was thus an inherent TOD-dependent pattern of deviation of means from target when using a fixed PBQC target. Using Fourier series analysis as an example approach, characterization of the pattern to produce TOD-dependent PBQC targets eliminated this inherent inaccuracy.

37312038,RegCloser: a robust regression approach to closing genome gaps.,"BACKGROUND: Closing gaps in draft genomes leads to more complete and continuous genome assemblies. The ubiquitous genomic repeats are challenges to the existing gap-closing methods, based on either the k-mer representation by the de Bruijn graph or the overlap-layout-consensus paradigm. Besides, chimeric reads will cause erroneous k-mers in the former and false overlaps of reads in the latter.
RESULTS: We propose a novel local assembly approach to gap closing, called RegCloser. It represents read coordinates and their overlaps respectively by parameters and observations in a linear regression model. The optimal overlap is searched only in the restricted range consistent with insert sizes. Under this linear regression framework, the local DNA assembly becomes a robust parameter estimation problem. We solved the problem by a customized robust regression procedure that resists the influence of false overlaps by optimizing a convex global Huber loss function. The global optimum is obtained by iteratively solving the sparse system of linear equations. On both simulated and real datasets, RegCloser outperformed other popular methods in accurately resolving the copy number of tandem repeats, and achieved superior completeness and contiguity. Applying RegCloser to a plateau zokor draft genome that had been improved by long reads further increased contig N50 to 3-fold long. We also tested the robust regression approach on layout generation of long reads.
CONCLUSIONS: RegCloser is a competitive gap-closing tool. The software is available at https://github.com/csh3/RegCloser .

We previously performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify proviral host factors for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Few host factors were required by diverse coronaviruses across multiple cell types, but DYRK1A was one such exception. Although its role in coronavirus infection was previously undescribed, DYRK1A encodes Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase 1A and is known to regulate cell proliferation and neuronal development. Here, we demonstrate that DYRK1A regulates ACE2 and DPP4 transcription independent of its catalytic kinase function to support SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) entry. We show that DYRK1A promotes DNA accessibility at the ACE2 promoter and a putative distal enhancer, facilitating transcription and gene expression. Finally, we validate that the proviral activity of DYRK1A is conserved across species using cells of nonhuman primate and human origin.

Previous viral vaccine programs, such as those for HIV, Zika, Influenza, Ebola, Dengue, SARS, and MERS, were evaluated. Paramount challenges were identified, including quasi-species, cross-reactivity, duration of immunity, revaccination, mutation, immunosenescence, and adverse events related to viral vaccines. Although a large population has been vaccinated, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and adverse events related to vaccines pose significant challenges. Previous vaccine programs have taught us that predicting the final outcome of the current vaccine program for COVID-19 cannot be determined at a given state. Long-term follow-up studies are essential. Validated preclinical studies, long-term follow-up studies, alternative therapeutic approaches, and alternative vaccines are necessary.","['Singh RS', 'Singh A', 'Masih GD', 'Batra G', 'Sharma AR', 'Joshi R', 'Prakash A', 'Suroy B', 'Sarma P', 'Prajapat M', 'Kaur H', 'Bhattacharyya A', 'Upadhyay S', 'Medhi B']",2023,9,6,Heliyon,"Singh RS, et al.

The RBD anchors the virus to the host cellular membrane to regulate the virus transmissibility and infectious process. Although the protein/receptor interaction mainly depends on the spike's conformation, particularly on its S1 unit, their secondary structures are poorly known. In this paper, the S1 conformation was investigated for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 at serological pH by measuring their Amide I infrared absorption bands. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 secondary structure revealed a strong difference compared to those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, with a significant presence of extended β-sheets. Furthermore, the conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 showed a significant change by moving from serological pH to mild acidic and alkaline pH conditions. Both results suggest the capability of infrared spectroscopy to follow the secondary structure adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 to different environments.","[""D'Arco A"", 'Di Fabrizio M', 'Mancini T', 'Mosetti R', 'Macis S', 'Tranfo G', 'Della Ventura G', 'Marcelli A', 'Petrarca M', 'Lupi S']",2023,24,11,Int J Mol Sci,"D'Arco A, et al.

37291260,Using machine learning to detect coronaviruses potentially infectious to humans.,"Establishing the host range for novel viruses remains a challenge. Here, we address the challenge of identifying non-human animal coronaviruses that may infect humans by creating an artificial neural network model that learns from spike protein sequences of alpha and beta coronaviruses and their binding annotation to their host receptor. The proposed method produces a human-Binding Potential (h-BiP) score that distinguishes, with high accuracy, the binding potential among coronaviruses. Three viruses, previously unknown to bind human receptors, were identified: Bat coronavirus BtCoV/133/2005 and Pipistrellus abramus bat coronavirus HKU5-related (both MERS related viruses), and Rhinolophus affinis coronavirus isolate LYRa3 (a SARS related virus). We further analyze the binding properties of BtCoV/133/2005 and LYRa3 using molecular dynamics. To test whether this model can be used for surveillance of novel coronaviruses, we re-trained the model on a set that excludes SARS-CoV-2 and all viral sequences released after the SARS-CoV-2 was published. The results predict the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with a human receptor, indicating that machine learning methods are an excellent tool for the prediction of host expansion events.","['Gonzalez-Isunza G', 'Jawaid MZ', 'Liu P', 'Cox DL', 'Vazquez M', 'Arsuaga J']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Gonzalez-Isunza G, et al.

37275866,Enhancing immune protection against MERS-CoV: the synergistic effect of proteolytic cleavage sites and the fusion peptide and RBD domain targeting VLP immunization.,"INTRODUCTION: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infectious virus that has caused significant outbreaks in the Middle East and beyond. Due to a highly mortality rate, easy transmission, and rapid spread of the MERS-CoV, it remains as a significant public health treat. There is currently no licensed vaccine available to protect against MERS-CoV.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether the proteolytic cleavage sites and fusion peptide domain of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein could be a vaccine target to elicit the MERS-CoV S protein-specific antibody responses and confer immune protection against MERS-CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that immunization of the proteolytic cleavage sites and the fusion peptide domain using virus-like particle (VLP) induced the MERS-CoV S protein-specific IgG antibodies with capacity to neutralize pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection in vitro. Moreover, proteolytic cleavage sites and the fusion peptide VLP immunization showed a synergistic effect on the immune protection against MERS-CoV infection elicited by immunization with VLP expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Additionally, immune evasion of MERS-CoV RBD variants from anti-RBD sera was significantly controlled by anti-proteolytic cleavage sites and the fusion peptide sera.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates the potential of VLP immunization targeting the proteolytic cleavage sites and the fusion peptide and RBD domains of the MERS-CoV S protein for the development of effective treatments and vaccines against MERS-CoV and related variants.","['Oh J', 'Park U', 'Kim J', 'Jeon K', 'Kim C', 'Cho NH', 'Choi YS']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Oh J, et al.

37269984,"Pregnancy, infection, and epigenetic regulation: A complex scenario.","A unique immunological condition, pregnancy ensures fetus from maternal rejection, allows adequate fetal development, and protects against microorganisms. Infections during pregnancy may lead to devastating consequences for pregnant women and fetuses, resulting in the mother's death, miscarriage, premature childbirth, or neonate with congenital infection and severe diseases and defects. Epigenetic (heritable changes in gene expression) mechanisms like DNA methylation, chromatin modification, and gene expression modulation during gestation are linked with the number of defects in the fetus and adolescents. The feto-maternal crosstalk for fetal survival during the entire gestational stages are tightly regulated by various cellular pathways, including epigenetic mechanisms that respond to both internal as well outer environmental factors, which can influence the fetal development across the gestational stages. Due to the intense physiological, endocrinological, and immunological changes, pregnant women are more susceptible to bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections than the general population. Microbial infections with viruses (LCMV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Coxiella burnetii, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis) further increase the risk to maternal and fetal life and developmental outcome. If the infections remain untreated, the possibility of maternal and fetal death exists. This article focused on the severity and susceptibility to infections caused by Salmonella, Listeria, LCMV, and SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and their impact on maternal health and the fetus. How epigenetic regulation during pregnancy plays a vital role in deciding the fetus's developmental outcome under various conditions, including infection and other stress. A better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, the characterization of the maternal immune system, and the epigenetic regulations during pregnancy may help protect the mother and fetus from infection-mediated outcomes.","['Pradhan J', 'Mallick S', 'Mishra N', 'Tiwari A', 'Negi VD']",2023,1869,7,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,"Pradhan J, et al.

Despite the potential for these publicly available and free resources to help optimize public health campaigns, use for this purpose has been limited.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether early public awareness of COVID-19 correlated with elevated public interest in other infectious diseases of public health importance.
METHODS: Google Trends search data and Reddit comment data were analyzed from 2018 through 2020 for the frequency of keywords ""chikungunya,"" ""Ebola,"" ""H1N1,"" ""MERS,"" ""SARS,"" and ""Zika,"" 6 highly publicized epidemic diseases in recent decades. After collecting Google Trends relative popularity scores for each of these 6 terms, unpaired 2-tailed t tests were used to compare the 2020 weekly scores for each term to their average level over the 3-year study period. The number of Reddit comments per month with each of these 6 terms was collected and then adjusted for the total estimated Reddit monthly comment volume to derive a measure of relative use, analogous to the Google Trends popularity score. The relative monthly incidence of comments with each search term was then compared to the corresponding search term's pre-COVID monthly comment data, again using unpaired 2-tailed t tests. P value cutoffs for statistical significance were determined a priori with a Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: Google Trends and Reddit data both demonstrate large and statistically significant increases in the usage of each evaluated disease term through at least the initial months of the pandemic. Google searches and Reddit comments that included any of the evaluated infectious disease search terms rose significantly in the first months of 2020 above their baseline usage, peaking in March 2020. Google searches for ""SARS"" and ""MERS"" remained elevated for the entirety of the 2020 calendar year, as did Reddit comments with the words ""Ebola,"" ""H1N1,"" ""MERS,"" and ""SARS"" (P<.001, for each weekly or monthly comparison, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Google Trends and Reddit can readily be used to evaluate real-time general interest levels in public health-related topics, providing a tool to better time and direct public health initiatives that require a receptive target audience. The start of the COVID-19 pandemic correlated with increased public interest in other epidemic infectious diseases. We have demonstrated that for 6 distinct infectious causes of epidemics over the last 2 decades, public interest rose substantially and rapidly with the outbreak of COVID-19. Our data suggests that for at least several months after the initial outbreak, the public may have been particularly receptive to dialogue on these topics. Public health officials should consider using Google Trends and social media data to identify patterns of engagement with public health topics in real time and to optimize the timing of public health campaigns.","['Cummins JA', 'Lipworth AD']",2023,7,,JMIR Form Res,Cummins JA and Lipworth AD.

37246519,High-Sensitivity Detection toward SARS-CoV-2 S1 Glycoprotein by Parallel Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has overwhelmed the global economy and human well-being. On account of the sharp increase in test demand, there is a need for an accurate and alternative diagnosis method for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, with the aim to specifically identify the trace SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein, we developed a high-sensitivity and high-selectivity diagnostic method based on the targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay of eight selected peptides. This study emphasizes the outstanding detection sensitivity of 0.01 pg of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein even in the interference of other structural proteins, which to our knowledge is the current minimum limit of detection for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein. This technology could further identify 0.01 pg of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein in a spike pseudovirus, revealing its practical effectiveness. All our preliminary results throw light on the capability of the mass spectrometry-based targeted PRM assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 as a practicable orthogonal diagnostic tool. Furthermore, this technology could be extended to other pathogens (e.g., MERS-CoV S1 protein or SARS-CoV S1 protein) by quickly adjusting the targeted peptides of MS data acquisition. In summary, this strategy is universal and flexible and could be quickly adjusted to detect and discriminate different mutants and pathogens.","['Zhou W', 'Sui Z', 'Liu J', 'He Y', 'Yuan H', 'Sun Y', 'Liang Z', 'Yang K', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang Y']",2023,95,23,Anal Chem,"Zhou W, et al.

This study describes influenza infection among pilgrims upon arrival in Indonesia and the genetic characterization of imported influenza A/H3N2 virus. In total, 251 swab samples with influenza-like illness were tested using real-time RT-PCR for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza viruses. Complete sequences of influenza A/H3N2 HA and NA genes were obtained using DNA sequencing and plotted to amino acid and antigenicity changes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a neighbour-joining method including the WHO vaccine strains and influenza A/H3N2 as references. The real-time RT-PCR test detected 100 (39.5%) samples positive with influenza with no positivity of MERS-CoV. Mutations in the HA gene were mainly located within the antigenic sites A, B, and D, while for the NA gene, no mutations related to oseltamivir resistance were observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses grouped together with clades 3C.2 and 3C.3; however, they were not closely grouped with the WHO-recommended vaccine (clades 3C.1). Sequences obtained from Hajj and Umrah pilgrims were also not grouped together with viruses from Middle East countries but clustered according to years of collection.

37220645,Identification of Evolutionary Trajectories Shared across Human Betacoronaviruses.,"Comparing the evolution of distantly related viruses can provide insights into common adaptive processes related to shared ecological niches. Phylogenetic approaches, coupled with other molecular evolution tools, can help identify mutations informative on adaptation, although the structural contextualization of these to functional sites of proteins may help gain insight into their biological properties. Two zoonotic betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission have caused pandemics in recent times (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), although a third virus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for sporadic outbreaks linked to animal infections. Moreover, two other betacoronaviruses have circulated endemically in humans for decades (HKU1 and OC43). To search for evidence of adaptive convergence between established and emerging betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission (HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2), we developed a methodological pipeline to classify shared nonsynonymous mutations as putatively denoting homoplasy (repeated mutations that do not share direct common ancestry) or stepwise evolution (sequential mutations leading towards a novel genotype). In parallel, we look for evidence of positive selection and draw upon protein structure data to identify potential biological implications. We find 30 candidate mutations, from which 4 (codon sites 18121 [nsp14/residue 28], 21623 [spike/21], 21635 [spike/25], and 23948 [spike/796]; SARS-CoV-2 genome numbering) further display evolution under positive selection and proximity to functional protein regions.

37217030,"Host range, severity and trans boundary transmission of Orf virus (ORFV).","Contagious ecthyma in small ruminants is a zoonotic disease caused by Orf virus (ORFV) in the genus Parapoxvirus that can be deadly to its natural hosts. It causes significant losses worldwide, and commonly infects humans. However, the literature about its comparative severity in sheep and goat hosts is misleading; and while contagious ecthyma has been shown to occur in camels and transmit to humans, there is confusion as to whether ORFV is responsible. Camels are important from a 'One Health' perspective as they have been implicated as a reservoir host for the virus causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has a case fatality rate of 35% in humans. We compared ORFV gene sequences and mortality data from the West Bank in Palestine, where ORFV has not been reported previously, with data from the region. Surprisingly, we found that infections of camels that had been attributed to ORFV were more closely related to a different member of the genus Parapoxvirus. Two Middle East ORFVs isolated from humans were unrelated and sat alongside sheep and goat derived sequences on two distinct ORFV lineages of a maximum likelihood B2L gene tree. One of the viral lineages bifurcated to produce a monophyletic group of goat-derived ORFVs characterized uniquely by a glycine at amino acid reside 249. We found that serine is the ancestral allele shared between ORFV infections of sheep and also two closely related Parapoxviruses (PCPV and CCEV), indicating that the glycine allele represents a more recent shift in virus host range adaptation to goats. Furthermore, and contrary to some reports that ORFV is more severe in goats than in sheep, we observed median mortality of up to 24.5% in sheep, but none in goats. We also identified trans-boundary spread of ORFV between the West Bank and Israel.","['Abu Ghazaleh R', 'Al-Sawalhe M', 'Abu Odeh I', 'El Ibrahim J', 'Al-Turman B', 'Makhamreh J']",2023,112,,Infect Genet Evol,"Abu Ghazaleh R, et al.

37214944,Fulgor: A fast and compact k-mer index for large-scale matching and color queries.,"The problem of sequence identification or matching - determining the subset of references from a given collection that are likely to contain a query nucleotide sequence - is relevant for many important tasks in Computational Biology, such as metagenomics and pan-genome analysis. Due to the complex nature of such analyses and the large scale of the reference collections a resource efficient solution to this problem is of utmost importance. The reference collection should therefore be pre-processed into an index for fast queries. This poses the threefold challenge of designing an index that is efficient to query, has light memory usage, and scales well to large collections. To solve this problem, we describe how recent advancements in associative, order-preserving, k-mer dictionaries can be combined with a compressed inverted index to implement a fast and compact colored de Bruijn graph data structure. This index takes full advantage of the fact that unitigs in the colored de Bruijn graph are monochromatic (all k-mers in a unitig have the same set of references of origin, or ""color""), leveraging the order-preserving property of its dictionary. In fact, k-mers are kept in unitig order by the dictionary, thereby allowing for the encoding of the map from k-mers to their inverted lists in as little as 1 +o(1) bits per unitig. Hence, one inverted list per unitig is stored in the index with almost no space/time overhead. By combining this property with simple but effective compression methods for inverted lists, the index achieves very small space. We implement these methods in a tool called Fulgor. Compared to Themisto, the prior state of the art, Fulgor indexes a heterogeneous collection of 30,691 bacterial genomes in 3.8× less space, a collection of 150,000 Salmonella enterica genomes in approximately 2× less space, is at least twice as fast for color queries, and is 2 - 6&times faster to construct.","['Fan J', 'Khan J', 'Singh NP', 'Pibiri GE', 'Patro R']",2023,,,bioRxiv,"Fan J, et al.

There are currently few antivirals approved for treatment of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and more options would be beneficial, not only now but also to increase our preparedness for future coronavirus outbreaks. Honokiol is a small molecule from magnolia trees for which several biological effects have been reported, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. Honokiol has also been shown to inhibit several viruses in cell culture. In this study, we determined that honokiol protected Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic effect, with a 50% effective concentration of 7.8 μM. In viral load reduction assays, honokiol decreased viral RNA copies as well as viral infectious progeny titers. The compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the more relevant human A549 cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2. Time-of-addition and other assays showed that honokiol inhibited virus replication at a post-entry step of the replication cycle. Honokiol was also effective against more recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron, and it inhibited other human coronaviruses as well. Our study suggests that honokiol is an interesting molecule to be evaluated further in animal studies and, when successful, maybe even in clinical trials to investigate its effect on virus replication and pathogenic (inflammatory) host responses.

37205708,Modelling the structures of frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots from representative bat coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting stimulated by RNA pseudoknots in the viral genome to control expression of enzymes essential for replication, making CoV pseudoknots a promising target for anti-coronaviral drugs. Bats represent one of the largest reservoirs of CoVs and are the ultimate source of most CoVs infecting humans, including those causing SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. However, the structures of bat-CoV frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots remain largely unexplored. Here we use a combination of blind structure prediction followed by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to model the structures of eight pseudoknots that, together with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, are representative of the range of pseudoknot sequences in bat CoVs. We find that they all share some key qualitative features with the pseudoknot from SARS-CoV-2, notably the presence of conformers with two distinct fold topologies differing in whether or not the 5' end of the RNA is threaded through a junction, and similar conformations for stem 1. However, they differed in the number of helices present, with half sharing the 3-helix architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot but two containing 4 helices and two others only 2. These structure models should be helpful for future work studying bat-CoV pseudoknots as potential therapeutic targets.","['Sekar RV', 'Oliva PJ', 'Woodside MT']",2023,19,5,PLoS Comput Biol,"Sekar RV, et al.

37200564,Global patterns of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prevalence and seroprevalence in camels: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the human coronaviruses that causes severe respiratory infection. Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir, where dromedary camels (DC) are the intermediate hosts of the virus. The current study was undertaken to provide an update on global distribution of the virus in camels, and to investigate the pooled prevalence and camel-associated risk factors of infection. After registration of the review protocol in the Open Science Framework, data searches were conducted on 18 April 2023 through Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Considering only natural MERS-CoV infection in camels, 94 articles were selected for data curation through blind screening by two authors. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence and to evaluate camel-associated risk factors. Finally, the results were presented in forest plots. The reviewed articles tested 34 countries, of which camels of 24 countries were seropositive and in 15 countries they were positive by molecular method. Viral RNA was detected in DC. Non-DC, such as bactrian camels, alpaca, llama, and hybrid camels were only seropositive. The global estimated pooled seroprevalence and viral RNA prevalence in DC were 77.53% and 23.63%, respectively, with the highest prevalence in West Asia (86.04% and 32.37% respectively). In addition, 41.08% of non-DC were seropositive. The estimated pooled prevalence of MERS-CoV RNA significantly varied by sample types with the highest in oral (45.01%) and lowest in rectal (8.42%) samples; the estimated pooled prevalence in nasal (23.10%) and milk (21.21%) samples were comparable. The estimated pooled seroprevalence in <2 years, 2-5 years, and > 5 years age groups were 56.32%, 75.31%, and 86.31%, respectively, while viral RNA prevalence was 33.40%, 15.87%, and 13.74%, respectively. Seroprevalence and viral RNA prevalence were generally higher in females (75.28% and 19.70%, respectively) than in males (69.53% and 18.99%, respectively). Local camels had lower estimated pooled seroprevalence (63.34%) and viral RNA prevalence (17.78%) than those of imported camels (89.17% and 29.41%, respectively). The estimated pooled seroprevalence was higher in camels of free-herds (71.70%) than confined herds (47.77%). Furthermore, estimated pooled seroprevalence was higher in samples from livestock markets, followed by abattoirs, quarantine, and farms but viral RNA prevalence was the highest in samples from abattoirs, followed by livestock markets, quarantine, and farms. Risk factors, such as sample type, young age, female sex, imported camels, and camel management must be considered to control and prevent the spread and emergence of MERS-CoV.","['Islam MM', 'Khanom H', 'Farag E', 'Mim ZT', 'Naidoo P', 'Mkhize-Kwitshana ZL', 'Tibbo M', 'Islam A', 'Soares Magalhaes RJ', 'Hassan MM']",2023,16,,One Health,"Islam MM, et al.

37195454,fimpera: drastic improvement of Approximate Membership Query data-structures with counts.,"MOTIVATION: High throughput sequencing technologies generate massive amounts of biological sequence datasets as costs fall. One of the current algorithmic challenges for exploiting these data on a global scale consists in providing efficient query engines on these petabyte-scale datasets. Most methods indexing those datasets rely on indexing words of fixed length k, called k-mers. Many applications, such as metagenomics, require the abundance of indexed k-mers as well as their simple presence or absence, but no method scales up to petabyte-scaled datasets. This deficiency is primarily because storing abundance requires explicit storage of the k-mers in order to associate them with their counts. Using counting Approximate Membership Queries (cAMQ) data structures, such as counting Bloom filters, provides a way to index large amounts of k-mers with their abundance, but at the expense of a sensible false positive rate.
RESULTS: We propose a novel algorithm, called fimpera, that enables the improvement of any cAMQ performance. Applied to counting Bloom filters, our proposed algorithm reduces the false positive rate by two orders of magnitude and it improves the precision of the reported abundances. Alternatively, fimpera allows for the reduction of the size of a counting Bloom filter by two orders of magnitude while maintaining the same precision. fimpera does not introduce any memory overhead and may even reduces the query time.

37193746,"Different electrostatic forces drive the binding kinetics of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Envelope proteins with the PDZ2 domain of ZO1.","The Envelope protein (E) is a structural protein encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Coronaviruses. It is poorly present in the virus but highly expressed in the host cell, with prominent role in virus assembly and virulence. The E protein possesses a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) at its C terminus that allows it to interact with host PDZ domain containing proteins. ZO1 is a key protein in assembling the cytoplasmic plaque of epithelial and endothelial Tight Junctions (TJs) as well as in determining cell differentiation, proliferation and polarity. The PDZ2 domain of ZO1 is known to interact with the Coronaviruses Envelope proteins, however the molecular details of such interaction have not been established. In this paper we directly measured, through Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer and Stopped-Flow methodology, the binding kinetics of the PDZ2 domain of ZO1 with peptides mimicking the C-terminal portion of the Envelope protein from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in different ionic strength conditions. Interestingly, the peptide mimicking the E protein from MERS-CoV display much higher microscopic association rate constant with PDZ2 compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggesting a stronger contribution of electrostatic forces in the early events of binding. A comparison of thermodynamic and kinetic data obtained at increasing ionic strengths put in evidence different contribution of electrostatics in the recognition and complex formation events for the three peptides.

There are structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs) in the genome of this virus. S, M, H, and E proteins are structural proteins, and NSPs include accessory and replicase proteins. The structural and NSP components of SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in its infectivity, and some of them may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, including cancer, coagulation disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with targets such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can stimulate pathological intracellular signaling pathways by triggering transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), CD147, and Eph receptors, which play important roles in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, and multiple cancers such as glioblastoma, lung malignancies, and leukemias. Several compounds such as polyphenols, doxazosin, baricitinib, and ruxolitinib could inhibit these interactions. It has been demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a stronger affinity for human ACE2 than the spike protein of SARS-CoV, leading the current study to hypothesize that the newly produced variant Omicron receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to human ACE2 more strongly than the primary strain. SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses against structural and NSPs have become resistant to previous vaccines. Therefore, the review of recent studies and the performance of current vaccines and their effects on COVID-19 and related diseases has become a vital need to deal with the current conditions. This review examines the potential role of these SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the initiation of chronic diseases, and it is anticipated that these proteins could serve as components of an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 and related diseases.

37177995,DNA binding specificity of all four Saccharomyces cerevisiae forkhead transcription factors.,"Quantifying the nucleotide preferences of DNA binding proteins is essential to understanding how transcription factors (TFs) interact with their targets in the genome. High-throughput in vitro binding assays have been used to identify the inherent DNA binding preferences of TFs in a controlled environment isolated from confounding factors such as genome accessibility, DNA methylation, and TF binding cooperativity. Unfortunately, many of the most common approaches for measuring binding preferences are not sensitive enough for the study of moderate-to-low affinity binding sites, and are unable to detect small-scale differences between closely related homologs. The Forkhead box (FOX) family of TFs is known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of key processes from proliferation and development to tumor suppression and aging. By using the high-sequencing depth SELEX-seq approach to study all four FOX homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have been able to precisely quantify the contribution and importance of nucleotide positions all along an extended binding site. Essential to this process was the alignment of our SELEX-seq reads to a set of candidate core sequences determined using a recently developed tool for the alignment of enriched k-mers and a newly developed approach for the reprioritization of candidate cores.","['Cooper BH', 'Dantas Machado AC', 'Gan Y', 'Aparicio OM', 'Rohs R']",2023,51,11,Nucleic Acids Res,"Cooper BH, et al.

In this study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the most abundant viral structural protein, is capable of binding to dsRNA and phosphorylated PKR, inhibiting both the PKR and OAS/RNase L pathways. The N protein of the bat coronavirus (bat-CoV) RaTG13, the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2, has a similar ability to inhibit the human PKR and RNase L antiviral pathways. Via mutagenic analysis, we found that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the N protein is sufficient for binding dsRNA and inhibiting RNase L activity. Interestingly, while the CTD is also sufficient for binding phosphorylated PKR, the inhibition of PKR antiviral activity requires not only the CTD but also the central linker region (LKR). Thus, our findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of antagonizing the two critical antiviral pathways activated by viral dsRNA and that its inhibition of PKR activities requires more than dsRNA binding mediated by the CTD.

37140523,Modeling Instantaneous Firing Rate of Deep Brain Stimulation Target Neuronal Ensembles in the Basal Ganglia and Thalamus.,"OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders, including Parkinson disease and essential tremor. However, the underlying mechanisms of DBS remain elusive. Despite the capability of existing models in interpreting experimental data qualitatively, there are very few unified computational models that quantitatively capture the dynamics of the neuronal activity of varying stimulated nuclei-including subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim)-across different DBS frequencies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both synthetic and experimental data were used in the model fitting; the synthetic data were generated by an established spiking neuron model that was reported in our previous work, and the experimental data were provided using single-unit microelectrode recordings (MERs) during DBS (microelectrode stimulation). Based on these data, we developed a novel mathematical model to represent the firing rate of neurons receiving DBS, including neurons in STN, SNr, and Vim-across different DBS frequencies. In our model, the DBS pulses were filtered through a synapse model and a nonlinear transfer function to formulate the firing rate variability. For each DBS-targeted nucleus, we fitted a single set of optimal model parameters consistent across varying DBS frequencies.
RESULTS: Our model accurately reproduced the firing rates observed and calculated from both synthetic and experimental data. The optimal model parameters were consistent across different DBS frequencies.
CONCLUSIONS: The result of our model fitting was in agreement with experimental single-unit MER data during DBS. Reproducing neuronal firing rates of different nuclei of the basal ganglia and thalamus during DBS can be helpful to further understand the mechanisms of DBS and to potentially optimize stimulation parameters based on their actual effects on neuronal activity.","['Tian Y', 'Murphy MJH', 'Steiner LA', 'Kalia SK', 'Hodaie M', 'Lozano AM', 'Hutchison WD', 'Popovic MR', 'Milosevic L', 'Lankarany M']",2023,,,Neuromodulation,"Tian Y, et al.

37138419,Antiviral Flavonoids: A natural scaffold with prospects as phytomedicines against SARS-CoV2.,"Flavonoids are vital candidates to fight against a wide range of pathogenic microbial infections. Due to their therapeutic potential, many flavonoids from the herbs of traditional medicine systems are now being evaluated as lead compounds to develop potential antimicrobial hits. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 caused one of the deadliest pandemics that has ever been known to mankind. To date, more than 600 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV2 infection have been reported worldwide. Situations are worse due to the unavailability of therapeutics to combat the viral disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop drugs against SARS-CoV2 and its emerging variants. Here, we have carried out a detailed mechanistic analysis of the antiviral efficacy of flavonoids in terms of their potential targets and structural feature required for exerting their antiviral activity. A catalog of various promising flavonoid compounds has been shown to elicit inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteases. However, they act in the high-micromolar regime. Thus a proper lead-optimization against the various proteases of SARS-CoV2 can lead to high-affinity SARS-CoV2 protease inhibitors. To enable lead optimization, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis has been developed for the flavonoids that have shown antiviral activity against viral proteases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence similarities between coronavirus proteases enable the applicability of the developed QSAR to SARS-CoV2 proteases inhibitor screening. The detailed mechanistic analysis of the antiviral flavonoids and the developed QSAR models is a step forward toward the development of flavonoid-based therapeutics or supplements to fight against COVID-19.","['Saha C', 'Naskar R', 'Chakraborty S']",2023,,,Mini Rev Med Chem,"Saha C, et al.

37131407,Correlation of covid-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome: A Mechanistic Perspective.,"AIMS: Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical and have proteins called spikes that stick out on the surface. COVID-19 most commonly affects the respiratory system, but various clinical manifestations on coronavirus have revealed their potential neurotropism. The neuroinvasive affinity of Coronavirus infections has been reported nearly for all the β Coronavirus infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HEV. Coronavirus invasion occurs through hypoxia injury, immune injury, ACE2, and direct infection. The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and other human Coronaviruses reveals the possible mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
METHODS: A systematic literature review carried out from various search engines like Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Elsevier for investigating the therapeutic perspective of association between Covid-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as its entry receptor and enters the central nervous system through a Blood-brain barrier constituted of inflammatory mediators, direct infection of the endothelial cells, or endothelial injury. Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disease that injures and attacks the nerves in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest that the virus can infect peripheral neurons to cause direct damage through various mechanisms, including direct damage by cytokine-related injury, ACE2 receptors, and the sequelae of hypoxia.

37130166,The substrate selectivity of papain-like proteases from human-infecting coronaviruses correlates with innate immune suppression.,"Coronaviruses that can infect humans can cause either common colds (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43) or severe respiratory symptoms (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). The papain-like proteases (PLPs) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 function in viral innate immune evasion and have deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities. We identified the PLPs of HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43 and found that their enzymatic properties correlated with their ability to suppress innate immune responses. A conserved noncatalytic aspartic acid residue was critical for both DUB and deISGylating activities, but the PLPs had differing ubiquitin (Ub) chain cleavage selectivities and binding affinities for Ub, K48-linked diUb, and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) substrates. The crystal structure of HKU1-PLP2 in complex with Ub revealed binding interfaces that accounted for the unusually high binding affinity between this PLP and Ub. In cellular assays, the PLPs from the severe disease-causing coronaviruses strongly suppressed innate immune IFN-I and NF-κB signaling and stimulated autophagy, whereas the PLPs from the mild disease-causing coronaviruses generally showed weaker effects on immune suppression and autophagy induction. In addition, a PLP from a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern showed increased suppression of innate immune signaling pathways. Overall, these results demonstrated that the DUB and deISGylating activities and substrate selectivities of these PLPs differentially contribute to viral innate immune evasion and may affect viral pathogenicity.","['Xiong Y', 'Huang B', 'Yang Y', 'Fu X', 'Fu Z', 'Xu H', 'Liu M', 'Cao D', 'Zhang M', 'Yang H', 'Niu X', 'Yu C', 'Huang H']",2023,16,783,Sci Signal,"Xiong Y, et al.

A cohort study of Hajj pilgrims from Malaysia enrolled 2,863 participants from 2016-2018, all of whom consented to provide paired blood samples for both pre- and post-Hajj travel to the Middle East. ELISAs and micro-neutralization assays were performed to detect the presence of MERS-CoV IgG antibodies. Sociodemographic data, symptoms experienced during Hajj, and history of exposure to camels or camel products were recorded using structured pre- and post-Hajj questionnaires. A 4-fold increase in anti-MERS-CoV IgG between paired pre-Hajj and post-Hajj serum samples in twelve participants was observed. None of the twelve ELISA-positive sera had detectable levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. All reportedly had mild symptoms of respiratory symptoms at a certain point during the pilgrimage, implying mild or asymptomatic infections. No association between post-Hajj serum positivity and a history of exposure to camels or camel products was obtained. Findings from the study suggest that serologic conversion to MERS-CoV occurred in at least 0.6% of the Hajj pilgrims returning from the Middle East.

37085450,Subunit vaccines with a saponin-based adjuvant boost humoral and cellular immunity to MERS coronavirus.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks have constituted a public health issue with drastic mortality higher than 34%, necessitating the development of an effective vaccine. During MERS-CoV infection, the trimeric spike protein on the viral envelope is primarily responsible for attachment to host cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). With the goal of generating a protein-based prophylactic, we designed a subunit vaccine comprising the recombinant S1 protein with a trimerization motif (S1-Fd) and examined its immunogenicity and protective immune responses in combination with various adjuvants. We found that sera from immunized wild-type and human DPP4 transgenic mice contained S1-specific antibodies that can neutralize MERS-CoV infection in susceptible cells. Vaccination with S1-Fd protein in combination with a saponin-based QS-21 adjuvant provided long-term humoral as well as cellular immunity in mice. Our findings highlight the significance of the trimeric S1 protein in the development of MERS-CoV vaccines and offer a suitable adjuvant, QS-21, to induce robust and prolonged memory T cell response.","['Chang CC', 'Algaissi A', 'Lai CC', 'Chang CK', 'Lin JS', 'Wang YS', 'Chang BH', 'Chang YC', 'Chen WT', 'Fan YQ', 'Peng BH', 'Chao CY', 'Tzeng SR', 'Liang PH', 'Sung WC', 'Hu AY', 'Chang SC', 'Chang MF']",2023,41,21,Vaccine,"Chang CC, et al.

37082513,Two decades of association mapping: Insights on disease resistance in major crops.,"Climate change across the globe has an impact on the occurrence, prevalence, and severity of plant diseases. About 30% of yield losses in major crops are due to plant diseases; emerging diseases are likely to worsen the sustainable production in the coming years. Plant diseases have led to increased hunger and mass migration of human populations in the past, thus a serious threat to global food security. Equipping the modern varieties/hybrids with enhanced genetic resistance is the most economic, sustainable and environmentally friendly solution. Plant geneticists have done tremendous work in identifying stable resistance in primary genepools and many times other than primary genepools to breed resistant varieties in different major crops. Over the last two decades, the availability of crop and pathogen genomes due to advances in next generation sequencing technologies improved our understanding of trait genetics using different approaches. Genome-wide association studies have been effectively used to identify candidate genes and map loci associated with different diseases in crop plants. In this review, we highlight successful examples for the discovery of resistance genes to many important diseases. In addition, major developments in association studies, statistical models and bioinformatic tools that improve the power, resolution and the efficiency of identifying marker-trait associations.

37075625,Discovery of novel papain-like protease inhibitors for potential treatment of COVID-19.,"The recent emergence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants creates an urgent need to develop more effective therapeutic agents to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. Among SARS-CoV-2 essential proteases is papain-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro), which plays multiple roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 viral spread and innate immunity such as deubiquitinating and deISG15ylating (interferon-induced gene 15) activities. Many studies are currently focused on targeting this protease to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, we performed a phenotypic screening using an in-house pilot compounds collection possessing a diverse skeleta against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. This screen identified SIMR3030 as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. SIMR3030 has been shown to exhibit deubiquitinating activity and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 specific gene expression (ORF1b and Spike) in infected host cells and possessing virucidal activity. Moreover, SIMR3030 was demonstrated to inhibit the expression of inflammatory markers, including IFN-α, IL-6, and OAS1, which are reported to mediate the development of cytokine storms and aggressive immune responses. In vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) assessment of the drug-likeness properties of SIMR3030 demonstrated good microsomal stability in liver microsomes. Furthermore, SIMR3030 demonstrated very low potency as an inhibitor of CYP450, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 which rules out any potential drug-drug interactions. In addition, SIMR3030 showed moderate permeability in Caco2-cells. Critically, SIMR3030 has maintained a high in vivo safety profile at different concentrations. Molecular modeling studies of SIMR3030 in the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV PLpro were performed to shed light on the binding modes of this inhibitor. This study demonstrates that SIMR3030 is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro that forms the foundation for developing new drugs to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics for a possible future outbreak of new SARS-CoV-2 variants or other Coronavirus species.","['Hersi F', 'Sebastian A', 'Tarazi H', 'Srinivasulu V', 'Mostafa A', 'Allayeh AK', 'Zeng C', 'Hachim IY', 'Liu SL', 'Abu-Yousef IA', 'Majdalawieh AF', 'Zaher DM', 'Omar HA', 'Al-Tel TH']",2023,254,,Eur J Med Chem,"Hersi F, et al.

37066301,SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 is required for IFN antagonism and efficient virus replication in mice.,"UNLABELLED: Several coronavirus (CoV) encoded proteins are being evaluated as targets for antiviral therapies for COVID-19. Included in this set of proteins is the conserved macrodomain, or Mac1, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase and ADP-ribose binding protein. Utilizing point mutant recombinant viruses, Mac1 was shown to be critical for both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV virulence. However, as a potential drug target, it is imperative to understand how a complete Mac1 deletion impacts the replication and pathogenesis of different CoVs. To this end, we created recombinant bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing complete Mac1 deletions (ΔMac1) in MHV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. While we were unable to recover infectious virus from MHV or MERS-CoV ΔMac1 BACs, SARS-CoV-2 ΔMac1 was readily recovered from BAC transfection, indicating a stark difference in the requirement for Mac1 between different CoVs. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 ΔMac1 replicated at or near wild-type levels in multiple cell lines susceptible to infection. However, in a mouse model of severe infection, ΔMac1 was quickly cleared causing minimal pathology without any morbidity. ΔMac1 SARS-CoV-2 induced increased levels of interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in cell culture and mice, indicating that Mac1 blocks IFN responses which may contribute to its attenuation. ΔMac1 infection also led to a stark reduction in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. These results demonstrate that Mac1 only minimally impacts SARS-CoV-2 replication, unlike MHV and MERS-CoV, but is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and is a unique antiviral drug target.
SIGNIFICANCE: All CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, encode for a conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that counters host ADP-ribosylation. Prior studies with SARS-CoV-1 and MHV found that Mac1 blocks IFN production and promotes CoV pathogenesis, which has prompted the development of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors. However, development of these compounds into antivirals requires that we understand how SARS-CoV-2 lacking Mac1 replicates and causes disease ","['Alhammad YM', 'Parthasarathy S', 'Ghimire R', ""O'Connor JJ"", 'Kerr CM', 'Pfannenstiel JJ', 'Chanda D', 'Miller CA', 'Unckless RL', 'Zuniga S', 'Enjuanes L', 'More S', 'Channappanavar R', 'Fehr AR']",2023,,,bioRxiv,"Alhammad YM, et al.

37061313,Impact of proactive and reactive vaccination strategies for health-care workers against MERS-CoV: a mathematical modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Several vaccine candidates are in development against MERS-CoV, which remains a major public health concern. In anticipation of available MERS-CoV vaccines, we examine strategies for their optimal deployment among health-care workers.
METHODS: Using data from the 2013-14 Saudi Arabia epidemic, we use a counterfactual analysis on inferred transmission trees (who-infected-whom analysis) to assess the potential impact of vaccination campaigns targeting health-care workers, as quantified by the proportion of cases or deaths averted. We investigate the conditions under which proactive campaigns (ie vaccinating in anticipation of the next outbreak) would outperform reactive campaigns (ie vaccinating in response to an unfolding outbreak), considering vaccine efficacy, duration of vaccine protection, effectiveness of animal reservoir control measures, wait (time between vaccination and next outbreak, for proactive campaigns), reaction time (for reactive campaigns), and spatial level (hospital, regional, or national, for reactive campaigns). We also examine the relative efficiency (cases averted per thousand doses) of different strategies.
FINDINGS: The spatial scale of reactive campaigns is crucial. Proactive campaigns outperform campaigns that vaccinate health-care workers in response to outbreaks at their hospital, unless vaccine efficacy has waned significantly. However, reactive campaigns at the regional or national levels consistently outperform proactive campaigns, regardless of vaccine efficacy. When considering the number of cases averted per vaccine dose administered, the rank order is reversed: hospital-level reactive campaigns are most efficient, followed by regional-level reactive campaigns, with national-level and proactive campaigns being least efficient. If the number of cases required to trigger reactive vaccination increases, the performance of hospital-level campaigns is greatly reduced; the impact of regional-level campaigns is variable, but that of national-level campaigns is preserved unless triggers have high thresholds.
INTERPRETATION: Substantial reduction of MERS-CoV morbidity and mortality is possible when vaccinating only health-care workers, underlining the need for countries at risk of outbreaks to stockpile vaccines when available.

37047038,Stabilization of the Dimeric State of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease by GC376 and Nirmatrelvir.,"The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) is an enzyme that is evolutionarily conserved among different genera of coronaviruses. As it is essential for processing and maturing viral polyproteins, Mpro has been identified as a promising target for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against coronaviruses. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the mature and active form of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a dimer composed of identical subunits, each with a single active site. Individual monomers, however, have very low or no catalytic activity. As such, inhibition of Mpro can be achieved by molecules that target the substrate binding pocket to block catalytic activity or target the dimerization process. In this study, we investigated GC376, a transition-state analog inhibitor of the main protease of feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus, and Nirmatrelvir (NMV), an oral, bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor with pan-human coronavirus antiviral activity. Our results show that both GC376 and NMV are capable of strongly binding to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and altering the monomer-dimer equilibrium by stabilizing the dimeric state. This behavior is proposed to be related to a structured hydrogen-bond network established at the Mpro active site, where hydrogen bonds between Ser1' and Glu166/Phe140 are formed in addition to those achieved by the latter residues with GC376 or NMV.","['Paciaroni A', 'Libera V', 'Ripanti F', 'Orecchini A', 'Petrillo C', 'Francisci D', 'Schiaroli E', 'Sabbatini S', 'Gidari A', 'Bianconi E', 'Macchiarulo A', 'Hussain R', 'Silvestrini L', 'Moretti P', 'Belhaj N', 'Vercelli M', 'Roque Y', 'Mariani P', 'Comez L', 'Spinozzi F']",2023,24,7,Int J Mol Sci,"Paciaroni A, et al.

37034576,Mutation nsp6 L232F associated with MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission confers higher viral replication in human respiratory tract cultures ex-vivo.,"UNLABELLED: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes zoonotic disease. Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. We identified a mutation of amino acid leucine to phenylalanine in the codon 232 position of the non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) (nsp6 L232F) that is repeatedly associated with zoonotic transmission. We generated a pair of isogenic recombinant MERS-CoV with nsp6 232L and 232F residues, respectively, and showed that the nsp6 L232F mutation confers higher replication competence in ex-vivo culture of human nasal and bronchial tissues and in lungs of mice experimentally infected in-vivo. Mechanistically, the nsp6 L232F mutation appeared to modulate autophagy and was associated with higher exocytic virus egress, while innate immune responses and zippering activity of the endoplasmic reticulum remained unaffected. Our study suggests that MERS-CoV nsp6 may contribute to viral adaptation to humans. This highlights the importance of continued surveillance of MERS-CoV in both camels and humans.
IMPORTANCE: Viral host adaptation plays an important role in zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses. For MERS-CoV that widely circulates in dromedary camels from Arabian Peninsula, camel-to human transmissions are ongoing, raising the possibility of human adaptive evolution for MERS-CoV. Here, we analysed MERS-CoV sequences and identified an amino acid mutation L232F in nsp6 to occur repeatedly in human MERS-CoV over the years since the first outbreak in 2012. We found the nsp6 L232F confers increase viral replication in-vitro, in ex-vivo upper human respiratory tract cultures and in mice, using a reverse genetics approach. Our results showed the nsp6 L232F may be advantageous for MERS-CoV to replicate in humans. This study highlighted a human adaptation of MERS-CoV and a need for continued surveillance of MERS-CoV to identify any further adaptations in humans, which may be relevant to the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV.","['So RT', 'Chu DK', 'Hui KP', 'Mok CK', 'Sanyal S', 'Nicholls JM', 'Ho JCW', 'Cheung MC', 'Ng KC', 'Yeung HW', 'Chan MC', 'Poon LL', 'Zhao J', 'Peiris M']",2023,,,bioRxiv,"So RT, et al.

37032501,The Effect of Covid Convalescent Plasma on Hospital Stay: A Retrospective Observational Study from a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India.,"Introduction- Covid convalescent plasma (CCP) has been used as standard of care in patients all over the world. CCP is plasma collected from recently infected and currently recovered COVID-19 patients, which contains antiviral antibodies that can be used to treat patients with COVID-19. Several studies have shown a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma in comparison with those not treated with it. Methods- This was a retrospective observational study done at a tertiary health care centre from July 2020 to May 2021, including patients who received CCP during the course of their stay in the hospital. Results- Among 257 participants, the patients with multiple comorbidities who were administered CCP had the longest average length of stay in the hospital which was 15 days, out of which, 92 (35.8%) patients were discharged while 9 (3.5%) patients died. Also, the maximum number of deaths was observed in those patients who had no associated comorbidity, being 11 (4.3%). It was observed that earlier administration of CCP in patients (<5 days from symptom onset) was associated with a higher number of discharges as compared to deaths. Conclusion- Our study indicates that CCP may be efficient in treating COVID-19 patients if given in early course of the disease.","['Pandey P', 'Ranjan S', 'Setya D', 'Kumari S', 'Mandal S']",2023,,,Recent Adv Antiinfect Drug Discov,"Pandey P, et al.

37023405,ClassGraph: Improving Metagenomic Read Classification with Overlap Graphs.,"Current technologies allow the sequencing of microbial communities directly from the environment without prior culturing. One of the major problems when analyzing a microbial sample is to taxonomically annotate its reads to identify the species it contains. Most methods that are currently available focus on the classification of reads using a set of reference genomes and their k-mers. While in terms of precision these methods have reached percentages of correctness close to perfection, in terms of sensitivity (the actual number of classified reads), the performance is often poor. One reason is that the reads in a sample can be very different from the corresponding reference genomes; for example, viral genomes are usually highly mutated. To address this issue, in this article, we propose ClassGraph, a new taxonomic classification method that makes use of the read overlap graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the results of existing tools. We evaluated its performance on simulated and real datasets with several taxonomic classification tools, and the results showed an improved sensitivity and F-measure, while maintaining high precision. ClassGraph is capable of improving the classification accuracy, especially in difficult cases such as virus and real datasets, where traditional tools can classify <40% of reads.","['Cavattoni M', 'Comin M']",2023,30,6,J Comput Biol,Cavattoni M and Comin M.

However, the molecular mechanism behind the association is complex and remains to be clarified. This study integrated human genes involved in infections of three coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from multi-omics data, and investigated the shared genes and molecular functions between coronavirus infection and two neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Seven genes including HSP90AA1, ALDH2, CAV1, COMT, MTOR, IGF2R and HSPA1A, and several inflammation and stress response-related molecular functions such as MAPK signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, responses to oxidative or chemical stress were common to both coronavirus infection and neurodegenerative diseases. These genes were further found to interact with more than 20 other viruses. Finally, drugs targeting these genes were identified. The study would not only help clarify the molecular mechanism behind the association between coronavirus infection and neurodegenerative diseases, but also provide novel targets for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against both coronaviruses and neurodegenerative diseases.","['Deng L', 'Ding L', 'Duan X', 'Peng Y']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Deng L, et al.

37014961,Structure and epitope of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that targets the stem helix of β coronaviruses.,"Monoclonal antibodies that retain neutralizing activity against multiple coronavirus (CoV) lineages and variants of concern (VoC) must be developed to protect against future pandemics. These broadly neutralizing MAbs (BNMAbs) may be used as therapeutics and/or to assist in the rational design of vaccines that induce BNMAbs. 1249A8 is a BNMAb that targets the stem helix (SH) region of CoV spike (S) protein and neutralizes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) original strain, delta, and omicron VoC, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). To understand its mechanism of action, the crystal structure of 1249A8 bound to a MERS-CoV SH peptide was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. BNMAb 1249A8 mimics the SARS-CoV-2 S loop residues 743-749, which interacts with the N-terminal end of the SH helix in the S post-fusion conformation. The conformation of 1249A8-bound SH is distinct from the SH conformation observed in the post-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S structure, suggesting 1249A8 disrupts the secondary structure and refolding events required for CoV post-fusion S to initiate membrane fusion and ultimately infection. This study provides novel insights into the neutralization mechanisms of SH-targeting CoV BNMAbs that may inform vaccine development and the design of optimal BNMAb therapeutics.","['Deshpande A', 'Schormann N', 'Piepenbrink MS', 'Martinez Sobrido L', 'Kobie JJ', 'Walter MR']",2023,290,13,FEBS J,"Deshpande A, et al.

Understanding common factors that super-spreaders may share could inform outbreak models, and be used to guide contact tracing during outbreaks.
METHODS: We searched in MEDLINE, Scopus, and preprints to identify studies about people documented as transmitting pathogens that cause SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 to at least nine other people. We extracted data to describe them by age, sex, location, occupation, activities, symptom severity, any underlying conditions, disease outcome and undertook quality assessment for outbreaks published by June 2021.
RESULTS: The most typical super-spreader was a male age 40+. Most SARS or MERS super-spreaders were very symptomatic, the super-spreading occurred in hospital settings and frequently the individual died. In contrast, COVID-19 super-spreaders often had very mild disease and most COVID-19 super-spreading happened in community settings.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS and MERS super-spreaders were often symptomatic, middle- or older-age adults who had a high mortality rate. In contrast, COVID-19 super-spreaders tended to have mild disease and were any adult age. More outbreak reports should be published with anonymized but useful demographic information to improve understanding of super-spreading, super-spreaders, and the settings in which super-spreading happens.","['Brainard J', 'Jones NR', 'Harrison FCD', 'Hammer CC', 'Lake IR']",2023,82,,Ann Epidemiol,"Brainard J, et al.

36999715,Traditional Chinese Medicine as the preventive and therapeutic remedy for COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic still has tremendous impacts on the global socio-economy and quality of living. The traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) approach showed encouraging results during previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). With limited treatment availability, TCM herbs and formulations could be viable to reduce COVID-19 symptoms and potential sources for discovering novel therapeutic targets. We reviewed 12 TCM herbs and formulations recommended for COVID-19 management by the National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the People's Republic of China. This article explored the Chinese national authorities' guidelines from 2003 to 2020, the scientific data in public databases for the recommended TCM remedies, and their potential mechanistic actions in COVID-19 management. Several TCM herbs and formulations could potentially benefit COVID-19 management. The recommended TCM oral preparations list are Huoxiang zhengqi, Jinhua Qinggan, Lianhua Qingwen, and Shufeng jiedu; the recommended injection preparations comprise Xiyanping Xuebijing, Re-Du-Ning, Tanreqing, Xingnaojing, Shenfu, Shengmai, and Shenmai. TCM remedies are viable options for symptom alleviation and management of COVID-19. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents an opportunity to find novel therapeutic targets from TCM-active ingredients. Despite the recommendations in Chinese National guidelines, these remedies warrant further assessments in well-designed clinical trials for their efficacies in COVID-19.","['Gasmi A', 'Tippairote T', 'Mujawdiya PK', 'Menzel A', 'Lysiuk R', 'Shanaida M', 'Lenchyk L', 'Peana M', 'Bjørklund G']",2023,,,Curr Med Chem,"Gasmi A, et al.

36996998,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-a 10-year (2012-2022) global analysis of human and camel infections, genomic sequences, lineages, and geographical origins.","OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization priority zoonotic pathogen Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) has a high case fatality rate in humans and circulates in camels worldwide.
METHODS: We performed a global analysis of human and camel MERS-CoV infections, epidemiology, genomic sequences, clades, lineages, and geographical origins for the period January 1, 2012 to August 3, 2022. MERS-CoV Surface gene sequences (4061 bp) were extracted from GenBank, and a phylogenetic maximum likelihood tree was constructed.
RESULTS: As of August 2022, 2591 human MERS cases from 26 countries were reported to the World Health Organization (Saudi Arabia, 2184 cases, including 813 deaths [case fatality rate: 37.2%]) Although declining in numbers, MERS cases continue to be reported from the Middle East. A total of 728 MERS-CoV genomes were identified (the largest numbers were from Saudi Arabia [222: human = 146, camels = 76] and the United Arab Emirates [176: human = 21, camels = 155]). A total of 501 'S'-gene sequences were used for phylogenetic tree construction (camels [n = 264], humans [n = 226], bats [n = 8], other [n=3]). Three MERS-CoV clades were identified: clade B, which is the largest, followed by clade A and clade C. Of the 462 clade B lineages, lineage 5 was predominant (n = 177).
CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV remains a threat to global health security. MERS-CoV variants continue circulating in humans and camels. The recombination rates indicate co-infections with different MERS-CoV lineages. Proactive surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and variants of concern in camels and humans worldwide, and development of a MERS vaccine, are essential for epidemic preparedness.","['Azhar EI', 'Velavan TP', 'Rungsung I', 'Traore T', 'Hui DS', 'McCloskey B', 'El-Kafrawy SA', 'Zumla A']",2023,131,,Int J Infect Dis,"Azhar EI, et al.

36990513,SARS-CoV-2 spike variants differ in their allosteric response to linoleic acid.,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a functionally important fatty acid (FA) binding site, also found in some other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), which binds linoleic acid. When occupied by linoleic acid, it reduces infectivity, by 'locking' the spike in a less infectious conformation. Here, we use dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to compare the response of spike variants to linoleic acid removal. D-NEMD simulations show that the FA site is coupled to other, some distant, functional regions of the protein, e.g. the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, furin cleavage site, and regions surrounding the fusion peptide. D-NEMD simulations also identify the allosteric networks connecting the FA site to the functional regions. Comparison of the response of the wild-type spike with four variants (Alpha, Delta, Delta plus, and Omicron BA.1) shows that the variants differ significantly in their response to linoleic acid removal. The allosteric connections to the FA site on Alpha are generally similar to those on the wild-type protein, with the exception of the receptor-binding motif and the S71-R78 region, which show a weaker link to the FA site. In contrast, Omicron is the most affected variant exhibiting significant differences in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, V622-L629, and the furin cleavage site. These differences in allosteric modulation may be of functional relevance, potentially affecting transmissibility and virulence. Experimental comparison of the effects of linoleic acid on SARS-CoV-2 variants, including emerging variants, is warranted.","['Oliveira ASF', 'Shoemark DK', 'Davidson AD', 'Berger I', 'Schaffitzel C', 'Mulholland AJ']",2023,,,J Mol Cell Biol,"Oliveira ASF, et al.

36979339,Linker Length Drives Heterogeneity of Multivalent Complexes of Hub Protein LC8 and Transcription Factor ASCIZ.,"LC8, a ubiquitous and highly conserved hub protein, binds over 100 proteins involved in numerous cellular functions, including cell death, signaling, tumor suppression, and viral infection. LC8 binds intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and although several of these contain multiple LC8 binding motifs, the effects of multivalency on complex formation are unclear. Drosophila ASCIZ has seven motifs that vary in sequence and inter-motif linker lengths, especially within subdomain QT2-4 containing the second, third, and fourth LC8 motifs. Using isothermal-titration calorimetry, analytical-ultracentrifugation, and native mass-spectrometry of QT2-4 variants, with methodically deactivated motifs, we show that inter-motif spacing and specific motif sequences combine to control binding affinity and compositional heterogeneity of multivalent duplexes. A short linker separating strong and weak motifs results in stable duplexes but forms off-register structures at high LC8 concentrations. Contrastingly, long linkers engender lower cooperativity and heterogeneous complexation at low LC8 concentrations. Accordingly, two-mers, rather than the expected three-mers, dominate negative-stain electron-microscopy images of QT2-4. Comparing variants containing weak-strong and strong-strong motif combinations demonstrates sequence also regulates IDP/LC8 assembly. The observed trends persist for trivalent ASCIZ subdomains: QT2-4, with long and short linkers, forms heterogeneous complexes, whereas QT4-6, with similar mid-length linkers, forms homogeneous complexes. Implications of linker length variations for function are discussed.","['Walker DR', 'Jara KA', 'Rolland AD', 'Brooks C', 'Hare W', 'Swansiger AK', 'Reardon PN', 'Prell JS', 'Barbar EJ']",2023,13,3,Biomolecules,"Walker DR, et al.

Protein sequences, being quoted as the 'language of life', has been analyzed for a multitude of applications and inferences. Owing to the rapid development of deep learning, in recent years there have been a number of breakthroughs in the domain of Natural Language Processing. Since these methods are capable of performing different tasks when trained with a sufficient amount of data, off-the-shelf models are used to perform various biological applications. In this study, we investigated the applicability of the popular Skip-gram model for protein sequence analysis and made an attempt to incorporate some biological insights into it. We propose a novel k-mer embedding scheme, Align-gram, which is capable of mapping the similar k-mers close to each other in a vector space. Furthermore, we experiment with other sequence-based protein representations and observe that the embeddings derived from Align-gram aids modeling and training deep learning models better.

36971501,An overview of the recent progress in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) drug discovery.,"INTRODUCTION: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has remained a public health concern since it first emerged in 2012. Although many potential treatments for MERS-CoV have been developed and tested, none have had complete success in stopping the spread of this deadly disease. MERS-CoV replication comprises attachment, entry, fusion and replication steps. Targeting these events may lead to the creation of medications that effectively treat MERS-CoV infection.
AREAS COVERED: This review updates the research on the development of inhibitors of MERS-CoV. The main topics are MERS-CoV‒related proteins and host cell proteins that are involved in viral protein activation and infection.
EXPERT OPINION: Research on discovering drugs that can inhibit MERS-CoV started at a slow pace, and although efforts have steadily increased, clinical trials for new drugs specifically targeting MERS-CoV have not been extensive enough. The explosion in efforts to find new medications for the SARS-CoV-2 virus indirectly enhanced the volume of data on MERS-CoV inhibition by including MERS-CoV in drug assays. The appearance of COVID-19 completely transformed the data available on MERS-CoV inhibition.

The reasons for this are unclear and the role of IFITMs in infection of other human coronaviruses (hCoVs) remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous expression of IFITM2 and/or IFITM3 is critical for efficient replication of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV-OC43 but has little effect on MERS-, NL63-and 229E-hCoVs. In contrast, overexpression of IFITMs inhibits all these hCoVs, and the corresponding spike-containing pseudo-particles, except OC43, which is enhanced by IFITM3. We further demonstrate that overexpression of IFITMs impairs cell surface expression of ACE2 representing the entry receptor of SARS-CoVs and hCoV-NL63 but not hCoV-OC43. Our results explain the inhibitory effects of artificial IFITM overexpression on ACE2-tropic SARS-CoVs and show that three hCoVs, including major causative agents of severe respiratory disease, hijack IFITMs for efficient infection of human cells.","['Xie Q', 'Bozzo CP', 'Eiben L', 'Noettger S', 'Kmiec D', 'Nchioua R', 'Niemeyer D', 'Volcic M', 'Lee JH', 'Zech F', 'Sparrer KMJ', 'Drosten C', 'Kirchhoff F']",2023,26,4,iScience,"Xie Q, et al.

36964860,What is really 'Long COVID'?,"The previous acute respiratory diseases caused by viruses originating from China or the middle east (e.g., SARS, MERS) remained fast developing short diseases without major sequalae or any long-lasting complications. The new COVID-19, on the other hand, not only that it rapidly spread over the world, but some patients never fully recovered or even if they did, a few weeks later started to complain not only of shortness of breath, if any, but general weakness, muscle pains and 'brain fog', i.e., fuzzy memories. Thus, these signs and symptoms were eventually labelled 'long COVID', for which the most widely used definition is 'new signs and symptoms occurring 4-8 weeks after recovering from acute stage of COVID-19'. The other most frequent manifestations associated with long COVID include headache, loss of memory, smell and of hair, nausea, and vomiting. Thus, long COVID is not a simple disease, but complex disorder of several organ systems malfunctioning; hence, it is probably more appropriate to call this a syndrome. The pathogenesis of long COVID syndrome is poorly understood, but initial and persistent vascular endothelial injury that often triggers the formation of microthrombi that if dislodged as emboli, damage several organs, especially in the brain, heart and kidney, by creating microinfarcts. The other major contributory mechanistic factor is the persistent cytokine storm that may last longer in long COVID patients than in others, probably triggered by aggregates of SARS-Co-2 discovered recently in the adrenal cortex, kidney and brain. The prevalence of long COVID is relatively high, e.g., initially varied 3-30%, and recent data indicate that 2.5% of UK population suffers from this syndrome, while in the US 14.7% of acute COVID-19 patients continued to have symptoms longer than 2 months. Thus, the long COVID syndrome deserves to be further investigated, both from clinical and basic research perspectives.","['Szabo S', 'Zayachkivska O', 'Hussain A', 'Muller V']",2023,31,2,Inflammopharmacology,"Szabo S, et al.

36964118,"Pregnancy and Severe ARDS with COVID-19: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Outcomes and Treatment.","Pregnancy-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is fast becoming a growing and clinically relevant subgroup of ARDS amidst global outbreaks of various viral respiratory pathogens that include H1N1-influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is a risk factor for severe viral-induced ARDS and commonly associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes including fetal growth-restriction, preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion. Physiologic changes of pregnancy further compounded by mechanical and immunologic alterations are theorized to impact the development of ARDS from viral pneumonia. The COVID-19 sub-phenotype of ARDS share overlapping molecular features of maternal pathogenicity of pregnancy with respect to immune-dysregulation and endothelial/microvascular injury (i.e., preeclampsia) that may in part explain a trend toward poor maternal and fetal outcomes seen with severe COVID-19 maternal infections. To date, current ARDS diagnostic criteria and treatment management fail to include and consider physiologic adaptations that are unique to maternal physiology of pregnancy and consideration of maternal-fetal interactions. Treatment focused on lung-protective ventilation strategies have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults with ARDS but may have adverse maternal-fetal interactions when applied in pregnancy-related ARDS. No specific pharmacotherapy has been identified to improve outcomes in pregnancy with ARDS. Adjunctive therapies aimed at immune-modulation and anti-viral treatment with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have been reported but data in regard to its efficacy and safety is currently lacking.","['Lim MJ', 'Lakshminrusimha S', 'Hedriana H', 'Albertson T']",2023,28,1,Semin Fetal Neonatal Med,"Lim MJ, et al.

HCWs have been stigmatized by people at their workplace and community, fearing that health care workers are the sources of spreading the virus. This study aimed to assess the perceived stress, stigma, and social support of Nepali health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 380 Nepali HCWs. Perceived stress was measured using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The questionnaire related to stigma was derived from a study conducted to measure stigma among HCWs during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak. Furthermore, perceived social support was measured by Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3). Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses at the significance level of 0.05. This study illustrated that nearly half (44.2%) of the respondents perceived poor social support. Similarly, almost 3% of the HCWs experienced high perceived stress, whereas 87.6% perceived moderate stress, and 35% of the HCWs felt stigmatized. Nepali healthcare workers experienced perceived stress, social stigma, and social support in various severity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 emergency is emotionally difficult and where psychological distress can jeopardize outcomes and affect work performance.

36960162,Type I interferon autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome and association with outcomes and treatment effect of interferon beta-1b in MIRACLE clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential antiviral cytokines induced upon respiratory exposure to coronaviruses. Defects in type I IFN signaling can result in severe disease upon exposure to respiratory viral infection and are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) to type I IFNs were reported as a risk factor for life-threatening COVID-19, but their presence has not been evaluated in patients with severe Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of type I IFN auto-Abs in a cohort of hospitalized patients with MERS who were enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial for treatment with IFN-β1b and lopinavir-ritonavir (MIRACLE trial). Samples were tested for type I IFN auto-Abs using a multiplex particle-based assay.
RESULTS: Among the 62 enrolled patients, 15 (24.2%) were positive for immunoglobulin G auto-Abs for at least one subtype of type I IFNs. Auto-Abs positive patients were not different from auto-Abs negative patients in age, sex, or comorbidities. However, the majority (93.3%) of patients who were auto-Abs positive were critically ill and admitted to the ICU at the time of enrollment compared to 66% in the auto-Abs negative patients. The effect of treatment with IFN-β1b and lopinavir-ritonavir did not significantly differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the presence of type I IFN auto-Abs in hospitalized patients with MERS.","['Alotaibi F', 'Alharbi NK', 'Rosen LB', 'Asiri AY', 'Assiri AM', 'Balkhy HH', 'Al Jeraisy M', 'Mandourah Y', 'AlJohani S', 'Al Harbi S', 'Jokhdar HAA', 'Deeb AM', 'Memish ZA', 'Jose J', 'Ghazal S', 'Al Faraj S', 'Al Mekhlafi GA', 'Sherbeeni NM', 'Elzein FE', 'AlMutairi BM', 'Al-Dawood A', 'Abdullah ML', 'Barhoumi T', 'Alenazi MW', 'Almasood A', 'Holland SM', 'Arabi YM', 'Saudi Critical Care Trials Group']",2023,17,3,Influenza Other Respir Viruses,"Alotaibi F, et al.

36959228,Antiviral activity of marine sulfated glycans against pathogenic human coronaviruses.,"Great interest exists towards the discovery and development of broad-spectrum antivirals. This occurs due to the frequent emergence of new viruses which can also eventually lead to pandemics. A reasonable and efficient strategy to develop new broad-spectrum antivirals relies on targeting a common molecular player of various viruses. Heparan sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan present on the surface of cells which plays a key role as co-receptor in many virus infections. In previous work, marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) were identified as having antiviral activities. Their mechanism of action relies primarily on competitive inhibition of virion binding to heparan sulfate, preventing virus attachment to the cell surface prior to entry. In the current work we used pseudotyped lentivirus particles to investigate in a comparative fashion the inhibitory properties of five structurally defined MSGs against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and influenza A virus (IAV). MSGs include the disaccharide-repeating sulfated galactan from the red alga Botryocladia occidentalis, the tetrasaccharide-repeating sulfated fucans from the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus and from the sea cucumber Isostichopus badionotus, and the two marine fucosylated chondroitin sulfates from the sea cucumbers I. badionotus and Pentacta pygmaea. Results indicate specificity of action against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Curiously, the MSGs showed decreased inhibitory potencies against MERS-CoV and negligible action against IAV. Among the five MSGs, the two sulfated fucans here studied deserve further attention since they have the lowest anticoagulant effects but still present potent and selective antiviral properties.","['Zoepfl M', 'Dwivedi R', 'Kim SB', 'McVoy MA', 'Pomin VH']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Zoepfl M, et al.

36941758,A Cross-Sectional Study on the Psychological Changes of Medical Personnel in Hospitals Who Experienced Special COVID-19 Situations.,"The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an increase in mental health issues; Psychological changes occur in health professionals who are more susceptible to infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate health professionals' levels of anxiety, rage, and depression in COVID-related special circumstances. A general hospital in Korea experienced a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. There was a total of 149 involved frontline and non-frontline health professionals surveyed. The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, General Anxiety Disorder-7, and Korean Screening Tool for Depressive Disorders were utilized in the evaluation of their rage, anxiety, and depression. Anxiety and depression were found to be significantly higher among health professionals by occupation than among non-health professionals. Frontline workers were more depressed than non-frontline workers, according to type of work. These psychological changes can cause PTSD, so it is necessary to check and care for the mental health of health care workers working in medical institutions in the event of mass infections. These issues have been confirmed through studies related to the occurrence of mass infections such as SARS and MERS that the occurrence of mass infections can cause PTSD. The findings proved that the COVID-19 pandemic had a psychological impact on healthcare workers.

36931945,Sudden cardiac death in childhood hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"The most prevalent cause of mortality in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is sudden cardiac death (SCD), which happens more frequently than in adult patients. Risk stratification tactics have generally been drawn from adult practice, however emerging data has revealed significant disparities between children and adult cohorts, implying the need for pediatric-specific risk stratification methodologies. We conducted an all-language literature search on Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar until October 2021. The following search strings and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were used: ""HCM,"" ""SCD,"" ""Sudden Cardiac Death,"" and ""Childhood Onset HCM."" We explored the literature on the risk of SCD in HCM for its epidemiology, pathophysiology, the role of various genes and their influence, associated complications leading to SCD and preventive and treatment modalities. Childhood-onset HCM is linked to significant life-long morbidity and mortality, including a higher SCD rate in children than in adults. The present focus is on symptom relief and avoiding illness-related consequences, but the prospect of future disease-modifying medicines offers an intriguing opportunity to alter disease expression and outcomes in these young individuals. Current preventive recommendations promote implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement based on cumulative risk factor thresholds, although they have been demonstrated to have weak discriminating capacity. This article addresses questions and discusses the etiology, risk factors, and method to risk stratification for SCD in children with HCM.","['Thakkar K', 'Karajgi AR', 'Kallamvalappil AM', 'Avanthika C', 'Jhaveri S', 'Shandilya A', 'Anusheel', 'Al-Masri R']",2023,69,4,Dis Mon,"Thakkar K, et al.

Assay cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity were determined using samples from 160 negative controls and 60 PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. The assay demonstrated sensitivities of 98.3%, 95%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 99.4%, and 98.8% for anti-(S), -N, and -RBD, respectively. Results are expressed as IgG antibody concentrations in BAU/mL, using the WHO international standard (NIBSC code 20/136) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. When the multiplex assay was performed and compared with singleplex assays, the IgG antibody measurement geometric mean ratios were between 0.895 and 1.122, and no evidence of interference was observed between antigens. Lower and upper IgG concentration limits, based on accuracy (between 80% and 120%), precision (percent relative standard deviation, ≤25%), and sample dilutional linearity (between 75% and 125%), were used to establish the assay range. Precision was established by evaluating 24 individual human serum samples obtained from vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. The assay provided reproducible, consistent results with typical coefficients of variation of ≤20% for all assays, irrespective of the run, day, or analyst.

36924385,Determinants of renal papillary appearance in kidney stone formers: An in-depth examination.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investi-gate the association between the urinary metabolic milieu and kidney stone recurrence with a validated papillary evaluation score (PPLA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 30 stone for-mers who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery procedures. Visual inspection of the accessible renal papillae was performed to calculate PPLA score, based on the characterization of ductal plugging, surface pitting, loss of papillary contour and Randall's plaque extension. Stone compositions, 24h urine collections and kidney stone events during follow-up were collected. Relative supersaturation ratios (RSS) for calcium oxalate (CaOx), brushite and uric acid were calculated using EQUIL-2. PPLA score > 3 was deﬁned as high.
RESULTS: Median follow-up period was 11 months (5, 34). PPLA score was inversely correlated with BMI (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38, 0.91, p = 0.018), type 2 diabetes (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.003, 0.58, p = 0.018) and history of recurrent kidney stones (OR 0.17, 95%CI 0.04, 0.75, p = 0.019). The associations between PPLA score, diabetes and BMI were not conﬁrmed after excluding patients with uric acid stones. Higher PPLA score was associated with lower odds of new kidney stone events during follow-up (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02, 1.00, p = 0.05). No other signiﬁcant correla-tions were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results conﬁrm the lack of efﬁcacy of PPLA score in phenotyping patients affected by kidney stone disease or in predicting the risk of stone recurrence. Larger, long-term studies need to be performed to clarify the role of PPLA on the risk of stone recurrence.","['Bargagli M', 'Pinto F', 'De Leonardis R', 'Ragonese M', 'Totaro A', 'Recupero S', 'Vittori M', 'Bassi P', 'Gambaro G', 'Ferraro PM']",2023,95,1,Arch Ital Urol Androl,"Bargagli M, et al.

36903364,Potential Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Strategies.,"Finding effective antiviral molecular strategies was a main concern in the scientific community when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 as an easily transmissible and potentially deadly β-coronavirus able to cause the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which famously led to one of the most worrying pandemics in recent times. Other members of this zoonotic pathogenic family were already known before 2019, but apart from the SARS-CoV, which was responsible of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002/2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), whose main impact on humans is geographically restricted to Middle Eastern countries, the other human β-coronaviruses known at that time were those typically associated with common cold symptoms which had not led to the development of any specific prophylactic or therapeutic measures. Although SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations are still causing illness in our communities, COVID-19 is less deadly than before and we are returning to normality. Overall, the main lesson learnt after the past few years of pandemic is that keeping our bodies healthy and immunity defenses strong using sport, nature-inspired measures, and using functional foods are powerful weapons for preventing the more severe forms of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 and, from a more molecular perspective, that finding drugs with mechanisms of action involving biological targets conserved within the different mutations of SARS-CoV-2-and possibly within the entire family of β-coronaviruses-gives more therapeutic opportunities in the scenario of future pandemics based on these pathogens. In this regard, the main protease (M","['Vicidomini C', 'Roviello GN']",2023,28,5,Molecules,Vicidomini C and Roviello GN. Potential Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Strategies.

36902020,R-Propranolol Has Broad-Spectrum Anti-Coronavirus Activity and Suppresses Factors Involved in Pathogenic Angiogenesis.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antivirals to increase our preparedness. Patients often require treatment by the time that blocking virus replication is less effective. Therefore, therapy should not only aim to inhibit the virus, but also to suppress pathogenic host responses, e.g., leading to microvascular changes and pulmonary damage. Clinical studies have previously linked SARS-CoV-2 infection to pathogenic intussusceptive angiogenesis in the lungs, involving the upregulation of angiogenic factors such as ANGPTL4. The β-blocker propranolol is used to suppress aberrant ANGPTL4 expression in the treatment of hemangiomas. Therefore, we investigated the effect of propranolol on SARS-CoV-2 infection and the expression of ANGPTL4. SARS-CoV-2 upregulated ANGPTL4 in endothelial and other cells, which could be suppressed with R-propranolol. The compound also inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells and reduced the viral load by up to ~2 logs in various cell lines and primary human airway epithelial cultures. R-propranolol was as effective as S-propranolol but lacks the latter's undesired β-blocker activity. R-propranolol also inhibited SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It inhibited a post-entry step of the replication cycle, likely via host factors. The broad-spectrum antiviral effect and suppression of factors involved in pathogenic angiogenesis make R-propranolol an interesting molecule to further explore for the treatment of coronavirus infections.","['Thaler M', 'Salgado-Benvindo C', 'Leijs A', 'Tas A', 'Ninaber DK', 'Arbiser JL', 'Snijder EJ', 'van Hemert MJ']",2023,24,5,Int J Mol Sci,"Thaler M, et al.

The emergence of Omicron and subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the limitations of solely targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Here, we isolated a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) from SARS-CoV-2 recovered-vaccinated donors, which targets a conserved S2 region in the betacoronavirus spike fusion machinery. Select bnAbs showed broad in vivo protection against all three deadly betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, which have spilled over into humans in the past two decades. Structural studies of these bnAbs delineated the molecular basis for their broad reactivity and revealed common antibody features targetable by broad vaccination strategies. These bnAbs provide new insights and opportunities for antibody-based interventions and for developing pan-betacoronavirus vaccines.","['Zhou P', 'Song G', 'Liu H', 'Yuan M', 'He WT', 'Beutler N', 'Zhu X', 'Tse LV', 'Martinez DR', 'Schäfer A', 'Anzanello F', 'Yong P', 'Peng L', 'Dueker K', 'Musharrafieh R', 'Callaghan S', 'Capozzola T', 'Limbo O', 'Parren M', 'Garcia E', 'Rawlings SA', 'Smith DM', 'Nemazee D', 'Jardine JG', 'Safonova Y', 'Briney B', 'Rogers TF', 'Wilson IA', 'Baric RS', 'Gralinski LE', 'Burton DR', 'Andrabi R']",2023,56,3,Immunity,"Zhou P, et al.

RECENT FINDINGS: RTIs of viral cause such as influenza, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43) are common in MGEs. No cases of MERS-CoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj, despite the fact that MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers of mass gathering religious and sporting events have implemented risk-based infection control measures and lockdowns that limited transmission of RTIs.
SUMMARY: Large-scale RTI outbreaks at MGEs are uncommon due to more robust public health planning, prevention, risk assessment and improved health infrastructures in host countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Hui DSC', 'Zumla A']",2023,29,3,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Hui DSC and Zumla A.

36868633,The interaction of membrane estradiol receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors in adaptive and maladaptive estradiol-mediated motivated behaviors in females.,"Estrogen receptors were initially identified as intracellular, ligand-regulated transcription factors that result in genomic change upon ligand binding. However, rapid estrogen receptor signaling initiated outside of the nucleus was also known to occur via mechanisms that were less clear. Recent studies indicate that these traditional receptors, estrogen receptor α and estrogen receptor β, can also be trafficked to act at the surface membrane. Signaling cascades from these membrane-bound estrogen receptors (mERs) can rapidly alter cellular excitability and gene expression, particularly through the phosphorylation of CREB. A principal mechanism of neuronal mER action has been shown to occur through glutamate-independent transactivation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu), which elicits multiple signaling outcomes. The interaction of mERs with mGlu has been shown to be important in many diverse functions in females, including driving motivated behaviors. Experimental evidence suggests that a large part of estradiol-induced neuroplasticity and motivated behaviors, both adaptive and maladaptive, occurs through estradiol-dependent mER activation of mGlu. Herein we will review signaling through estrogen receptors, both ""classical"" nuclear receptors and membrane-bound receptors, as well as estradiol signaling through mGlu. We will focus on how the interactions of these receptors and their downstream signaling cascades are involved in driving motivated behaviors in females, discussing a representative adaptive motivated behavior (reproduction) and maladaptive motivated behavior (addiction).","['Johnson CS', 'Mermelstein PG']",2023,168,,Int Rev Neurobiol,Johnson CS and Mermelstein PG.

We previously generated a group of fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides, with one formulation being evaluated under clinical trials. In this study, we dedicated to characterize the extended N-terminal motif (residues 1161-1168) of the so-called spike (S) heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region. Alanine scanning analysis of this motif verified its critical roles in S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. Using a panel of HR2 peptides with the N-terminal extensions, we identified a peptide termed P40, which contained four extended N-terminal residues (VDLG) and exhibited improved binding and antiviral activities, whereas the peptides with further extensions had no such effects. Then, we developed a new lipopeptide P40-LP by modifying P40 with cholesterol, which exhibited dramatically increased activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 variants including divergent Omicron sublineages. Moreover, P40-LP displayed a synergistic effect with IPB24 lipopeptide that was designed containing the C-terminally extended residues, and it could effectively inhibit other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Taken together, our results have provided valuable insights for understanding the structure-function relationship of SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein and offered novel antiviral strategies to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Hu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Yu Y', 'Liu N', 'Ju X', 'Ding Q', 'He Y']",2023,212,,Antiviral Res,"Hu Y, et al.

Patients with COVID-19 presented with a wide spectrum of symptoms for the disease, from entirely asymptomatic disease to full-blown pneumonia and multiorgan failures. More evidence emerged, showing the production of interferons (IFNs) in the severe cases were significantly lower than their milder counterparts, suggesting linkage of COVID-19 to impaired innate immunity. This review presents a brief overview of how coronaviruses evade innate immunity, according to the current studies about SARS-CoV and middle-east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The coronaviruses manage to block, escape, or dampen the innate immune response by antagonizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathways, epigenetic modification, posttranslational modifications, and host mRNA translation.

As November 2, 2022, World Health Organization (WHO) received 628,035,553 reported incidents on COVID-19, with 6,572,800 mortalities and, with a total 12,850,970,971 vaccine doses have been delivered as of October 31, 2022. The infection can cause mild or self-limiting symptoms of pulmonary and severe infections or death may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Simultaneously, antivirals, corticosteroids, immunological treatments, antibiotics, and anticoagulants have been proposed as potential medicines to cure COVID-19 affected patients. Among these initial treatments, COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), which was retrieved from COVID-19 recovered patients to be used as passive immune therapy, in which antibodies from cured patients were given to infected patients to prevent illness. Such treatment has yielded the best results in earlier with preventative or early stages of illness. Convalescent plasma (CP) is the first treatment available when infectious disease initially appears, although few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. The historical record suggests with potential benefit for other respiratory infections, as coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-I (SARS-CoV-I) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), though the analysis of such research is constrained by some non-randomized experiments (NREs). Rigorous studies on CP are made more demanding by the following with the immediacy of the epidemics, CP use may restrict the ability to utilize it for clinical testing, non-homogenous nature of product, highly decentralized manufacturing process; constraints with capacity to measure biologic function, ultimate availability of substitute therapies, as antivirals, purified immune globulins, or monoclonal antibodies. Though, it is still not clear how effectively CCP works among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current review tries to focus on its efficiency and usage in clinical scenarios and identifying existing benefits of implementation during pandemic or how it may assist with future pandemic preventions.","['Kandula UR', 'Tuji TS', 'Gudeta DB', 'Bulbula KL', 'Mohammad AA', 'Wari KD', 'Abbas A']",2023,14,,J Blood Med,"Kandula UR, et al.

36854032,Shapify: Paths to SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting pseudoknot.,"Multiple coronaviruses including MERS-CoV causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, SARS-CoV causing SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, use a mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to replicate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a unique RNA pseudoknotted structure that stimulates -1 PRF. Targeting -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 to impair viral replication can improve patients' prognoses. Crucial to developing these therapies is understanding the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Our goal is to expand knowledge of -1 PRF structural conformations. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in -1 PRF pseudoknots of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. We provide in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV -1 PRF pseudoknots, including reference and noteworthy mutated sequences. To better understand the impact of mutations, we provide insight on -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on resulting structures. We introduce Shapify, a novel algorithm that given an RNA sequence incorporates structural reactivity (SHAPE) data and partial structure information to output an RNA secondary structure prediction within a biologically sound hierarchical folding approach. Shapify enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot conformations by providing energetically favourable predictions that are relevant to structure-function and may correlate with -1 PRF efficiency. Applied to the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot, Shapify unveils previously unknown paths from initial stems to pseudoknotted structures. By contextualizing our work with available experimental data, our structure predictions motivate future RNA structure-function research and can aid 3-D modeling of pseudoknots.","['Trinity L', 'Wark I', 'Lansing L', 'Jabbari H', 'Stege U']",2023,19,2,PLoS Comput Biol,"Trinity L, et al.

36851186,Quasispecies Nature of RNA Viruses: Lessons from the Past.,"Viral quasispecies are distinct but closely related mutants formed by the disparity in viral genomes due to recombination, mutations, competition, and selection pressure. Theoretical derivation for the origin of a quasispecies is owed to the error-prone replication by polymerase and mutants of RNA replicators. Here, we briefly addressed the theoretical and mathematical origin of quasispecies and their dynamics. The impact of quasispecies for major salient human pathogens is reviewed. In the current global scenario, rapid changes in geographical landscapes favor the origin and selection of mutants. It comes as no surprise that a cauldron of mutants poses a significant risk to public health, capable of causing pandemics. Mutation rates in RNA viruses are magnitudes higher than in DNA organisms, explaining their enhanced virulence and evolvability.

36839773,Aspects of Nanotechnology for COVID-19 Vaccine Development and Its Delivery Applications.,"Coronavirus, a causative agent of the common cold to a much more complicated disease such as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV-2), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", is a member of the coronaviridae family and contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA of 26-32 kilobase pairs. COVID-19 has shown very high mortality and morbidity and imparted a significantly impacted socioeconomic status. There are many variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have originated from the mutation of the genetic material of the original coronavirus. This has raised the demand for efficient treatment/therapy to manage newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infections successfully. However, different types of vaccines have been developed and administered to patients but need more attention because COVID-19 is not under complete control. In this article, currently developed nanotechnology-based vaccines are explored, such as inactivated virus vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines, DNA-based vaccines, S-protein-based vaccines, virus-vectored vaccines, etc. One of the important aspects of vaccines is their administration inside the host body wherein nanotechnology can play a very crucial role. Currently, more than 26 nanotechnology-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in various phases of clinical trials. Nanotechnology is one of the growing fields in drug discovery and drug delivery that can also be used for the tackling of coronavirus. Nanotechnology can be used in various ways to design and develop tools and strategies for detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic and vaccine development to protect against COVID-19. The design of instruments for speedy, precise, and sensitive diagnosis, the fabrication of potent sanitizers, the delivery of extracellular antigenic components or mRNA-based vaccines into human tissues, and the administration of antiretroviral medicines into the organism are nanotechnology-based strategies for COVID-19 management. Herein, we discuss the application of nanotechnology in COVID-19 vaccine development and the challenges and opportunities in this approach.","['Prabhakar PK', 'Khurana N', 'Vyas M', 'Sharma V', 'Batiha GE', 'Kaur H', 'Singh J', 'Kumar D', 'Sharma N', 'Kaushik A', 'Kumar R']",2023,15,2,Pharmaceutics,"Prabhakar PK, et al.

36825325,Current status in cellular-based therapies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks that resulted in a catastrophic threat to global health, with more than 500 million cases detected and 5.5 million deaths worldwide. Patients with a COVID-19 infection presented with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms, resulting in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. Immune dysregulation through delayed innate immune response or impairment of the adaptive immune response is the key contributor to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. Symptomatic and supportive therapy is the fundamental strategy in treating COVID-19 infection, including antivirals, steroid-based therapies, and cell-based immunotherapies. Various studies reported substantial effects of immune-based therapies for patients with COVID-19 to modulate the over-activated immune system while simultaneously refining the body's ability to destroy the virus. However, challenges may arise from the complexity of the disease through the genetic variance of the virus itself and patient heterogeneity, causing increased transmissibility and heightened immune system evasion that rapidly change the intervention and prevention measures for SARS-CoV-2. Cell-based therapy, utilizing stem cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T cells, among others, are being extensively explored as other potential immunological approaches for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2-affected patients the similar process was effectively proven in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections. This review provides detailed insights into the innate and adaptive immune response-mediated cell-based immunotherapies in COVID-19 patients. The immune response linking towards engineered autologous or allogenic immune cells for either treatment or preventive therapies is subsequently highlighted in an individual study or in combination with several existing treatments. Up-to-date data on completed and ongoing clinical trials of cell-based agents for preventing or treating COVID-19 are also outlined to provide a guide that can help in treatment decisions and future trials.","['Hattab D', 'Amer MFA', 'Mohd Gazzali A', 'Chuah LH', 'Bakhtiar A']",2023,60,5,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,"Hattab D, et al.

36813016,Measuring functional similarity of lncRNAs based on variable K-mer profiles of nucleotide sequences.,"Long non-coding RNAs are a class of essential non-coding RNAs with a length of more than 200 nts. Recent studies have indicated that lncRNAs have various complex regulatory functions, which play great impacts on many fundamental biological processes. However, measuring the functional similarity between lncRNAs by traditional wet-experiments is time-consuming and labor intensive, computational-based approaches have been an effective choice to tackle this problem. Meanwhile, most sequences-based computation methods measure the functional similarity of lncRNAs with their fixed length vector representations, which could not capture the features on larger k-mers. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the predict performance of the potential regulatory functions of lncRNAs. In this study, we propose a novel approach called MFSLNC to comprehensively measure functional similarity of lncRNAs based on variable k-mer profiles of nucleotide sequences. MFSLNC employs the dictionary tree storage, which could comprehensively represent lncRNAs with long k-mers. The functional similarity between lncRNAs is evaluated by the Jaccard similarity. MFSLNC verified the similarity between two lncRNAs with the same mechanism, detecting homologous sequence pairs between human and mouse. Besides, MFSLNC is also applied to lncRNA-disease associations, combined with the association prediction model WKNKN. Moreover, we also proved that our method can more effectively calculate the similarity of lncRNAs by comparing with the classical methods based on the lncRNA-mRNA association data. The detected AUC value of prediction is 0.867, which achieves good performance in the comparison of similar models.","['Teng Z', 'Shi L', 'Yu H', 'Wu C', 'Tian Z']",2023,212,,Methods,"Teng Z, et al.

36788606,Immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in asymptomatic and symptomatic pediatric and adult patients.,"BACKGROUND: The infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has unpredictable manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and variable clinical course with some patients being asymptomatic whereas others experiencing severe respiratory distress, or even death. We aimed to evaluate the immunoglobulin G (IgG) response towards linear peptides on a peptide array containing sequences from SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 antigens, in order to identify immunological indicators of disease outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
METHODS: We included in the study 79 subjects, comprising 19 pediatric and 30 adult SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with increasing disease severity, from mild to critical illness, and 30 uninfected subjects who were vaccinated with one dose of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Serum samples were analyzed by a peptide microarray containing 5828 overlapping 15-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome and selected linear epitopes of spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) glycoproteins as well as nucleoprotein (N) of MERS, SARS and coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 (isolates 1, 2 and 5).
RESULTS: All patients exhibited high IgG reactivity against the central region and C-terminus peptides of both SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins. Setting the threshold value for serum reactivity above 25,000 units, 100% and 81% of patients with severe disease, 36% and 29% of subjects with mild symptoms, and 8% and 17% of children younger than 8-years reacted against N and S proteins, respectively. Overall, the total number of peptides in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome targeted by serum samples was much higher in children compared to adults. Notably, we revealed a differential antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides of M protein between adults, mainly reacting against the C-terminus epitopes, and children, who were highly responsive to the N-terminus of M protein. In addition, IgG signals against NS7B, NS8 and ORF10 peptides were found elevated mainly among adults with mild (63%) symptoms. Antibodies towards S and N proteins of other coronaviruses (MERS, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) were detected in all groups without a significant correlation with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results showed that antibodies elicited by specific linear epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteome are age dependent and related to COVID-19 clinical severity. Cross-reaction of antibodies to epitopes of other human coronaviruses was evident in all patients with distinct profiles between children and adult patients. Several SARS-CoV-2 peptides identified in this study are of particular interest for the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests to predict the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Tornesello AL', 'Botti C', 'Micillo A', 'Labonia F', 'Arpino S', 'Isgrò MA', 'Meola S', 'Russo L', 'Cavalcanti E', 'Sale S', 'Nicastro C', 'Atripaldi L', 'Starita N', 'Cerasuolo A', 'Reimer U', 'Holenya P', 'Buonaguro L', 'Buonaguro FM', 'Tornesello ML']",2023,21,1,J Transl Med,"Tornesello AL, et al.

36768923,Reactivity Graph Yields Interpretable IgM Repertoire Signatures as Potential Tumor Biomarkers.,"Combining adaptive and innate immunity induction modes, the repertoire of immunoglobulin M (IgM) can reflect changes in the internal environment including malignancies. Previously, it was shown that a mimotope library reflecting the public IgM repertoire of healthy donors (IgM IgOme) can be mined for efficient probes of tumor biomarker antibody reactivities. To better explore the interpretability of this approach for IgM, solid tumor-related profiles of IgM reactivities to linear epitopes of actual tumor antigens and viral epitopes were studied. The probes were designed as oriented planar microarrays of 4526 peptide sequences (as overlapping 15-mers) derived from 24 tumor-associated antigens and 209 cancer-related B cell epitopes from 30 viral antigens. The IgM reactivity in sera from 21 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, brain metastases of other tumors, and non-tumor-bearing neurosurgery patients was thus probed in a proof-of-principle study. A graph representation of the binding data was developed, which mapped the cross-reactivity of the mixture of IgM (poly)specificities, delineating different antibody footprints in the features of the graph-neighborhoods and cliques. The reactivity graph mapped the major features of the IgM repertoire such as the magnitude of the reactivity (titer) and major cross-reactivities, which correlated with blood group reactivity, non-self recognition, and even idiotypic specificities. A correlation between an aspect of this image of the IgM IgOme, namely, small cliques reflecting rare self-reactivities and the capacity of subsets of the epitopes to separate the diagnostic groups studied was found. In this way, the graph representation helped the feature selection in its filtering step and provided reduced feature sets, which, after recursive feature elimination, produced a classifier containing 51 peptide reactivities separating the three diagnostic groups with an unexpected efficiency. Thus, IgM IgOme approaches to repertoire studies is greatly augmented when self/viral antigens are used and the data are represented as a reactivity graph. This approach is most general, and if it is applicable to tumors in immunologically privileged sites, it can be applied to any solid tumors, for instance, breast or lung cancer.","['Ferdinandov D', 'Kostov V', 'Hadzhieva M', 'Shivarov V', 'Petrov P', 'Bussarsky A', 'Pashov AD']",2023,24,3,Int J Mol Sci,"Ferdinandov D, et al.

The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has enhanced the potential for infection and transmission as compared to other known members of this family. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 21-25 nucleotides long non-coding RNA that bind to 3' UTR of genes and regulate almost every aspect of cellular function. Several human miRNAs have been known to target viral genomes, mostly to downregulate their expression and sometimes to upregulate also. In some cases, host miRNAs could be sequestered by the viral genome to create a condition for favourable virus existence. The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic is unique based on its transmissibility and severity and we hypothesised that there could be a unique mechanism for its pathogenesis. In this study, we exploited ","['Baig MS', 'Deepanshu', 'Prakash P', 'Alam P', 'Krishnan A']",2023,,,J Biomol Struct Dyn,"Baig MS, et al.

36749755,Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry monitoring of anti-viral antibody production throughout vaccination and breakthrough Covid-19.,"Immune responses to COVID-19 infection and vaccination are individual and varied. There is a need to understand the timeline of vaccination efficacy against current and yet to be discovered viral mutations. Assessing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of immunity to other respiratory viruses is also valuable. Here we demonstrate the capability of a fully automated prototype Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry system to perform reliable longitudinal serology against a 34-plex respiratory array. The array contains antigens for respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal influenza, common human coronaviruses, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. AIR measures a change in reflectivity due to the binding of serum antibodies to the antigens on the array. Samples were collected from convalescent COVID-19 donors and individuals vaccinated with a two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen. Vaccinated samples were collected prior to the first dose, one week after the first dose, one week after the second dose, and monthly thereafter. Information following booster dose and/or breakthrough infection is included for a subset of subjects. Longitudinal samples of vaccinated individuals demonstrate a rise and fall of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in agreement with general knowledge of the adaptive immune response and other studies. Linear Regression analysis was performed to understand the relationship between antibodies binding to different antigens on the array. Our analysis identified strong correlations between closely related influenza virus strains as well as correlations between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and human coronavirus 229E. A small test of using diluted whole blood from a fingerstick provided clean arrays with antibody binding comparable to serum. Potential applications include assessing immunity in the context of exposure to multiple respiratory viruses, clinical serology, population monitoring to facilitate public health recommendations, and vaccine development against new viruses and virus mutations.","['Klose AM', 'Kosoy G', 'Miller BL']",2023,18,2,PLoS One,"Klose AM, et al.

36747286,Using random forest to predict antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations of nontyphoidal Salmonella in Taiwan.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue and surveillance of AMR can be useful for understanding AMR trends and planning intervention strategies. Salmonella, widely distributed in food-producing animals, has been considered the first priority for inclusion in the AMR surveillance program by the World Health Organization (WHO). Recent advances in rapid and affordable whole-genome sequencing (WGS) techniques lead to the emergence of WGS as a one-stop test to predict the antimicrobial susceptibility. Since the variation of sequencing and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurement methods could result in different results, this study aimed to develop WGS-based random forest models for predicting MIC values of 24 drugs using data generated from the same laboratories in Taiwan. The WGS data have been transformed as a feature vector of 10-mers for machine learning. Based on rigorous validation and independent tests, a good performance was obtained with an average mean absolute error (MAE) less than 1 for both validation and independent test. Feature selection was then applied to identify top-ranked 10-mers that can further improve the prediction performance. For surveillance purposes, the genome sequence-based machine learning methods could be utilized to monitor the difference between predicted and experimental MIC, where a large difference might be worthy of investigation on the emerging genomic determinants.","['Wang CC', 'Hung YT', 'Chou CY', 'Hsuan SL', 'Chen ZW', 'Chang PY', 'Jan TR', 'Tung CW']",2023,54,1,Vet Res,"Wang CC, et al.

36744940,Single Amino Acid Substitution in the Receptor Binding Domain of Spike Protein Is Sufficient To Convert the Neutralization Profile between Ethiopian and Middle Eastern Isolates of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus that causes MERS, which is endemic in the Middle East. The absence of human cases in Africa despite the presence of MERS-CoV suggests virological differences between MERS-CoVs in Africa and the Middle East. In fact, in the laboratory, recombinant MERS-CoV carrying the spike (S) protein of Ethiopian isolates exhibits attenuated properties, being more easily neutralized and replicating slower than viruses carrying the S protein of Middle Eastern isolate, EMC. In this study, to identify the amino acids that define the different virological features between Ethiopian and Middle Eastern MERS-CoVs, neutralization titers and viral replication were evaluated using recombinant MERS-CoVs carrying amino acid substitution(s) in the S protein. A single amino acid difference introduced into the receptor binding domain was sufficient to reverse the difference in the neutralizing properties of the S protein between Ethiopian and Middle Eastern MERS-CoVs. Furthermore, amino acid mutations in the S1 and S2 regions of S protein were collectively involved in slow viral replication. Since even a single amino acid difference in S protein can reverse the viral properties of MERS-CoV, it should be noted that multiple mutations may induce a significant change. Careful monitoring of genetic alterations in MERS-CoVs in Africa is therefore required to detect the emergence of virulent strains generated by a few genetic differences.

Infections of human respiratory systems and other important organs by these pathogenic viruses often results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Efficient anti-viral drugs are needed. Herein, we firstly take SARS-CoV-2 as an example to present the molecular mechanism of CoV infection cycle, including the receptor binding, viral entry, intracellular replication, virion assembly, and release. Then according to their mode of action, we provide a summary of anti-viral peptides that have been reported in peer-reviewed publications. Even though CoVs can rapidly evolve to gain resistance to the conventional small molecule drugs, peptide-based inhibitors targeting various steps of CoV lifecycle remain a promising approach.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.
SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: In this fourth review update version, we included 33 RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on quality of life (MD 1.00, 95% CI -2.14 to 4.14; 1 RCT, 483 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have low certainty evidence for our primary outcomes. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","['Iannizzi C', 'Chai KL', 'Piechotta V', 'Valk SJ', 'Kimber C', 'Monsef I', 'Wood EM', 'Lamikanra AA', 'Roberts DJ', 'McQuilten Z', 'So-Osman C', 'Jindal A', 'Cryns N', 'Estcourt LJ', 'Kreuzberger N', 'Skoetz N']",2023,2,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Iannizzi C, et al.

36717455,Biology of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus.,"New coronavirus infection causing COVID-19, which was first reported in late 2019 in China, initiated severe social and economic crisis that affected the whole world. High frequency of the errors in replication of RNA viruses, zoonotic nature of transmission, and high transmissibility allowed betacoronaviruses to cause the third pandemic in the world since the beginning of 2003: SARS-CoV in 2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. The latest pandemic united scientific community and served as a powerful impetus in the study of biology of coronaviruses: new routes of virus penetration into the human cells were identified, features of the replication cycle were studied, and new functions of coronavirus proteins were elucidated. It should be recognized that the pandemic was accompanied by the need to obtain and publish results within a short time, which led to the emergence of an array of conflicting data and low reproducibility of research results. We systematized and analyzed scientific literature, filtered the results according to reliability of the methods of analysis used, and prepared a review describing molecular mechanisms of functioning of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. This review considers organization of the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mechanisms of its gene expression and entry of the virus into the cell, provides information on key mutations that characterize different variants of the virus, and their contribution to pathogenesis of the disease.","['Mingaleeva RN', 'Nigmatulina NA', 'Sharafetdinova LM', 'Romozanova AM', 'Gabdoulkhakova AG', 'Filina YV', 'Shavaliyev RF', 'Rizvanov AA', 'Miftakhova RR']",2022,87,12,Biochemistry (Mosc),"Mingaleeva RN, et al.

36709255,The prevalence of mental ill-health in women during pregnancy and after childbirth during the Covid-19 pandemic: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of the impact of the COVID-19, MERS, and SARS pandemics on the mental health of pregnant women.
METHODS: All COVID-19, SARS and MERS studies that evaluated the mental health of pregnant women with/without gynaecological conditions that were reported in English between December 2000 - July 2021 were included. The search criteria were developed based upon the research question using PubMed, Science Direct, Ovid PsycINFO and EMBASE databases. A wide search criterion was used to ensure the inclusion of all pregnant women with existing gynaecological conditions. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale was used to assess the risk of bias for all included studies. Random effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied for the meta-analysis and I-square statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity across studies. The pooled prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, stress, and sleep disorders with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed.
RESULTS: This systematic review identified 217 studies which included 638,889 pregnant women or women who had just given birth. There were no studies reporting the mental health impact due to MERS and SARS. Results showed that women who were pregnant or had just given birth displayed various symptoms of poor mental health including those relating to depression (24.9%), anxiety (32.8%), stress (29.44%), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (27.93%), and sleep disorders (24.38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION: It is important to note that studies included in this review used a range of outcome measures which does not allow for direct comparisons between findings. Most studies reported self-reported measure of symptoms without clinical diagnoses so conclusions can be made for symptom prevalence rather than of mental illness.

However, it remains unclear why they perform better than previous methods that rely on k-mers and position weight matrices. Here, we highlight a recent deep learning-based software package, called ResidualBind, that analyzes RNA-protein interactions using only RNA sequence as an input feature and performs global importance analysis for model interpretability. We discuss practical considerations for model interpretability to uncover learned sequence motifs and their secondary structure preferences.","['Koo PK', 'Ploenzke M', 'Anand P', 'Paul S', 'Majdandzic A']",2023,2586,,Methods Mol Biol,"Koo PK, et al.

36700518,Hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hIVIG) contains polyclonal antibodies, which can be prepared from large amounts of pooled convalescent plasma or prepared from animal sources through immunisation. They are being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review was previously part of a parent review addressing convalescent plasma and hIVIG for people with COVID-19 and was split to address hIVIG and convalescent plasma separately.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of hIVIG therapy for the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.
SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Research Database, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform and Medline and Embase from 1 January 2019 onwards. We carried out searches on 31 March 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated hIVIG for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies that evaluated standard immunoglobulin.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used RoB 2. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), quality of life, adverse events, and serious adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with 947 participants, of whom 688 received hIVIG prepared from humans, 18 received heterologous swine glyco-humanised polyclonal antibody, and 241 received equine-derived processed and purified F(ab')
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We included data from five RCTs that evaluated hIVIG compared to standard therapy, with participants with moderate-to-severe disease. As the studies evaluated different preparations (from humans or from various animals) and doses, we could not pool them. hIVIG prepared from humans may have little to no impact on mortality, and clinical improvement and worsening. hIVIG may increase grade 3-4 adverse events. Studies did not evaluate quality of life.

36698762,Porechop_ABI: discovering unknown adapters in Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing reads for downstream trimming.,"MOTIVATION: Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has become very popular over the past few years and offers a cost-effective solution for many genomic and transcriptomic projects. One distinctive feature of the technology is that the protocol includes the ligation of adapters to both ends of each fragment. Those adapters should then be removed before downstream analyses, either during the basecalling step or by explicit trimming. This basic task may be tricky when the definition of the adapter sequence is not well documented.
RESULTS: We have developed a new method to scan a set of ONT reads to see if it contains adapters, without any prior knowledge on the sequence of the potential adapters, and then trim out those adapters. The algorithm is based on approximate

Timeliness, a key metric in epidemic response, can be examined to identify critical steps and delays in public health action.AimTo examine timeliness, we analysed the response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic, with a focus on the international and One Health response efforts.MethodsWe performed a historical review of the MERS epidemic between September 2012 and January 2019 in three steps: (i) the construction of a timeline identifying critical events in the global response, (ii) the performance of a critical path analysis to define outbreak milestones and (iii) a time gap analysis to measure timeliness in the execution of these milestones.ResultsWe proposed 14 MERS-specific milestones at different phases of the epidemic, assessing timeliness of the public health response as well as at the animal-human interface, where we identified the most significant delays.ConclusionsWhen comparing timeliness across three coronavirus epidemics, i.e. MERS (2012), SARS (2002) and COVID-19 (2019), we identified clear improvements over time for certain milestones including laboratory confirmation and diagnostics development, while this was not as apparent for others, as the identification of zoonotic hosts. To more efficiently respond to emerging threats, the global health community should widely assess and tackle specific delays in implementing response interventions by addressing challenges in the sharing of information, data and resources, as well as efficiency, quality, transparency and reliability of reporting events.","['Dos S Ribeiro C', 'van Roode M', 'Farag E', 'Nour M', 'Moustafa A', 'Ahmed M', 'Haringhuizen G', 'Koopmans M', 'van de Burgwal L']",2022,27,48,Euro Surveill,"Dos S Ribeiro C, et al.

36691475,[French research organization on emerging infectious diseases: From REACTing to ANRS emerging infectious diseases].,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) can be responsible for epidemics or even pandemics that disrupt societies and cause national and international crises. In our globalized world, anarchic urbanization, ecosystem disruptions (deforestation, creation of dams…), changes in crop and livestock farming conditions, the increasing availability of air transport, population displacement and climate change are all factors that favor the occurrence and spread of emerging or re-emerging pathogens such as SARS-Cov, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, influenza, or more recently SARS-CoV-2 and Monkeypox. States, regional and international organizations, health and research agencies, non-governmental organizations and the pharmaceutical industry are today challenged by the repetition of these crises and their consequences on health, social, economic and political balances. For the past fifteen years, we have clearly been in a new regime of infectious emergence and re-emergence. This new regime calls for new responses, to meet in the urgency the challenges of emergency epidemic crises and to better respond to the issues of crisis management in a context of ""One Health"". Research is an essential pillar in the response to these epidemics with a double challenge: (i) to improve knowledge on the disease, its prevention, treatment, diagnosis, impact on society. and (ii) to prepare for and understand future emergencies, ""anticipate"".

36690780,"Comparative susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV across mammals.","Exploring wild reservoirs of pathogenic viruses is critical for their long-term control and for predicting future pandemic scenarios. Here, a comparative in vitro infection analysis was first performed on 83 cell cultures derived from 55 mammalian species using pseudotyped viruses bearing S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Cell cultures from Thomas's horseshoe bats, king horseshoe bats, green monkeys, and ferrets were found to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. Moreover, five variants (del69-70, D80Y, S98F, T572I, and Q675H), that beside spike receptor-binding domain can significantly alter the host tropism of SARS-CoV-2. An examination of phylogenetic signals of transduction rates revealed that closely related taxa generally have similar susceptibility to MERS-CoV but not to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. Additionally, we discovered that the expression of 95 genes, e.g., PZDK1 and APOBEC3, were commonly associated with the transduction rates of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. This study provides basic documentation of the susceptibility, variants, and molecules that underlie the cross-species transmission of these coronaviruses.","['Li M', 'Du J', 'Liu W', 'Li Z', 'Lv F', 'Hu C', 'Dai Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu G', 'Pan Q', 'Yu Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhu P', 'Tan X', 'Garber PA', 'Zhou X']",2023,17,4,ISME J,"Li M, et al.

36683958,A new One Health Framework in Qatar for future emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases preparedness and response.,"One Health is increasingly recognized as an optimal approach to address the global risk of health threats originating at the human, animal, and ecosystem interface, and their impact. Qatar has successfully practiced One Health approach for investigation and surveillance of zoonotic diseases such as MERS-CoV, and other health threats. However, the current gaps at institution and policy level hinder the sustainment of One Health. In this paper, we have assessed the potential for implementation of One Health Framework to reinforce and sustain One Health capacities in Qatar for 2022-2027. To implement One Health Framework in the country, Qatar Joint External Evaluation (JEE) report, lessons learnt during One Health experiences on zoonotic, vector-borne, and food borne diseases were used to present an outline for multisectoral coordination. In addition, technical capacities of One Health and factors that are required to operationalize it in the country were also assessed in series of meetings and workshops held at Ministry of Public Health on March 2022. Present health care infrastructure and resources were found to be conducive for effective management and response to shared health threats as evident during MERS-CoV, despite being more event based. Regardless, the need for more sustainable capacity development was unanimously emphasized. The consensus between all relevant stakeholders and partners was that there is a need for better communication channels, policies and protocols for data sharing, and the need to invest more resources for better sustainability. The proposed framework is expected to strengthen and facilitate multilateral coordination, enhanced laboratory capacity and network, improve active surveillance and response, risk communication, community engagement, maximize applied research, and build One Health technical work force. This would enable advancement and sustainment of One Health activities to prevent and control health threats shared between humans-animals-ecosystem interface.","['Bansal D', 'Jaffrey S', 'Al-Emadi NA', 'Hassan M', 'Islam MM', 'Al-Baker WAA', 'Radwan E', 'Hamdani D', 'Haroun MI', 'Enan K', 'Nour M', 'Coyle PV', 'Al Marri A', 'Al-Zeyara AA', 'Younus NM', 'Yassine HM', 'Al Thani AA', 'Darkhshan F', 'Khalid M', 'Marhous H', 'Tibbo M', 'Alhosani M', 'Taha T', 'Wannous C', 'Al Hajri M', 'Bertollini R', 'Al-Maslamani MA', 'Al Khal A', 'Al Romaihi HE', 'Al Thani SMBHBJ', 'El Idrissi A', 'Farag EA']",2023,16,,One Health,"Bansal D, et al.

With a wide distribution around the world, HCoVs are usually associated with mild respiratory disease. In the elderly, young children and immunocompromised patients, more severe or even fatal respiratory infections may be observed. In Africa, data on seasonal HCoV are scarce. This retrospective study investigated the epidemiology and genetic diversity of seasonal HCoVs during nine consecutive years of influenza-like illness surveillance in Senegal. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from ILI outpatients or from SARI hospitalized patients. HCoVs were diagnosed by qRT-PCR and the positive samples were selected for molecular characterization. Among 9337 samples tested for HCoV, 406 (4.3%) were positive: 235 (57.9%) OC43, 102 (25.1%) NL63, 58 (14.3%) 229E and 17 (4.2%) HKU1. The four types circulated during the study period and a peak was noted between November and January. Children under five were the most affected. Co-infections were observed between HCoV types (1.2%) or with other viruses (76.1%). Genetically, HCoVs types showed diversity. The results highlighted that the impact of HCoVs must be taken into account in public health; monitoring them is therefore particularly necessary both in the most sensitive populations and in animals.","['Faye MN', 'Barry MA', 'Jallow MM', 'Wade SF', 'Mendy MP', 'Sy S', 'Fall A', 'Kiori DE', 'Ndiaye NK', 'Goudiaby D', 'Diamanka A', 'Niang MN', 'Dia N']",2022,15,1,Viruses,"Faye MN, et al.

36680018,Human Coronavirus Cell Receptors Provide Challenging Therapeutic Targets.,"Coronaviruses interact with protein or carbohydrate receptors through their spike proteins to infect cells. Even if the known protein receptors for these viruses have no evolutionary relationships, they do share ontological commonalities that the virus might leverage to exacerbate the pathophysiology. ANPEP/CD13, DPP IV/CD26, and ACE2 are the three protein receptors that are known to be exploited by several human coronaviruses. These receptors are moonlighting enzymes involved in several physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, and blood pressure regulation; moreover, the three proteins are expressed in kidney, intestine, endothelium, and other tissues/cell types. Here, we spot the commonalities between the three enzymes, the physiological functions of the enzymes are outlined, and how blocking either enzyme results in systemic deregulations and multi-organ failures via viral infection or therapeutic interventions is addressed. It can be difficult to pinpoint any coronavirus as the target when creating a medication to fight them, due to the multiple processes that receptors are linked to and their extensive expression.","['López-Cortés GI', 'Palacios-Pérez M', 'Hernández-Aguilar MM', 'Veledíaz HF', 'José MV']",2023,11,1,Vaccines (Basel),"López-Cortés GI, et al.

It is in the order Nidovirales, suborder Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and sub-genus Sarbecovirus (lineage B), together with two bat-derived strains with a 96% genomic homology with other bat coronaviruses (BatCoVand RaTG13). Thus far, two Alphacoronavirus strains, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, along with five Betacoronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have been recognized as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than six million deaths worldwide since late 2019. The appearance of this novel virus is defined by its high and variable transmission rate (RT) and coexisting asymptomatic and symptomatic propagation within and across animal populations, which has a longer-lasting impact. Most current therapeutic methods aim to reduce the severity of COVID-19 hospitalization and virus symptoms, preventing the infection from progressing from acute to chronic in vulnerable populations. Now, pharmacological interventions including vaccines and others exist, with research ongoing. The only ethical approach to developing herd immunity is to develop and provide vaccines and therapeutics that can potentially improve on the innate and adaptive system responses at the same time. Therefore, several vaccines have been developed to provide acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19-disease. The initial evaluations of the COVID-19 vaccines began in around 2020, followed by clinical trials carried out during the pandemic with ongoing population adverse effect monitoring by respective regulatory agencies. Therefore, durability and immunity provided by current vaccines requires further characterization with more extensive available data, as is presented in this paper. When utilized globally, these vaccines may create an unidentified pattern of antibody responses or memory B and T cell responses that need to be further researched, some of which can now be compared within laboratory and population studies here. Several COVID-19 vaccine immunogens have been presented in clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy, inducing cellular antibody production through cellular B and T cell interactions that protect against infection. This response is defined by virus-specific antibodies (anti-N or anti-S antibodies), with B and T cell characterization undergoing extensive research. In this article, we review four types of contemporary COVID-19 vaccines, comparing their antibody profiles and cellular aspects involved in coronavirus immunology across several population studies.","['Al-Sheboul SA', 'Brown B', 'Shboul Y', 'Fricke I', 'Imarogbe C', 'Alzoubi KH']",2022,11,1,Vaccines (Basel),"Al-Sheboul SA, et al.

Further analysis revealed that the pathogenic strain of virus was corona but it was distinct from other coronavirus strains, and thus it was renamed 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2. This coronavirus shares many characteristics with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The clinical manifestations raised in the form of a cytokine storm trigger a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes that include cardiovascular, kidney, and liver problems. The lack of an effective treatment strategy has imposed a health and socio-economic burden. Even though the mortality rate of patients with this disease is lower, since it is judged to be the most contagious, it is considered more lethal. Globally, the researchers are continuously engaged to develop and identify possible preventive and therapeutic regimens for the management of disease. Notably, to combat SARS-CoV-2, various vaccine types have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials; these have also been used as a health emergency during a pandemic. Despite this, many old antiviral and other drugs (such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and so on) are still used in various countries as emergency medicine. Plant-based products have been reported to be safe as alternative options for several infectious and non-infectious diseases, as many of them showed chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects in the case of tuberculosis, cancer, malaria, diabetes, cardiac problems, and others. Therefore, plant-derived products may play crucial roles in improving health for a variety of ailments by providing a variety of effective cures.

According to the World Health Organization reports, more than 645 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and more than 6.5 million confirmed deaths were noted all over the world during the pandemic (between December 2020 and December 2022). Although SARS-CoV-2 is a virus belonging to the coronavirus family, our knowledge of the pathogenesis and immune response of SARS-CoV-2 is still limited. Approximately 10 years (2012) after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (nearly 2200 confirmed cases and 791 confirmed deaths) and 20 years (2002-2004) after the SARS-CoV epidemic (29 different countries, nearly 8000 confirmed cases, and 774 confirmed deaths), the current COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder of how new pathogens can emerge and spread rapidly, eventually causing serious public health problems.

36650897,Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV fusion peptides measured using single-molecule force methods.,"We address the challenge of understanding how hydrophobic interactions are encoded by fusion peptide (FP) sequences within coronavirus (CoV) spike proteins. Within the FPs of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), a largely conserved peptide sequence called FP1 (SFIEDLLFNK and SAIEDLLFDK in SARS-2 and MERS, respectively) has been proposed to play a key role in encoding hydrophobic interactions that drive viral-host cell membrane fusion. Although a non-polar triad (Leu-Leu-Phe (LLF)) is common to both FP1 sequences, and thought to dominate the encoding of hydrophobic interactions, FP1 from SARS-2 and MERS differ in two residues (Phe 2 versus Ala 2 and Asn 9 versus Asp 9, respectively). Here we explore whether single-molecule force measurements can quantify hydrophobic interactions encoded by FP1 sequences, and then ask whether sequence variations between FP1 from SARS-2 and MERS lead to significant differences in hydrophobic interactions. We find that both SARS-2 and MERS wild-type FP1 generate measurable hydrophobic interactions at the single-molecule level, but that SARS-2 FP1 encodes a substantially stronger hydrophobic interaction than its MERS counterpart (1.91 ± 0.03 nN versus 0.68 ± 0.03 nN, respectively). By performing force measurements with FP1 sequences with single amino acid substitutions, we determine that a single-residue mutation (Phe 2 versus Ala 2) causes the almost threefold difference in the hydrophobic interaction strength generated by the FP1 of SARS-2 versus MERS, despite the presence of LLF in both sequences. Infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements support the proposal that the outsized influence of Phe 2 versus Ala 2 on the hydrophobic interaction arises from variation in the secondary structure adopted by FP1. Overall, these insights reveal how single-residue diversity in viral FPs, including FP1 of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, can lead to substantial changes in intermolecular interactions proposed to play a key role in viral fusion, and hint at strategies for regulating hydrophobic interactions of peptides in a range of contexts.","['Qiu C', 'Whittaker GR', 'Gellman SH', 'Daniel S', 'Abbott NL']",2023,122,4,Biophys J,"Qiu C, et al.

36625656,SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Lung Edema and Replication Are Diminished by Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Modulators.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) of genera α, β, γ, and δ encode proteins that have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) consisting of the last four residues of the envelope (E) protein (PBM core). PBMs may bind over 400 cellular proteins containing PDZ domains (an acronym formed by the combination of the first letter of the names of the three first proteins where this domain was identified), making them relevant for the control of cell function. Three highly pathogenic human CoVs have been identified to date: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. The PBMs of the three CoVs were virulence factors. SARS-CoV mutants in which the E protein PBM core was replaced by the E protein PBM core from virulent or attenuated CoVs were constructed. These mutants showed a gradient of virulence, depending on whether the alternative PBM core introduced was derived from a virulent or an attenuated CoV. Gene expression patterns in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs encoding each of the different PBMs were analyzed by RNA sequencing of infected lung tissues. E protein PBM of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 dysregulated gene expression related to ion transport and cell homeostasis. Decreased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mRNA, essential for alveolar edema resolution, was shown. Reduced CFTR mRNA levels were associated with edema accumulation in the alveoli of mice infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Compounds that increased CFTR expression and activity, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 growth in cultured cells and protected against mouse infection, suggesting that E protein virulence is mediated by a decreased CFTR expression.

Initially, a mathematical form is given to the dynamics of the disease while incorporating some unpredictable factors. The study of the underlying model shows the existence of positive global solution. Formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the paper will also explore parametric conditions which will lead to the extinction of the disease from a community. Moreover, to reveal that the infection will persist, ergodic stationary distribution will be carried out. It will also be shown that a threshold quantity exists, which will determine some essential parameters for exploring other dynamical aspects of the main model. With the addition of some examples, the underlying stochastic model of MERS-Cov will be studied graphically for more illustration.","['Hussain S', 'Tunç O', 'Rahman GU', 'Khan H', 'Nadia E']",2023,207,,Math Comput Simul,"Hussain S, et al.

36618428,Monoclonal antibodies constructed from COVID-19 convalescent memory B cells exhibit potent binding activity to MERS-CoV spike S2 subunit and other human coronaviruses.,"INTRODUCTION: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are two highly contagious coronaviruses causing MERS and COVID-19, respectively, without an effective antiviral drug and a long-lasting vaccine. Approaches for diagnosis, therapeutics, prevention, etc., particularly for SARS-CoV-2 that is continually spreading and evolving, are urgently needed. Our previous study discovered that >60% of sera from convalescent COVID-19 individuals, but <8% from general population, showed binding activity against the MERS-CoV spike protein, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted antibodies cross-reactive with MERS-CoV.
METHODS: To generate antibodies specific to both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, here we screened 60 COVID-19 convalescent sera against MERS-CoV spike extracellular domain and S1 and S2 subunits. We constructed and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from COVID-19 convalescent memory B cells and examined their binding and neutralizing activities against human coronaviruses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of 60 convalescent serum samples, 34 showed binding activity against MERS-CoV S2, with endpoint titers positively correlated with the titers to SARS-CoV-2 S2. By sorting single memory B cells from COVID-19 convalescents, we constructed 38 mAbs and found that 11 mAbs showed binding activity with MERS-CoV S2, of which 9 mAbs showed potent cross-reactivity with all or a proportion of spike proteins of alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, OC43, and HKU1). Moreover, 5 mAbs also showed weak neutralization efficiency against MERS-CoV spike pseudovirus. Epitope analysis revealed that 3 and 8 mAbs bound to linear and conformational epitopes in MERS-CoV S2, respectively. In summary, we have constructed a panel of antibodies with broad-spectrum reactivity against all seven human coronaviruses, thus facilitating the development of diagnosis methods and vaccine design for multiple coronaviruses.","['Peng Y', 'Liu Y', 'Hu Y', 'Chang F', 'Wu Q', 'Yang J', 'Chen J', 'Teng S', 'Zhang J', 'He R', 'Wei Y', 'Bostina M', 'Luo T', 'Liu W', 'Qu X', 'Li YP']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Peng Y, et al.

Four dimensional computed tomography(4DCT) and F-18 Fluorocholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FCH PET/CT) localize adenomas accurately to perform MIP. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and metanalysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 4DCT and FCH PET/CT scan for quadrant wise localisation in PHPT patients and to do head-to-head comparison between these two modalities. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENT : After searching through PubMed and EMBASE databases, 46 studies (using histology as a gold standard) of 4DCT and FCH PET/CT were included. RESULTS: Total number of patients included were 1651 and 952 for 4DCT scan (studies n = 26) and FCH PET/CT scan (studies n = 24) respectively. In per patient analysis, FCH PET/CT and 4DCT had pooled sensitivities of 92% (88-94) and 85% (73-92) respectively and in per lesion analysis, 90% (86-93) and 79% (71-84), respectively. In the subgroup with negative conventional imaging/persistent PHPT, FCH PET/CT had comparable sensitivity to 4DCT (84% [74-90] vs. 72% [46-88]). As per patient wise analysis, FCH PET/CT had better detection rates than 4DCT ([92.4 vs. 76.85], odds ratio -3.89 [1.6-9.36] p = .0024) in the subpopulation where both FCH PET/CT and 4DCT were reported. CONCLUSION: Both 4DCT and FCH PET/CT scan performed well in newly diagnosed patients, patients with persistent disease and in those with inconclusive conventional imaging results. FCH PET/CT scan had a higher pooled sensitivity than 4DCT in detecting patients with PHPT in head to head comparison.","['Patel DD', 'Bhattacharjee S', 'Pandey AK', 'Kopp CR', 'Ashwathanarayana AG', 'Patel HV', 'Barnabas R', 'Bhadada SK', 'Dodamani MH']",2023,99,3,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),"Patel DD, et al.

Additionally, most profilers focus mainly on bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations, while less attention is paid to viral communities.
RESULTS: We present KMCP (K-mer-based Metagenomic Classification and Profiling), a novel k-mer-based metagenomic profiling tool that utilizes genome coverage information by splitting the reference genomes into chunks and stores k-mers in a modified and optimized Compact Bit-Sliced Signature Index for fast alignment-free sequence searching. KMCP combines k-mer similarity and genome coverage information to reduce the false positive rate of k-mer-based taxonomic classification and profiling methods. Benchmarking results based on simulated and real data demonstrate that KMCP, despite a longer running time than all other methods, not only allows the accurate taxonomic profiling of prokaryotic and viral populations but also provides more confident pathogen detection in clinical samples of low depth.

36576129,Accurate and fast clade assignment via deep learning and frequency chaos game representation.,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there has been an explosion of sequencing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus; most notably, the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade.
RESULTS: In this article, we leverage the frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieved an $96.29\%$ overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a $77,12\%$ overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using deep learning and FCGR for intraspecies classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods, CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that match SARS-CoV-2 marker variants.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on random forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.

36563641,"Novel type-I interferons from the dromedary camel: Molecular identification, prokaryotic expression and functional characterization of camelid interferon-delta.","The last two decades have seen the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses with zoonotic origins, which prompted immediate attention to the underlying cause and prevention of future outbreaks. Intensification of camel husbandry in the Middle East has resulted in increased human-camel interactions, which has led to the spread of potentially zoonotic viruses with human spillover risks like MERS-coronavirus, camelpox virus, etc. Type-I interferons function as the first line of defense against invading viruses and are pivotal for limiting viral replication and immune-mediated pathologies. Seven novel dromedary camel interferon delta genes were identified and cloned. Functional characterization of this novel class of IFNs from the mammalian suborder tylopoda is reported for the first time. The camel interferon-delta proteins resemble the reported mammalian counterparts in sequence similarity, conservation of cysteines, and phylogenetic proximity. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant camel interferon-δ1 induced IFN-stimulated gene expression and also exerted antiviral action against camelpox virus, an endemic zoonotic virus. The pre-treatment of camel kidney cells with recombinant camel IFN-δ1 increased cell survival and reduced camelpox virus in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of novel IFNs from species with zoonotic spillover risk such as camels, and evaluating their antiviral effects in-vitro will play a key role in improving immunotherapies against viruses and expanding the arsenal to combat emerging zoonotic pathogens.","['Premraj A', 'Aleyas AG', 'Nautiyal B', 'Rasool TJ']",2023,153,,Mol Immunol,"Premraj A, et al.

Given the reactive management of the pandemic, it is necessary to reflect on, and answer, the question as to which good practices (interventions) were implemented in care homes (population) to improve management and care quality (outcomes). This systematic review aimed to identify and describe good practices adopted in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic or other recent epidemics. We conducted searches in Embase, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest Central, and Scopus over the period 1-30 November, 2021, using the descriptors ""nursing homes"", ""long-term care"", ""long-term care facilities"" and ""COVID-19""; and the keywords ""learnings"", ""lessons"", ""positive learnings"", ""positive lessons"", ""SARS"", ""MERS"", ""COVID-19"" and ""pandemic"". We identified 15 papers describing 14 best practices and 26 specific actions taken for COVID-19 management in long-term care facilities. Following the IDEF methodology, the practices were classified into strategic processes (staff training, communication with the national health system, person-centered care, and protocols), operational processes (cohorts, diagnostic testing, case monitoring, personal protective equipment, staff reinforcement, restriction of visits, social distancing, and alternative means for communication with families) and support processes (provision of equipment and hygiene reinforcement). Fifty percent of practices were likely to be maintained beyond the outbreak to improve the operation and quality of the long-term care facilities.

36551110,Conducting Polymer-Infused Electrospun Fibre Mat Modified by POEGMA Brushes as Antifouling Biointerface.,"Biofouling on surfaces, caused by the assimilation of proteins, peptides, lipids and microorganisms, leads to contamination, deterioration and failure of biomedical devices and causes implants rejection. To address these issues, various antifouling strategies have been extensively studied, including polyethylene glycol-based polymer brushes. Conducting polymers-based biointerfaces have emerged as advanced surfaces for interfacing biological tissues and organs with electronics. Antifouling of such biointerfaces is a challenge. In this study, we fabricated electrospun fibre mats from sulphonated polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (sSEBS), infused with conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (sSEBS-PEDOT), to produce a conductive (2.06 ± 0.1 S/cm), highly porous, fibre mat that can be used as a biointerface in bioelectronic applications. To afford antifouling, here the poly(oligo (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA) brushes were grafted onto the sSEBS-PEDOT conducting fibre mats via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization technique (SI-ATRP). For that, a copolymer of EDOT and an EDOT derivative with SI-ATRP initiating sites, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) methyl 2-bromopropanoate (EDOTBr), was firstly electropolymerized on the sSEBS-PEDOT fibre mat to provide sSEBS-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-EDOTBr). The POEGMA brushes were grafted from the sSEBS-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-EDOTBr) and the polymerization kinetics confirmed the successful growth of the brushes. Fibre mats with 10-mers and 30-mers POEGMA brushes were studied for antifouling using a BCA protein assay. The mats with 30-mers grafted brushes exhibited excellent antifouling efficiency, ~82% of proteins repelled, compared to the pristine sSEBS-PEDOT fibre mat. The grafted fibre mats exhibited cell viability >80%, comparable to the standard cell culture plate controls. Such conducting, porous biointerfaces with POEGMA grafted brushes are suitable for applications in various biomedical devices, including biosensors, liquid biopsy, wound healing substrates and drug delivery systems.","['Ashraf J', 'Lau S', 'Akbarinejad A', 'Evans CW', 'Williams DE', 'Barker D', 'Travas-Sejdic J']",2022,12,12,Biosensors (Basel),"Ashraf J, et al.

36548304,Ubiquitin variants potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and viral replication via a novel site distal to the protease active site.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has made it clear that combating coronavirus outbreaks benefits from a combination of vaccines and therapeutics. A promising drug target common to all coronaviruses-including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2-is the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro cleaves part of the viral replicase polyproteins into non-structural protein subunits, which are essential to the viral replication cycle. Additionally, PLpro can cleave both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 from host cell substrates as a mechanism to evade innate immune responses during infection. These roles make PLpro an attractive antiviral drug target. Here we demonstrate that ubiquitin variants (UbVs) can be selected from a phage-displayed library and used to specifically and potently block SARS-CoV-2 PLpro activity. A crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with a representative UbV reveals a dimeric UbV bound to PLpro at a site distal to the catalytic site. Yet, the UbV inhibits the essential cleavage activities of the protease in vitro and in cells, and it reduces viral replication in cell culture by almost five orders of magnitude.","['van Vliet VJE', 'Huynh N', 'Palà J', 'Patel A', 'Singer A', 'Slater C', 'Chung J', 'van Huizen M', 'Teyra J', 'Miersch S', 'Luu GK', 'Ye W', 'Sharma N', 'Ganaie SS', 'Russell R', 'Chen C', 'Maynard M', 'Amarasinghe GK', 'Mark BL', 'Kikkert M', 'Sidhu SS']",2022,18,12,PLoS Pathog,"van Vliet VJE, et al.

Saudi Arabia reported the majority of these cases, with 2,184 cases and 813 deaths (CFR: 37.2%), necessitating a thorough understanding of the molecular machinery of MERS-CoV. To develop antiviral medicines, illustrative investigation of the protein in coronavirus subunits are required to increase our understanding of the subject.

Subsequent large-scale studies involving children confirmed the occurrence of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection also among paediatric patients, especially in the context of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS). At this regard, we report the challenging case of a 10-month-old baby with PIMS-TS complicated by acute cerebral oedema successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids and anakinra. Our results, combined with the evidence of larger case series suggest that higher inflammatory burden is more frequent in patients with neuro PIMS-TS. As regards neuroimaging, neuroimmune disorders are found to be more common during acute COVID-19, MERS is more frequent during PIMS-TS. Distinct immune mechanisms may underlie these different types of neurological involvement, which are yet to be understood. Further studies are required to better define the physiopathology of neuro PIMS-TS and its possible therapeutical implications.","['Scarcella A', 'Mastrolia MV', 'Marrani E', 'Maccora I', 'Pagnini I', 'Simonini G']",2022,14,,Ther Adv Musculoskelet Dis,"Scarcella A, et al.

36532264,Physico-Chemical Mechanisms of the Functioning of Membrane-Active Proteins of Enveloped Viruses.,"Over the past few years, the attention of the whole world has been riveted to the emergence of new dangerous strains of viruses, among which a special place is occupied by coronaviruses that have overcome the interspecies barrier in the past 20 years: SARS viruses (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as a new coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the largest pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918. Coronaviruses are members of a class of enveloped viruses that have a lipoprotein envelope. This class also includes such serious pathogens as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, Ebola virus, influenza, etc. Despite significant differences in the clinical picture of the course of disease caused by enveloped viruses, they themselves have a number of characteristic features, which determine their commonality. Regardless of the way of penetration into the cell-by endocytosis or direct fusion with the cell membrane-enveloped viruses are characterized by the following stages of interaction with the target cell: binding to receptors on the cell surface, interaction of the surface glycoproteins of the virus with the membrane structures of the infected cell, fusion of the lipid envelope of the virion with plasma or endosomal membrane, destruction of the protein capsid and its dissociation from the viral nucleoprotein. Subsequently, within the infected cell, the newly synthesized viral proteins must self-assemble on various membrane structures to form a progeny virion. Thus, both the initial stages of viral infection and the assembly and release of new viral particles are associated with the activity of viral proteins in relation to the cell membrane and its organelles. This review is devoted to the analysis of physicochemical mechanisms of functioning of the main structural proteins of a number of enveloped viruses in order to identify possible strategies for the membrane activity of such proteins at various stages of viral infection of the cell.",['Batishchev OV'],2022,16,4,Biochem (Mosc) Suppl Ser A Membr Cell Biol,Batishchev OV.

We aim to summarize common imaging findings of 3 betacoronaviruses (b-CoVs) and the common clinical manifestation, to provide a better understanding of the courses of the disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched for the terms ""SARS-CoV"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""MERS-CoV"". Imaging-specific searches included keyword searches for ""CT"" AND ""imaging"". Clinical presentation-specific searches included keyword searches for ""clinical"" AND ""manifestation"" AND ""cardio-vascular"" OR ""neurology"" OR ""gastrointestinal"" OR ""hematology"". In total, 77 articles were selected for discussion in the current literature review.
RESULTS: Human b-CoVs infection presented consistent indications of ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening. Pleural effusion was also common in all 3 b-CoVs, but it was least present in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bilateral lung involvement was common to both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiovascular, neurological, haematological, and gastrointestinal were common clinical presentations found in patients infected with b-CoVs.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of imaging findings can be applied in clinical practice to distinguish the 3 CoV through different imaging modalities.

36525447,Classification of bacterial plasmid and chromosome derived sequences using machine learning.,"Plasmids are important genetic elements that facilitate horizonal gene transfer between bacteria and contribute to the spread of virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Most bacterial genome sequences in the public archives exist in draft form with many contigs, making it difficult to determine if a contig is of chromosomal or plasmid origin. Using a training set of contigs comprising 10,584 chromosomes and 10,654 plasmids from the PATRIC database, we evaluated several machine learning models including random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, and a neural network for their ability to classify chromosomal and plasmid sequences using nucleotide k-mers as features. Based on the methods tested, a neural network model that used nucleotide 6-mers as features that was trained on randomly selected chromosomal and plasmid subsequences 5kb in length achieved the best performance, outperforming existing out-of-the-box methods, with an average accuracy of 89.38% ± 2.16% over a 10-fold cross validation. The model accuracy can be improved to 92.08% by using a voting strategy when classifying holdout sequences. In both plasmids and chromosomes, subsequences encoding functions involved in horizontal gene transfer-including hypothetical proteins, transporters, phage, mobile elements, and CRISPR elements-were most likely to be misclassified by the model. This study provides a straightforward approach for identifying plasmid-encoding sequences in short read assemblies without the need for sequence alignment-based tools.","['Zou X', 'Nguyen M', 'Overbeek J', 'Cao B', 'Davis JJ']",2022,17,12,PLoS One,"Zou X, et al.

However, current aerosol collection and detection technologies may be limited to on-field use for real-time monitoring because of the relatively low concentrations of targeted bioaerosols in air samples. Microfluidic devices have been used as lab-on-a-chip platforms and exhibit outstanding capabilities in airborne particulate collection, sample processing, and target molecule analysis, thereby highlighting their potential for on-site bioaerosol monitoring. This review discusses the measurement of airborne microorganisms from air samples, including sources and transmission of bioaerosols, sampling strategies, and analytical methodologies. Recent advancements in microfluidic platforms have focused on bioaerosol sample preparation strategies, such as sorting, concentrating, and extracting, as well as rapid and field-deployable detection methods for analytes on microfluidic chips. Furthermore, we discuss an integrated platform for on-site bioaerosol analyses.

They harbour harmful viruses which can spread easily. In the recent times we have seen pandemic like situations being created as a result of the spread of deadly and fatal viruses. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the wellrecognized groups of viruses. There are four known genera of Coronavirus family namely, alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ). Animals have been infected with CoVs belonging to all four genera.

We are currently in another pandemic like situation created due to the uncontrolled spread of a similar coronavirus namely SARSCoV-2. These findings are based on a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can transmit disease to humans. Several mammals, including cats, dogs, bank voles, ferrets, fruit bats, hamsters, mink, pigs, rabbits, racoon dogs, and white-tailed deer, have been found to be infected naturally by the virus. Certain laboratory discoveries revealed that animals such as cats, ferrets, fruit bats, hamsters, racoon dogs, and white-tailed deer can spread the illness to other animals of the same species.

36500379,Computational Bioprospecting Guggulsterone against ADP Ribose Phosphatase of SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the disease a as global public health hazard on 11 March 2020. Currently, there are no adequate measures to combat viral infections, including COVID-19, and the medication guidelines for the management of COVID-19 are dependent on previous findings from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV research. Natural products have achieved widespread acceptance around the world as a means of enhancing healthcare and disease prevention. Plants are a potential source of antiviral factors such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids, and others. Some of these agents exhibit a broad spectrum of antiviral activity. This study aimed to screen herbal leads for possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 ADP Ribose Phosphatase enzyme (ARP). Guggulsterone was found to be highly stabilized within the active site of the viral ARP enzyme by molecular dynamic simulation with very little fluctuation throughout the simulation timeframe of 100 ns. Thus, guggulsterone can be further used to develop a safe and competent medication for evolving therapy against SARS-CoV-2 in post-preclinical and clinical trials.","['Kciuk M', 'Mujwar S', 'Rani I', 'Munjal K', 'Gielecińska A', 'Kontek R', 'Shah K']",2022,27,23,Molecules,"Kciuk M, et al.

36482973,Immunopeptidome profiling of human coronavirus OC43-infected cells identifies CD4 T cell epitopes specific to seasonal coronaviruses or cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2.,"UNLABELLED: Seasonal ""common-cold"" human coronaviruses are widely spread throughout the world and are mainly associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections. The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 has prompted increased attention to coronavirus biology and immunopathology, but identification and characterization of the T cell response to seasonal human coronaviruses remain largely uncharacterized. Here we report the repertoire of viral peptides that are naturally processed and presented upon infection of a model cell line with seasonal human coronavirus OC43. We identified MHC-I and MHC-II bound peptides derived from the viral spike, nucleocapsid, hemagglutinin-esterase, 3C-like proteinase, and envelope proteins. Only three MHC-I bound OC43-derived peptides were observed, possibly due to the potent MHC-I downregulation induced by OC43 infection. By contrast, 80 MHC-II bound peptides corresponding to 14 distinct OC43-derived epitopes were identified, including many at very high abundance within the overall MHC-II peptidome. These peptides elicited low-abundance recall T cell responses in most donors tested. In vitro assays confirmed that the peptides were recognized by CD4+ T cells and identified the presenting HLA alleles. T cell responses cross-reactive between OC43, SARS-CoV-2, and the other seasonal coronaviruses were confirmed in samples of peripheral blood and peptide-expanded T cell lines. Among the validated epitopes, S 
AUTHOR SUMMARY: There is much current interest in cellular immune responses to seasonal common-cold coronaviruses because of their possible role in mediating protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or pathology. However, identification of relevant T cell epitopes and systematic studies of the T cell responses responding to these viruses are scarce. We conducted a study to identify naturally processed and presented MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes from human cells infected with the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43, and to characterize the T cell responses associated with these epitopes. We found epitopes specific to the seasonal coronaviruses, as well as epitopes cross-reactive between HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes should be useful in following immune responses to seasonal coronaviruses and identifying their roles in COVID-19 vaccination, infection, and pathogenesis.","['Becerra-Artiles A', 'Nanaware PP', 'Muneeruddin K', 'Weaver GC', 'Shaffer SA', 'Calvo-Calle JM', 'Stern LJ']",2022,,,bioRxiv,"Becerra-Artiles A, et al.

Small molecules and other therapeutics are rapidly being developed to treat these diseases, but the threat of new variants and outbreaks argue for the identification of additional viral targets. Here we identify regions in each of the three coronavirus genomes that are able to form G-quadruplex (G4) structures. G4s are structures formed by DNA or RNA with a core of two or more stacked planes of guanosine tetrads. In recent years, numerous DNA and RNA G4s have emerged as promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of cancer and viral infection. We use a combination of bioinformatics and biophysical approaches to identify conserved RNA G4 regions from the ORF1A and S sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Although a general depletion of G4-forming regions is observed in coronaviridae, the preservation of these selected G4 sequences support a significance in viral replication. Targeting these RNA structures may represent a new antiviral strategy against these viruses distinct from current approaches that target viral proteins.","['Kabbara A', 'Vialet B', 'Marquevielle J', 'Bonnafous P', 'Mackereth CD', 'Amrane S']",2022,10,,Front Chem,"Kabbara A, et al.

36473798,Emotional wellbeing of student midwives during COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: Mental health of students in higher education was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
AIM: To examine the emotional wellbeing of midwifery students in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium) during COVID-19.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online-based survey with 619 Dutch and Flemish midwifery students. Sociodemographic details were obtained. Anxiety and depression were measured twice (T1, T2) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
FINDINGS: Flemish students had significantly higher mean depression and anxiety scores than Dutch students during the total period of study (p < .001; p < .001). Total group mean depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher at T2 compared to T1 (p < .001; p < .001). In the Dutch student group, there was a significant increase of depression from T1 to T2 (p < .001). In the Flemish student group, both depression and anxiety scores significantly increased from T1 to T2 (p < .001; p < .001). A history of psychological problems predicted both depression and anxiety, irrespective of COVID-19 period or country (p < .001; p < .001). Being single (p.015) and having a job (p.046) predicted depression, irrespective of period or country. A history of psychological problems predicted depression (p.004; p < .001) and anxiety (p.003; p.001) during the total period of study. Being single also predicted depression during T2 (p.024).
CONCLUSION: These findings inform how emotional wellbeing of midwifery students was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify those students that might need extra attention after the pandemic, during another pandemic or similar situations with social restrictions.","['Kuipers Y', 'Mestdagh E']",2023,36,2,Women Birth,Kuipers Y and Mestdagh E.

36472969,"An efficacy and safety report based on randomized controlled single-blinded multi-centre clinical trial of ZingiVir-H, a novel herbo-mineral formulation designed as an add-on therapy in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.","OBJECTIVE: Coronaviruses, hence named because of the crown-like spikes on the viral envelope, are members of Coronaviridae family and Order Nidovirales. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human pathogenic coronavirus identified after HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV. SARS-Cov-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV. COVID-19 is the corresponding acute disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was initially reported in Wuhan, China towards the end of 2019 and spread to millions of humans globally. Unfortunately, limited studies were available on the efficacy of antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 at the time of this study. ZingiVir-H is an Ayurvedic formulation for use in early therapy of viral disease. This clinical trial was planned to investigate (1) the efficacy and safety of ZingiVir-H and (2) the efficacy of ZingiVir-H as an add-on therapy to the standard of care in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19.
METHODS: A total of 123 eligible subjects as per inclusion criteria were randomized within the study. Three subjects later declined to participate in the study and four subjects didn't meet inclusion criteria, which brought the final evaluable subject count to 116 for the efficacy and safety endpoint analysis. Thus, a total of 116 patients were equally randomised into two groups, namely, ZingiVir-H and Placebo for this clinical trial. The study patients were assigned to receive either ZingiVir-H or Placebo along with the standard of care as per the National Indian COVID-19 treatment protocol. The time interval until a negative RT-PCR obtained, was evaluated during treatment with ZingiVir-H or Placebo for ten days. Liver and kidney function tests were regularly assessed to ensure the safety profile of ZingiVir-H.
RESULTS: The study found that patients who were administered ZingiVir-H had a median recovery time of 5 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 5-5) when compared to 6 days (95% CI 5-6) in those who received Placebo. Besides, in Ordinal Scale analysis of all the patients treated with ZingiVir-H demonstrated significant redistribution to a better clinical status from ordinal scale 5 to 6 and 7 within five to seven days when compared to that of placebo treatment. The time required for clinical improvement and the number of days needed for hospitalization was significantly less in the ZingiVir-H treated group when compared to placebo. The absence of liver and kidney function changes affirmed the safety profile of ZingiVir-H. No serious adverse events were reported in ZingiVir-H treated patients.
CONCLUSION: We found that ZingiVir-H is effective and safe in managing COVID-19 infections and delaying the disease progression from mild to moderate and moderate to severe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial report on the efficacy/safety of a herbo-mineral Ayurvedic drug against COVID-19 as of yet.

However, nucleotide features that determine these distinct distributions of lncRNAs and mRNAs have yet to be fully addressed. Here, we develop RNAlight, a machine learning model based on LightGBM, to identify nucleotide k-mers contributing to the subcellular localizations of mRNAs and lncRNAs. With the Tree SHAP algorithm, RNAlight extracts nucleotide features for cytoplasmic or nuclear localization of RNAs, indicating the sequence basis for distinct RNA subcellular localizations. By assembling k-mers to sequence features and subsequently mapping to known RBP-associated motifs, different types of sequence features and their associated RBPs were additionally uncovered for lncRNAs and mRNAs with distinct subcellular localizations. Finally, we extended RNAlight to precisely predict the subcellular localizations of other types of RNAs, including snRNAs, snoRNAs and different circular RNA transcripts, suggesting the generality of using RNAlight for RNA subcellular localization prediction.","['Yuan GH', 'Wang Y', 'Wang GZ', 'Yang L']",2023,24,1,Brief Bioinform,"Yuan GH, et al.

36464077,RBM24 inhibits the translation of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins by targeting the 5'-untranslated region.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with single-stranded positive-sense RNA, which is a serious global threat to human health. Understanding the molecular mechanism of viral replication is crucial for the development of antiviral drugs. The synthesis of viral polyproteins is a crucial step in viral progression. The synthesis of viral polyproteins in coronaviruses is regulated by the 5'-untranslated region (UTR); however, the detailed regulatory mechanism needs further investigation. The present study demonstrated that the RNA binding protein, RBM24, interacts with the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 via its RNA recognition submotifs (RNPs). The findings revealed that RBM24 recognizes and binds to the GUGUG element at stem-loop 4 (SL4) in the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between RBM24 and 5'-UTR prevents 80S ribosome assembly, which in turn inhibits polyproteins translation and the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, other RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebolavirus, rhinovirus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 also contain one or several G(U/C/A)GUG sequences in the 5'-UTR, which is also targeted by RBM24. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that RBM24 functions by interacting with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and elucidated that RBM24 could be a host restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.","['Yao Y', 'Sun H', 'Chen Y', 'Tian L', 'Huang D', 'Liu C', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wen Z', 'Yang B', 'Chen X', 'Pei R']",2023,209,,Antiviral Res,"Yao Y, et al.

36438876,A retrospective study of COVID during pregnancy and the outcome of vaginal delivery.,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are three highly pathogenic and lethal human coronaviruses that have arisen in the last two decades. Pregnant women have a higher risk due to a special state of immunosuppression. However, there is no proof that pregnant women and their babies are more vulnerable to infection, as data is limited.The primary goal of this retrospective study is to examine the effects of early COVID-19 diagnosis and to address the best method of delivery based on medical records of neonatal and maternal outcomes observed at Nepal's Paropakar Maternity Hospital. This retrospective research will determine whether vaginal delivery is healthy compared to cesarean delivery and whether the outcome of a COVID-19 pregnancy in both mother and the baby is independent of the disease's status of the mother.
METHODS: Study design: The proposed study is a retrospective cross-sectional study.
PATIENTS POPULATION: 104 cases of COVID positive pregnancy with vaginal delivery or caesarean section.
RESULTS: The neonatal outcomes of COVID pregnancy revealed at least 51% baby born with Low APGAR score, 18% born prematurely, 19% with low birth weight, 7% requiring NICU admission, 3% Neonatal asphyxia, and 2% Neonatal death. Furthermore, when normal vaginal delivery and Cesarean section were compared there was no significant between the differences found in the outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The COVID positive status had no association with the perinatal outcomes. Moreover, COVID status rarely affected the course of pregnancy.

36435212,Rapid discovery and classification of inhibitors of coronavirus infection by pseudovirus screen and amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay.,"To identify potent antiviral compounds, we introduced a high-throughput screen platform that can rapidly classify hit compounds according to their target. In our platform, we performed a compound screen using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus presenting a spike protein of coronavirus, and we evaluated the hit compounds using an amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (alpha) test with purified host receptor protein and the receptor binding domain of the viral spike. With our screen platform, we were able to identify both spike-specific compounds (class I) and broad-spectrum antiviral compounds (class II). Among the hit compounds, thiosemicarbazide was identified to be selective to the interaction between the viral spike and its host cell receptor, and we further optimized the binding potency of thiosemicarbazide through modification of the pyridine group. Among the class II compounds, we found raloxifene and amiodarone to be highly potent against human coronaviruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. In particular, using analogs of the benzothiophene moiety, which is also present in raloxifene, we have identified benzothiophene as a novel structural scaffold for broad-spectrum antivirals. This work highlights the strong utility of our screen platform using a pseudovirus assay and an alpha test for rapid identification of potential antiviral compounds and their mechanism of action, which can lead to the accelerated development of therapeutics against newly emerging viral infections.","['Jeong K', 'Chang J', 'Park SM', 'Kim J', 'Jeon S', 'Kim DH', 'Kim YE', 'Lee JC', 'Im S', 'Jo Y', 'Min JY', 'Lee H', 'Yeom M', 'Seok SH', 'On DI', 'Noh H', 'Yun JW', 'Park JW', 'Song D', 'Seong JK', 'Kim KC', 'Lee JY', 'Park HJ', 'Kim S', 'Nam TG', 'Lee W']",2023,209,,Antiviral Res,"Jeong K, et al.

36422629,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 during the Pandemic by Multiplex RT-rPCR hCoV Test: Future Perspectives.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a significant threat to public health. However, among the Coronaviridae family members, there are other viruses that can also cause infections in humans. Among these, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have posed significant threats to human health in the past. Other human pathogenic coronaviruses have been identified, and they are known to cause respiratory diseases with manifestations ranging from mild to severe. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a multiplex RT-rPCR specific to seven human pathogenic coronaviruses in mainly detecting SARS-CoV-2 directly from nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from suspected COVID-19 infected patients, while simultaneously detecting different human pathogenic coronaviruses in case these were also present. We tested 1195 clinical samples suspected of COVID-19 infection. The assay identified that 69% of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (1195), which was confirmed using another SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit available in our laboratory. None of these clinical samples were positive for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or HCoV. This means that during the endemic phase of COVID-19, infection with other human pathogenic coronaviruses, even the common cold coronavirus (HCoV), is very uncommon. Our study also confirmed that the multiplex RT-rPCR is a sensitive assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 regardless of differences among the variants. This multiplex RT-rPCR is also time- and cost-saving and very easy to apply in the diagnostic laboratory due to its simple procedure and its stability in storage after preparation. These features make the assay a valuable approach in screening procedures for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic coronaviruses that could affect public health.","['Inchingolo AD', 'Gargiulo CI', 'Malcangi G', 'Ciocia AM', 'Patano A', 'Azzollini D', 'Piras F', 'Barile G', 'Settanni V', 'Mancini A', 'Garofoli G', 'Palmieri G', 'Di Pede C', 'Rapone B', 'Inchingolo AM', 'Jones M', 'Corriero A', 'Brienza N', 'Parisi A', 'Bianco A', 'Capozzi L', 'Del Sambro L', 'Simone D', 'Bordea IR', 'Tartaglia GM', 'Scarano A', 'Lorusso F', 'Macchia L', 'Migliore G', 'Pham VH', 'Dipalma G', 'Inchingolo F']",2022,11,11,Pathogens,"Inchingolo AD, et al.

The highest viral inhibition percentage (96%) was recorded for S. tomentosa. Moreover, the mode of action for both S. tomentosa and A. judaica showed 99.5% and 92% inhibition, respectively, with virucidal as the main mode of action. Furthermore, the anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of S. tomentosa were measured. Notably, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. tomentosa was very high (100%) and anti-MERS-CoV inhibition was slightly lower (96%). Therefore, the phytochemical investigation of the very promising S. tomentosa L. led to the isolation and structural identification of nine compounds (1−9). Then, both the CC50 and IC50 values for the isolated compounds against SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Compound 4 (genistein 4’-methyl ether) achieved superior anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with an IC50 value of 2.13 µm. Interestingly, the mode of action of S. tomentosa against SARS-CoV-2 showed that both virucidal and adsorption mechanisms were very effective. Additionally, the IC50 values of S. tomentosa against SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were found to be 1.01 and 3.11 µg/mL, respectively. In addition, all the isolated compounds were subjected to two separate molecular docking studies against the spike (S) and main protease (Mpr°) receptors of SARS-CoV-2.","['Abd-Alla HI', 'Kutkat O', 'Sweelam HM', 'Eldehna WM', 'Mostafa MA', 'Ibrahim MT', 'Moatasim Y', 'GabAllah M', 'Al-Karmalawy AA']",2022,12,11,Metabolites,"Abd-Alla HI, et al.

36418944,Transposable element finder (TEF): finding active transposable elements from next generation sequencing data.,"BACKGROUND: Detection of newly transposed events by transposable elements (TEs) from next generation sequence (NGS) data is difficult, due to their multiple distribution sites over the genome containing older TEs. The previously reported Transposon Insertion Finder (TIF) detects TE transpositions on the reference genome from NGS short reads using end sequences of target TE. TIF requires the sequence of target TE and is not able to detect transpositions for TEs with an unknown sequence.
RESULT: The new algorithm Transposable Element Finder (TEF) enables the detection of TE transpositions, even for TEs with an unknown sequence. TEF is a finding tool of transposed TEs, in contrast to TIF as a detection tool of transposed sites for TEs with a known sequence. The transposition event is often accompanied with a target site duplication (TSD). Focusing on TSD, two algorithms to detect both ends of TE, TSDs and target sites are reported here. One is based on the grouping with TSDs and direct comparison of k-mers from NGS without similarity search. The other is based on the junction mapping of TE end sequence candidates. Both methods succeed to detect both ends and TSDs of known active TEs in several tests with rice, Arabidopsis and Drosophila data and discover several new TEs in new locations. PCR confirmed the detected transpositions of TEs in several test cases in rice.
CONCLUSIONS: TEF detects transposed TEs with TSDs as a result of TE transposition, sequences of both ends and their inserted positions of transposed TEs by direct comparison of NGS data between two samples. Genotypes of transpositions are verified by counting of junctions of head and tail, and non-insertion sequences in NGS reads. TEF is easy to run and independent of any TE library, which makes it useful to detect insertions from unknown TEs bypassed by common TE annotation pipelines.","['Miyao A', 'Yamanouchi U']",2022,23,1,BMC Bioinformatics,Miyao A and Yamanouchi U.

36418811,Plant lectins as versatile tools to fight coronavirus outbreaks.,"The S protein forming the homotrimeric spikes of pathogenic beta-coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, is a highly glycosylated protein containing mainly N-glycans of the complex and high-mannose type, as well as O-glycans. Similarly, the host cell receptors DPP4 for MERS-CoV and ACE2 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, also represent N- and O-glycosylated proteins. All these glycoproteins share common glycosylation patterns, suggesting that plant lectins with different carbohydrate-binding specificities could be used as carbohydrate-binding agents for the spikes and their receptors, to combat COVID19 pandemics. The binding of plant lectins to the spikes and their receptors could mask the non-glycosylated receptor binding domain of the virus and the corresponding region of the receptor, thus preventing a proper interaction of the spike proteins with their receptors. In this review, we analyze (1) the ability of plant lectins to interact with the N- and O-glycans present on the spike proteins and their receptors, (2) the in vitro and in vivo anti-COVID19 activity already reported for plant lectins and, (3) the possible ways for delivery of lectins to block the spikes and/or their receptors.","['Simplicien M', 'Pério P', 'Sudor J', 'Barre A', 'Benoist H', 'Van Damme EJM', 'Rougé P']",2023,40,1,Glycoconj J,"Simplicien M, et al.

36417012,Studying the characteristics of nanobody CDR regions based on sequence analysis in combination with 3D structures.,"BACKGROUND: Single-domain antibodies or nanobodies have recently attracted much attention in research and applications because of their great potential and advantage over conventional antibodies. However, isolation of candidate nanobodies in the lab has been costly and time-consuming. Screening of leading nanobody candidates through synthetic libraries is a promising alternative, but it requires prior knowledge to control the diversity of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) while still maintaining functionality. In this work, we identified sequence characteristics that could contribute to nanobody functionality by analyzing three datasets, CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3.
RESULTS: By classification of amino acids based on physicochemical properties, we found that two different amino acid groups were sufficient for CDRs. The nonpolar group accounted for half of the total amino acid composition in these sequences. Observation of the highest occurrence of each amino acid revealed that the usage of some important amino acids such as tyrosine and serine was highly correlated with the length of the CDR3. Amino acid repeat motifs were also under-represented and highly restricted as 3-mers. Inspecting the crystallographic data also demonstrated conservation in structural coordinates of dominant amino acids such as methionine, isoleucine, valine, threonine, and tyrosine and certain positions in the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified sequence characteristics that contributed to functional nanobodies including amino acid groups, the occurrence of each kind of amino acids, and repeat patterns. These results provide a simple set of rules to make it easier to generate desired candidates by computational means; also, they can be used as a reference to evaluate synthetic nanobodies.","['Truong TTT', 'Huynh VQ', 'Vo NT', 'Nguyen HD']",2022,20,1,J Genet Eng Biotechnol,"Truong TTT, et al.

36408391,Comparison of dural puncture and dural incision in deep brain stimulation surgery: A simple but worthwhile technique modification.,"BACKGROUND: The accuracy of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode placement is influenced by a myriad of factors, among which pneumocephalus and loss of cerebrospinal fluid that occurs with dural opening during the surgery are considered most important. This study aimed to describe an effective method for decreasing pneumocephalus by comparing its clinical efficacy between the two different methods of opening the dura.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared two different methods of opening the dura in 108 patients who underwent bilateral DBS surgery in our center. The dural incision group comprised 125 hemispheres (58 bilateral and 9 unilateral) and the dural puncture group comprised 91 (41 bilateral and 9 unilateral). The volume of intracranial air, dural opening time, intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs), postoperative electrode displacement, clinical efficacy, and complications were examined. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to identify factors associated with the volume of intracranial air and postoperative electrode displacement.
RESULTS: The volume of intracranial air was significantly lower (0.35 cm
CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that opening the dura via puncture rather than incision when performing DBS surgery reduces pneumocephalus, shortens dural opening time, enables longer sensorimotor area and more stable MERs, minimizes postoperative electrode displacement, and may permit a better clinical efficacy.","['Fan S', 'Zhang Q', 'Meng F', 'Fang H', 'Yang G', 'Shi Z', 'Liu H', 'Zhang H', 'Yang A', 'Zhang J', 'Shi L']",2022,16,,Front Neurosci,"Fan S, et al.

36403071,The envelope proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV potently reduce the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).,"BACKGROUND: Viroporins are virally encoded ion channels involved in virus assembly and release. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza A virus encode for viroporins. The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 encodes for at least two viroporins, a small 75 amino acid transmembrane protein known as the envelope (E) protein and a larger 275 amino acid protein known as Orf3a. Here, we compared the replication of HIV-1 in the presence of four different β-coronavirus E proteins.
RESULTS: We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV E proteins reduced the release of infectious HIV-1 yields by approximately 100-fold while MERS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 E proteins restricted HIV-1 infectivity to a lesser extent. Mechanistically, neither reverse transcription nor mRNA synthesis was involved in the restriction. We also show that all four E proteins caused phosphorylation of eIF2-α at similar levels and that lipidation of LC3-I could not account for the differences in restriction. However, the level of caspase 3 activity in transfected cells correlated with HIV-1 restriction in cells. Finally, we show that unlike the Vpu protein of HIV-1, the four E proteins did not significantly down-regulate bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that while viroporins from homologous viruses can enhance virus release, we show that a viroporin from a heterologous virus can suppress HIV-1 protein synthesis and release of infectious virus.","['Henke W', 'Waisner H', 'Arachchige SP', 'Kalamvoki M', 'Stephens E']",2022,19,1,Retrovirology,"Henke W, et al.

CONTENT: The risk of gestational complications was confirmed during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. However, this is not robust for COVID-19 because there is still no scientific evidence from longitudinal studies. A systematic review was performed using four databases, and 14 prospective or retrospective cohorts were finally included in the analysis.
SUMMARY: The most frequently associated sociodemographic characteristic or comorbidity was the presence of any previous comorbidity (9 studies, 64.3%), followed by ethnicity and age (6 studies each one, 42.9%). The most frequently associated gestational complications in mothers were the admission to Intensive Care Unit (4 studies, 28.6%) and gestational age at delivery <37 weeks (3 studies, 21.4%). The most frequently associated gestational complications in newborns were preterm birth (4 studies, 28.6%) and the admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (2 studies, 14.3%).
OUTLOOK: Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 appear to have a higher risk of admission to Intensive Care Unit.

Because of its characteristics, LL-37 can be considered an adjuvant for vaccine development. In this study, we confirmed the possible adjuvant activity of LL-37 in mucosal vaccine development against Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by means of intranasal immunization in C57BL/6 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice. Intranasal immunization using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein (S-RBD) recombined with LL-37 (S-RBD-LL-37) induced an efficient mucosal IgA and systemic IgG response with virus-neutralizing activity, compared with S-RBD. Ag-specific CTL stimulation was also efficiently induced in the lungs of mice that had been intranasally immunized with S-RBD-LL-37, compared with S-RBD. Importantly, intranasal immunization of hDPP4-Tg mice with S-RBD-LL-37 led to reduced immune cell infiltration into the lungs after infection with MERS-CoV. Finally, intranasal immunization of hDPP4-Tg mice with S-RBD-LL-37 led to enhanced protective efficacy, with increased survival and reduced body weight loss after challenge infection with MERS-CoV.

36378534,SARS-CoV-2 infection of sustentacular cells disrupts olfactory signaling pathways.,"Loss of olfactory function has been commonly reported in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Recovery from anosmia is not well understood. Previous studies showed that sustentacular cells, and occasionally olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE), are infected in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and experimental animals. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of sustentacular cells induces inflammation characterized by infiltration of myeloid cells to the olfactory epithelium and variably increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We observed widespread damage to, and loss of cilia on, OSNs, accompanied by downregulation of olfactory receptors and signal transduction molecules involved in olfaction. A consequence of OSN dysfunction was a reduction in the number of neurons in the olfactory bulb expressing tyrosine hydroxylase, consistent with reduced synaptic input. Resolution of the infection, inflammation, and olfactory dysfunction occurred over 3-4 weeks following infection in most but not all animals. We also observed similar patterns of OE infection and anosmia/hyposmia in mice infected with other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Together, these results define the downstream effects of sustentacular cell infection and provide insight into olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19-associated anosmia.","['Verma AK', 'Zheng J', 'Meyerholz DK', 'Perlman S']",2022,7,24,JCI Insight,"Verma AK, et al.

The enhancer may be located upstream or downstream of the gene. It is not necessarily close to the gene to be acted on, because the entanglement structure of chromatin allows the positions far apart in the sequence to have the opportunity to contact each other. Therefore, identifying enhancers and their strength is a complex and challenging task. In this article, a new prediction method based on deep learning is proposed to identify enhancers and enhancer strength, called iEnhancer-DCLA. Firstly, we use word2vec to convert k-mers into number vectors to construct an input matrix. Secondly, we use convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network to extract sequence features, and finally use the attention mechanism to extract relatively important features.

Recently in SARS CoV-2, the in vitro studies and structural analysis shows a risk of disease severity via ADE. This phenomenon is partially attributed to non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub-neutralizing levels. These antibodies result in antigen-antibody complexes' deposition and propagation of a chronic inflammatory process that destroys affected tissues. Further, antigen-antibody complexes may enhance the internalization of the virus into cells through the Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) and lead to further virus replication. Thus, ADE occur via two mechanisms; 1. Antibody mediated replication and 2. Enhanced immune activation. Antibody-mediated effector functions are mainly driven by complement activation, and the first complement in the cascade is complement 1q (C1q) which binds to the virus-antibody complex. Reports say that deficiency in circulating plasma levels of C1q, an independent predictor of mortality in high-risk patients, including diabetes, is associated with severe viral infections. Complement mediated ADE is reported in several viral infections such as dengue, West Nile virus, measles, RSV, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola virus. This review discusses ADE in viral infections and the in vitro evidence of ADE in coronaviruses. We outline the mechanisms of ADE, emphasizing the role of complements, especially C1q in the outcome of the enhanced disease.","['Thomas S', 'Smatti MK', 'Ouhtit A', 'Cyprian FS', 'Almaslamani MA', 'Thani AA', 'Yassine HM']",2022,152,,Mol Immunol,"Thomas S, et al.

Several studies suggested that cross-reactive T-cells response to live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) such as BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) can limit the development and severity of COVID-19. This study aims to identify potential cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2, HCCCs, and LAVs in the context of T-cell epitopes peptides presented by HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) alleles of the Indonesian population. SARS-CoV-2 derived T-cell epitopes were predicted using immunoinformatics tools and assessed for their conservancy, variability, and population coverage. Two fully conserved epitopes with 100% similarity and nine heterologous epitopes with identical T-cell receptor (TCR) contact residues were identified from the ORF1ab fragment of SARS-CoV-2 and all HCCCs. Cross-reactive epitopes from various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and LAVs were also identified (15 epitopes from BCG, 7 epitopes from MMR, but none from OPV). A majority of the identified epitopes were observed to belong to ORF1ab, further suggesting the vital role of ORF1ab in the coronaviruses family and suggesting it as a candidate for a potential universal coronavirus vaccine that protects against severe disease by inducing cell mediated immunity.","['Gustiananda M', 'Julietta V', 'Hermawan A', 'Febriana GG', 'Hermantara R', 'Kristiani L', 'Sidhartha E', 'Sutejo R', 'Agustriawan D', 'Andarini S', 'Parikesit AA']",2022,14,11,Viruses,"Gustiananda M, et al.

Almost simultaneously, in 2013, new genotypes 7 and 8 of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) were discovered in dromedary and Bactrian camels, respectively. HEV 7 was further shown to be associated with chronic viral hepatitis in a transplant recipient. In this study, serological screening for antibodies to MERS-CoV and hepatitis E virus was carried out on large camel farms in the south and west of Kazakhstan. 6.42% of the tested camels were found to be positive for antibodies to the hepatitis E virus, which indicates its circulation in local camel population.

36362351,Antiviral Potential of Plants against COVID-19 during Outbreaks-An Update.,"Several human diseases are caused by viruses, including cancer, Type I diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past, people have suffered greatly from viral diseases such as polio, mumps, measles, dengue fever, SARS, MERS, AIDS, chikungunya fever, encephalitis, and influenza. Recently, COVID-19 has become a pandemic in most parts of the world. Although vaccines are available to fight the infection, their safety and clinical trial data are still questionable. Social distancing, isolation, the use of sanitizer, and personal productive strategies have been implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. Moreover, the search for a potential therapeutic molecule is ongoing. Based on experiences with outbreaks of SARS and MERS, many research studies reveal the potential of medicinal herbs/plants or chemical compounds extracted from them to counteract the effects of these viral diseases. COVID-19's current status includes a decrease in infection rates as a result of large-scale vaccination program implementation by several countries. But it is still very close and needs to boost people's natural immunity in a cost-effective way through phytomedicines because many underdeveloped countries do not have their own vaccination facilities. In this article, phytomedicines as plant parts or plant-derived metabolites that can affect the entry of a virus or its infectiousness inside hosts are described. Finally, it is concluded that the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants must be analyzed and evaluated entirely in the control of COVID-19 in cases of uncontrollable SARS infection.",['Jamal QMS'],2022,23,21,Int J Mol Sci,Jamal QMS.

36359579,Multi-Stage Temporal Convolution Network for COVID-19 Variant Classification.,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global epidemic. Due to the pathogenic virus's high transmission rate, accurate identification and early prediction are required for subsequent therapy. Moreover, the virus's polymorphic nature allows it to evolve and adapt to various environments, making prediction difficult. However, other diseases, such as dengue, MERS-CoV, Ebola, SARS-CoV-1, and influenza, necessitate the employment of a predictor based on their genomic information. To alleviate the situation, we propose a deep learning-based mechanism for the classification of various SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, including the most recent, Omicron. Our model uses a neural network with a temporal convolution neural network to accurately identify different variants of COVID-19. The proposed model first encodes the sequences in the numerical descriptor, and then the convolution operation is applied for discriminative feature extraction from the encoded sequences. The sequential relations between the features are collected using a temporal convolution network to classify COVID-19 variants accurately. We collected recent data from the NCBI, on which the proposed method outperforms various baselines with a high margin.","['Ullah W', 'Ullah A', 'Malik KM', 'Saudagar AKJ', 'Khan MB', 'Hasanat MHA', 'AlTameem A', 'AlKhathami M']",2022,12,11,Diagnostics (Basel),"Ullah W, et al.

SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Several modes of transmission have been identified: via respiratory droplets, contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, and potentially, bioaerosols. Various countries have taken preventive measures that may include partial or total lockdowns lasting weeks. The physical inactivity associated with lockdowns may promote cardiometabolic or other diseases, while physical activity may play a critical role in preventing them. Here we develop the hypothesis of the involvement of aerosols in the contamination process, the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the potential benefits and harm of physical activity during lockdowns, and we suggest directions for future research.","['Djemai H', 'Hammad R', 'Dabayebeh IM', 'Hammad S', 'Merzouk A', 'Coumoul X', 'Noirez P']",2022,80,1,Arch Public Health,"Djemai H, et al.

Here we report a near-complete, haplotype-phased, genome assembly of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, using hi-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and chromosome conformation capture data. This assembly includes 14 pairs of long scaffolds (>38 Mb) corresponding to chromosomes (2n = 28). The accuracy of the assembly, as measured by an analysis of k-mers, is estimated to be 99.99997%. Moreover, the haplotypes contain 95.2% and 95.9%, respectively, complete and single-copy BUSCO genes, demonstrating the high quality of the assembly. Transposons comprise 53.3% of the assembly and are a major contributor to structural variations. Despite overall collinearity between haplotypes, one of the chromosomal scaffolds contains megabase-scale non-syntenic regions, which necessarily have never been detected and resolved in conventional haplotype-merged assemblies. These regions encode expanded gene families of NACHT, DZIP3/hRUL138-like HEPN, and immunoglobulin domains, multiplying the immunity gene repertoire, which we hypothesize is important for the innate immune capability of pearl oysters.

Hence, many viruses are causing high morbidity and mortality for a long time. Despite large diversity, viruses share common characteristics for infection. At least 12 different respiratory-borne viruses are reported belonging to various virus taxonomic families. Many of these viruses multiply and cause damage to the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The description of these viruses in comparison with each other concerning their epidemiology, molecular characteristics, disease manifestations, diagnosis and treatment is lacking. Such information helps diagnose, differentiate, and formulate the control measures faster. The leading cause of acute illness worldwide is acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and are responsible for nearly 4 million deaths every year, mostly in young children and infants. Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth most common cause of death globally, after non-infectious chronic conditions. This review aims to present the characteristics of different viruses causing respiratory infections, highlighting the uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2. We expect this review to help understand the similarities and differences among the closely related viruses causing respiratory infections and formulate specific preventive or control measures.","['Gandhi L', 'Maisnam D', 'Rathore D', 'Chauhan P', 'Bonagiri A', 'Venkataramana M']",2022,27,1,Eur J Med Res,"Gandhi L, et al.

36331873,Beyond COVID-19: the impact of recent pandemics on medical students and their education: a scoping review.,"INTRODUCTION: Over the past two years, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has greatly altered medical student education as well as daily life. Medical schools across the world were disrupted and had to immediately adapt the educational experience to the online environment in order to continue the delivery of quality medical education. However, COVID-19 was not the only recent pandemic. This posed the question, were similar disruptions and adaptations also seen in recent past pandemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that could have prepared medical educators for COVID-19? This scoping review investigated the educational and personal impact of recent pandemics on medical students.
METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews. Nine databases including PubMed, ERIC, and EMBASE were systematically searched using keywords and subject headings related to medical students and SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. Studies were limited to research studies published between 2000 and 2020 and in English. Based on exclusion and inclusion criteria, all studies were independently screened by two reviewers first by the title/abstract and then via full text. Data were extracted from the included studies and analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 174 studies fit the criteria. Seven major themes emerged from those studies: educational adaptations and online modifications, knowledge and attitudes of students, mental wellness of students, student involvement and use of telehealth, student vaccination, physical wellness of students, and stigma.
CONCLUSION: This review provided insights into how medical students were affected by recent pandemics and their perceptions of pivoting to online education, mental health, and knowledge of the diseases. Additionally, this review showcases the various educational adaptations that emerged uniquely during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as telehealth services or video conferencing tools, that can be utilized in a post-pandemic environment.","['Bughrara MS', 'Swanberg SM', 'Lucia VC', 'Schmitz K', 'Jung D', 'Wunderlich-Barillas T']",2023,28,1,Med Educ Online,"Bughrara MS, et al.

We measured plasma levels of 17 cytokines at enrollment and tested the treatment effect on 90-day mortality according to cytokine levels (higher versus lower levels using the upper tertile (67%) as a cutoff point) and time to treatment (≤ 7 days versus > 7 days of symptom onset) using interaction tests. Among 70 included patients, 32 received interferon-β1b and lopinavir-ritonavir and 38 received placebo. Interferon-β1b and lopinavir-ritonavir reduced mortality in patients with lower IL-2, IL-8 and IL-13 plasma concentrations but not in patients with higher levels (p-value for interaction = 0.09, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively) and with early but not late therapy (p = 0.002). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effect according to other cytokine levels. Further work is needed to evaluate whether the assessment of inflammatory status can help in identifying patients with MERS who may benefit from interferon-β1b and lopinavir-ritonavir.

Here we investigate the potential utility of a T-cell vaccine strategy targeting conserved regions of the sarbecovirus proteome. We identified the most conserved regions of the sarbecovirus proteome as portions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Helicase proteins, both of which are part of the coronavirus replication transcription complex (RTC). Fitness constraints suggest that as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve these regions may better preserve cross-reactive potential of T-cell responses than Spike, Nucleocapsid, or Membrane proteins. We sought to determine if vaccine-elicited T-cell responses to the highly conserved regions of the RTC would reduce viral loads following challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in mice using a rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vector. The RhAd52.CoV.Consv vaccine generated robust cellular immunity in mice and led to significant reductions in viral loads in the nasal turbinates following challenge with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. These data suggest the potential utility of T-cell targeting of conserved regions for a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.","['Dagotto G', 'Ventura JD', 'Martinez DR', 'Anioke T', 'Chung BS', 'Siamatu M', 'Barrett J', 'Miller J', 'Schäfer A', 'Yu J', 'Tostanoski LH', 'Wagh K', 'Baric RS', 'Korber B', 'Barouch DH']",2022,7,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Dagotto G, et al.

The animal model construction techniques developed during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pandemics were rapidly deployed and applied in the establishment of COVID-19 animal models. To date, a large number of animal models for COVID-19, including mice, hamsters, minks and nonhuman primates, have been established. Infectious diseases produce unique manifestations according to the characteristics of the pathogen and modes of infection. Here we classified animal model resources around the infection route of SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the characteristics of the animal models constructed via transnasal, localized, and simulated transmission routes of infection.","['Qi F', 'Qin C']",2022,5,5,Animal Model Exp Med,Qi F and Qin C.

There are key lessons-learned from the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that blood operators can apply to the next pandemic. Warning signals to the COVID-19 pandemic included outbreaks of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the prior two decades. It will be critical to quickly determine whether there is a risk of blood-borne transmission of a new pandemic virus. Prior to the next pandemic blood operators should be prepared for changes in activities, policies, and procedures at all levels of the organization. Blood operators can utilize ""Plan-Do-Study-Act"" cycles spanning from: vigilance for emerging viruses, surveillance activities and studies, operational continuity, donor engagement and trust, and laboratory testing if required. Occupational health and donor safety issues will be key areas of focus even if the next pandemic virus is not transfusion transmitted. Blood operators may also be requested to engage in new activities such as the development of therapeutics or supporting public health surveillance activities. Activities such as scenario development, tabletop exercises, and drills will allow blood operators to prepare for the unknowns of the next pandemic.","['Drews SJ', ""O'Brien SF""]",2022,14,10,Viruses,Drews SJ and O'Brien SF.

As there are no specific treatments to combat the virus, current approaches to overcome the crisis have mainly revolved around vaccination efforts, preventing human-to-human transmission through enforcement of lockdowns and repurposing of drugs. To efficiently facilitate the measures implemented by governments, rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease is vital. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography have been the standard procedures to diagnose and evaluate COVID-19. However, disadvantages, including the necessity of specialized equipment and trained personnel, the high financial cost of operation and the emergence of false negatives, have hindered their application in high-demand and resource-limited sites. Nanoparticle-based methods of diagnosis have been previously reported to provide precise results within short periods of time. Such methods have been studied in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Given the need for rapid diagnostic techniques, this review discusses nanoparticle use in detecting the aforementioned coronaviruses and the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 to highlight approaches that could potentially be used during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Al-Hindawi A', 'AlDallal U', 'Waly YM', 'Hussain MH', 'Shelig M', 'Saleh ElMitwalli OSMM', 'Deen GR', 'Henari FZ']",2022,12,20,Nanomaterials (Basel),"Al-Hindawi A, et al.

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the immune reaction in health workers of the Polyclinic of Bari to identify the relationship of antispike titers with blood type, sex, age, and comorbidities. This prospective observational study (RENAISSANCE) had as its primary endpoint the assessment of serologic response to BNT162b2 at three blood titers: the first at 60 days after the second dose (3 February 2021); the second titer at 75 days after the first titer; and the third titer at 130 days after the second titer. Out of 230 enrolled staff members, all responded excellently to the mRna Pfizer (BNT162b) vaccine. Only one patient, 40 days after the second dose (3 February 2021), was positive on the swab control performed on 15 March 2021, although completely asymptomatic, and was negative on the subsequent molecular swab performed on 30 March 2021. All the patients responded to the mRNA Pfizer (BNT162b) vaccine with an antispike IgG level above 500 BAU/mL at the first antispike protein essay (60 days after the second dose on 3 April 2021); at the second titer (75 days after the first titer on 20 June 2021), 4 (1.7% of 230 enrolled) patients showed an antispike IgG level under 500 BAU/mL; at the third titer (130 days after the second titer on 30 June 2021, which means 9 months after the second dose), 37 (16.1% of 230 enrolled) patients showed an antispike IgG level under 500 BAU/mL. The data analysis demonstrated that patients belonging to blood group 0, regardless of their rhesus factor, showed the strongest level of antibodies compared to the other groups. No dependency was found between low antibodies level and sex or age. Molecular swab controls were performed every 15th of the month continuously. However, the enrolled patients' activity was at high risk because they carried out medical activities such as dental and surgical as well with droplets of water vaporized by the effect of turbines, piezosurgery. The vaccination campaign among health workers of the Policlinico of the University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"" led to an excellent serological response and the complete absence of COVID-19 incident cases, so the antibody response was excellent. The COVID-19 vaccine booster shot should be administered after 9 months and not without prompt antispike titer detection to assess if any sign of waning immunity is present in that specific patient.","['Inchingolo AD', 'Malcangi G', 'Ceci S', 'Patano A', 'Corriero A', 'Azzollini D', 'Marinelli G', 'Coloccia G', 'Piras F', 'Barile G', 'Settanni V', 'Mancini A', 'De Leonardis N', 'Garofoli G', 'Palmieri G', 'Isacco CG', 'Rapone B', 'Jones M', 'Bordea IR', 'Tartaglia GM', 'Scarano A', 'Lorusso F', 'Macchia L', 'Larocca AMV', 'Tafuri S', 'Migliore G', 'Brienza N', 'Dipalma G', 'Inchingolo F']",2022,10,10,Biomedicines,"Inchingolo AD, et al.

After that, we concluded the host factors associated with pandemics morbidity and mortality (immune responses and immunopathology, ages, and effect of pandemics on pregnancy). Additionally, we focused on the burdens of COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (quarantine, mass gatherings, facemasks, and hygiene), and medical interventions (antiviral therapies and vaccines). Finally, we investigated the nanotechnology between COVID-19 analysis and immune system boosting (Nanoparticles (NPs), antimicrobial NPs as antivirals and immune cytokines).

Since the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, patients with acute respiratory symptoms returning from an endemic area can be suspected to be infected by this virus.
METHODS: 98 patients suspected to have MERS-CoV infection from 2014 to 2019 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Upper and lower respiratory tract samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR for the detection of MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses. Routine microbiological analyses were also performed. Patient data were retrieved from laboratory and hospital databases retrospectively.
RESULTS: All patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection travelled before their hospitalization. Most frequent symptoms were cough (94.4%) and fever (69.4%). 98 specimens were tested for MERS-CoV RNA and none of them was positive. Most frequently detected viruses were Enterovirus/Rhinovirus (40/83; 48.2%), Influenzavirus A (34/90; 37.8%) and B (11/90; 12.2%), H-CoV (229E and OC43 10/83; 12% and 7/83; 8.4%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: From 2014 to 2019, none of 98 patients returning from endemic areas was MERS-CoV infected.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) play a critical role in mounting adaptive immune response against the virus. This study was performed to assess the expression of CD26 and CD66e on PBMCs and their susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection.
METHODS: Surface expression of CD26 and CD66e receptors on PBMCs from MERS-CoV patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) was assessed by flow cytometry and the soluble forms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MERS-CoV UpE and Orf1a genes in PBMCs were detected by using Altona diagnostics reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit.
RESULTS: Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD66e was significantly higher on CD4 + lymphocytes (462.4 ± 64.35 vs 325.1 ± 19.69; p < 0.05) and CD8 + lymphocytes (533.8 ± 55.32 vs 392.4 ± 37.73; p < 0.04) from patients with MERS-CoV infection compared to the normal controls. No difference in MFI for CD66e was observed on monocytes (381.8 ± 40.34 vs 266.8 ± 20.6; p = 0.3) between the patients and controls. Soluble form of CD66e among MERS-CoV patients was also higher than the normal controls (mean= 338.7 ± 58.75 vs 160.7 ± 29.49 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Surface expression of CD26 on PBMCs and its soluble form were no different between the groups. MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR in 16/20 (80%) patients from whole blood, among them 8 patients were tested in PBMCs, 4/8 (50%) patients were positive.

Previous studies have shown that the skin microbial community could remain stable, even after long-term exposure to the external environment. In this study, we explore two questions: Do there exist strains or genetic variants in skin microorganisms that are individual-specific, temporally stable, and body site-independent? And if so, whether such microorganismal genetic variants could be used as markers, called ""fingerprints"" in our study, to identify donors? We proposed a framework to capture individual-specific DNA microbial fingerprints from skin metagenomic sequencing data. The fingerprints are identified on the frequency of 31-mers free from reference genomes and sequence alignments. The 616 metagenomic samples from 17 skin sites at 3-time points from 12 healthy individuals from Integrative Human Microbiome Project were adopted.

Considering that human skin temperature is around 33°C, lower than core body temperature of 37°C, we have developed an srRNA that functions optimally at skin temperature and is inactivated at or above 37°C as a safety switch. This temperature- c ontrollable srRNA (c-srRNA), when tested as an intradermal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, functions when injected naked without lipid nanoparticles. Unlike most currently available vaccines, c-srRNA vaccines predominantly elicit cellular immunity with little or no antibody production. Interestingly, c-srRNA-vaccinated mice produced antigen-specific antibodies upon subsequent stimulation with antigen protein. Antigen-specific antibodies were also produced when B-cell stimulation using antigen protein was followed by c-srRNA booster vaccination. Using c-srRNA, we have designed a pan-coronavirus booster vaccine that incorporates both spike receptor binding domains as viral surface proteins and evolutionarily conserved nucleoproteins as viral non-surface proteins, from both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. It can thereby potentially immunize against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their variants. c-srRNA may provide a route to activate cellular immunity against a wide variety of pathogens.","['Amano T', 'Yu H', 'Amano M', 'Leyder E', 'Badiola M', 'Ray P', 'Kim J', 'Ko AC', 'Achour A', 'Weng NP', 'Kochba E', 'Levin Y', 'Ko MSH']",2022,,,bioRxiv,"Amano T, et al.

The S1 domain of the spike protein contains a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) and an N-terminal domain (NTD). The NTD of other coronaviruses includes a glycan-binding cleft. However, for the SARS-CoV-2 NTD protein-glycan binding was only observed weakly for sialic acids with highly sensitive methods. Amino acid changes in the NTD of Variants of Concern (VoC) shows antigenic pressure, which can be an indication of NTD-mediated receptor binding.

SYNOPSIS: Coronaviruses utilize their N-terminal domain (NTD) for initial reversible low-affinity interaction to (sialylated) glycans. This initial low-affinity/high-avidity engagement enables viral surfing on the target membrane, potentially followed by a stronger secondary receptor interaction. Several coronaviruses, such as HKU1 and OC43, possess a hemagglutinin-esterase for viral release after sialic acid interaction, thus allowing viral dissemination. Other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, do not possess a hemagglutinin-esterase, but interact reversibly to sialic acids allowing for viral surfing and dissemination.

So far, several antivirals and the commercial vaccines have been found to evoke the required humoral and cellular immunity within a huge population around world. However, an important aspect to consider is the avoidance mechanism of the host protective immunity by SARS-CoV-2 variants.
MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Indeed, such an immune escape strategy has been noticed previously in case of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Regarding the SARS-CoV-2 variants, the most important aspect on vaccine development is to determine whether the vaccine is actually capable to elicit the immune response or not, especially the viral spike (S) protein.

To uncover the neutralization mechanism, we determined structures of MERS-S41 Fab in complex with the trimeric spike glycoprotein by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We observed four distinct classes of the complex structure, which showed that the MERS-S41 Fab bound to the ""up"" receptor binding domain (RBD) with full saturation and also bound to an accessible partially lifted ""down"" RBD, providing a structural basis for understanding how mAbs bind to trimeric spike glycoproteins. Structure analysis of the epitope and cell surface staining assays demonstrated that virus entry is blocked predominantly by direct competition with the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4).","['Zhang S', 'Jia W', 'Zeng J', 'Li M', 'Wang Z', 'Zhou H', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Zhang S, et al.

36245690,Effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mechanization service providers and mechanization equipment retailers: Insights from phone surveys in Myanmar.,"Agrifood sector mechanization service providers (MSP) and mechanization equipment retailers (MER) have increasingly become the providers of mechanical technologies for smallholders in developing countries, including Myanmar. Evidence remains scarce on the effects of COVID-19 on these MSPs and MERs. This study provides insights into the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on MSPs and MERs in Myanmar, using unbalanced panel data from five rounds of phone surveys. Direct responses to COVID-19 involving movement restrictions, market disruptions, and growing financial challenges had significant negative effects on revenue prospects, service delivery, and sales of machines and equipment. Negative revenue prospects during a particular period can further hurt revenue prospects in subsequent periods. This is consistent with the hypotheses that MSPs who had incurred high sunk costs in machines can engage in more desperate and, thus, potentially suboptimal business practices to recover the sunk cost. Overall, policies to minimize movement restrictions and various financial struggles and mitigate any pessimism at the beginning of the production season are all important to make sure MSPs and MERs continue to function effectively under COVID-19.","['Takeshima H', 'Masias I', 'Win MT', 'Zone PP']",2022,,,Rev Dev Econ,"Takeshima H, et al.

36243453,Gain-of-function research.,"The term Gain-of-Function (GoF) describes the gain of new functions by organisms through genetic changes, which can naturally occur or by experimental genetic modifications. Gain-of-Function research on viruses is enhancing transmissibility, virus replication, virulence, host range, immune evasion or drug and vaccine resistance to get insights into the viral mechanisms, to create and analyze animal models, to accelerate drug and vaccine development and to improve pandemic preparedness. A subset is the GoF research of concern (GOFROC) on enhanced potentially pandemic pathogens (ePPPs) that could be harmful for humans. A related issue is the military use of research as dual-use research of concern (DURC). Influenza and coronaviruses are main research targets, because they cause pandemics by airborne infections. Two studies on avian influenza viruses initiated a global debate and a temporary GoF pause in the United States which ended with a new regulatory framework in 2017. In the European Union and China, GoF and DURC are mainly covered by the legislation for laboratory safety and genetically modified organisms. After the coronavirus outbreaks, the GoF research made significant advances, including analyses of modified MERS-like and SARS-like viruses and the creation of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viruses as a platform to generate mutations. The GoF research on viruses will still play an important role in future, but the need to clarify the differences and overlaps between GoF research, GOFROC and DURC and the need for specialized oversight authorities are still debated.",['Saalbach KP'],2022,120,,Adv Appl Microbiol,Saalbach KP.

36242850,Highly pathogenic coronaviruses and the kidney.,"Since the end of 2019, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a pneumonia epidemic, posing a significant public health challenge in 236 countries, territories, and regions worldwide. Clinically, in addition to the symptoms of pulmonary infection, many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those with a critical illness, eventually develop multiple organ failure in which damage to the kidney function is common, ultimately leading to severe consequences such as increased mortality and morbidity. To date, three coronaviruses have set off major global public health security incidents: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Among the diseases caused by the coronaviruses, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the most impactful and harmful. Similar to with SARS-CoV-2 infections, previous studies have shown that kidney injury is also common and prominent in patients with the two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to comprehensively summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of these three pandemic-level infections, provide a deep analysis of the potential mechanism of COVID-19 in various types of kidney diseases, and explore the causes of secondary kidney diseases of SARS-CoV-2, so as to provide a reference for further research and the clinical prevention of kidney damage caused by coronaviruses.","['Wang F', 'Suo XG', 'Wang C', 'Wang JN', 'He XY', 'Wang FC', 'Jin J', 'Wen JG', 'Ni WJ', 'Shen BX', 'Meng XM']",2022,156,,Biomed Pharmacother,"Wang F, et al.

36239422,Investigation of the pharmacokinetic properties of synthetic heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a sulfated polysaccharide with a wide range of biological activities. There is an increasing interest in the development of structurally homogeneous HS oligosaccharides as therapeutics. However, the factors influencing the pharmacokinetic properties of HS-based therapeutics remain unknown. Here, we report the pharmacokinetic properties of a panel of dodecasaccharides (12-mers) with varying sulfation patterns in healthy mice and uncover the pharmacokinetic properties of an octadecasaccharide (18-mer) in acutely injured mice. In the 12-mer panel, 1 12-mer, known as dekaparin, is anticoagulant, and 3 12-mers are nonanticoagulant. The concentrations of 12-mers in plasma and urine were determined by the disaccharide analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. We observed a striking difference between anticoagulant and nonanticoagulant oligosaccharides in the 12-mer panel, showing that anticoagulant dekaparin had a 4.6-fold to 8.6-fold slower clearance and 4.4-fold to 8-fold higher plasma exposure compared to nonanticoagulant 12-mers. We also observed that the clearance of HS oligosaccharides is impacted by disease. Using an antiinflammatory 18-mer, we discovered that the clearance of 18-mer is reduced 2.8-fold in a liver failure mouse model compared to healthy mice. Our results suggest that oligosaccharides are rapidly cleared renally if they have low interaction with circulating proteins. We observed that the clearance rate of oligosaccharides is inversely associated with the degree of binding to target proteins, which can vary in response to pathophysiological conditions. Our findings uncover a contributing factor for the plasma and renal clearance of oligosaccharides which will aid the development of HS-based therapeutics.","['Arnold K', 'Wang Z', 'Lucas A', 'Zamboni W', 'Xu Y', 'Liu J']",2023,33,2,Glycobiology,"Arnold K, et al.

36222999,Current Transition Practice for Primary Immunodeficiencies and Autoinflammatory Diseases in Europe: a RITA-ERN Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Due to the absence of curative treatments for inborn errors of immunity (IEI), children born with IEI require long-term follow-up for disease manifestations and related complications that occur over the lifespan. Effective transition from pediatric to adult services is known to significantly improve adherence to treatment and long-term outcomes. It is currently not known what transition services are available for young people with IEI in Europe.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the prevalence and practice of transition services in Europe for young people with IEI, encompassing both primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and systemic autoinflammatory disorders (AID).
METHODS: A survey was generated by the European Reference Network on immunodeficiency, autoinflammatory, and autoimmune diseases Transition Working Group and electronically circulated, through professional networks, to pediatric centers across Europe looking after children with IEI.
RESULTS: Seventy-six responses were received from 52 centers, in 45 cities across 17 different countries. All services transitioned patients to adult services, mainly to specialist PID or AID centers, typically transferring up to ten patients to adult care each year. The transition process started at a median age of 16-18 years with transfer to the adult center occurring at a median age of 18-20 years. 75% of PID and 68% of AID centers held at least one joint appointment with pediatric and adult services prior to the transfer of care. Approximately 75% of PID and AID services reported having a defined transition process, but few centers reported national disease-specific transition guidelines to refer to.
CONCLUSIONS: Transition services for children with IEI in Europe are available in many countries but lack standardized guidelines to promote best practice.","['Israni M', 'Nicholson B', 'Mahlaoui N', 'Obici L', 'Rossi-Semerano L', 'Lachmann H', 'Hayward G', 'Avramovič MZ', 'Guffroy A', 'Dalm V', 'Rimmer R', 'Solis L', 'Villar C', 'Gennery AR', 'Skeffington S', 'Nordin J', 'Warnatz K', 'Korganow AS', 'Antón J', 'Cattalini M', 'Amin T', 'Berg S', 'Soler-Palacin P', 'Burns SO', 'Campbell M', 'RITA-ERN Transition Working Group Consortium']",2023,43,1,J Clin Immunol,"Israni M, et al.

36216587,Sequences of Events from the Electronic Medical Record and the Onset of Infection.,"We present a novel model of time-series analysis to learn from electronic health record (EHR) data when infection occurred in the intensive care unit (ICU) by translating methods from proteomics and Bayesian statistics. Using 48,536 patients hospitalized in an ICU, we describe each hospital course as an 'alphabet' of 23 physician actions ('events') in temporal order. We analyze these as k-mers of length 3-12 events and apply a Bayesian model of (cumulative) relative risk (RR). The log2-transformed RR (median=0.248, mean=0.226) supported the conclusion that the events selected were individually associated with increased risk of infection. Selecting from all possible cutoffs of maximum gain (MG), MG>0.0244 predicts administration of antibiotics with PPV 82.0 %, NPV 44.4 %, and AUC 0.706.

36213008,Chemical screen uncovers novel structural classes of inhibitors of the papain-like protease of coronaviruses.,"The papain-like protease (PLpro) of coronaviruses is an attractive antiviral target to inhibit both viral replication and interference of the host immune response. We have identified and characterized three novel classes of small molecules, thiophene, cyanofuran, and triazoloquinazoline, as PLpro inhibitors. Thiophene inhibited the PLpro of two major coronaviruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) including SARS-CoV-2, while cyanofuran and triazoloquinazoline more selectively inhibited MERS-CoV PLpro. Unlike GRL0617, a known PLpro inhibitor, all three compounds contain no naphthyl group but like GRL0617 were predicted to fit on the cleft near the BL2 loop. Docking studies further revealed that the location and direction of the binding determined their specificity to different coronaviruses. Together, our work demonstrates that the BL2 loop and nearby regions are outstanding druggable targets, and our three inhibitors can be applicable to the development of therapeutics for coronavirus infection.","['Jeong K', 'Kim J', 'Chang J', 'Hong S', 'Kim I', 'Oh S', 'Jeon S', 'Lee JC', 'Park HJ', 'Kim S', 'Lee W']",2022,25,10,iScience,"Jeong K, et al.

36211107,Deep Brain Stimulation in the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. The cardinal feature of Parkinson's is neuronal degeneration causing a dopamine deficit in the brain which leads to a host of clinical features in the patient. However, consensus over specific clinical criteria for diagnosis remains to be established. Parkinson's does not have a cure yet, but a variety of diagnostic and treatment protocols have been developed over the years with a primary focus on pharmacological therapy. Anti-parkinsonian drugs such as levodopa lose their efficacy over time and are needed in higher doses as the disease inevitably progresses. An alternative to pharmacological therapy is deep brain stimulation (DBS). Deep brain stimulation involves transcranial placement of unilateral or bilateral leads (wires) most commonly in the sub-thalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus interna of the brain by stereotactic surgery. Given the multiple hypotheses explaining the different effects of DBS with sometimes conflicting mechanisms, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact way in which DBS operates. Nevertheless, it has proven to be significantly effective. DBS, although being a cost-effective treatment measure for Parkinson's patients, is not without limitations. A careful selection of patients is required preoperatively that determines the response and tolerance to the therapy in patients. This review aims to summarize the current literature on DBS in Parkinson's with a focus on the hypothesized mechanisms, selection criteria, advantages and its limitations.","['Shah H', 'Usman O', 'Ur Rehman H', 'Jhaveri S', 'Avanthika C', 'Hussain K', 'Islam H', 'I S K S']",2022,14,9,Cureus,"Shah H, et al.

Here, we show that the rationally engineered H84T-banana lectin (H84T-BanLec), which specifically recognizes high mannose found on viral proteins but seldom on healthy human cells, potently inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (including Omicron), and other human-pathogenic coronaviruses at nanomolar concentrations. H84T-BanLec protects against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Importantly, intranasally and intraperitoneally administered H84T-BanLec are comparably effective. Mechanistic assays show that H84T-BanLec targets virus entry. High-speed atomic force microscopy depicts real-time multimolecular associations of H84T-BanLec dimers with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Single-molecule force spectroscopy demonstrates binding of H84T-BanLec to multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike mannose sites with high affinity and that H84T-BanLec competes with SARS-CoV-2 spike for binding to cellular ACE2. Modeling experiments identify distinct high-mannose glycans in spike recognized by H84T-BanLec. The multiple H84T-BanLec binding sites on spike likely account for the drug compound's broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the lack of resistant mutants.","['Chan JF', 'Oh YJ', 'Yuan S', 'Chu H', 'Yeung ML', 'Canena D', 'Chan CC', 'Poon VK', 'Chan CC', 'Zhang AJ', 'Cai JP', 'Ye ZW', 'Wen L', 'Yuen TT', 'Chik KK', 'Shuai H', 'Wang Y', 'Hou Y', 'Luo C', 'Chan WM', 'Qin Z', 'Sit KY', 'Au WK', 'Legendre M', 'Zhu R', 'Hain L', 'Seferovic H', 'Tampé R', 'To KK', 'Chan KH', 'Thomas DG', 'Klausberger M', 'Xu C', 'Moon JJ', 'Stadlmann J', 'Penninger JM', 'Oostenbrink C', 'Hinterdorfer P', 'Yuen KY', 'Markovitz DM']",2022,3,10,Cell Rep Med,"Chan JF, et al.

The recent one however is a different one from the Coronavirus involved in SARS (2002-2004) and MERS (2012) in being highly infectious. Initially COVID 19 had a high case fatality rate which has now decreased to a significant extent. Many cases of COVID 19 are asymptomatic with a significant number of positive cases developing a triad of fever, breathlessness and GI symptoms. Recent travel increases the probability of infection. The pathogenesis involves ACE 2 receptors. So, it has been found that there are more cases and mortality among hypertensive individuals. Even higher among the people who use ACE inhibitor in comparison to those who use other anti-hypertensive drugs. Treatment is usually symptomatic. Antiviral drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 are being used. Deranged liver enzymes are common in COVID-19, however, serious liver injury is not much documented. Liver injury is either due to disease itself or due to antiviral drugs. Extra care like strict social distancing, avoiding unnecessary contact is needed for those with autoimmune hepatitis, liver cancer and those who are in immunosuppression because of a scheduled or already liver transplant. Further research is definitely needed in this field.

A key component in the virulence of MERS-CoV is the Spike (S) protein, which binds with the host membrane receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The goal of the present investigation is to examine the effects of missense mutations in the MERS-CoV S protein on protein stability and binding affinity with DPP4 to provide insight that is useful in developing vaccines to prevent coronavirus infection. We utilized a saturation mutagenesis approach to simulate all possible mutations in the MERS-CoV full-length S, S Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and DPP4. We found the mutations in MERS-CoV S protein residues, G552, C503, C526, N468, G570, S532, S451, S419, S465, and S435, affect protein stability.

We investigated the effects of MERS-CoV S protein viral mutations on protein stability and binding affinity. In addition, we studied all DPP4 mutations and found the functional substitution R336T weakens both DPP4 protein stability and S-DPP4 binding affinity. We compared the S protein structures of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses and identified the residues like C526, C383, and N468 located in equivalent positions of these viruses have effects on S protein structure.

There is lack of zoonotic viruses that are origins of HCoV-HKU1 and the first recorded pandemic CoV (SARS-CoV-2) for studies. In this chapter, we review current knowledge of the roles of sialyl glycans in infections with these viruses in distinct infection stages. Determination of the similarities and differences in roles of sialyl glycans in infections with these viruses could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission that is essential for combating infections with CoVs that recognize sialyl glycans.","['Sriwilaijaroen N', 'Suzuki Y']",2022,2556,,Methods Mol Biol,"Sriwilaijaroen N and Suzuki Y.

We propose a flexible semiparametric modeling framework with at least three advantages. First, it enables researchers to study the structure of a population contact network and its impact on the spread of infectious diseases. Second, it can accommodate short- and long-tailed degree distributions and detect potential superspreaders, who represent an important public health concern. Third, it addresses the important issue of incomplete data. Starting from first principles, we show when the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters of the population model. We demonstrate the semiparametric modeling framework by simulations and an application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in 2015.

METHODS: Here, we highlight the characteristics of this syndrome together with the clinical and MRI findings of 6 pediatric patients with MERS.
RESULTS: Between January 2017 and October 2020, 6 patients with MERS (3 boys and 3 girls) presented to our center. The mean age was 122 ± 54.6 (min-max: 44-180) months. None of the patients had a chronic disease. In our study, infectious agents were detected in 4 patients (66.6%), while noninfectious causes (one seizure and the other hyponatremia) were detected in two patients. All of our cases were discharged without any sequelae after an average of 12.1 ± 7 (min-max: 4-20) days of hospitalization. In 1 patient (case 6), control MRI could not be performed, and the radiological recovery of our other patients was shown to be between 14 days and 2 months.

COVID-19 is highly pathogenic and contagious which has caused a large-scale epidemic impacting more deaths than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003 or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic in 2012-2013. Although COVID-19 symptoms are mild in most people, in those with pre-existing comorbidities there is an increased risk of progression to severe disease and death. In an attempt to mitigate this pandemic, urgent public health measures including quarantining exposed individuals and social distancing have been implemented in most states, while some states have even started the process of re-opening after considering both the economic and public health consequences of social distancing measures. While prevention is crucial, both novel agents and medications already in use with other indications are being investigated in clinical trials for patients with COVID-19. The collaboration between healthcare providers, health systems, patients, private sectors, and local and national governments is needed to protect both healthcare providers and patients to ultimately overcome this pandemic. The purpose of this review is to summarize the peer-reviewed and preprint literature on the epidemiology, transmission, clinical presentation, and available therapies as well as to propose a preventive strategy to overcome the present global pandemic.","['Krittanawong C', 'Maitra N', 'Kumar A', 'Hahn J', 'Wang Z', 'Carrasco D', 'Zhang HJ', 'Sun T', 'Jneid H', 'Virani SS']",2022,12,4,Am J Cardiovasc Dis,"Krittanawong C, et al.

Enormous data are being collected every day that could provide insight into reducing the false diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) could be the way forward to process these data and reduce the false diagnosis rates. In this study, ML and DL approaches have been applied to the data set collected using an ultra-fast COVID-19 diagnostic sensor (UFC-19). The ability of ML and DL to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 signals against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human CoV, and Influenza was investigated. UFC-19 is an electrochemical sensor that was used to test these virus samples and the obtained current response dataset was used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 using different algorithms. Our results indicate that the convolution neural networks algorithm could diagnose SARS-CoV-2 samples with a sensitivity of 96.15%, specificity of 98.17%, and accuracy of 97.20%. Combining this DL model with the existing UFC-19 could selectively identify SARS-CoV-2 presence within two minutes.","['Gecgel O', 'Ramanujam A', 'Botte GG']",2022,14,9,Viruses,"Gecgel O, et al.

NP packages the viral RNA during virus assembly and is, therefore, indispensable for virus reproduction. NP consists of two domains, i.e., the N- and C-terminal domains. RNA-binding is mainly performed by a binding pocket within the N-terminal domain (NTD). NP represents an important target for drug discovery to treat COVID-19. In this project, we used the Vina LC virtual drug screening software and a ZINC-based database with 210,541 natural and naturally derived compounds that specifically target the binding pocket of NTD of NP. Our aim was to identify coronaviral inhibitors that target NP not only of SARS-CoV-2 but also of other diverse human pathogenic coronaviruses. Virtual drug screening and molecular docking procedures resulted in 73 candidate compounds with a binding affinity below -9 kcal/mol with NP NTD of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HoC-229E, and HCoV-HKU1.

36129908,MERS-CoV ORF4b is a virulence factor involved in the inflammatory pathology induced in the lungs of mice.,"No vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are authorized against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) despite its high mortality rate and prevalence in dromedary camels. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has been causing sporadic zoonotic infections in humans, which poses a risk of genetic evolution to become a pandemic virus. MERS-CoV genome encodes five accessory proteins, 3, 4a, 4b, 5 and 8b for which limited information is available in the context of infection. This work describes 4b as a virulence factor in vivo, since the deletion mutant of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV-Δ4b (MERS-CoV-MA-Δ4b) was completely attenuated in a humanized DPP4 knock-in mouse model, resulting in no mortality. Attenuation in the absence of 4b was associated with a significant reduction in lung pathology and chemokine expression levels at 4 and 6 days post-infection, suggesting that 4b contributed to the induction of lung inflammatory pathology. The accumulation of 4b in the nucleus in vivo was not relevant to virulence, since deletion of its nuclear localization signal led to 100% mortality. Interestingly, the presence of 4b protein was found to regulate autophagy in the lungs of mice, leading to upregulation of BECN1, ATG3 and LC3A mRNA. Further analysis in MRC-5 cell line showed that, in the context of infection, MERS-CoV-MA 4b inhibited autophagy, as confirmed by the increase of p62 and the decrease of ULK1 protein levels, either by direct or indirect mechanisms. Together, these results correlated autophagy activation in the absence of 4b with downregulation of a pathogenic inflammatory response, thus contributing to attenuation of MERS-CoV-MA-Δ4b.","['Bello-Perez M', 'Hurtado-Tamayo J', 'Requena-Platek R', 'Canton J', 'Sánchez-Cordón PJ', 'Fernandez-Delgado R', 'Enjuanes L', 'Sola I']",2022,18,9,PLoS Pathog,"Bello-Perez M, et al.

36125414,Large-Scale Functionalized Metasurface-Based SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Quantification.,"Plasmonic metasurfaces consist of metal-dielectric interfaces that are excitable at background and leakage resonant modes. The sharp and plasmonic excitation profile of metal-free electrons on metasurfaces at the nanoscale can be used for practical applications in diverse fields, including optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and biosensing. Currently, Fano resonant metasurface fabrication processes for biosensor applications are costly, need clean room access, and involve limited small-scale surface areas that are not easy for accurate sample placement. Here, we leverage the large-scale active area with uniform surface patterns present on optical disc-based metasurfaces as a cost-effective method to excite asymmetric plasmonic modes, enabling tunable optical Fano resonance interfacing with a microfluidic channel for multiple target detection in the visible wavelength range. We engineered plasmonic metasurfaces for biosensing through efficient layer-by-layer surface functionalization toward real-time measurement of target binding at the molecular scale. Further, we demonstrated the quantitative detection of antibodies, proteins, and the whole viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity and specificity, even distinguishing it from similar RNA viruses such as influenza and MERS. This cost-effective plasmonic metasurface platform offers a small-scale light-manipulation system, presenting considerable potential for fast, real-time detection of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogens in resource-limited settings.","['Ahmed R', 'Guimarães CF', 'Wang J', 'Soto F', 'Karim AH', 'Zhang Z', 'Reis RL', 'Akin D', 'Paulmurugan R', 'Demirci U']",2022,16,10,ACS Nano,"Ahmed R, et al.

36125275,SARS-CoV-2 Diverges from Other Betacoronaviruses in Only Partially Activating the IRE1α/XBP1 Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway in Human Lung-Derived Cells.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed over 6 million individuals worldwide and continues to spread in countries where vaccines are not yet widely available or its citizens are hesitant to become vaccinated. Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed to be essential for viral replication. We examined the master UPR sensor IRE1α kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1α-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found that human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1α as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1α through autophosphorylation, but its RNase activity fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, while IRE1α was dispensable for replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested, it was required for maximal expression of genes associated with several key cellular functions, including the interferon signaling pathway, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1α, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.

36122669,Non-severe COVID-19 complicated by cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion): a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019- (COVID-19-) associated cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs) have been reported as a rare neurological abnormality in severe cases. Here, a case of CLOCCs in the early stages of mild COVID-19 infection during the Omicron BA.1 epidemic is reported along with a literature review.
CASE REPORT: A Japanese woman with COVID-19 presented to the emergency department with altered consciousness and cerebellar symptoms a day after fever onset. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion with restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum. She exhibited no complications of pneumonia, her neurological symptoms resolved after two days, and after 10 days, the brain lesion was not detected on MRI.
LITERATURE REVIEW: The PubMed database was searched for case reports that met the CLOCC definition proposed by Starkey et al. The search yielded 15 COVID-19-associated cases reported as CLOCCs and 13 cases described under former terms, including mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion. Adult cases with a documented course were accompanied by pneumonia or hypoxemia, whereas pediatric cases were mostly accompanied by a multisystem inflammatory syndrome.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated CLOCCs can occur, even at an early, non-severe stage. Therefore, this condition may be underdiagnosed if MRI is not performed.","['Kubo M', 'Kubo K', 'Kobayashi KI', 'Komiya N']",2022,125,,Int J Infect Dis,"Kubo M, et al.

36115766,Investigation of the potential of leukoreduction filters in the creation of anti-inflammatory compound.,"BACKGROUND: Some viruses such as SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS cause an imbalance in immune responses and leads to an acute inflammatory reaction named cytokine storm. In this situation, an anti-inflammatory component can modulate the immune system and decrease mortality. The aim of this study was investigate the potential of leukoreduction filters (LRFs) in creating an anti-inflammatory compound.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, firstly optimal dose of the anti-inflammatory drug was obtained through LRFs treatment with 0.1 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.6 mg of Betamethasone. Then inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine in gene and protein level was evaluated. In the next step, LRFs were categorized into treatment 1, treatment 2, control assay, and control groups and treated with the optimal dose of the drug. Finally, the obtained compound was investigated for the concentration of IL1, IL6, and TNF-α as inflammatory and IL4, IL1Ra, and IL10 as anti-inflammatory cytokines.
RESULTS: The results of the current study showed that the concentration of 0.4 mg of Betamethasone lead to a significant increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine in gene and protein levels. The results also showed that the Betamethasone treated groups (treatment1) causes a significant increase in the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine compares to the control while inflammatory cytokine remained at the control level.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that under influence of anti-inflammatory drug treatments the production and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines can be induced in LRFs.","['Balagholi S', 'Dabbaghi R', 'Mohammadi S', 'Abbasi Malati Z', 'Javan MR', 'Eshghi P']",2023,62,1,Transfus Apher Sci,"Balagholi S, et al.

In this work, eight ion-pairing systems at two concentrations buffered with acetic acid were used with octadecyl column to investigate the effects of temperature (in the range from 20 °C to 90 °C) on retention, diastereomeric separation, resolution of mers of different length and resolution of oligonucleotides with different number of phosphorothioate linkages. It was observed that elevated temperature suppresses the diastereomeric separation and oligonucleotide peaks become narrower. This improves the resolution of n and n-1 mers at elevated temperature. Plots of ln k (k = retention factor) versus reciprocal absolute temperature show that for 100 mM ion-pairing systems the increase in temperature does not lead to simple decrease in oligonucleotides retention as generally observed in reversed-phase liquid chromatography.

36103437,Efficient Approximate Kernel Based Spike Sequence Classification.,"Machine learning (ML) models, such as SVM, for tasks like classification and clustering of sequences, require a definition of distance/similarity between pairs of sequences. Several methods have been proposed to compute the similarity between sequences, such as the exact approach that counts the number of matches between k-mers (sub-sequences of length k) and an approximate approach that estimates pairwise similarity scores. Although exact methods yield better classification performance, they pose high computational costs, limiting their applicability to a small number of sequences. The approximate algorithms are proven to be more scalable and perform comparably to (sometimes better than) the exact methods - they are designed in a ""general"" way to deal with different types of sequences (e.g., music, protein, etc.). Although general applicability is a desired property of an algorithm, it is not the case in all scenarios. For example, in the current COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, there is a need for an approach that can deal specifically with the coronavirus. To this end, we propose a series of ways to improve the performance of the approximate kernel (using minimizers and information gain) in order to enhance its predictive performance pm coronavirus sequences. More specifically, we improve the quality of the approximate kernel using domain knowledge (computed using information gain) and efficient preprocessing (using minimizers computation) to classify coronavirus spike protein sequences corresponding to different variants (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Gamma). We report results using different classification and clustering algorithms and evaluate their performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Using two datasets, we show that our proposed method helps improve the kernel's performance compared to the baseline and state-of-the-art approaches in the healthcare domain.","['Ali S', 'Sahoo B', 'Khan MA', 'Zelikovsky A', 'Khan IU', 'Patterson M']",2022,PP,,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,"Ali S, et al.

36096737,CMIC: predicting DNA methylation inheritance of CpG islands with embedding vectors of variable-length k-mers.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications established in mammalian gametes are largely reprogrammed during early development, however, are partly inherited by the embryo to support its development. In this study, we examine CpG island (CGI) sequences to predict whether a mouse blastocyst CGI inherits oocyte-derived DNA methylation from the maternal genome. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including that based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), have recently been employed for variable-length inputs in classification and regression analyses. One advantage of this strategy is the ability of RNNs to automatically learn latent features embedded in inputs by learning their model parameters. However, the available CGI dataset applied for the prediction of oocyte-derived DNA methylation inheritance are not large enough to train the neural networks.
RESULTS: We propose a GRU-based model called CMIC (CGI Methylation Inheritance Classifier) to augment CGI sequence by converting it into variable-length k-mers, where the length k is randomly selected from the range [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], N times, which were then used as neural network input. N was set to 1000 in the default setting. In addition, we proposed a new embedding vector generator for k-mers called splitDNA2vec. The randomness of this procedure was higher than the previous work, dna2vec.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that CMIC can predict the inheritance of oocyte-derived DNA methylation at CGIs in the maternal genome of blastocysts with a high F-measure (0.93). We also show that the F-measure can be improved by increasing the parameter N, that is, the number of sequences of variable-length k-mers derived from a single CGI sequence. This implies the effectiveness of augmenting input data by converting a DNA sequence to N sequences of variable-length k-mers. This approach can be applied to different DNA sequence classification and regression analyses, particularly those involving a small amount of data.","['Maruyama O', 'Li Y', 'Narita H', 'Toh H', 'Au Yeung WK', 'Sasaki H']",2022,23,1,BMC Bioinformatics,"Maruyama O, et al.

36095903,People with chronic wounds cared for at home in Belgium: Prevalence and exploration of care integration needs using health care trajectory analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the prevalence of people with chronic wounds cared for at home and their care integration needs in Belgium. In high-income countries, chronic wounds are associated with ageing processes, chronic diseases and social and financial vulnerability, resulting in multiple needs. To meet these needs, many health care providers (with nurses figuring prominently) are involved. This can lead to fragmented health care trajectories and the need to strengthen care coordination.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the prevalence of people with chronic wounds cared for at home in Belgium. It also seeks to explore their health care trajectories and the risk of fragmentation of care to inform policy makers, care providers and research.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING(S): Home care.
PARTICIPANTS: Routinely collected data of reimbursed care of 3467 people with a chronic wound cared for at home in 2018.
METHODS: We applied a stratification method to our sample based on health care trajectories. First, we constructed individual sequences of care received during the year. Then we summarised the health care events using a K-mers approach. Finally, a multinomial mixture model was used on the previously obtained summary to cluster individuals according to their health care trajectories. Afterwards, other epidemiological, socioeconomic and health care use indicators were calculated for each health care trajectory group. We also estimated the prevalence of people with chronic wounds treated at home.
RESULTS: We constructed six health care trajectory groups for two age categories (<65 and ≥65 years) showing different intensity of care use and type of care. In some health care trajectory groups, generalist care was found to be predominant. In others, specialist care appeared more prevalent. Depending on the health care trajectory group, a significant proportion of people had multiple care providers involved (mainly nurses, medical specialists and GPs), and many of them also had multiple transitions between care settings. The prevalence of people with chronic wounds treated at home rises significantly with age: 0.3%, 95%CI (0.2%-0.4%) for people aged under 65, 2.5%, 95%CI (2.3%-2.8%) for people aged 65 and over.
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of people with chronic wounds experienced multiple transitions and met many health care providers. This can lead to complex trajectories and risk of fragmentation. Nurses, who are intensively involved in wound care at home, with the appropriate skills, could play a 'reference' role to promote continuity of care and better coordination.

The frequent mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has rendered disease control with vaccines and antiviral drugs quite challenging, with newer variants surfacing constantly. There is therefore the need for newer, effective and efficacious drugs against coronaviruses. Considering the central role of RNA dependent, RNA polymerase (RdRp) as an enzyme necessary for the virus life cycle and its conservation among coronaviruses, we investigated potential host miRNAs that can be employed as broad-range antiviral drugs averse to coronaviruses, with particular emphasis on BCoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs are small molecules capable of binding mRNA and regulate expression at transcriptional or translational levels. Our hypothesis is that host miRNAs have the potential of blocking coronavirus replication through miRNA-RdRp mRNA interaction. To investigate this, we retrieved the open reading frame (ORF1ab) nucleotide sequences and used them to interrogate miRNA databases for miRNAs that can bind them. We employed various bioinformatics tools to predict and identify the most effective host miRNAs. In all, we found 27 miRNAs that target RdRp mRNA sequence of multiple coronaviruses, of which three - hsa-miR-1283, hsa-miR-579-3p, and hsa-miR-664b-3p target BCoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Like most infectious diseases common to humans, coronavirus infections were first discovered in animals. Due to the increased rate of replication and recombination activity compared to other viruses, mutations occur more often in the genome of coronaviruses, which contribute to the acquisition of new qualities in order to consolidate in the host organism. Examples of cross-species transmission are not only SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which are dangerous to humans, but also coronaviruses of agricultural and domestic animals, between which there is a genetic relationship. There are several known cases of zoo, wild, domestic, and farm animals displaying symptoms characteristic of COVID-19 and identification of the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in them. The issue of cross-species transmission of coronavirus infections, in particular the reverse zoonosis of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans, is widely discussed. According to the conclusions of many researchers, including OIE experts, there is no direct evidence base for infection of humans with COVID-19 from animals. However, people with suspected COVID-19 and with a confirmed diagnosis are still advised to isolate not only from people but also from animals.

36075899,A novel cyclic γ-AApeptide-based long-acting pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor with potential oral bioavailability by targeting two sites in spike protein.,"The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are the targets of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and pan-coronavirus (CoV) fusion inhibitory peptides, respectively. However, neither nAb- nor peptide-based drugs can be used orally. In this study, we screened a one-bead-two-compound (OBTC) cyclic γ-AApeptide library against SARS-CoV-2 S protein and identified a hit: S-20 with potent membrane fusion inhibitory activity, but moderate selectivity index (SI). After modification, one derivative, S-20-1, exhibited improved fusion inhibitory activity and SI (>1000). S-20-1 could effectively inhibit infection by pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron), as well as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. It could also inhibit infection of a pseudotyped SARS-related coronavirus WIV1 (SARSr-CoV-WIV1) from bats. Intranasal application of S-20-1 to mice before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 or SARS-CoV-2 provided significant protection from infection. Importantly, S-20-1 was highly resistant to proteolytic degradation, had long half-life, and possessed favorable oral bioavailability. Mechanistic studies suggest that S-20-1 binds with high affinity to RBD in S1 and HR1 domain in S2 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Thus, with its pan-CoV fusion and entry inhibitory activity by targeting two sites in S protein, desirable half-life, and promising oral bioavailability, S-20-1 is a potential candidate for further development as a novel therapeutic and prophylactic drug against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as future emerging and reemerging CoVs.","['Xue S', 'Wang X', 'Wang L', 'Xu W', 'Xia S', 'Sun L', 'Wang S', 'Shen N', 'Yang Z', 'Huang B', 'Li S', 'Cao C', 'Calcul L', 'Sun X', 'Lu L', 'Cai J', 'Jiang S']",2022,8,1,Cell Discov,"Xue S, et al.

36066146,Multiple encephalopathy syndrome: a case of a novel radiological subtype of acute encephalopathy in childhood.,"INTRODUCTION: This report presents the case of a novel subtype of acute encephalopathy syndrome in childhood found in a patient with influenza type A infection; the patient exhibited evident magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.
CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old boy was transferred to our hospital for prolonged (lasting 60 min) status epilepticus with influenza encephalopathy. Mild brain hypothermia therapy was applied for 72 h, followed by targeted temperature management for 96 h with mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Moreover, methylprednisolone pulse therapy and immunoglobulin therapy were administered. One month after the treatment, his physical status recovered such that he was able to run, take food orally, communicate verbally, and successfully return to kindergarten. Interestingly, serial MRI studies revealed findings that were compatible with 1) acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), 2) mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS type II), 3) acute cerebellitis, and 4) acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD) on days 2, 4, 7, and 16, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, these significant MRI findings associated with acute encephalopathy have never been reported. Thus, herein, we propose the new term radiological ""multiple encephalopathy syndrome (MES)"" based on our case of acute encephalopathy in childhood.","['Fujita Y', 'Imataka G', 'Sakuma H', 'Takanashi JI', 'Yoshihara S']",2022,26,16,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Fujita Y, et al.

A fractional derivative of the non-singular Mittag-Leffler type is used in this research to conduct a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of MERS-CoV infection transmission. The dynamics of such a disease with an additional degree of freedom and non-singular behavior are discovered through the use of the aforementioned fractional operator, and this is one of the important components of our prepared paper. Using the concept of fixed point theory, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are demonstrated. The stability analysis is also tested with the help of the Ulam-Hyers approach, respectively. The numerical solution has been conducted by using the fractional Adams-Bashforth scheme. In the numerical simulation, all classes are demonstrated through the graphical presentation regarding the changing values of fractional-order at time t. The results at various fractional-order laying between (0,1] are drawn with the help of Matlab. We also provide a comparison of the proposed approach with that of the Caputo operator. The outcomes that were achieved illustrate that the considered scheme is highly methodical and very efficient compared to the Caputo fractional operator.","['Mahmood T', 'Al-Duais FS', 'Sun M']",2022,606,,Physica A,"Mahmood T, et al.

36063274,Current clinical status of new COVID-19 vaccines and immunotherapy.,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-strand RNA belonging to Coronaviridae family, along with MERS and SARS. Since its first report in 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has affected over 530 million people and led to 6.3 million deaths worldwide until June 2022. Despite eleven vaccines being used worldwide already, new variants are of concern. Therefore, the governing bodies are re-evaluating the strategies for achieving universal vaccination. Initially, the WHO expected that vaccines showing around 50-80% efficacy would develop in 1-2 years. However, US-FDA announced emergency approval of the two m-RNA vaccines within 11 months of vaccine development, which enabled early vaccination for healthcare workers in many countries. Later, in January 2021, 63 vaccine candidates were under human clinical trials and 172 under preclinical development. Currently, the number of such clinical studies is still increasing. In this review, we have summarized the updates on the clinical status of the COVID-19 and the available treatments. Additionally, COVID-19 had created negative impacts on world's economy; affected agriculture, industries, and tourism service sectors; and majorly affected low-income countries. The review discusses the clinical outcomes, latest statistics, socio-economic impacts of pandemic and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2, and strategies against the new variant of concern. The review will help understand the current status of vaccines and other therapies while also providing insights about upcoming vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 management.","['Nagpal D', 'Nagpal S', 'Kaushik D', 'Kathuria H']",2022,29,47,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Nagpal D, et al.

36061136,Exploring the relationship between national governance indicators and speed of initial government response to COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the relationship between national governance and country response to the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries, to support preparedness for the next pandemic. We conducted a statistical analysis of 116 countries, examining the relationship between speed of initial response and measures of national governance.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study, with individual countries as the unit of analysis.
METHODS: We used logistic regression to look for associations between quicker initial government response and four national governance indicators: Government Effectiveness, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Voice and Accountability, and Corruption Perceptions Index.
RESULTS: A quicker initial government response was associated with countries with higher Government Effectiveness (OR 13.92 95% CI 3.69-52.48, p < 0.001) and lower Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.57, p = 0.002). There was no relationship observed between speed of initial government response and Voice and Accountability or Corruption Perceptions Index. Other factors associated with quicker initial response were small population size, experiencing first COVID-19 case after the pandemic declaration, not having previous experience with SARS-CoV1 or MERS and not being an island nation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that having higher state policy and implementation capacity, and lower political stability was associated with a quicker initial pandemic response. Limitations of this study include the use of crude national level indicators and broad categorisations of countries into quicker and slower responders. Deeper enquiry into the early decision-making processes taken at the national executive level within individual countries may help clarify the observed associations further.","['Nagasivam A', 'Fryatt R', 'de Habich M', 'Johns B']",2022,4,,Public Health Pract (Oxf),"Nagasivam A, et al.

36057949,Detection and genetic characterization of bat MERS-related coronaviruses in Japan.,"Betacoronaviruses, containing sarbecoviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) and merbecovirus such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused three human outbreaks in the past 2 decades; in particular, SARS-CoV-2 has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Since the ancestor of betacoronaviruses originated from wild bats, unidentified bat betacoronaviruses are presumed to be transmitted to humans in the future. In this study, we detected novel bat merbecoviruses from Vespertilio sinensis and Eptesicus japonensis, belonging to the family Vespertilionidae, in Japan. We found that these merbecoviruses were phylogenetically most closely related to the those previously detected in China. Alignment of the predicted receptor-binding motif on the spike proteins indicated that the Japanese bat merbecoviruses did not possess the specific amino acid residues that could be responsible for binding of MERS-CoV to the human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptor, which is unlikely to infect humans. This study demonstrated that bat merbecoviruses are widely conserved in multiple bat species of Vespertilionidae in East Asia, emphasizing the need for extensive epidemiological and biological studies on bat betacoronaviruses to facilitate the risk assessment of their spillover potential to humans.","['Murakami S', 'Kitamura T', 'Matsugo H', 'Yamamoto T', 'Mineshita K', 'Sakuyama M', 'Sasaki R', 'Takenaka-Uema A', 'Horimoto T']",2022,69,6,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Murakami S, et al.

36056630,Native and activated antithrombin inhibits TMPRSS2 activity and SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Host cell proteases such as TMPRSS2 are critical determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tropism and pathogenesis. Here, we show that antithrombin (AT), an endogenous serine protease inhibitor regulating coagulation, is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of coronavirus infection. Molecular docking and enzyme activity assays demonstrate that AT binds and inhibits TMPRSS2, a serine protease that primes the Spike proteins of coronaviruses for subsequent fusion. Consequently, AT blocks entry driven by the Spikes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern including Omicron, and suppresses lung cell infection with genuine SARS-CoV-2. Thus, AT is an endogenous inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 that may be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We further demonstrate that activation of AT by anticoagulants, such as heparin or fondaparinux, increases the anti-TMPRSS2 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of AT, suggesting that repurposing of native and activated AT for COVID-19 treatment should be explored.","['Wettstein L', 'Immenschuh P', 'Weil T', 'Conzelmann C', 'Almeida-Hernández Y', 'Hoffmann M', 'Kempf A', 'Nehlmeier I', 'Lotke R', 'Petersen M', 'Stenger S', 'Kirchhoff F', 'Sauter D', 'Pöhlmann S', 'Sanchez-Garcia E', 'Münch J']",2023,95,1,J Med Virol,"Wettstein L, et al.

Here, we show that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) accessory protein ORF4b has the most potential among the MERS-CoV accessory proteins to inhibit the TLR7/9-signaling-dependent alpha interferon production. ORF4b protein, which has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, was found to bind to IKKα, a kinase responsible for phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. This interaction caused relocation of a large proportion of IKKα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Studies using ORF4b and IKKα mutants demonstrated that ORF4b protein inhibited IKKα-mediated IRF7 phosphorylation by sequestering IKKα in the nucleus and by impeding the phosphorylation process of cytoplasmic IKKα.","['Kitagawa Y', 'Tsukamoto T', 'Itoh M', 'Gotoh B']",2022,596,19,FEBS Lett,"Kitagawa Y, et al.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have initiated investigations on developing an efficient and safe vaccine against the virus. From Moderna and Pfizer in the United States to PastocoVac in Pasteur Institute of Iran and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, different candidates have been introduced to the market. COVID-19 vaccine research has been facilitated based on genome and structural information, bioinformatics predictions, epitope mapping, and data obtained from the previous developments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccine candidates. SARS-CoV genome sequence is highly homologous to the one in COVID-19 and both viruses use the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Moreover, the immune system responds to these viruses, partially in the same way. Considering the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and previous attempts to manufacture SARS-CoV vaccines, this paper is going to discuss clinical cases as well as vaccine challenges, including those related to infrastructures, transportation, possible adverse reactions, utilized delivery systems (e.g., nanotechnology and electroporation) and probable vaccine-induced mutations.","['Abdolmaleki G', 'Taheri MA', 'Paridehpour S', 'Mohammadi NM', 'Tabatabaei YA', 'Mousavi T', 'Amin M']",2022,30,2,Daru,"Abdolmaleki G, et al.

36049288,A non-invasive ultrasensitive diagnostic approach for COVID-19 infection using salivary label-free SERS fingerprinting and artificial intelligence.,"Clinical diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection usually comprises the sampling of throat or nasopharyngeal swabs that are invasive and create patient discomfort. Hence, saliva is attempted as a sample of choice for the management of COVID-19 outbreaks that cripples the global healthcare system. Although limited by the risk of eliciting false-negative and positive results, tedious test procedures, requirement of specialized laboratories, and expensive reagents, nucleic acid-based tests remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, genetic diversity of the virus due to rapid mutations limits the efficiency of nucleic acid-based tests. Herein, we have demonstrated the simplest screening modality based on label-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (LF-SERS) for scrutinizing the SARS-CoV-2-mediated molecular-level changes of the saliva samples among healthy, COVID-19 infected and COVID-19 recovered subjects. Moreover, our LF-SERS technique enabled to differentiate the three classes of corona virus spike protein derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Raman spectral data was further decoded, segregated and effectively managed with the aid of machine learning algorithms. The classification models built upon biochemical signature-based discrimination method of the COVID-19 condition from the patient saliva ensured high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The trained support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% and F1-score of 94.73%, and 95.28% for healthy and COVID-19 infected patients respectively. The current approach not only differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection with healthy controls but also predicted a distinct fingerprint for different stages of patient recovery. Employing portable hand-held Raman spectrophotometer as the instrument and saliva as the sample of choice will guarantee a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic strategy to warrant or assure patient comfort and large-scale population screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection and monitoring the recovery process.","['Karunakaran V', 'Joseph MM', 'Yadev I', 'Sharma H', 'Shamna K', 'Saurav S', 'Sreejith RP', 'Anand V', 'Beegum R', 'Regi David S', 'Iype T', 'Sarada Devi KL', 'Nizarudheen A', 'Sharmad MS', 'Sharma R', 'Mukhiya R', 'Thouti E', 'Yoosaf K', 'Joseph J', 'Sujatha Devi P', 'Savithri S', 'Agarwal A', 'Singh S', 'Maiti KK']",2022,234,,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Karunakaran V, et al.

The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has increased the quest to explore phytochemicals as treatment options. We summarize phytochemicals with activity against various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We compiled 705 phytochemical compounds through text mining of 893 PubMed articles. The physicochemical properties including molecular weight, lipophilicity, and the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors were determined from the structures of these compounds. A structure-based evaluation of these properties with respect to drug likeness showed that most compounds have a positive score of drug likeness. QSAR analysis showed that 5 descriptors, namely polar surface area, relative polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond donors, solubility, and lipophilicity, are significantly related to IC50. We envisage that these phytochemicals could be further explored for developing new potential therapeutic molecules for COVID-19.

36036352,COVID-19 patients at referral to hospital during the first peak of disease: Common clinical findings including myalgia and fatigue.,"The wide range of manifestations and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 has made it a unique disease. Investigating the epidemiology of different clinical manifestations of this disease in patients referred to medical centers is one of the most effective steps in adopting a suitable diagnostic and treatment approach. These findings also provide a basis for comparing the evolution of the virus and its clinical manifestations over time and at different peaks of the disease. Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating common clinical findings at the time of referral in patients with COVID-19 in Afzalipour Hospital, Kerman, during the first peak of the disease. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, between March 2020 and June 2020. The patients were included in the study by census method, and the research variables related to demographic indicators, disease course and clinical symptoms were extracted from the patients' medical records, and then subjected to statistical analysis. In this study, a total of 210 patients were examined, consisted mainly of male patients (59.5%). The mean age was found to be 53.95 ± 19.55 years. Also, 20.3% of patients needed admission in the intensive care unit. In addition, 1% of patients were infected in February 2020, 24% in March 2020, 47.4% in April 2020 and 27.4% in May 2020. The mean onset of symptoms until hospitalization was also found as 6.51 days. The most common clinical symptoms included shortness of breath (75.7%), dry cough (52.9%), fever (50.5%), myalgia (45.7%) and fatigue (41.9%). Fever at admission time was significantly more common in ages less than 50 years (p=0.034). Our study showed that the most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath, dry cough, fever, myalgia and fatigue. No statistically significant difference was found in common symptoms between men and women. Among the common clinical symptoms, only fever at admission time was observed to be significantly higher in those under 50 years of age.","['Honarmand A', 'Sheybani F', 'Aflatoonian E', 'Saberinia A']",2022,32,3,Eur J Transl Myol,"Honarmand A, et al.

36033843,Vaccine-associated enhanced disease in humans and animal models: Lessons and challenges for vaccine development.,"The fight against infectious diseases calls for the development of safe and effective vaccines that generate long-lasting protective immunity. In a few situations, vaccine-mediated immune responses may have led to exacerbated pathology upon subsequent infection with the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. Such vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) has been reported, or at least suspected, in animal models, and in a few instances in humans, for vaccine candidates against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus (MV), dengue virus (DENV), HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although alleviated by clinical and epidemiological evidence, a number of concerns were also initially raised concerning the short- and long-term safety of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon are not yet completely understood, the individual and/or collective role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), complement-dependent enhancement, and cell-dependent enhancement have been highlighted. Here, we review mechanisms that may be associated with the risk of VAED, which are important to take into consideration, both in the assessment of vaccine safety and in finding ways to define models and immunization strategies that can alleviate such concerns.","['Bigay J', 'Le Grand R', 'Martinon F', 'Maisonnasse P']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Bigay J, et al.

36029810,Corticosteroids: A boon or bane for COVID-19 patients?,"Several drugs and antibodies have been repurposed to treat COVID-19. Since the outcome of the drugs and antibodies clinical studies have been mostly inconclusive or with lesser effects, therefore the need for alternative treatments has become unavoidable. However, corticosteroids, which have a history of therapeutic efficacy against coronaviruses (SARS and MERS), might emerge into one of the pandemic's heroic characters. Corticosteroids serve an immunomodulatory function in the post-viral hyper-inflammatory condition (the cytokine storm, or release syndrome), suppressing the excessive immunological response and preventing multi-organ failure and death. Therefore, corticosteroids have been used to treat COVID-19 patients for more than last two years. According to recent clinical trials and the results of observational studies, corticosteroids can be administered to patients with severe and critical COVID-19 symptoms with a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Corticosteroids like Hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, Prednisolone and Methylprednisolone has been reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 virus in comparison to that of non-steroid drugs, by using non-genomic and genomic effects to prevent and reduce inflammation in tissues and the circulation. Clinical trials also show that inhaled budesonide (a synthetic corticosteroid) increases time to recovery and has the potential to reduce hospitalizations or fatalities in persons with COVID-19.

36016329,"The Flexible, Extended Coil of the PDZ-Binding Motif of the Three Deadly Human Coronavirus E Proteins Plays a Role in Pathogenicity.","The less virulent human (h) coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 cause mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections, while the more virulent SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have caused severe outbreaks. The CoV envelope (E) protein, an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe hCoV infections, may provide insight into this disparate severity of the disease. We, therefore, generated full-length E protein models for SARS-CoV-1 and -2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and docked C-terminal peptides of each model to the PDZ domain of the human PALS1 protein. The PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 and MERS-CoV models adopted a more flexible, extended coil, while the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 models adopted a less flexible alpha helix. All the E peptides docked to PALS1 occupied the same binding site and the more virulent hCoV E peptides generally interacted more stably with PALS1 than the less virulent ones. We hypothesize that the increased flexibility of the PBM in the more virulent hCoVs facilitates more stable binding to various host proteins, thereby contributing to more severe disease. This is the first paper to model full-length 3D structures for both the more virulent and less virulent hCoV E proteins, providing novel insights for possible drug and/or vaccine development.","['Schoeman D', 'Cloete R', 'Fielding BC']",2022,14,8,Viruses,"Schoeman D, et al.

36016218,Immunogenicity of High-Dose MVA-Based MERS Vaccine Candidate in Mice and Camels.,"UNLABELLED: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen that can transmit from dromedary camels to humans, causing severe pneumonia, with a 35% mortality rate. Vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in mice, camels, and humans. Previously, we developed a vaccine based on the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) viral vector, encoding a full-length spike protein of MERS-CoV, MVA-MERS. Here, we report the immunogenicity of high-dose MVA-MERS in prime-boost vaccinations in mice and camels.
METHODS: Three groups of mice were immunised with MVA wild-type (MVA-wt) and MVA-MERS (MVA-wt/MVA-MERS), MVA-MERS/MVA-wt, or MVA-MERS/MVA-MERS. Camels were immunised with two doses of PBS, MVA-wt, or MVA-MERS. Antibody (Ab) responses were evaluated using ELISA and MERS pseudovirus neutralisation assays.
RESULTS: Two high doses of MVA-MERS induced strong Ab responses in both mice and camels, including neutralising antibodies. Anti-MVA Ab responses did not affect the immune responses to the vaccine antigen (MERS-CoV spike).
CONCLUSIONS: MVA-MERS vaccine, administered in a homologous prime-boost regimen, induced high levels of neutralising anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in mice and camels. This could be considered for further development and evaluation as a dromedary vaccine to reduce MERS-CoV transmission to humans.","['Alharbi NK', 'Aljamaan F', 'Aljami HA', 'Alenazi MW', 'Albalawi H', 'Almasoud A', 'Alharthi FJ', 'Azhar EI', 'Barhoumi T', 'Bosaeed M', 'Gilbert SC', 'Hashem AM']",2022,10,8,Vaccines (Basel),"Alharbi NK, et al.

36014999,Hydrophobic Alpha-Helical Short Peptides in Overlapping Reading Frames of the Coronavirus Genome.,"In this study, we show that the coronavirus (CoV) genome may encode many functional hydrophobic alpha-helical peptides (HAHPs) in overlapping reading frames of major coronaviral proteins throughout the entire viral genome. These HAHPs can theoretically be expressed from non-canonical sub-genomic (sg)RNAs that are synthesized in substantial amounts in infected cells. We selected and analyzed five and six HAHPs encoded in the S gene regions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively. Two and three HAHPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, respectively, specifically interacted with both the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV S proteins and inhibited their membrane fusion activity. Furthermore, one of the SARS-CoV-2 HAHPs specifically inhibited viral RNA synthesis by accumulating at the site of viral RNA synthesis. Our data show that a group of HAHPs in the coronaviral genome potentially has a regulatory role in viral propagation.","['Okura T', 'Shirato K', 'Kakizaki M', 'Sugimoto S', 'Matsuyama S', 'Tanaka T', 'Kume Y', 'Chishiki M', 'Ono T', 'Moriishi K', 'Sonoyama M', 'Hosoya M', 'Hashimoto K', 'Maenaka K', 'Takeda M']",2022,11,8,Pathogens,"Okura T, et al.

36010203,Long-Term Health Consequences of SARS-CoV-2: Assumptions Based on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV Infections.,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is one of the worst pandemics in the history of the world. It is the third coronavirus disease that has afflicted humans in a short span of time. The world appears to be recovering from the grasp of this deadly pandemic; still, its post-disease health effects are not clearly understood. It is evident that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients usually recovered over time; however, disease manifestation is reported to still exist in some patients even after complete recovery. The disease is known to have left irreversible damage(s) among some patients and these damages are expected to cause mild or severe degrees of health effects. Apart from the apparent damage to the lungs caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-surviving patients display a wide spectrum of dysfunctions in different organ systems that is similar to what occurs with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS diseases. The major long COVID-19 manifestations include the following aspects: (1) central nervous system, (2) cardiovascular, (3) pulmonary, (4) gastrointestinal, (5) hematologic, (6) renal and (7) psycho-social systems. COVID-19 has a disease display manifestation in these organs and its related systems amongst a large number of recovered cases.

Hashing is also crucial for efficiently storing abundant sequence data. Here, we introduce ntHash2, a fast algorithm for spaced seed hashing that can be integrated into various bioinformatics tools for efficient sequence analysis with applications in genome research.
RESULTS: ntHash2 is up to 2.1× faster at hashing various spaced seeds than the previous version and 3.8× faster than conventional hashing algorithms with naïve adaptation. Additionally, we reduced the collision rate of ntHash for longer k-mer lengths and improved the uniformity of the hash distribution by modifying the canonical hashing mechanism.

35998203,Human coronaviruses disassemble processing bodies.,"A dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine response is characteristic of severe coronavirus infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, yet our understanding of the underlying mechanism responsible for this imbalanced immune response remains incomplete. Processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that control innate immune responses by mediating the constitutive decay or suppression of mRNA transcripts, including many that encode proinflammatory cytokines. PB formation promotes turnover or suppression of cytokine RNAs, whereas PB disassembly corresponds with the increased stability and/or translation of these cytokine RNAs. Many viruses cause PB disassembly, an event that can be viewed as a switch that rapidly relieves cytokine RNA repression and permits the infected cell to respond to viral infection. Prior to this submission, no information was known about how human coronaviruses (CoVs) impacted PBs. Here, we show SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold CoVs, OC43 and 229E, induced PB loss. We screened a SARS-CoV-2 gene library and identified that expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2 was sufficient to mediate PB disassembly. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that transcripts encoding TNF and IL-6 localized to PBs in control cells. PB loss correlated with the increased cytoplasmic localization of these transcripts in SARS-CoV-2 N protein-expressing cells. Ectopic expression of the N proteins from five other human coronaviruses (OC43, MERS, 229E, NL63 and SARS-CoV) did not cause significant PB disassembly, suggesting that this feature is unique to SARS-CoV-2 N protein. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-mediated PB disassembly contributes to the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production observed during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Kleer M', 'Mulloy RP', 'Robinson CA', 'Evseev D', 'Bui-Marinos MP', 'Castle EL', 'Banerjee A', 'Mubareka S', 'Mossman K', 'Corcoran JA']",2022,18,8,PLoS Pathog,"Kleer M, et al.

35997564,MMGraph: a multiple motif predictor based on graph neural network and coexisting probability for ATAC-seq data.,"MOTIVATION: Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) prediction is a crucial step in revealing functions of transcription factors from high-throughput sequencing data. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides insight on TFBSs and nucleosome positioning by probing open chromatic, which can simultaneously reveal multiple TFBSs compare to traditional technologies. The existing tools based on convolutional neural network (CNN) only find the fixed length of TFBSs from ATAC-seq data. Graph neural network (GNN) can be considered as the extension of CNN, which has great potential in finding multiple TFBSs with different lengths from ATAC-seq data.
RESULTS: We develop a motif predictor called MMGraph based on three-layer GNN and coexisting probability of k-mers for finding multiple motifs from ATAC-seq data.

Although antigen/antibody-based immunoassays and neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been successfully developed over the past 2 years, they are often inefficient and unreliable for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Novel approaches against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are therefore urgently needed. Aptamers have been developed for the detection and inhibition of several different viruses such as HIV, influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV. Aptamers targeting SARS-CoV-2 represent a promising tool in the fight against COVID-19, which is of paramount importance for the current and any future pandemics.

It is a severe issue and a major task not only for health care experts but also for governments to contain this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the human coronavirus family to be implicated in this zoonotic outbreak. COVID-19's CV interactions are comparable to those of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and influenza. Those who have COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are at a higher risk of serious illness and mortality, and disease has been linked to several direct and indirect CV consequences. COVID-19 causes CVDs such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, and acute myocardial damage (AMD) as a consequence of acute coronary syndrome. The provision of CV care may expose health care professionals to risk as they become hosts or vectors of viral transmission. It binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor, causing constitutional and pulmonary signs in the beginning, and then as the infection advances, it affects other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, CVS, neurological system, and so on.

35983235,EL-RMLocNet: An explainable LSTM network for RNA-associated multi-compartment localization prediction.,"Subcellular localization of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecules provide significant insights into the functionality of RNAs and helps to explore their association with various diseases. Predominantly developed single-compartment localization predictors (SCLPs) lack to demystify RNA association with diverse biochemical and pathological processes mainly happen through RNA co-localization in multiple compartments. Limited multi-compartment localization predictors (MCLPs) manage to produce decent performance only for target RNA class of particular sub-type. Further, existing computational approaches have limited practical significance and potential to optimize therapeutics due to the poor degree of model explainability. The paper in hand presents an explainable Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network ""EL-RMLocNet"", predictive performance and interpretability of which are optimized using a novel GeneticSeq2Vec statistical representation learning scheme and attention mechanism for accurate multi-compartment localization prediction of different RNAs solely using raw RNA sequences. GeneticSeq2Vec generates optimized statistical vectors of raw RNA sequences by capturing short and long range relations of nucleotide k-mers. Using sequence vectors generated by GeneticSeq2Vec scheme, Long Short Term Memory layers extract most informative features, weighting of which on the basis of discriminative potential for accurate multi-compartment localization prediction is performed using attention layer. Through reverse engineering, weights of statistical feature space are mapped to nucleotide k-mers patterns to make multi-compartment localization prediction decision making transparent and explainable for different RNA classes and species. Empirical evaluation indicates that EL-RMLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art predictor for subcellular localization prediction of 4 different RNA classes by an average accuracy figure of 8% for Homo Sapiens species and 6% for Mus Musculus species.

One such effort has involved the assembly of oligomers of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a synthetic precursor of polydopamine (PDA), into melanin-mimicking nanoparticles for use in a variety of applications with desired optical, photonic, thermal, and electrical properties. In many of these applications, the PDA nanoparticles are mixed with other polymers or oligomers, thus motivating this specific study to understand how the surface characteristics of the assembled PDA-nanoparticles affect their interaction with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains in aqueous solution. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the interaction of linear 20-mer PEG chains with different PDA-nanoparticles assembled using four types of oligomers of 5,6-DHI: two isomers of 5,6-DHI 2-mers with the monomers bonding either at the 2-2' position (A-type isomer) or 7-7' position (B-type isomer), denoted as A:2-mer and B:2-mer, respectively, and a 4-mer and an 8-mer of B-type chemistry denoted as B:4-mer and B:8-mer, respectively. Using explicit-solvent atomistic MD simulations, we find that PDA-nanoparticle surfaces assembled from B:8-mer exhibit smaller density fluctuations of water molecules and, as a result, are relatively more hydrophilic than the PDA-nanoparticle surfaces assembled from A:2-mer, B:2-mer, and B:4-mer. The surface composition of PDA-nanoparticles assembled from A:2-mer contains relatively fewer hydroxyl (-OH) groups compared to PDA-nanoparticles assembled from a B:2-mer, B:4-mer, or B:8-mer, yet the sample of PEG chains show more collapsed and adsorbed conformations on A:2-mer nanoparticles' surface. To explain the atomistically observed behavior of PEG chains on the nanoparticles' surfaces, we use coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations and explain the roles of the pattern formed by the attractive sites (e.g.,-OH groups) exposed on the surface and the roughness of the surface on interactions with a genric PEG-like copolymer chain. By comparing atomistic and CG MD simulation results, we confirm that the -OH groups' pattern on the surface of the PDA-nanoparticle assembled from A:2-mer is patchier than the random or string-like patterns on the PDA-nanoparticle assembled from B:2-mer, B:4-mer, or B:8-mer, and it is this -OH groups' surface pattern that dictates the PEG chain conformations and adsorption on the PDA-nanoparticle surface. Overall, these results guide the design of chemically and physically heterogeneous nanoparticle surfaces for the desired polymer interaction and conformations.","['Kapoor U', 'Jayaraman A']",2022,126,33,J Phys Chem B,Kapoor U and Jayaraman A.

What have we learned?,"In this commentary, we bring together knowledge on sex-differences in excess death during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most hit European countries. We zoom into Italian regions to account for the spatial gradient of the spread of the virus. Analyses of excess death by sex during the COVID-19 pandemic have been possible thanks to weekly mortality data released by national statistical offices, mainly in developed countries. The general finding is that males up to 75 years old have been suffering more excess death compared to females. However, the picture is less clear-cut at older ages. During previous epidemics, such as SARS, Swine Flu, and MERS, studies are limited and produce scattered, non-conclusive evidence. Knowledge of the sex-pattern of susceptibility to mortality from virulent respiratory diseases and its interplay with age could improve crisis management during future epidemics and pandemics. National statistical offices should provide weekly mortality data with spatial granularity, disaggregated by sex and age groups, to allow for such analyses.","['Rizzi S', 'Strozza C', 'Zarulli V']",2022,78,1,Genus,"Rizzi S, et al.

35966177,Nature of viruses and pandemics: Coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genome among RNA viruses and store large amounts of information without genome integration as they replicate in the cell cytoplasm. The replication of the virus is a continuous process, whereas the transcription of the subgenomic mRNAs is a discontinuous one, involving a template switch, which resembles a high frequency recombination mechanism that may favor virus genome variability. The origin of the three deadly human CoVs SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are zoonotic events. SARS-CoV-2 has incorporated in its spike protein a furine proteolytic site that facilitates the activation of the virus in any tissue, making this CoV strain highly polytropic and pathogenic. Using MERS-CoV as a model, a propagation-deficient RNA replicon was generated by removing E protein gene (essential for viral morphogenesis and involved in virulence), and accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b and 5 (responsible for antagonism of the innate immune response) to attenuate the virus: MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E]. This RNA replicon is strongly attenuated and elicits sterilizing protection after a single immunization in transgenic mice with the receptor for MERS-CoV, making it a promising vaccine candidate for this virus and an interesting platform for vector-based vaccine development. A strategy could be developed for the design of RNA replicon vaccines for other human pathogenic coronaviruses.","['Enjuanes L', 'Sola I', 'Zúñiga S', 'Honrubia JM', 'Bello-Pérez M', 'Sanz-Bravo A', 'González-Miranda E', 'Hurtado-Tamayo J', 'Requena-Platek R', 'Wang L', 'Muñoz-Santos D', 'Sánchez CM', 'Esteban A', 'Ripoll-Gómez J']",2022,3,,Curr Res Immunol,"Enjuanes L, et al.

35953854,Risk of transmission of respiratory viruses during aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) revisited in the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: In many jurisdictions healthcare workers (HCWs) are using respirators for aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) performed on adult and pediatric populations with all suspect/confirmed viral respiratory infections (VRIs). This systematic review assessed the risk of VRIs to HCWs in the presence of AGMPs, the role respirators versus medical/surgical masks have on reducing that risk, and if the risk to HCWs during AGMPs differed when caring for adult or pediatric patient populations.
MAIN TEXT: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Cochrane SR, CINAHL, COVID-19 specific resources, and MedRxiv for English and French articles from database inception to September 9, 2021. Independent reviewers screened abstracts using pre-defined criteria, reviewed full-text articles, selected relevant studies, abstracted data, and conducted quality assessments of all studies using the ROBINS-I risk of bias tool. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Thirty-eight studies were included; 23 studies on COVID-19, 10 on SARS, and 5 on MERS/ influenza/other respiratory viruses. Two of the 16 studies which assessed associations found that HCWs were 1.7 to 2.5 times more likely to contract COVID-19 after exposure to AGMPs vs. not exposed to AGMPs. Eight studies reported statistically significant associations for nine specific AGMPs and transmission of SARS to HCWS. Intubation was consistently associated with an increased risk of SARS. HCWs were more likely (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.2-3.4) to contract human coronaviruses when exposed to an AGMP in one study. There were no reported associations between AGMP exposure and transmission of influenza or in a single study on MERS. There was limited evidence supporting the use of a respirator over a medical/surgical mask during an AGMP to reduce the risk of viral transmission. One study described outcomes of HCWs exposed to a pediatric patient during intubation.
CONCLUSION: Exposure to an AGMP may increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, and human coronaviruses to HCWs, however the evidence base is heterogenous and prone to confounding, particularly related to COVID-19. There continues to be a significant research gap in the epidemiology of the risk of VRIs among HCWs during AGMPs, particularly for pediatric patients. Further evidence is needed regarding what constitutes an AGMP.","['Leal J', 'Farkas B', 'Mastikhina L', 'Flanagan J', 'Skidmore B', 'Salmon C', 'Dixit D', 'Smith S', 'Tsekrekos S', 'Lee B', 'Vayalumkal J', 'Dunn J', 'Harrison R', 'Cordoviz M', 'Dubois R', 'Chandran U', 'Clement F', 'Bush K', 'Conly J', 'Larios O']",2022,11,1,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,"Leal J, et al.

35951293,Determining the Stoichiometry of Amyloid Oligomers by Single-Molecule Photobleaching.,"Small oligomers are the initial intermediates in the pathway to amyloid fibril formation. They have a distinct identity from the monomers as well as from the protofibrils and the fibrils, both in their structure and in their properties. In many cases, they play a crucial biological role. However, due to their transient nature, they are difficult to characterize. ""Oligomer"" is a diffuse definition, encompassing aggregates of many different sizes, and this lack of precise definition causes much confusion and disagreement between different research groups. Here, we define the small oligomers as ""n""-mers with n < 10, which is the size range in which the amyloid proteins typically exist at the initial phase of the aggregation process. Since the oligomers dynamically interconvert into each other, a solution of aggregating amyloid proteins will contain a distribution of sizes. A precise characterization of an oligomeric solution will, therefore, require quantification of the relative population of each size. Size-based separation methods, such as size-exclusion chromatography, are typically used to characterize this distribution. However, if the interconversion between oligomers of different sizes is fast, this would not yield reliable results. Single-molecule photobleaching (smPB) is a direct method to evaluate this size distribution in a heterogeneous solution without separation. In addition, understanding the mechanism of action of amyloid oligomers requires knowing the affinity of each oligomer type to different cellular components, such as the cell membrane. These measurements are also amenable to smPB. Here we show how to perform smPB, both for oligomers in solution and for oligomers attached to the membrane.","['Dey A', 'Maiti S']",2022,2538,,Methods Mol Biol,Dey A and Maiti S.

The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and the related literature was reviewed. The clinical features, treatment and prognosis of the disease were summarized to improve recognition of Kawasaki disease complicated with MERS. A 7-year-old boy was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease due to continuous high fever for 6 d, accompanied by strawberry tongue, conjunctival congestion, erythema-like hyperemia rash, and cervical enlarged lymph nodes. And treatment was started with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG: 2 g/kg) and oral aspirin [40 mg/(kg·d)]. Twenty-four hours after the treatment of IVIG, the patient' s fever persisted and in addition he developed headache and drowsiness. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a localized lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum with high intensity signal on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and T2-weighted, and low intensity signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T1-weighted. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with MERS-complicated Kawasaki disease. Methylprednisolone [2 mg/(kg·d)] treatment was started intravenously, and within several hours he was afebrile and the neurological symptoms disappeared. A follow-up MRI was conducted after 1 week was normal. He was discharged without any neurological sequelae and coronary artery lesions. A total of 12 qualified foreign literature were retrieved, with no Chinese literature searched. Seventeen children were reported, the median age was 6.5 years (range: 1-14 years), among them 11 cases were children over 5 years old, and 4 cases were complicated with coronary artery lesions. All children had neurological symptoms, such as consciousness disorder, visual hallucination or convulsion. MRI conformed to MERS imaging changes. After active treatment, the neurological manifestations and radiological abnormalities completely disappeared, leaving no neurological sequelae. Kawasaki disease complicated with MERS had not been reported in China by now. Literature that identified Kawasaki disease complicated with MERS mostly occurred in children over 5 years old. Cranial MRI examination is helpful for early diagnosis. Timely treatment can reverse MERS in a short time, without neurological sequelae left.","['DU YY', 'Wang J', 'He L', 'Ji LN', 'Xu XW']",2022,54,4,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"DU YY, et al.

Evidence suggests that some bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) could infect people directly, and that their spillover is more frequent than previously recognized. Each zoonotic spillover of a novel virus represents an opportunity for evolutionary adaptation and further spread; therefore, quantifying the extent of this spillover may help target prevention programs. We derive current range distributions for known bat SARSr-CoV hosts and quantify their overlap with human populations. We then use probabilistic risk assessment and data on human-bat contact, human viral seroprevalence, and antibody duration to estimate that a median of 66,280 people (95% CI: 65,351-67,131) are infected with SARSr-CoVs annually in Southeast Asia. These data on the geography and scale of spillover can be used to target surveillance and prevention programs for potential future bat-CoV emergence.","['Sánchez CA', 'Li H', 'Phelps KL', 'Zambrana-Torrelio C', 'Wang LF', 'Zhou P', 'Shi ZL', 'Olival KJ', 'Daszak P']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Sánchez CA, et al.

35942188,COVID-19 detection using X-ray images and statistical measurements.,"The COVID-19 pandemic spread all over the world, starting in China in late 2019, and significantly affected life in all aspects. As seen in SARS, MERS, COVID-19 outbreaks, coronaviruses pose a great threat to world health. The COVID-19 epidemic, which caused pandemics all over the world, continues to seriously threaten people's lives. Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, many countries' healthcare sectors were caught off guard. This situation put a burden on doctors and healthcare professionals that they could not handle. All of the studies on COVID-19 in the literature have been done to help experts to recognize COVID-19 more accurately, to use more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment methods. The alleviation of this workload will be possible by developing computer aided early and accurate diagnosis systems with machine learning. Diagnosis and evaluation of pneumonia on computed tomography images provide significant benefits in investigating possible complications and in case follow-up. Pneumonia and lesions occurring in the lungs should be carefully examined as it helps in the diagnostic process during the pandemic period. For this reason, the first diagnosis and medications are very important to prevent the disease from progressing. In this study, a dataset consisting of Pneumonia and Normal images was used by proposing a new image preprocessing process. These preprocessed images were reduced to 15x15 unit size and their features were extracted according to their RGB values. Experimental studies were carried out by performing both normal values and feature reduction among these features. RGB values of the images were used in train and test processes for MLAs.

The date of infection and infector-infectee pairings are deduced from travel history to Saudi Arabia or exposure to confirmed cases. The incubation times and serial intervals are estimated using parametric models accounting for exposure interval censoring. Our estimations show that MERS-CoV has a mean incubation time of 7.21 (95% CI: 6.59-7.85) days, whereas COVID-19 (for the circulating strain in the study period) has a mean incubation period of 5.43(95% CI: 4.81-6.11) days. MERS-CoV has an estimated serial interval of 14.13(95% CI: 13.9-14.7) days, while COVID-19 has an estimated serial interval of 5.1(95% CI: 5.0-5.5) days. The COVID-19 serial interval is found to be shorter than the incubation time, indicating that pre-symptomatic transmission may occur in a significant fraction of transmission events. We conclude that during the COVID-19 wave studied, at least 75% of transmission happened prior to the onset of symptoms. The CFR for MERS-CoV is estimated to be 38.1% (95% CI: 36.8-39.5), while the CFR for COVID-19 1.67% (95% CI: 1.63-1.71).

Recently, some cases of pediatric acute pyelonephritis with mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) have been reported. We describe a case of a six-year-old boy who presented with a high fever and four episodes of cluster convulsions. Despite the absence of leukocyturia and hypo-inflammatory response in the blood, he was diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis by contrast-enhanced computed tomography seven days after onset.

There is limited evidence on the psychometric properties of this measure in a perinatal population. The aim of this study is to explore the psychometric properties of the Brief COPE in pregnant and postpartum women.
METHODS: The Dutch/Flemish version of the Brief-COPE was administrated in a sample of 754 antenatal (n = 432) and postpartum (n = 322) women living in Belgium. Exploratory factor analyses assessed the factor structure of the Brief-COPE and its convergent validity in an antenatal and postpartum sample. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for internal consistency reliability of the Brief-COPE items.
RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis showed a five-factor antenatal model, presented by the subscales: (1) Active coping (α = 0.86), (2) Self-blame and Disengagement (α = 0.70), (3) Alcohol use (α = 0.96), (4) Humour (α = 0.79), and (5) Spirituality (α = 0.81). For the postpartum sample, a three-factor model emerged, presented by the subscales: (1) Active coping (α = 0.85), (2) Self-blame (α = 0.85) and (3) Spirituality (α = 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences and similarities in coping strategies between antenatal and postpartum women - information to be of merit for clinical practice and research. The Brief-COPE is a promising tool for the use of identifying women's coping strategies during pregnancy and the postpartum period, specifically for women in a similar cultural context as the women in this study, mainly in terms of antenatal alcohol use.","['van Gils Y', 'Bleijenbergh R', 'Brosens C', 'Van den Branden L', 'Rimaux S', 'Kuipers YJ']",2022,26,10,Matern Child Health J,"van Gils Y, et al.

Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most common central nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidence varies for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus, exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, have the potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, there may be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Future efforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortality complications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and prevent further spread.

Triplex and duplex LNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles the global systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures of vaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells and differential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequential vaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species, significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture.

To date, 504,907,616 people have been infected and developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed to control this pandemic. In this study, a visual nucleic acid detection method combining reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) was successfully established and could detect 20 copies/μl of SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcript within 50 min at 61°C. This assay had no cross-reactivity with a variety of coronaviruses, including human coronavirus OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and bat coronavirus HKU4, exhibiting very high levels of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Most strikingly, this method can be used for detecting multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, Delta, and Omicron variants. Compared with the RT-qPCR method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), RT-LAMP-VF does not require special equipment and is easy to perform. As a result, it is more suitable for rapid screening of suspected SARS-CoV-2 samples in the field and local laboratories.","['Yu M', 'Huang P', 'Li Y', 'Song Y', 'Liu X', 'Feng N', 'Jin H', 'Bai Y', 'Zhang H', 'Li Y', 'Xia X', 'Gao Y', 'Wang H']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Yu M, et al.

Multiple zoonotic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are hypothesized to have evolved in bats. We investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), the host protein bound by MERS-CoV, in the largest bat datasets to date. Both the ACE2 and DPP4 genes are under strong selection pressure in bats, more so than in other mammals, and in residues that contact viruses. Additionally, mammalian groups vary in their similarity to humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and increased similarity to humans in binding residues is broadly predictive of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This work augments our understanding of the relationship between coronaviruses and mammals, particularly bats, provides taxonomically diverse data for studies of how host proteins are bound by coronaviruses and can inform surveillance, conservation and public health efforts.","['Frank HK', 'Enard D', 'Boyd SD']",2022,289,1979,Proc Biol Sci,"Frank HK, et al.

35891485,Translation of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA Is Extremely Efficient and Competitive despite a High Degree of Secondary Structures and the Presence of an uORF.,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection generates up to nine different sub-genomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), in addition to the genomic RNA (gRNA). The 5'UTR of each viral mRNA shares the first 75 nucleotides (nt.) at their 5'end, called the leader, but differentiates by a variable sequence (0 to 190 nt. long) that follows the leader. As a result, each viral mRNA has its own specific 5'UTR in term of length, RNA structure, uORF and Kozak context; each one of these characteristics could affect mRNA expression. In this study, we have measured and compared translational efficiency of each of the ten viral transcripts. Our data show that most of them are very efficiently translated in all translational systems tested. Surprisingly, the gRNA 5'UTR, which is the longest and the most structured, was also the most efficient to initiate translation. This property is conserved in the 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-1 but not in MERS-CoV strain, mainly due to the regulation imposed by the uORF. Interestingly, the translation initiation mechanism on the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA 5'UTR requires the cap structure and the components of the eIF4F complex but showed no dependence in the presence of the poly(A) tail in vitro. Our data strongly suggest that translation initiation on SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs occurs via an unusual cap-dependent mechanism.","['Condé L', 'Allatif O', 'Ohlmann T', 'de Breyne S']",2022,14,7,Viruses,"Condé L, et al.

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a variety of bat-associated coronaviruses have been identified in many countries. However, they do not represent all the specific geographic locations of their hosts. In this study, full-length genomes representing newly identified bat coronaviruses in South Korea were obtained using an RNA sequencing approach. The analysis, based on genome structure, conserved replicase domains, spike gene, and nucleocapsid genes revealed that bat Alphacoronaviruses are from three different viral species. Among them, the newly identified B20-97 strain may represent a new putative species, closely related to PEDV. In addition, the newly-identified MERS-related coronavirus exhibited shared genomic nucleotide identities of less than 76.4% with other Merbecoviruses. Recombination analysis and multiple alignments of spike and RBD amino acid sequences suggested that this strain underwent recombination events and could possibly use hDPP4 molecules as its receptor. The bat SARS-related CoV B20-50 is unlikely to be able to use hACE2 as its receptor and lack of an open reading frame in ORF8 gene region. Our results illustrate the diversity of coronaviruses in Korean bats and their evolutionary relationships. The evolution of the bat coronaviruses related ORF8 accessory gene is also discussed.","['Lo VT', 'Yoon SW', 'Choi YG', 'Jeong DG', 'Kim HK']",2022,14,7,Viruses,"Lo VT, et al.

Prior to the pandemic of COVID-19 which started in March 2020, there was a well-established understanding about the structure and pathogenesis of previously known Coronaviruses from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. In addition to this, vaccines for various Coronaviruses were available for veterinary use. This knowledge supported the creation of various vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2. Before COVID-19 there are no reports of a vaccine being developed in under a year and no vaccine for preventing coronavirus infection in humans had ever been developed. Approximately nine different technologies are being researched and developed at various levels in order to design an effective COVID-19 vaccine. As the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for generating substantial adaptive immune response, mostly all the vaccine candidates have been targeting the whole spike protein or epitopes of spike protein as a vaccine candidate. In this review, we have compiled the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and followed by the mechanism of action of various vaccine platforms such as mRNA vaccines, Adenoviral vectored vaccine, inactivated virus vaccines and subunit vaccines in the market. In the end we have also summarized the various adjuvants used in the COVID-19 vaccine formulation.","['Bellamkonda N', 'Lambe UP', 'Sawant S', 'Nandi SS', 'Chakraborty C', 'Shukla D']",2022,10,7,Biomedicines,"Bellamkonda N, et al.

35880726,Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers.,"We have synthesized B-antigen-displaying dendrimers (16-mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high-density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.","['Manabe Y', 'Tsutsui M', 'Hirao K', 'Kobayashi R', 'Inaba H', 'Matsuura K', 'Yoshidome D', 'Kabayama K', 'Fukase K']",2022,28,61,Chemistry,"Manabe Y, et al.

35877772,Predictive modeling of Pseudomonas syringae virulence on bean using gradient boosted decision trees.,"Pseudomonas syringae is a genetically diverse bacterial species complex responsible for numerous agronomically important crop diseases. Individual P. syringae isolates are assigned pathovar designations based on their host of isolation and the associated disease symptoms, and these pathovar designations are often assumed to reflect host specificity although this assumption has rarely been rigorously tested. Here we developed a rapid seed infection assay to measure the virulence of 121 diverse P. syringae isolates on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). This collection includes P. syringae phylogroup 2 (PG2) bean isolates (pathovar syringae) that cause bacterial spot disease and P. syringae phylogroup 3 (PG3) bean isolates (pathovar phaseolicola) that cause the more serious halo blight disease. We found that bean isolates in general were significantly more virulent on bean than non-bean isolates and observed no significant virulence difference between the PG2 and PG3 bean isolates. However, when we compared virulence within PGs we found that PG3 bean isolates were significantly more virulent than PG3 non-bean isolates, while there was no significant difference in virulence between PG2 bean and non-bean isolates. These results indicate that PG3 strains have a higher level of host specificity than PG2 strains. We then used gradient boosting machine learning to predict each strain's virulence on bean based on whole genome k-mers, type III secreted effector k-mers, and the presence/absence of type III effectors and phytotoxins. Our model performed best using whole genome data and was able to predict virulence with high accuracy (mean absolute error = 0.05). Finally, we functionally validated the model by predicting virulence for 16 strains and found that 15 (94%) had virulence levels within the bounds of estimated predictions. This study strengthens the hypothesis that P. syringae PG2 strains have evolved a different lifestyle than other P. syringae strains as reflected in their lower level of host specificity. It also acts as a proof-of-principle to demonstrate the power of machine learning for predicting host specific adaptation.","['Almeida RND', 'Greenberg M', 'Bundalovic-Torma C', 'Martel A', 'Wang PW', 'Middleton MA', 'Chatterton S', 'Desveaux D', 'Guttman DS']",2022,18,7,PLoS Pathog,"Almeida RND, et al.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that have spilled over into humans and agricultural animals to cause severe diseases. These viruses include Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and coronaviruses that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, bats that are naturally or experimentally infected with these viruses do not show clinical signs of disease.

35872668,A Lesson for the Future; Determining the Prognosis of the Pregnant Patients with COVID-19 in the Second Trimester? A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the third coronavirus epidemic outbreak, has brought about a lot of concern about the pregnancy and the disease course, fatality rate, and the best management in severe cases. Early April 27, 2020, the first maternal mortality due to progressive COVID-19 infection was reported. Considering this challenging situation, the need for some comprehensive data on the main risk and predictive factors of disease progression is clear.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present our experience with 4 confirmed pregnant cases of COVID-19 in the second trimester, who showed typical COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough, and myalgia. We aim to compare our findings with prior reports by reviewing the most recent and relevant studies.4 cases of COVID-19 induced respiratory discomfort in the second trimester of pregnancy were admitted to the intensive care unit. Most of the cases showed respiratory failure that led to intubation, but despite the similar initial presentation, they revealed widely. All of the required medical records are described here.
CONCLUSION: Considering the limited information on this new COVID-19 clinical courses in pregnancy in comparison with two prior coronavirus outbreaks since the early 21 century, SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, the possibility of poor pregnancy outcome has been confirmed, but there is debate on the effect of pregnancy and different management on disease progression. Taking into account the avail of this finding, our experiences, against prior belief, suggest pregnant patients are susceptible to severe morbidity and mortality, similar to report on pregnancies with SARS and MERS.","['Dehghan M', 'Ebrahimian N', 'Mousavi Seresht L', 'Ebrahim Babaei M']",2022,13,Suppl 3,Caspian J Intern Med,"Dehghan M, et al.

35864073,The COVID-19 pandemic - How many times were we warned before?,"Infectious diseases are known to act in both predictable and unpredictable ways, which leads to the notions of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Emerging diseases with their disastrous consequences might be surprising and unpredictable, but they could be foreseen. For instance, some emerging diseases and recently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were the reason for papers published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other researchers addressing the likely pathogens causing future outbreaks, according to the reports of the WHO in 2016 and 2018. Although it might seem like a wisdom in retrospect, several studies had already indicated possible future outbreaks caused by coronaviruses. Announcements, which may be viewed as ""warnings,"" appeared since the emergence of the first coronavirus-related outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the winter of 2002-2003 and a later outbreak caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012-2013. Therefore, we were curious to review the medical literature prior to the COVID-19 pandemic with an aim to enumerate and evaluate studies addressing and warning against future outbreaks, and surprisingly pandemics, of members of coronaviruses. Interestingly, we found numerous studies that correctly predicted the current pandemic of COVID-19. While this part is highly interesting, how authorities reacted and prepared for warnings, if any, and how will they get prepared for the next warnings are our main messages. Taking these points into serious consideration will certainly aid in analyzing reports regarding possible future outbreaks as well as in developing various strategies for prevention and coping with such epidemics.","['Mahroum N', 'Seida I', 'Esirgün SN', 'Bragazzi NL']",2022,105,,Eur J Intern Med,"Mahroum N, et al.

Here, we provide a detailed review of the structural biology and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 as it relates to all facets of the viral life cycle, including cell entry, replication, and three-dimensional (3D) packaging based on insights obtained from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron tomography, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structural comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and the related earlier viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a common thread throughout this review.

Although vaccines are available, too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape. To determine if antibodies could be identified with universal coronavirus activity, plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved between human β-coronavirus. From these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad hmAb, able to recognize all human β-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of 1249A8 i.n. dose 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV Urbani strain, protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden. These results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.","['Piepenbrink MS', 'Park JG', 'Deshpande A', 'Loos A', 'Ye C', 'Basu M', 'Sarkar S', 'Khalil AM', 'Chauvin D', 'Woo J', 'Lovalenti P', 'Erdmann NB', 'Goepfert PA', 'Truong VL', 'Bowen RA', 'Walter MR', 'Martinez-Sobrido L', 'Kobie JJ']",2022,18,7,PLoS Pathog,"Piepenbrink MS, et al.

An attempt was made to optimize chitosan production from fungi. Soil fungi were isolated, identified, and screened for high glucosamine content. Among the fungal isolates tested, Cunninghamella echinulata showed high glucosamine content. The biomass production of C. echinulata was standardized under different growth parameters. The physicochemical characterization of derived chitosan isolates was distinctive and diverged as supported by the FT-IR, molecular mass distribution, degree of deacetylation, and crystallinity. Molecular mass distribution ranged from 1 to 9 mers. The degree of deacetylation was observed to be maximum in C6 (80.88%), which increased with the increase in alkali concentration. In the chitosan isolate, C1 was non-toxic to Vero cells up to 250 µg/mL. In the physicochemical and functional properties of chitosan isolate, C1 was found to be unique and diverse; further detailed investigations on this isolate might help to develop some biomaterials with improved biocompatibility.","['Azeez S', 'Sathiyaseelan A', 'Jeyaraj ER', 'Saravanakumar K', 'Wang MH', 'Kaviyarasan V']",2023,195,6,Appl Biochem Biotechnol,"Azeez S, et al.

We consider both the Achlioptas process (AP) and the inverse Achlioptas process (IAP), in which giant cluster formation is prohibited and accelerated, respectively. By employing finite-size scaling analysis, we confirm that the percolation transitions are continuous, and thus we calculate the percolation threshold and critical exponents. This allows us to determine the universality class of the k-mer explosive percolation transition. Interestingly, the numerical simulation suggests that the universality class of the explosive percolation transition with the AP alters when the k-mer size changes. In contrast, the universality class of the transition with the IAP is independent of k, but it differs from that of the RSA without the IAP.","['Chen F', 'Fang P', 'Li L', 'You WL', 'Liu M']",2022,105,6-1,Phys Rev E,"Chen F, et al.

Structural and neutralization analyses indicated WS6 to neutralize by inhibiting fusion and post-viral attachment. Comparison of WS6 with other recently identified antibodies that broadly neutralize beta-coronaviruses indicated a stem-helical supersite-centered on hydrophobic residues Phe1148, Leu1152, Tyr1155, and Phe1156-to be a promising target for vaccine design.","['Shi W', 'Wang L', 'Zhou T', 'Sastry M', 'Yang ES', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen M', 'Chen X', 'Choe M', 'Creanga A', 'Leung K', 'Olia AS', 'Pegu A', 'Rawi R', 'Schön A', 'Shen CH', 'Stancofski ED', 'Talana CA', 'Teng IT', 'Wang S', 'Corbett KS', 'Tsybovsky Y', 'Mascola JR', 'Kwong PD']",2022,30,9,Structure,"Shi W, et al.

Progression is usually favorable with disappearance of the MRI brain lesion and regression of clinical symptoms over a few days to a few weeks. The exact pathophysiology remains unclear. MERS can be associated with various pathogens.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a paediatric case of MERS associated with Shigella flexneri infection. A five-year-old boy with no relevant past medical history presented with symptoms such as headache, fever, profuse diarrhea and hallucinations. A brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging performed on Day 2 of the symptoms revealed hyperintense signal changes of the splenium of the corpus callosum in T2 FLAIR sequence. This infection had a favorable outcome after antibiotic therapy. No further recurrence of symptoms was observed and a follow-up clinical examination eight weeks later was normal. A follow-up brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging three months after discharge was also normal and the hyperintense signal changes of the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared completely.

35840902,Comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with seasonal coronavirus infection and COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-C0V, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to become a recurrent seasonal infection; hence, it is essential to compare the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 to the existent endemic coronaviruses. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with seasonal coronavirus (sCoV) infection and COVID-19 to compare their clinical characteristics and outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 190 patients hospitalized with any documented respiratory tract infection and a positive respiratory viral panel for sCoV from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2020, were included. Those patients were compared with 190 hospitalized adult patients with molecularly confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 admitted from March 1, 2020, to May 25, 2020.
RESULTS: Among 190 patients with sCoV infection, the Human Coronavirus-OC93 was the most common coronavirus with 47.4% of the cases. When comparing demographics and baseline characteristics, both groups were of similar age (sCoV: 74 years vs. COVID-19: 69 years) and presented similar proportions of two or more comorbidities (sCoV: 85.8% vs. COVID-19: 81.6%). More patients with COVID-19 presented with severe disease (78.4% vs. 67.9%), sepsis (36.3% vs. 20.5%), and developed ARDS (15.8% vs. 2.6%) compared to patients with sCoV infection. Patients with COVID-19 had an almost fourfold increased risk of in-hospital death than patients with sCoV infection (OR 3.86, CI 1.99-7.49; p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had similar demographics and baseline characteristics to hospitalized patients with sCoV infection; however, patients with COVID-19 presented with higher disease severity, had a higher case-fatality rate, and increased risk of death than patients with sCoV. Clinical findings alone may not help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 during high acute respiratory illness seasons. The respiratory multiplex panel by PCR that includes SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with local epidemiological data may be a valuable tool to assist clinicians with management decisions.","['Rodriguez-Nava G', 'Egoryan G', 'Dong T', 'Zhang Q', 'Hyser E', 'Poudel B', 'Yanez-Bello MA', 'Trelles-Garcia DP', 'Chung CW', 'Pyakuryal B', 'Imani-Ramos T', 'Trelles-Garcia VP', 'Bustamante-Soliz DS', 'Stake JJ']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Rodriguez-Nava G, et al.

35821981,SARS-CoV-2 diverges from other betacoronaviruses in only partially activating the IRE1α/XBP1 ER stress pathway in human lung-derived cells.,"UNLABELLED: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed over 6 million individuals worldwide and continues to spread in countries where vaccines are not yet widely available, or its citizens are hesitant to become vaccinated. Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed essential for viral replication. We examined the master UPR sensor IRE1α kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1α-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1α as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1α through autophosphorylation, but its RNase activity fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, while IRE1α was dispensable for replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested, it was required for maximal expression of genes associated with several key cellular functions, including the interferon signaling pathway, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1α, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.
IMPORTANCE: SARS-CoV-2 is the third lethal respiratory coronavirus after MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to emerge this century, causing millions of deaths world-wide. Other common coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 cause less severe respiratory disease. Thus, it is imperative to understand the similarities and differences among these viruses in how each interacts with host cells. We focused here on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) pathway, part of the host unfolded protein response to virus-induced stress. We found that while MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 fully activate the IRE1α kinase and RNase activities, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1α, promoting its kinase activity but not RNase activity. Based on IRE1α-dependent gene expression changes during infection, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 prevents IRE1α RNase activation as a strategy to limit detection by the host immune system.","['Nguyen LC', 'Renner DM', 'Silva D', 'Yang D', 'Parenti N', 'Medina KM', 'Nicolaescu V', 'Gula H', 'Drayman N', 'Valdespino A', 'Mohamed A', 'Dann C', 'Wannemo K', 'Robinson-Mailman L', 'Gonzalez A', 'Stock L', 'Cao M', 'Qiao Z', 'Moellering RE', 'Tay S', 'Randall G', 'Beers MF', 'Rosner MR', 'Oakes SA', 'Weiss SR']",2022,,,bioRxiv,"Nguyen LC, et al.

35810971,Exploring the dynamic variations of viral genomes via a novel genetic network.,"Exploring the dynamic variations of viral genomes utilizing with a phylogenetic analysis is vital to control the pandemic and stop its waves. Genetic network can be applied to depict the complicated evolution relationships of viral genomes. However, current phylogenetic methods cannot handle the cases with deletions effectively. Therefore, the k-mer natural vector is employed to characterize the compositions and distribution features of k-mers occurring in a viral genome, and construct a one-to-one relationship between a viral genome and its k-mer natural vector. Utilizing the k-mer natural vector, we proposed a novel genetic network to investigate the variations of viral genomes in transmission among humans. With the assistance of genetic network, we identified the super-spreaders that were responsible for the pandemic outbreaks all over the world and chose the parental strains to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The obtaining results fully demonstrated that our genetic network can truly describe the relationships of viral genomes, effectively simulate virus spread tendency, and trace the transmission routes precisely. In addition, this work indicated that the k-mer natural vector has the ability to capture established hotspots of diversities existing in the viral genomes and understand how genomic contents change over time.","['Zhang Y', 'Wen J', 'Xi K', 'Pan Q']",2022,175,,Mol Phylogenet Evol,"Zhang Y, et al.

35809965,Assessing putative bias in prediction of anti-microbial resistance from real-world genotyping data under explicit causal assumptions.,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming the customary means for identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain high resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing resistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic (antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development of AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since sampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and species representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR. Thus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling distribution shifts. In this work -under an explicit set of causal assumptions- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing and confounding adjustment on antibiotic resistance prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial genotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e., DNA fragments of length k), country, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class, preparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test boosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without bias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and year imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus bias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only moderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to that of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external test (n = 1085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1 %-5 % gain in AUROC with bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. In conclusion, we recommend using causally-informed prediction methods for modeling real-world AMR data; however, traditional adjustment or propensity-based methods may not provide advantage in all use cases and further methodological development should be sought.","['Prosperi M', 'Boucher C', 'Bian J', 'Marini S']",2022,130,,Artif Intell Med,"Prosperi M, et al.

35801930,Needle: a fast and space-efficient prefilter for estimating the quantification of very large collections of expression experiments.,"MOTIVATION: The ever-growing size of sequencing data is a major bottleneck in bioinformatics as the advances of hardware development cannot keep up with the data growth. Therefore, an enormous amount of data is collected but rarely ever reused, because it is nearly impossible to find meaningful experiments in the stream of raw data.
RESULTS: As a solution, we propose Needle, a fast and space-efficient index which can be built for thousands of experiments in <2 h and can estimate the quantification of a transcript in these experiments in seconds, thereby outperforming its competitors. The basic idea of the Needle index is to create multiple interleaved Bloom filters that each store a set of representative k-mers depending on their multiplicity in the raw data. This is then used to quantify the query.

35800558,The intricate association of COVID-19 pandemic with ecological issues.,"This critical narrative review is intended to emphasize the comprehensive ecological issues related to the evolution of the novel coronavirus, the environmental factors associated with the disease progress, and the impact the pandemic is having on the environment. Approximately 60% of the emerging infectious disease of the last century (including deadly viruses like HIV, Ebola, Influenza, coronavirus strains like SARS, MERS) are linked to zoonotic spillover. Therefore, to escape the emergence of newer cross-species infections, proper precautionary measures should be taken. Every country has specific rules to deal with the biomedical waste produced in hospitals. But the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a unique global challenge due to the overwhelming amount of biomedical waste generated from dedicated COVID hospitals, diagnostic facilities, quarantine centers, and home quarantine facilities. Moreover, inappropriate disposal of masks by the general public may contaminate the environment turning it into a potential health hazard. Therefore, strict adherence to Biomedical Waste Management Guidelines for proper disposal of masks and other medical waste by all concerned is a must. Lockdown has brought about tremendous improvement in conditions of the world's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Dramatic improvement in air quality index, decrease in water, and noise pollution are some of the positive aspects of lockdown. However, these effects are temporary. But these teach an important lesson to the world to take some permanent measures to bring down greenhouse gases and other toxic emissions. Some harmful effects of lockdown are illegal deforestation, wildlife trafficking, encroachment of reserved areas etc.","['Deka S', 'Rani D', 'Mahanta P', 'Kalita D']",2022,11,5,J Family Med Prim Care,"Deka S, et al.

35790657,An outlook on potential protein targets of COVID-19 as a druggable site.,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 disease has started a pandemic episode all over the world infecting millions of people and has created medical and economic crisis. From December 2019, cases originated from Wuhan city and started spreading at an alarming rate and has claimed millions of lives till now. Scientific studies suggested that this virus showed genomic similarity of about 90% with SARS-CoV and is found to be more contagious as compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Since the pandemic, virus has undergone constant mutation and few strains have raised public concern like Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.
OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host proteins as well as their mechanism of action. We have also elucidated the repurposed drugs that have shown potency to inhibit these protein targets in combating COVID-19. Moreover, the article discusses the vaccines approved so far and those under clinical trials for their efficacy against COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: Using cryo-electron microscopy or X-ray diffraction, hundreds of crystallographic data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been published including structural and non-structural proteins. These proteins have a significant role at different aspects in the viral machinery and presented themselves as potential target for drug designing and therapeutic interventions. Also, there are few host cell proteins which helps in SARS-CoV-2 entry and proteolytic cleavage required for viral infection.","['Noori R', 'Sardar M']",2022,49,11,Mol Biol Rep,Noori R and Sardar M.

35779468,Comparing pregnancy outcomes between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 positive unvaccinated women: Multicenter study in Saudi Arabia.,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection in pregnancy ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disease. However, the maternal and pregnancy outcomes are primarily favorable. Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) score is a Visual Triage Checklist for Acute Respiratory symptoms created by the ministry of health of Saudi Arabia 
METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional study of all pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in four medical centers located in four different cities in Saudi Arabia. The study period was from 1/3/2020 until 31/10/2020. Outcomes investigated were the prevalence of COVID infection in pregnant women at the time of delivery. Rate of asymptomatic disease, different maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Women were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups according to the ARI score. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, the cohort was divided according to maternal age into two groups: women of advanced maternal age ≥ 35 years and younger. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes RESULTS: During the study period, 9573 women gave birth at KAMCs, and 402 pregnant women were identified as COVID positive. Out of all COVID-positive women, only 394 women gave birth at KAMCs. The screening for COVID infection differed between the centers, but the testing was the same by the Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. In Riyadh, screening was based on ARI scoring at the beginning of the pandemic. Then, it became universal. In Jeddah, the screening was based on ARI scoring. Any woman who scored four or more was labeled as suspected, and she was tested. Finally, in Madinah and Dammam, the screening was universal throughout the study. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection among women who gave birth at KAMCs was 4.2% (402/9573). (CI 3.8-4.6%). At the time of diagnosis, most women (62%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath. Twenty-two women (5.5%) had Pneumonia, and five women (1.3%) needed admission to Intensive care units (ICU). One woman died due to respiratory failure. When pregnancy outcomes were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic women, pregnancy in symptomatic women was more likely to be complicated by Abortion (6 versus 2% p-value 0.00), fetal death (3 versus 1.3%), and cesarean delivery (30.8 versus 22.4%, p-value 0.001). COVID-positive pregnant women of advanced maternal age (AMA) were more likely to be symptomatic, have Abortion (5 versus 1%, p-value 0.01), and have Preterm delivery (17 versus 11% p-value 0.01) than younger women. In addition, neonatal death was more common in AMA COVID-positive women than younger (4 versus 0%), regardless of COVID-related symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Most of the COVID-infected pregnant women are asymptomatic. Therefore, the ARI scoring system does not help to triage patients. Symptomatic women, especially those older than 35, tend to have a higher maternal and pregnancy complication rate.","['Shams T', 'Alhashemi H', 'Madkhali A', 'Noorelahi A', 'Allarakia S', 'Faden Y', 'Alhasani A', 'Alzahrani K', 'Alrefai A', 'Ghilan NA', 'Al-Sum H', 'Kurdi S', 'Al-Ansari Y', 'Alotaibi M']",2022,15,8,J Infect Public Health,"Shams T, et al.

35775242,Graphene-Based Field-Effect Transistor for Ultrasensitive Immunosensing of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 Antigen.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has posed a global health challenge caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Early management and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are crucial for the timely treatment, traceability, and reduction of viral spread. We have developed a rapid method using a Graphene-based Field-Effect Transistor (Gr-FET) for the ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antigen (S1-Ag). The in-house developed antispike S1 antibody (S1-Ab) was covalently immobilized on the surface of a carboxy functionalized graphene channel using carbodiimide chemistry. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Optical Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA), and device stability studies were conducted to characterize the bioconjugation and fabrication process of Gr-FET. In addition, the electrical response of the device was evaluated by monitoring the change in resistance caused by Ag-Ab interaction in real time. For S1-Ag, our Gr-FET devices were tested in the range of 1 fM to 1 μM with a limit of detection of 10 fM in the standard buffer. The fabricated devices are highly sensitive, specific, and capable of detecting low levels of S1-Ag.","['Shahdeo D', 'Chauhan N', 'Majumdar A', 'Ghosh A', 'Gandhi S']",2022,5,7,ACS Appl Bio Mater,"Shahdeo D, et al.

35771831,The many facets of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and its inhibitors in disorders of the CNS - a critical overview.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a serine protease that cleaves X-proline or X-alanine in the penultimate position. Natural substrates of the enzyme are glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon inhibiting peptide, glucagon, neuropeptide Y, secretin, substance P, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, endorphins, endomorphins, brain natriuretic peptide, beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone and amyloid peptides as well as some cytokines and chemokines. The enzyme is involved in the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis and regulation of the immune system. It is expressed in many organs including the brain. DPP4 activity may be effectively depressed by DPP4 inhibitors. Apart from enzyme activity, DPP4 acts as a cell surface (co)receptor, associates with adeosine deaminase, interacts with extracellular matrix, and controls cell migration and differentiation. This review aims at revealing the impact of DPP4 and DPP4 inhibitors for several brain diseases (virus infections affecting the brain, tumours of the CNS, neurological and psychiatric disorders). Special emphasis is given to a possible involvement of DPP4 expressed in the brain.While prominent contributions of extracerebral DPP4 are evident for a majority of diseases discussed herein; a possible role of ""brain"" DPP4 is restricted to brain cancers and Alzheimer disease. For a number of diseases (Covid-19 infection, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and epilepsy), use of DPP4 inhibitors has been shown to have a disease-mitigating effect. However, these beneficial effects should mostly be attributed to the depression of ""peripheral"" DPP4, since currently used DPP4 inhibitors are not able to pass through the intact blood-brain barrier.","['Bernstein HG', 'Keilhoff G', 'Dobrowolny H', 'Steiner J']",2023,34,1,Rev Neurosci,"Bernstein HG, et al.

35771308,Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus Shedding by Bats in a Cave and Buildings in Ethiopia.,"Bats are important hosts of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential, including filoviruses, MERS-Coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV -1, and likely SARS-CoV-2. Viral infection and transmission among wildlife are dependent on a combination of factors that include host ecology and immunology, life history traits, roosting habitats, biogeography, and external stressors. Between 2016 and 2018, four species of insectivorous bats from a readily accessed roadside cave and buildings in Ethiopia were sampled and tested for viruses using consensus PCR assays for five viral families/genera. Previously identified and novel coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were identified in 99 of the 589 sampled bats. Bats sampled from the cave site were more likely to test positive for a CoV than bats sampled from buildings; viral shedding was more common in the wet season; and rectal swabs were the most common sample type to test positive. A previously undescribed alphacoronavirus was detected in two bat species from different taxonomic families, sampling interfaces, geographic locations, and years. These findings expand knowledge of the range and diversity of coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in insectivorous bats in Ethiopia and reinforce that an improved understanding of viral diversity and species-specific shedding dynamics is important for designing informed zoonotic disease surveillance and spillover risk reduction efforts.","['Lane JK', 'Negash Y', 'Randhawa N', 'Kebede N', 'Wells H', 'Ayalew G', 'Anthony SJ', 'Smith B', 'Goldstein T', 'Kassa T', 'Mazet JAK', 'Consortium P', 'Smith WA']",2022,19,2,Ecohealth,"Lane JK, et al.

35764457,Coronaviral PLpro proteases and the immunomodulatory roles of conjugated versus free Interferon Stimulated Gene product-15 (ISG15).,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) share some features with ubiquitin (Ub) such as their globular 3D structure and the ability to attach covalently to other proteins. Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) is an abundant Ubl that similar to Ub, marks many hundreds of cellular proteins, altering their fate. In contrast to Ub, , ISG15 requires interferon (IFN) induction to conjugate efficiently to other proteins. Moreover, despite the multitude of E3 ligases for Ub-modified targets, a single E3 ligase termed HERC5 (in humans) is responsible for the bulk of ISG15 conjugation. Targets include both viral and cellular proteins spanning an array of cellular compartments and metabolic pathways. So far, no common structural or biochemical feature has been attributed to these diverse substrates, raising questions about how and why they are selected. Conjugation of ISG15 mitigates some viral and bacterial infections and is linked to a lower viral load pointing to the role of ISG15 in the cellular immune response. In an apparent attempt to evade the immune response, some viruses try to interfere with the ISG15 pathway. For example, deconjugation of ISG15 appears to be an approach taken by coronaviruses to interfere with ISG15 conjugates. Specifically, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, encode papain-like proteases (PL1pro) that bear striking structural and catalytic similarities to the catalytic core domain of eukaryotic deubiquitinating enzymes of the Ubiquitin-Specific Protease (USP) sub-family. The cleavage specificity of these PLpro enzymes is for flexible polypeptides containing a consensus sequence (R/K)LXGG, enabling them to function on two seemingly unrelated categories of substrates: (i) the viral polyprotein 1 (PP1a, PP1ab) and (ii) Ub- or ISG15-conjugates. As a result, PLpro enzymes process the viral polyprotein 1 into an array of functional proteins for viral replication (termed non-structural proteins; NSPs), and it can remove Ub or ISG15 units from conjugates. However, by de-conjugating ISG15, the virus also creates free ISG15, which in turn may affect the immune response in two opposite pathways: free ISG15 negatively regulates IFN signaling in humans by binding non-catalytically to USP18, yet at the same time free ISG15 can be secreted from the cell and induce the IFN pathway of the neighboring cells. A deeper understanding of this protein-modification pathway and the mechanisms of the enzymes that counteract it will bring about effective clinical strategies related to viral and bacterial infections.","['Gold IM', 'Reis N', 'Glaser F', 'Glickman MH']",2022,132,,Semin Cell Dev Biol,"Gold IM, et al.

Cognate spike proteins of major variants of concern (N501Y, D614G, Y453F, Omicron-B1.1.529) showed sensor response ≥40 mV from the control (aptamer alone) for fM to nM concentration range. The sensor response was significantly lower for viral particles and cognate proteins of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) compared to SARS-CoV-2, indicating the specificity of the diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 vs. MERS viral proteins. During the early phase of the pandemic, the GFET sensor response agreed with RT-PCR data for oral human samples, as determined by the negative percent agreement (NPA) and positive percent agreement (PPA). During the recent Delta/Omicron wave, the GFET sensor also reliably distinguished positive and negative clinical saliva samples. Although the sensitivity is lower during the later pandemic phase, the GFET-defined positivity rate is in statistically close alignment with the epidemiological population-scale data. Thus, the aptamer-based GFET biosensor has a high level of precision in clinically and epidemiologically significant SARS-CoV-2 variant detection. This universal pathogen-sensing platform is amenable for a broad range of public health applications and real-time environmental monitoring.","['Ban DK', 'Bodily T', 'Karkisaval AG', 'Dong Y', 'Natani S', 'Ramanathan A', 'Ramil A', 'Srivastava S', 'Bandaru P', 'Glinsky G', 'Lal R']",2022,119,28,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Ban DK, et al.

35761402,A chimeric MERS-CoV virus-like particle vaccine protects mice against MERS-CoV challenge.,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of approximately 35%, thus posing a considerable threat to public health. The lack of approved vaccines or antivirals currently constitutes a barrier in controlling disease outbreaks and spread.
METHODS: In this study, using a mammalian expression system, which is advantageous for maintaining correct protein glycosylation patterns, we constructed chimeric MERS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) and determined their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice.
RESULTS: Western blot and cryo-electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that MERS-CoV VLPs were efficiently produced in cells co-transfected with MERS-CoV spike (S), envelope, membrane and murine hepatitis virus nucleocapsid genes. We examined their ability as a vaccine in a human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in C57BL/6 congenic mouse model. Mice immunized with MERS VLPs produced S-specific antibodies with virus neutralization activity. Furthermore, MERS-CoV VLP immunization provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV and improved virus clearance in the lung.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs have excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising vaccine candidate.","['Park JE', 'Kim JH', 'Park JY', 'Jun SH', 'Shin HJ']",2022,19,1,Virol J,"Park JE, et al.

35758804,CALDERA: finding all significant de Bruijn subgraphs for bacterial GWAS.,"MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), aiming to find genetic variants associated with a trait, have widely been used on bacteria to identify genetic determinants of drug resistance or hypervirulence. Recent bacterial GWAS methods usually rely on k-mers, whose presence in a genome can denote variants ranging from single-nucleotide polymorphisms to mobile genetic elements. This approach does not require a reference genome, making it easier to account for accessory genes. However, a same gene can exist in slightly different versions across different strains, leading to diluted effects.
RESULTS: Here, we overcome this issue by testing covariates built from closed connected subgraphs (CCSs) of the de Bruijn graph defined over genomic k-mers. These covariates capture polymorphic genes as a single entity, improving k-mer-based GWAS both in terms of power and interpretability. However, a method naively testing all possible subgraphs would be powerless due to multiple testing corrections, and the mere exploration of these subgraphs would quickly become computationally intractable. The concept of testable hypothesis has successfully been used to address both problems in similar contexts. We leverage this concept to test all CCSs by proposing a novel enumeration scheme for these objects which fully exploits the pruning opportunity offered by testability, resulting in drastic improvements in computational efficiency. Our method integrates with existing visual tools to facilitate interpretation.

35758788,"CMash: fast, multi-resolution estimation of k-mer-based Jaccard and containment indices.","MOTIVATION: K-mer-based methods are used ubiquitously in the field of computational biology. However, determining the optimal value of k for a specific application often remains heuristic. Simply reconstructing a new k-mer set with another k-mer size is computationally expensive, especially in metagenomic analysis where datasets are large. Here, we introduce a hashing-based technique that leverages a kind of bottom-m sketch as well as a k-mer ternary search tree (KTST) to obtain k-mer-based similarity estimates for a range of k values. By truncating k-mers stored in a pre-built KTST with a large k=kmax value, we can simultaneously obtain k-mer-based estimates for all k values up to kmax. This truncation approach circumvents the reconstruction of new k-mer sets when changing k values, making analysis more time and space-efficient.
RESULTS: We derived the theoretical expression of the bias factor due to truncation. And we showed that the biases are negligible in practice: when using a KTST to estimate the containment index between a RefSeq-based microbial reference database and simulated metagenome data for 10 values of k, the running time was close to 10× faster compared to a classic MinHash approach while using less than one-fifth the space to store the data structure.

35754942,"Identification, virtual screening and molecular dynamic analysis of novel TMPRSS2 inhibitors from natural compound database as potential entry-blocking agents in SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","UNLABELLED: Scientific insights gained from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have been assisting scientists and researchers in the quest of antiviral drug discovery process against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses and influenza viruses both rely on the host type 2 transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, for entry and propagation. Recent studies report SARS-CoV-2 also uses TMPRSS2 to enter cells. In the current study, we employed structure-based virtual screening of 1,82,651 natural compounds downloaded from the zin database against the homology model of the TMPRSS2 protein, followed by a molecular dynamics-based simulation to identify potential TMPRSS2 hits. The virtual screening yielded 110 hits with docking scores ranging from -8.654 to -6.775 and glide energies ranging from -55.714 to -29.065 kcal/mol. The binding mode analysis revealed that the hit molecules made H-bond, Pi-Pi stacking and salt bridge contacts with the TMPRSS2 active site residues. MD simulations of the top two hits (ZINC000095912839 and ZINC000085597504) revealed to form a stable complex with TMPRSS2, with a minimal RMSD and RMSF fluctuation. Both the hit structures interacted strongly with the Asp180, Gln183, Gly184, Ser186, Gly207 and Gly209, as predicted by Glide XP docking, and formed a significant H-bond interaction with Ser181 in MD simulation. Among these two, ZINC000095912839 was having the most stable binding interaction with TMPRSS2 of the two molecules. The present study successfully identified TMPRSS2 ligands from a database of zinc natural molecules as potential leads for novel SARs-CoV-2 treatment.

35751820,Kmer2SNP: Reference-Free Heterozygous SNP Calling Using k-mer Frequency Distributions.,"DNA sequencing technologies enable the generation of genetic profiles from many individuals at a rapid rate. Identifying single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between biological samples is fundamental in genetics with various applications, such as disease diagnosis and associations and ancestry and relationship inference. Most methods use a species-specific reference genome for aligning raw sequenced reads for accurate SNP calling. However, high-quality reference genomes may not be available for all species. Therefore, we developed a reference-free algorithm, Kmer2SNP, to identify heterozygous SNPs from raw sequenced reads to facilitate genetic studies in species without the reference genome. Kmer2SNP first calculates the k-mer frequency distribution from reads to determine k-mers containing heterozygous SNPs. Next, these k-mers are rapidly matched with each other to identify pairs of exact heterozygous k-mers that belong to one of the two possible haplotypes in a diploid organism. Finally, using overlapping neighboring k-mers, weights are assigned for SNP assignments; higher weights increase SNP discovery confidence.","['Li Y', 'Patel H', 'Lin Y']",2022,2493,,Methods Mol Biol,"Li Y, et al.

Using a direct-contact llama challenge model that mimics naturally occurring viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of a multimeric receptor binding domain (RBD) particle-display based vaccine candidate. While MERS-CoV was transmitted to naïve animals exposed to virus-inoculated llamas, immunization induced robust virus-neutralizing antibody responses and prevented transmission in 1/3 vaccinated, in-contact animals. Our exploratory study supports further improvement of the RBD-based vaccine to prevent zoonotic spillover of MERS-CoV.","['Rodon J', 'Mykytyn AZ', 'Cantero G', 'Albulescu IC', 'Bosch BJ', 'Brix A', 'Audonnet JC', 'Bensaid A', 'Vergara-Alert J', 'Haagmans BL', 'Segalés J']",2022,4,1,One Health Outlook,"Rodon J, et al.

35735997,Novel Engineered SARS-CoV-2 HR1 Trimer Exhibits Improved Potency and Broad-Spectrum Activity against SARS-CoV-2 and Its Variants.,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has substantially increased the risk to global public health. Multiple vaccines and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been authorized for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the emergence and spread of the viral variants may limit the effectiveness of these vaccines and antibodies. Fusion inhibitors targeting the HR1 domain of the viral S protein have been shown to broadly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. In theory, peptide inhibitors targeting the HR2 domain of the S protein should also be able to inhibit viral infection. However, previously reported HR1-derived peptide inhibitors targeting the HR2 domain exhibit poor inhibitory activities. Here, we engineered a novel HR1 trimer (HR1MFd) by conjugating the trimerization motif foldon to the C terminus of the HR1-derived peptide. HR1MFd showed significantly improved inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Mechanistically, HR1MFd possesses markedly increased α-helicity, thermostability, higher HR2 domain binding affinity, and better inhibition of S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion compared to the HR1 peptide. Therefore, HR1MFd lays the foundation to develop HR1-based fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. ","['Bi W', 'Chen G', 'Dang B']",2022,96,13,J Virol,"Bi W, et al.

35731587,"Cellulosic copper nanoparticles and a hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant trigger rapid inactivation of pseudoviral particles expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by human coronaviruses that include SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although their primary mode of transmission is through contaminated respiratory droplets from infected carriers, the deposition of expelled virus particles onto surfaces and fomites could contribute to viral transmission. Here, we use replication-deficient murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudoviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV Spike (S) protein on their surface. These surrogates of native coronavirus counterparts serve as a model to analyze the S-mediated entry into target cells. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) nanofibers that are combined with copper (Cu) exhibit strong antimicrobial properties. S-pseudovirions that are exposed to CMC-Cu nanoparticles (30 s) display a dramatic reduction in their ability to infect target Vero E6 cells, with ∼97% less infectivity as compared to untreated pseudovirions. In contrast, addition of the Cu chelator tetrathiomolybdate protects S-pseudovirions from CMC-Cu-mediated inactivation. When S-pseudovirions were treated with a hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant (denoted SaberTM) used at 1:250 dilution, their infectivity was dramatically reduced by ∼98%. However, the combined use of SaberTM and CMC-Cu is the most effective approach to restrict infectivity of SARS-CoV-2-S, SARS-CoV-S, and MERS-CoV-S pseudovirions in Vero E6 cell assays. Together, these results show that cellulosic Cu nanoparticles enhance the effectiveness of diluted SaberTM sanitizer, setting up an improved strategy to lower the risk of surface- and fomite-mediated transmission of enveloped respiratory viruses.","['Brault A', 'Néré R', 'Prados J', 'Boudreault S', 'Bisaillon M', 'Marchand P', 'Couture P', 'Labbé S']",2022,14,7,Metallomics,"Brault A, et al.

35729491,RResolver: efficient short-read repeat resolution within ABySS.,"BACKGROUND: De novo genome assembly is essential to modern genomics studies. As it is not biased by a reference, it is also a useful method for studying genomes with high variation, such as cancer genomes. De novo short-read assemblers commonly use de Bruijn graphs, where nodes are sequences of equal length k, also known as k-mers. Edges in this graph are established between nodes that overlap by [Formula: see text] bases, and nodes along unambiguous walks in the graph are subsequently merged. The selection of k is influenced by multiple factors, and optimizing this value results in a trade-off between graph connectivity and sequence contiguity. Ideally, multiple k sizes should be used, so lower values can provide good connectivity in lesser covered regions and higher values can increase contiguity in well-covered regions. However, current approaches that use multiple k values do not address the scalability issues inherent to the assembly of large genomes.
RESULTS: Here we present RResolver, a scalable algorithm that takes a short-read de Bruijn graph assembly with a starting k as input and uses a k value closer to that of the read length to resolve repeats. RResolver builds a Bloom filter of sequencing reads which is used to evaluate the assembly graph path support at branching points and removes paths with insufficient support. RResolver runs efficiently, taking only 26 min on average for an ABySS human assembly with 48 threads and 60 GiB memory. Across all experiments, compared to a baseline assembly, RResolver improves scaffold contiguity (NGA50) by up to 15% and reduces misassemblies by up to 12%.
CONCLUSIONS: RResolver adds a missing component to scalable de Bruijn graph genome assembly. By improving the initial and fundamental graph traversal outcome, all downstream ABySS algorithms greatly benefit by working with a more accurate and less complex representation of the genome.

METHODS: An RT-qPCR assay developed at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA, was validated in two New Zealand laboratories. Analytical measures, such as limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reactivity, were performed. One hundred and forty-seven saliva samples, each paired with a contemporaneously collected nasal swab, mainly of nasopharyngeal origin, were received. Positive (N=33) and negative (N=114) samples were tested blindly in each laboratory. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were then calculated.
RESULTS: The LOD was <0.75 copy per µL and no cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV was detected. There was complete concordance between laboratories for all saliva samples with the quantification cycle values for all three genes in close agreement. Saliva had 98.7% concordance with paired nasal samples: and a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 97.0%, 99.1% and 99.1%, respectively.

35725865,Establishment of well-differentiated camelid airway cultures to study Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,"In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and was mostly associated with severe respiratory illness in humans. Dromedary camels are the zoonotic reservoir for MERS-CoV. To investigate the biology of MERS-CoV in camelids, we developed a well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model for Llama glama and Camelus bactrianus. Histological characterization revealed progressive epithelial cellular differentiation with well-resemblance to autologous ex vivo tissues. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV displays a divergent cell tropism and replication kinetics profile in both AEC models. Furthermore, we observed that in the camelid AEC models MERS-CoV replication can be inhibited by both type I and III interferons (IFNs). In conclusion, we successfully established camelid AEC cultures that recapitulate the in vivo airway epithelium and reflect MERS-CoV infection in vivo. In combination with human AEC cultures, this system allows detailed characterization of the molecular basis of MERS-CoV cross-species transmission in respiratory epithelium.","['Gultom M', 'Kratzel A', 'Portmann J', 'Stalder H', 'Chanfon Bätzner A', 'Gantenbein H', 'Gurtner C', 'Ebert N', 'Gad HH', 'Hartmann R', 'Posthaus H', 'Zanolari P', 'Pfaender S', 'Thiel V', 'Dijkman R']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Gultom M, et al.

35721787,Association between thrombocytopenia and the severity of Covid-19 infection among hospitalized Egyptian patients.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, which is caused by the corona virus 2 that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, causes a respiratory and systemic illness that in 10-15% of patients escalates to a severe form of pneumonia. Thrombocytopenia is frequent in patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the association between thrombocytopenia and the severity of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done on 800 Egyptian patients with confirmed covid-19 infection. They were divided into Group I (Mild): 200 symptomatic patients meeting the case definition for COVID-19 without radiological evidence of pneumonia or hypoxia. Group II (Moderate): 200 patients with clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and radiological evidence of pneumonia. Group III (Severe): 200 patients with clinical signs of pneumonia plus: respiratory or lung dysfunction. Group IV: 200 critically ill patient in ICU: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Results: there was a highly statistically significant difference between the studied groups regarding thrombocytopenia (p < 0.001). Thrombocytopenia was statistically higher in severe and critically ill patients. In addition, a statistically significant difference found in outcome among the studied groups (p < 0.05) {critically ill (40%), severe (17.5%)}. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure, which occurred in 28 severe patients (80%) and 65 critically ill patients (81.25%), followed by hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia, which occurred in 7 severe patients (20%) and 15 critically ill patients, respectively (18.75%).
CONCLUSION: The Platelet count is a straightforward, inexpensive, as well as easily available laboratory parameter that is frequently linked to severe covid-19 infection and a significant death risk.","['El-Khaiat MM', 'El-Lehlah AM', 'Kesheita MA', 'Abdel-Samiee M', 'Teima AAA']",2022,79,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"El-Khaiat MM, et al.

35721786,"Comparative overview of emerging RNA viruses: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and current treatment.","From many decades, emerging infections have threatened humanity. The pandemics caused by different CoVs have already claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The SARS, Ebola, MERS epidemics and the most recent emergence of COVID-19 pandemic have threatened populations across borders. Since a highly pathogenic CoV has been evolved into the human population in the twenty-first century known as SARS, scientific advancements and innovative methods to tackle these viruses have increased in order to improve response preparedness towards the unpredictable threat posed by these rapidly emerging pathogens. Recently published review articles on SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its pathogenesis, epidemiology and available treatments. However, in this review, we have done a systematic comparison of all three CoVs i.e., SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 along with Ebola and Zika in terms of their epidemiology, virology, clinical features and current treatment strategies. This review focuses on important emerging RNA viruses starting from Zika, Ebola and the CoVs which include SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. Each of these viruses has been elaborated on the basis of their epidemiology, virulence, transmission and treatment. However, special attention has been given to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by it i.e., COVID-19 due to current havoc caused worldwide. At the end, insights into the current understanding of the lessons learned from previous epidemics to combat emerging CoVs have been described. The travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates associated with these highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses highlight the need for new prophylactic and therapeutic actions which include but are not limited to clinical indicators, contact tracing, and laboratory investigations as important factors that need to be taken into account in order to arrive at the final conclusion.","['Chakrabartty I', 'Khan M', 'Mahanta S', 'Chopra H', 'Dhawan M', 'Choudhary OP', 'Bibi S', 'Mohanta YK', 'Emran TB']",2022,79,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Chakrabartty I, et al.

The study aimed to identify the pattern of COVID-19 prevention measures during the outbreaks in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do at the early stage of COVID-19. Moreover, we investigated whether SME size and past experiences affected the preventive measures implemented in the region.
METHODS: A survey detailing the general characteristics and implementation of 12 preventive activities was conducted in 122 SMEs in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do. The survey was analyzed by size and operation period.
RESULTS: The study subjects consisted of 53 (43.4%) workplaces with 1-5 employees, 50 (40.9%) workplaces with 6-30 employees, and 19 (15.6%) workplaces with 31-49 employees. The lowest three items among those surveyed were 'symptomatic workers to stay home for 3-4 days' (17.2%), 'work remotely' (18.9%), and 'video meetings' (20.5%). There were significant differences in the rate of several preventive measures implemented. The larger sized SMEs, the higher the number of implementations (p < 0.01). The operation period had no significant relationship with the implementation of preventive measures. The same pattern was observed in multiple generalized linear regression with covariate adjustment.
CONCLUSION: Preventive measures among SMEs with fewer than 50 employees were identified. Even within SMEs, a gap in preventive measures according to size was confirmed. To prevent the spread of infection and protect workers' right to health, different support for different sized SMEs is necessary.","['Baek K', 'Kim SH', 'Park C', 'Sakong J']",2022,13,3,Saf Health Work,"Baek K, et al.

35715352,Vaccines based on the replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector ChAdOx1: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment.,"Replication-deficient adenoviral vectors have been under investigation as a platform technology for vaccine development for several years and have recently been successfully deployed as an effective COVID-19 counter measure. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector based on the simian adenovirus type Y25 and named ChAdOx1 has been evaluated in several clinical trials since 2012. The Brighton Collaboration Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy (BRAVATO) was formed to evaluate the safety and other key features of new platform technology vaccines. This manuscript reviews key features of the ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines. The simian adenovirus Y25 was chosen as a strategy to circumvent pre-existing immunity to common human adenovirus serotypes which could impair immune responses induced by adenoviral vectored vaccines. Deletion of the E1 gene renders the ChAdOx1 vector replication incompetent and further genetic engineering of the E3 and E4 genes allows for increased insertional capability and optimizes vaccine manufacturing processes. ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines can be manufactured in E1 complementing cell lines at scale and are thermostable. The first ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines approved for human use, against SARS-CoV-2, received emergency use authorization in the UK on 30th December 2020, and is now approved in more than 180 countries. Safety data were compiled from phase I-III clinical trials of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines expressing different antigens (influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, meningococcal B, prostate cancer, MERS-CoV, Chikungunya, Zika and SARS-CoV-2), conducted by the University of Oxford, as well as post marketing surveillance data for the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Overall, ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have been well tolerated. Very rarely, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), capillary leak syndrome (CLS), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following mass administration of the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of this COVID-19 vaccination have outweighed the risks of serious adverse events in most settings, especially with mitigation of risks when possible. Extensive immunogenicity clinical evaluation of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines reveal strong, durable humoral and cellular immune responses to date; studies to refine the COVID-19 protection (e.g., via homologous/heterologous booster, fractional dose) are also underway. New prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines based on the ChAdOx1 vector are currently undergoing pre-clinical and clinical assessment, including vaccines against viral hemorrhagic fevers, Nipah virus, HIV, Hepatitis B, amongst others.","['Folegatti PM', 'Jenkin D', 'Morris S', 'Gilbert S', 'Kim D', 'Robertson JS', 'Smith ER', 'Martin E', 'Gurwith M', 'Chen RT', 'Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy Working Group BRAVATO, ex-V3SWG)']",2022,40,35,Vaccine,"Folegatti PM, et al.

RESLES is one of the most common causes of Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy reversible splenial lesion (MERS) and a rare clinical syndrome for the pediatric population. In a limited number of pediatric case reports, association with SARS-COV-2 in was reported. We aimed to increase the awareness of neurological involvement and treatment options of RESLES in children diagnosed with MIS-C.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases with a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome-children who developed RESLES during the disease course. Fever, blurred vision, ataxia and encephalopathy were the main central nervous system symptoms. In our first case, we observed a rapid recovery in clinical symptoms and complete resolution of the splenial lesion in with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone treatment. However, our second case did not respond to IVIG and methylprednisolone treatment. We performed therapeutic plasma exchange therapy and observed a successful recovery both in brain magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiographic findings.
CONCLUSION: Although IVIG and methylprednisolone are the first choice treatment methods in MIS-C cases progressing with RESLES, therapeutic plasma exchange may be an option for the treatment of unresponsive cases.","['Varol F', 'Ergul N', 'Sahin EG', 'Can YY', 'Ergul U', 'Guven S', 'Cam H']",2022,61,5,Transfus Apher Sci,"Varol F, et al.

35708611,Shepherd: accurate clustering for correcting DNA barcode errors.,"MOTIVATION: DNA barcodes are short, random nucleotide sequences introduced into cell populations to track the relative counts of hundreds of thousands of individual lineages over time. Lineage tracking is widely applied, e.g. to understand evolutionary dynamics in microbial populations and the progression of breast cancer in humans. Barcode sequences are unknown upon insertion and must be identified using next-generation sequencing technology, which is error prone. In this study, we frame the barcode error correction task as a clustering problem with the aim to identify true barcode sequences from noisy sequencing data. We present Shepherd, a novel clustering method that is based on an indexing system of barcode sequences using k-mers, and a Bayesian statistical test incorporating a substitution error rate to distinguish true from error sequences.
RESULTS: When benchmarking with synthetic data, Shepherd provides barcode count estimates that are significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, producing 10-150 times fewer spurious lineages. For empirical data, Shepherd produces results that are consistent with the improvements seen on synthetic data. These improvements enable higher resolution lineage tracking and more accurate estimates of biologically relevant quantities, e.g. the detection of small effect mutations.

35705986,Projecting vaccine demand and impact for emerging zoonotic pathogens.,"BACKGROUND: Despite large outbreaks in humans seeming improbable for a number of zoonotic pathogens, several pose a concern due to their epidemiological characteristics and evolutionary potential. To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response.
METHODS: We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies to assess sustainable vaccine manufacturing needs, vaccine stockpile requirements, and the potential impact of the outbreak response. This framework incorporates geographically variable zoonotic spillover rates, human-to-human transmission, and the implementation of reactive vaccination campaigns in response to disease outbreaks. As proof of concept, we applied the framework to four priority pathogens: Lassa virus, Nipah virus, MERS coronavirus, and Rift Valley virus.
RESULTS: Annual vaccine regimen requirements for a population-wide strategy ranged from > 670,000 (95% prediction interval 0-3,630,000) regimens for Lassa virus to 1,190,000 (95% PrI 0-8,480,000) regimens for Rift Valley fever virus, while the regimens required for ring vaccination or targeting healthcare workers (HCWs) were several orders of magnitude lower (between 1/25 and 1/700) than those required by a population-wide strategy. For each pathogen and vaccination strategy, reactive vaccination typically prevented fewer than 10% of cases, because of their presently low R
CONCLUSIONS: Our framework provides a flexible methodology for estimating vaccine stockpile needs and the geographic distribution of demand under a range of outbreak response scenarios. Uncertainties in our model estimates highlight several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to target vulnerable populations more accurately. These include surveillance gaps that mask the true geographic distribution of each pathogen, details of key routes of spillover from animal reservoirs to humans, and the role of human-to-human transmission outside of healthcare settings. In addition, our estimates are based on the current epidemiology of each pathogen, but pathogen evolution could alter vaccine stockpile requirements.","['Lerch A', 'Ten Bosch QA', ""L'Azou Jackson M"", 'Bettis AA', 'Bernuzzi M', 'Murphy GAV', 'Tran QM', 'Huber JH', 'Siraj AS', 'Bron GM', 'Elliott M', 'Hartlage CS', 'Koh S', 'Strimbu K', 'Walters M', 'Perkins TA', 'Moore SM']",2022,20,1,BMC Med,"Lerch A, et al.

In this study, we constructed three different SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates that exhibited high structural homogeneity and stability. Notably, these vaccines elicited up to 50-times-higher neutralizing antibody titers than the S1 monomer in mice. Crucially, it was found that the S1-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine could elicit comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type or emerging variant SARS-CoV-2, with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the effect of which could be further enhanced using our designed nanoparticles. Our results indicate that the S1-conjugated nanoparticles are promising vaccine candidates with the potential to elicit potent and cross-reactive immunity against not only wild-type SARS-CoV-2, but also its variants of concern, variants of interest, and even other pathogenic betacoronaviruses.

Viral genetics; host factors, including polymorphisms in the receptors; and ecological, environmental, and population dynamics are major parameters to consider. Here, we describe the taxonomy, geographic distribution, and unique traits of bats associated with their importance as virus reservoirs. Then, we summarize the origin, intermediate hosts, and the current understanding of interspecies transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, Marburg virus, and rotaviruses. Finally, the molecular interactions of viral surface proteins with host cell receptors are examined, and a comparison of these interactions in humans, intermediate hosts, and bats is conducted. This uncovers adaptive mutations in virus spike protein that facilitate cross-species transmission and risk factors associated with the emergence of novel viruses from bats.","['Tian J', 'Sun J', 'Li D', 'Wang N', 'Wang L', 'Zhang C', 'Meng X', 'Ji X', 'Suchard MA', 'Zhang X', 'Lai A', 'Su S', 'Veit M']",2022,39,11,Cell Rep,"Tian J, et al.

35669345,NeoSplice: a bioinformatics method for prediction of splice variant neoantigens.,"MOTIVATION: Splice variant neoantigens are a potential source of tumor-specific antigen (TSA) that are shared between patients in a variety of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. Current tools for genomic prediction of splice variant neoantigens demonstrate promise. However, many tools have not been well validated with simulated and/or wet lab approaches, with no studies published that have presented a targeted immunopeptidome mass spectrometry approach designed specifically for identification of predicted splice variant neoantigens.
RESULTS: In this study, we describe NeoSplice, a novel computational method for splice variant neoantigen prediction based on (i) prediction of tumor-specific k-mers from RNA-seq data, (ii) alignment of differentially expressed k-mers to the splice graph and (iii) inference of the variant transcript with MHC binding prediction.

35669291,"In Silico Comparative Analysis of the Functional, Structural, and Evolutionary Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Spike Proteins.","BACKGROUND: A recent global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) created a pandemic and emerged as a potential threat to humanity. The analysis of virus genetic composition has revealed that the spike protein, one of the major structural proteins, facilitates the entry of the virus to host cells.
OBJECTIVE: The spike protein has become the main target for prophylactics and therapeutics studies. Here, we compared the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants using bioinformatics tools.
METHODS: The spike protein sequences of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its 6 variants-D614G, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2), gamma (P.1), and omicron (B.1.1.529)-were retrieved from the NCBI database. The ClustalX program was used to sequence multiple alignment and perform mutational analysis. Several online bioinformatics tools were used to predict the physiological, immunological, and structural features of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using CLC software. Statistical analysis of the data was done using jamovi 2 software.
RESULTS: Multiple sequence analysis revealed that the P681R mutation in the delta variant, which changed an amino acid from histidine (H) to arginine (R), made the protein more alkaline due to arginine's high pKa value (12.5) compared to histidine's (6.0). Physicochemical properties revealed the relatively higher isoelectric point (7.34) and aliphatic index (84.65) of the delta variant compared to other variants. Statistical analysis of the isoelectric point, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of all the variants revealed significant correlation, with 
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed that the delta variant is more aliphatic in nature, which provides more stability to it and subsequently influences virus behavior.","['Math RK', 'Mudennavar N', 'Javaregowda PK', 'Savanur A']",2022,3,1,JMIR Bioinform Biotech,"Math RK, et al.

35664675,Molecular and Clinical Investigation of COVID-19: From Pathogenesis and Immune Responses to Novel Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012/2013, and especially the current 2019/2021 severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) negatively affected the national health systems worldwide. Different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and recently Omicron (B.1.1.529), have emerged resulting from the high rate of genetic recombination and S1-RBD/S2 mutation/deletion in the spike protein that has an impact on the virus activity. Furthermore, genetic variability in certain genes involved in the immune system might impact the level of SARS-CoV-2 recognition and immune response against the virus among different populations. Understanding the molecular mechanism and function of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their different epidemiological outcomes is a key step for effective COVID-19 treatment strategies, including antiviral drug development and vaccine designs, which can immunize people with genetic variabilities against various strains of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we center our focus on the recent and up-to-date knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha to Omicron) origin and evolution, structure, genetic diversity, route of transmission, pathogenesis, new diagnostic, and treatment strategies, as well as the psychological and economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and their lives around the world.","['Kashani NR', 'Azadbakht J', 'Ehteram H', 'Kashani HH', 'Rajabi-Moghadam H', 'Ahmad E', 'Nikzad H', 'Hosseini ES']",2022,9,,Front Mol Biosci,"Kashani NR, et al.

Diagnosis of HAdV is commonly achieved by conventional methods such as viral cultures, immunoassays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. However, there are a variety of problems with conventional methods including slow isolation and propagation, inhibition by neutralizing antibodies, low sensitivity of immunoassays, and the diversity of HAdV strains for the PCR technique.

This vigilance was maintained to varying degrees in different jurisdictions.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evolution of vigilance following previous epidemics and pandemics and the subsequent atrophy of vigilance prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
METHODS: We evaluated documentation discussing US, Canada, and South Korea from March 2002 to October 2021. Our policy search strategy was rooted in academic literature, government documents and media reports.
RESULTS: In the US, there were examples of atrophy of vigilance; however, there was clear understanding of pandemic readiness actions that were simply not executed amongst political chaos. In Canada, political mishaps were less evident at the time the pandemic unfolded. Nevertheless, atrophy was evident with erosion in preparedness programs following SARS. South Korea appeared least subjected to atrophy of vigilance. The more recent MERS outbreak prompted evolution of sustained vigilance and compliance with basic public health measures such as mask wearing.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Policy options need to be explored and instituted that increase protection of preparedness programs through institutional safeguards and accountability measure.","['Witek TJ', 'Schwartz R']",2022,10,,Front Public Health,Witek TJ and Schwartz R.

35663932,Dysregulated Interferon Response and Immune Hyperactivation in Severe COVID-19: Targeting STATs as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy.,"A disease outbreak in December 2019, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells from the upper and lower respiratory tract system and is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets. Common clinical symptoms include fatigue, fever, and cough, but also shortness of breath and lung abnormalities. Still, some 5% of SARS-CoV-2 infections progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and/or multiple organ failure as important consequences, which can lead to death. The innate immune system recognizes viral RNAs and triggers the expression of interferons (IFN). IFNs activate anti-viral effectors and components of the adaptive immune system by activating members of the STAT and IRF families that induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)s. Among other coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, common strategies have been identified to antagonize IFN signaling. This typically coincides with hyperactive inflammatory host responses known as the ""cytokine storm"" that mediate severe lung damage. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 infection combines a dysregulated IFN response with excessive production of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. This excessive inflammatory response in the lungs is associated with the local recruitment of immune cells that create a pathogenic inflammatory loop. Together, it causes severe lung pathology, including ARDS, as well as damage to other vulnerable organs, like the heart, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidney, as well as the brain. This can rapidly progress to multiple organ exhaustion and correlates with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we focus on the crucial role of different types of IFN that underlies the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection and leads to immune cell hyper-activation in the lungs, exuberant systemic inflammation, and multiple organ damage. Consequently, to protect from systemic inflammation, it will be critical to interfere with signaling cascades activated by IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines. Targeting members of the STAT family could therefore be proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy in patients with severe COVID-19.","['Eskandarian Boroujeni M', 'Sekrecka A', 'Antonczyk A', 'Hassani S', 'Sekrecki M', 'Nowicka H', 'Lopacinska N', 'Olya A', 'Kluzek K', 'Wesoly J', 'Bluyssen HAR']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Eskandarian Boroujeni M, et al.

METHODS: A persistent leukopenic condition was induced in mice by injecting cyclophosphamide (CYP) three days before each dose of immunization. Mice were immunized on days 0, 14 and 21 with α-GalCer-bearing MERS-CoV PLpro-encapsulated DPPC-liposomes (α-GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes or MERS-CoV PLpo-encapsulated DPPC-liposomes (MERS-PLpro-liposomes), whereas the antigen emulsified in Alum (MERS-PLpro-Alum) was taken as a control. On day 26, the blood was taken from the immunized mice to analyze IgG titer, whereas the splenocytes were used to analyze the lymphocyte proliferation and the level of cytokines. In order to assess the memory immune response, mice were given a booster dose after 150 days of the last immunization.
RESULTS: The higher levels of MERS-CoV-PLpro-specific antibody titer, IgG2a and lymphocyte proliferation were noticed in mice immunized with α-GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes. Besides, the splenocytes from mice immunized with α-GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes produced larger amounts of IFN-γ as compared to the splenocytes from MERS-PLpro-liposomes or MERS- PLpro-Alum immunized mice. Importantly, an efficient antigen-specific memory immune response was observed in α-GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes immunized mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that α-GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes may substantiate to be a successful vaccine formulation against MERS-CoV infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.","['Khan MA', 'Khan A', 'Alzohairy MA', 'Alruwetei AM', 'Alsahli MA', 'Allemailem KS', 'Alrumaihi F', 'Almatroudi A', 'Alhatlani BY', 'Rugaie OA', 'Malik A']",2022,34,5,J King Saud Univ Sci,"Khan MA, et al.

METHODS: A random sample of 234 E. coli and 283 third generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates from urine and blood were collected (2014-2017). Culture-antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using VITEK 2 and BD Phoenix. Sequences were used as input for KOVER-AMR-SCM, KOVER-AMR-CART, and ResFinder 4.1. The concordance, major error rate (MER), and very major error rate (VMER) were calculated, with subsequent comparison to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria (MER ≤3% and VMER with a 95% confidence interval ≤1.5-≤7.5%).
RESULTS: ResFinder 4.1 performed better than KOVER-AMR-models; however, neither tool achieved overall (V)MERs below FDA criteria. KOVER-AMR-SCM, KOVER-AMR-CART, and ResFinder 4.1, MER (cumulative all antimicrobials) were: 5.1% (4.4-5.9), 4.3% (3.6-5.0), and 5.1% (4.5-5.8), respectively. MERs ≤3% were achieved for 6 (SCM) and 5 (CART) of the 11 tested antimicrobials for KOVER-AMR-models and for 9/13 antimicrobials tested with ResFinder 4.1.

35655326,"Transchromosomic bovines-derived broadly neutralizing antibodies as potent biotherapeutics to counter important emerging viral pathogens with a special focus on SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, HIV-1, and influenza A virus.","Historically, passive immunotherapy is an approved approach for protecting and treating humans against various diseases when other alternative therapeutic options are unavailable. Human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) can be made from convalescent human donor serum, although it is considered limited due to pandemics and the urgent requirement. Additionally, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) could be generated from animals, but they may cause severe immunoreactivity and, once ""humanized,"" may have lower neutralization efficiency. Transchromosomic bovines (TcBs) have been developed to address these concerns by creating robust neutralizing hpAbs, which are useful in preventing and/or curing human infections in response to hyperimmunization with vaccines holding adjuvants and/or immune stimulators over an extensive period. Unlike other animal-derived pAbs, potent hpAbs could be promptly produced from TcB in large amounts to assist against an outbreak scenario. Some of these highly efficacious TcB-derived antibodies have already neutralized and blocked diseases in clinical studies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has numerous variants classified into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring. Although these variants possess different mutations, such as N501Y, E484K, K417N, K417T, L452R, T478K, and P681R, SAB-185 has shown broad neutralizing activity against VOCs, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, and VOIs, such as Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda variants. This article highlights recent developments in the field of bovine-derived biotherapeutics, which are seen as a practical platform for developing safe and effective antivirals with broad activity, particularly considering emerging viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Zika, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and influenza A virus.

35642193,"Pulmonary function test and computed tomography features during follow-up after SARS, MERS and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic follows severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus epidemics. Some survivors of COVID-19 infection experience persistent respiratory symptoms, yet their cause and natural history remain unclear. Follow-up after SARS and MERS may provide a model for predicting the long-term pulmonary consequences of COVID-19.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to describe and compare the longitudinal pulmonary function test (PFT) and computed tomography (CT) features of patients recovering from SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Meta-analysis of PFT parameters (DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model) and proportion of CT features (Freeman-Tukey transformation random-effects model) were performed.
FINDINGS: Persistent reduction in the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide following SARS and COVID-19 infection is seen at 6 months follow-up, and 12 months after MERS. Other PFT parameters recover in this time. 6 months after SARS and COVID-19, ground-glass opacity, linear opacities and reticulation persist in over 30% of patients; honeycombing and traction dilatation are reported less often. Severe/critical COVID-19 infection leads to greater CT and PFT abnormality compared to mild/moderate infection.
INTERPRETATION: Persistent diffusion defects suggestive of parenchymal lung injury occur after SARS, MERS and COVID-19 infection, but improve over time. After COVID-19 infection, CT features are suggestive of persistent parenchymal lung injury, in keeping with a post-COVID-19 interstitial lung syndrome. It is yet to be determined if this is a regressive or progressive disease.","['Huntley CC', 'Patel K', 'Bil Bushra SE', 'Mobeen F', 'Armitage MN', 'Pye A', 'Knight CB', 'Mostafa A', 'Kershaw M', 'Mughal AZ', 'McKemey E', 'Turner AM', 'Burge PS', 'Walters GI']",2022,8,2,ERJ Open Res,"Huntley CC, et al.

35639931,The nature and genomic landscape of repetitive DNA classes in Chrysanthemum nankingense shows recent genomic changes.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tandemly repeated DNA and transposable elements represent most of the DNA in higher plant genomes. High-throughput sequencing allows a survey of the DNA in a genome, but whole-genome assembly can miss a substantial fraction of highly repeated sequence motifs. Chrysanthemum nankingense (2n = 2x = 18; genome size = 3.07 Gb; Asteraceae), a diploid reference for the many auto- and allopolyploids in the genus, was considered as an ancestral species and serves as an ornamental plant and high-value food. We aimed to characterize the major repetitive DNA motifs, understand their structure and identify key features that are shaped by genome and sequence evolution.
METHODS: Graph-based clustering with RepeatExplorer was used to identify and classify repetitive motifs in 2.14 millions of 250-bp paired-end Illumina reads from total genomic DNA of C. nankingense. Independently, the frequency of all canonical motifs k-bases long was counted in the raw read data and abundant k-mers (16, 21, 32, 64 and 128) were extracted and assembled to generate longer contigs for repetitive motif identification. For comparison, long terminal repeat retrotransposons were checked in the published C. nankingense reference genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed to show the chromosomal distribution of the main types of repetitive motifs.
KEY RESULTS: Apart from rDNA (0.86 % of the total genome), a few microsatellites (0.16 %), and telomeric sequences, no highly abundant tandem repeats were identified. There were many transposable elements: 40 % of the genome had sequences with recognizable domains related to transposable elements. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons showed widespread distribution over chromosomes, although different sequence families had characteristic features such as abundance at or exclusion from centromeric or subtelomeric regions. Another group of very abundant repetitive motifs, including those most identified as low-complexity sequences (9.07 %) in the genome, showed no similarity to known sequence motifs or tandemly repeated elements.
CONCLUSIONS: The Chrysanthemum genome has an unusual structure with a very low proportion of tandemly repeated sequences (~1.02 %) in the genome, and a high proportion of low-complexity sequences, most likely degenerated remains of transposable elements. Identifying the presence, nature and genomic organization of major genome fractions enables inference of the evolutionary history of sequences, including degeneration and loss, critical to understanding biodiversity and diversification processes in the genomes of diploid and polyploid Chrysanthemum, Asteraceae and plants more widely.","['Zhang F', 'Chen F', 'Schwarzacher T', 'Heslop-Harrison JS', 'Teng N']",2023,131,1,Ann Bot,"Zhang F, et al.

What promotes resilience in HCWs during pandemics is largely unknown.
AIM: To appraise and synthesize studies investigating resilience among HCWs during COVID-19, H1N1, MERS, EBOLA and SARS pandemics.
METHOD: A systematic review of studies from 2002 to 11th March 2022 was conducted. PsychInfo, CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for qualitative and mixed-methods studies investigating the well-being of HCWs working in hospital settings during a pandemic. Data was extracted, imported into NVivo and analyzed by means of thematic synthesis. Reporting followed PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one eligible studies (N = 11,907) were identified. The results revealed six main themes underpinning HCWs resilience: moral purpose and duty, connections, collaboration, organizational culture, character and potential for growth.
CONCLUSION: The studies reviewed indicated that HCWs resilience is mainly born out of their professional identity, collegial support, effective communication from supportive leaders along with flexibility to engage in self-care and experiences of growth.","['Curtin M', 'Richards HL', 'Fortune DG']",2022,95,,Clin Psychol Rev,"Curtin M, et al.

Here, we report a label free electrochemical Fluorine-Doped Tin Oxide (FTO) Immunosensor coupled with gold nanorods (GNRs) as an electron carrier for ultrasensitive detection of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS CoV-2 Spike protein. The RBD gene was cloned, and expressed in-house with confirmed molecular weight of ∼31 kDa via Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). RBD antibodies (Ab) were generated to be used as a bioreceptor for sensor fabrication, and characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). GNRs were fabricated on the electrode surface, followed by immobilization of RBD Ab. The conjugation steps were confirmed by UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). The fabricated electrode was further optimized for maximum efficiency and output. The detection limit of the developed electrode was determined as 0.73 fM for RBD antigen (Ag). Furthermore, the patient nasopharyngeal samples were collected in Viral Transport Media (VTM), and tested on the sensor surface that resulted in detection of SARS CoV-2 within 30 s, which was further validated via Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the immunosensor showed good repeatability, storage stability, and minimal cross reactivity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spike protein. Along with ease of fabrication, the electrodes show future miniaturization potential for extensive and rapid screening of populations for COVID-19.","['Shahdeo D', 'Roberts A', 'Archana GJ', 'Shrikrishna NS', 'Mahari S', 'Nagamani K', 'Gandhi S']",2022,212,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Shahdeo D, et al.

35621107,[Increased LAMP1 Expression Enhances SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Production in Vero-Derived Transgenic Cell Lines].,"Coronaviridae is a family of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses that can cause diseases with high mortality rates. SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV appeared in 2002-2003 and 2012, respectively. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019 in Wuhan (China) and has caused more than 5 million deaths in worldwide. The entry of SARS-CoV-1 into the cell is due to the interaction of the viral spike (S) protein and the cell protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). After infection, virus assembly occurs in Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles during exocytosis. One of the possible participants in this process is LAMP1 protein. We established transgenic Vero cell lines with increased expression of human LAMP1 gene and evaluated SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 production. An increase in the production of both viruses in LAMP1-expressing cells when compared with Vero cells was observed, especially in the presence of trypsin during infection. From these results it can be assumed that LAMP1 promotes SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 production due to enhanced exocytosis.","['Dolskiy AA', 'Grishchenko IV', 'Bodnev SA', 'Nazarenko AA', 'Smirnova AM', 'Matveeva AK', 'Bulychev LE', 'Ovchinnikova AS', 'Tregubchak TV', 'Zaykovskaya AV', 'Imatdinov IR', 'Pyankov OV', 'Gavrilova EV', 'Maksyutov RA', 'Yudkin DV']",2022,56,3,Mol Biol (Mosk),"Dolskiy AA, et al.

This virus causes acute respiratory syndrome in infected people. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection will probably rise unless efficient treatments or vaccines are developed. The global funding and medical communities have started performing more than five hundred clinical examinations on a broad spectrum of repurposed drugs to acquire effective treatments. Besides, other novel treatment approaches have also recently emerged, including cellular host-directed therapies. They counteract the unwanted responses of the host immune system that led to the severe pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This brief review focuses on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) principles in treating the COVID-19. The US clinical trials database and the world health organization database for clinical trials have reported 82 clinical trials (altogether) exploring the effects of MSCs in COVID-19 treatment. MSCs also had better be tried for treating other pathogens worldwide. MSC treatment may have the potential to end the high mortality rate of COVID-19.

35615888,Drugs repurposing for SARS-CoV-2: new insight of COVID-19 druggability.,"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) creates a massive panic worldwide due to the absence of effective medicines. Developing a new drug or vaccine is time-consuming to pass safety and efficacy testing. Therefore, repurposing drugs have been introduced to treat COVID-19 until effective drugs are developed.
AREA COVERED: A detailed search of repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out using the PubMed database, focusing on articles published 2020 years onward. A different class of drugs has been described in this article to target hosts and viruses. Based on the previous pandemic experience of SARS-CoV and MERS, several antiviral and antimalarial drugs are discussed here. This review covers the failure of some repurposed drugs that showed promising activity in the earlier CoV-pandemic but were found ineffective against SARS-CoV-2. All these discussions demand a successful drug development strategy for screening and identifying an effective drug for better management of COVID-19.
EXPERT OPINION: Repurposed drugs have been used since COVID-19 to eradicate disease propagation. Drugs found effective for MERS and SARS may not be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Drug libraries and artificial intelligence are helpful tools to screen and identify different molecules targeting viruses or hosts.","['Debnath SK', 'Debnath M', 'Srivastava R', 'Omri A']",2022,20,9,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,"Debnath SK, et al.

It spreads by means of respiratory droplets and close contact with infected persons. With the progression of disease, numerous complications develop, particularly among persons with chronic illnesses. Pathological investigations indicate that it affects multiple organs and can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prevention is vital and self-isolation is the best means of containing this virus. Good community health practices like maintaining sufficient distance from other people, wearing protective face masks and regular hand washing should be adopted. Convalescent plasma transfusion and the administration of the antiviral Remdesivir have been found to be effective. Vaccines offer lifesaving protecting against COVID-19 which has killed millions and our best bet for staying safe. Screening, suppression/containment as well as mitigation are the strategies implemented for controlling COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination is essential to end the COVID-19 pandemic and everyone should have an access to them.

METHODS: We identified conserved T- and B-cell epitopes from Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) highly homologous to 38 sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, to design a protein subunit vaccine targeting antigens to Dendritic Cells (DC) via CD40 surface receptor (CD40.CoV2).
FINDINGS: CD40.CoV2 immunization elicited high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, VOCs, and SARS-CoV-1 in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, associated with viral control and survival after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. A direct comparison of CD40.CoV2 with the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine showed that the two vaccines were equally immunogenic in mice. We demonstrated the potency of CD40.CoV2 to recall in vitro human multi-epitope, functional, and cytotoxic SARS-CoV-2 S- and N-specific T-cell responses that are unaffected by VOC mutations and cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-1 and, to a lesser extent, MERS epitopes.
INTERPRETATION: We report the immunogenicity and antiviral efficacy of the CD40.CoV2 vaccine in a preclinical model providing a framework for a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.

35594398,MERS-CoV endoribonuclease and accessory proteins jointly evade host innate immunity during infection of lung and nasal epithelial cells.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into humans in 2012, causing highly lethal respiratory disease. The severity of disease may be, in part, because MERS-CoV is adept at antagonizing early innate immune pathways—interferon (IFN) production and signaling, protein kinase R (PKR), and oligoadenylate synthetase/ribonuclease L (OAS/RNase L)—activated in response to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated during genome replication. This is in contrast to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which we recently reported to activate PKR and RNase L and, to some extent, IFN signaling. We previously found that MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a (dsRNA binding protein) and NS4b (phosphodiesterase) could weakly suppress these pathways, but ablation of each had minimal effect on virus replication. Here we investigated the antagonist effects of the conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), in combination with NS4a or NS4b. Inactivation of EndoU catalytic activity alone in a recombinant MERS-CoV caused little if any effect on activation of the innate immune pathways during infection. However, infection with recombinant viruses containing combined mutations with inactivation of EndoU and deletion of NS4a or inactivation of the NS4b phosphodiesterase promoted robust activation of dsRNA-induced innate immune pathways. This resulted in at least tenfold attenuation of replication in human lung–derived A549 and primary nasal cells. Furthermore, replication of these recombinant viruses could be rescued to the level of wild-type MERS-CoV by knockout of host immune mediators MAVS, PKR, or RNase L. Thus, EndoU and accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b together suppress dsRNA-induced innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection in order to optimize viral replication.","['Comar CE', 'Otter CJ', 'Pfannenstiel J', 'Doerger E', 'Renner DM', 'Tan LH', 'Perlman S', 'Cohen NA', 'Fehr AR', 'Weiss SR']",2022,119,21,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Comar CE, et al.

35588276,Effective Interferon Lambda Treatment Regimen To Control Lethal MERS-CoV Infection in Mice.,"Effective broad-spectrum antivirals are critical to prevent and control emerging human coronavirus (hCoV) infections. Despite considerable progress made toward identifying and evaluating several synthetic broad-spectrum antivirals against hCoV infections, a narrow therapeutic window has limited their success. Enhancing the endogenous interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response is another antiviral strategy that has been known for decades. However, the side effects of pegylated type-I IFNs (IFN-Is) and the proinflammatory response detected after delayed IFN-I therapy have discouraged their clinical use. In contrast to IFN-Is, IFN-λ, a dominant IFN at the epithelial surface, has been shown to be less proinflammatory. Consequently, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of IFN-λ in hCoV-infected airway epithelial cells and mice. Human primary airway epithelial cells treated with a single dose of IFN-I (IFN-α) and IFN-λ showed similar ISG expression, whereas cells treated with two doses of IFN-λ expressed elevated levels of ISG compared to that of IFN-α-treated cells. Similarly, mice treated with two doses of IFN-λ were better protected than mice that received a single dose, and a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic regimens completely protected mice from a lethal Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infection. A two-dose IFN-λ regimen significantly reduced lung viral titers and inflammatory cytokine levels with marked improvement in lung inflammation. Collectively, we identified an effective regimen for IFN-λ use and demonstrated the protective efficacy of IFN-λ in MERS-CoV-infected mice.

35584273,Potential intestinal infection and faecal-oral transmission of human coronaviruses.,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in 1960s for patients experiencing common cold. Since then, increasing number of HCoVs have been discovered, including those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the circulating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can cause fatal respiratory disease in humans on infection. HCoVs are believed to spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with HCoV infection develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and many patients with confirmed HCoV infection have shown detectable viral RNA in their faecal samples. Furthermore, multiple in vitro and in vivo animal studies have provided direct evidence of intestinal HCoV infection. These data highlight the nature of HCoV GI infection and its potential faecal-oral transmission. Here, we summarise the current findings on GI manifestations of HCoVs. We also discuss how HCoV GI infection might occur and the current evidence to establish the occurrence of faecal-oral transmission.","['Ning T', 'Liu S', 'Xu J', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang N', 'Xie S', 'Min L', 'Zhang S', 'Zhu S', 'Wang Y']",2022,32,6,Rev Med Virol,"Ning T, et al.

35583675,AMR-meta: a k-mer and metafeature approach to classify antimicrobial resistance from high-throughput short-read metagenomics data.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health concern. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing of microbial samples enables profiling of AMR genes through comparison with curated AMR databases. However, the performance of current methods is often hampered by database incompleteness and the presence of homology/homoplasy with other non-AMR genes in sequenced samples.
RESULTS: We present AMR-meta, a database-free and alignment-free approach, based on k-mers, which combines algebraic matrix factorization into metafeatures with regularized regression. Metafeatures capture multi-level gene diversity across the main antibiotic classes. AMR-meta takes in reads from metagenomic shotgun sequencing and outputs predictions about whether those reads contribute to resistance against specific classes of antibiotics. In addition, AMR-meta uses an augmented training strategy that joins an AMR gene database with non-AMR genes (used as negative examples). We compare AMR-meta with AMRPlusPlus, DeepARG, and Meta-MARC, further testing their ensemble via a voting system. In cross-validation, AMR-meta has a median f-score of 0.7 (interquartile range, 0.2-0.9). On semi-synthetic metagenomic data-external test-on average AMR-meta yields a 1.3-fold hit rate increase over existing methods. In terms of run-time, AMR-meta is 3 times faster than DeepARG, 30 times faster than Meta-MARC, and as fast as AMRPlusPlus. Finally, we note that differences in AMR ontologies and observed variance of all tools in classification outputs call for further development on standardization of benchmarking data and protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: AMR-meta is a fast, accurate classifier that exploits non-AMR negative sets to improve sensitivity and specificity. The differences in AMR ontologies and the high variance of all tools in classification outputs call for the deployment of standard benchmarking data and protocols, to fairly compare AMR prediction tools.","['Marini S', 'Oliva M', 'Slizovskiy IB', 'Das RA', 'Noyes NR', 'Kahveci T', 'Boucher C', 'Prosperi M']",2022,11,,Gigascience,"Marini S, et al.

35583271,"SPRISS: approximating frequent k-mers by sampling reads, and applications.","MOTIVATION: The extraction of k-mers is a fundamental component in many complex analyses of large next-generation sequencing datasets, including reads classification in genomics and the characterization of RNA-seq datasets. The extraction of all k-mers and their frequencies is extremely demanding in terms of running time and memory, owing to the size of the data and to the exponential number of k-mers to be considered. However, in several applications, only frequent k-mers, which are k-mers appearing in a relatively high proportion of the data, are required by the analysis.
RESULTS: In this work, we present SPRISS, a new efficient algorithm to approximate frequent k-mers and their frequencies in next-generation sequencing data. SPRISS uses a simple yet powerful reads sampling scheme, which allows to extract a representative subset of the dataset that can be used, in combination with any k-mer counting algorithm, to perform downstream analyses in a fraction of the time required by the analysis of the whole data, while obtaining comparable answers. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of SPRISS in approximating frequent k-mers, and shows that it can be used in various scenarios, such as the comparison of metagenomic datasets, the identification of discriminative k-mers, and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping, to extract insights in a fraction of the time required by the analysis of the whole dataset.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, as the dominant structural protein from coronaviruses that bind to the genomic RNA, participates in various vital activities after virus invasion and will probably become a promising target of antiviral drug design. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review of human coronavirus' pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic strategies is necessary for the control of the pandemic. Here, we give a systematic summary of the structures, immunoregulation, and potential vaccines and targeted drugs of the HCoVs N protein. First, we provide a general introduction to the fundamental structures and molecular function of N protein. Next, we outline the N protein mediated immune regulation and pathogenesis mechanism. Finally, we comprehensively summarize the development of potential N protein-targeted drugs and candidate vaccines to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

35567883,Fluorescence-based simultaneous dual oligo sensing of HCV genotypes 1 and 3 using magnetite nanoparticles.,"Nucleic acid tests (NATs) have gained an important position in biosensing in the context of the increasing need to meet the stringent requirements for accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases with high sensitivity and selectivity. Recently, the development of new strategies towards multiplex detection of analytes in a single assay is gaining impetus since such an approach would lead to high throughput analysis, leading to substantial benefits in terms of time, infrastructure, labor, and cost. In this work, we demonstrate a facile fluorescence-based simultaneous dual oligo sensing of genotypes 1 and 3 by employing two target sequences (36-mers each) derived from the NS4B and NS5A regions of HCV genome, respectively. A set of 18-mer amine-tagged probes and another set of 18-mer fluorescently-labeled probes that were complementary to each half of the 36-mer target sequences were designed. The amine-tagged probes were immobilized over aldehyde-derivatized magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) via imine bond formation, which was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping techniques. The successful hybridization between the two probes with their target followed by magnetic removal of the NPs from the solution enabled quantitative analysis of the target by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the residual concentration of the fluorescently-tagged probe. In this manner, the targets corresponding to genotypes 1 and 3 were simultaneously detected with the detection limit in the range of 10-15 nM. The current strategy can potentially be amalgamated with existing nanotechnology-based techniques towards multiplex oligo sensing of several pathogens.","['Maroju PA', 'Ganesan R', 'Dutta JR']",2022,232,,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Maroju PA, et al.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the seventh member of this coronavirus family, was detected in 2019 and can cause a number of respiratory symptoms, from dry cough and fever to fatal viral pneumonia. Various diagnostic assays ranging from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to point-of-care medical diagnostic systems have been developed for detection of viral components or antibodies targeting the virus. Point-of-care assays allow rapid diagnostic assessment of infectious patients. Such assays are ideally simple, low-cost, portable tests with the possibility for on-site field detection that do not require skilled staff, sophisticated equipment, or sample pretreatment, as compared to RT-PCR. Since early 2021 when new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern increased, rapid tests became more crucial in the disease management cycle.

Furthermore, this review highlights an update in the emergence of new prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against COVID-19. In addition to FDA or The World Health Organization (WHO) approved vaccines, we intended to incorporate the latest published data from phase III trials about different COVID-19 vaccines and provide clinical data released on the networks or peer-review journals.","['Adibzadeh S', 'Amiri S', 'Nia GE', 'Taleghani MR', 'Bijarpas ZK', 'Maserat N', 'Maali A', 'Azad M', 'Behzad-Behbahani A']",2022,27,,Gene Rep,"Adibzadeh S, et al.

35530723,"Urban parks as a potential mitigator of suicide rates resulting from global pandemics: Empirical evidence from past experiences in Seoul, Korea.","Globally, the increased suicide rate of the general population has become a concern not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of its associated socioeconomic insecurity, loss of jobs, and economic shocks. This study employed robust fixed-effects panel models to empirically identify the mitigating effects of infectious diseases, via urban parks, on the suicide rate, and to examine gender differences in this regard, based on previous experiences in Seoul, Korea. We found that the differentiating mitigating effect did not significantly affect suicide rates during the 2015 MERS epidemic. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, wherein the number of confirmed cases was very high and diffused nationwide, urban parks significantly reduced the suicide rates for both men and women. The role of parks as a mitigator was more enhanced in cities with a high number of confirmed cases if it was associated with economic shocks. However, this effect was significant only in the suicide rates of men, not women. During a pandemic, urban parks can help maintain social interaction and sustain physical activities (i.e., walking and exercise) while maintaining physical distance. National and local governments should develop urban parks to actively control the suicide rate influenced by movement restriction measures inevitably occurring during the spread of infectious diseases.","['Kim UR', 'Sung H']",2022,127,,Cities,"Kim UR and Sung H.

In the last two decades, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recognized. It has long been demonstrated that MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and SARS-CoV binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. A ""cytokine storm"" is the main pathophysiology of aforementioned viruses. Infiltration of neutrophils at the site of the infection is a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more people than SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV as it can easily be transmitted from person to person. Epidemiological studies indicate that majority of individuals are asymptomatic; therefore, an effective and an efficient tool is required for rapid testing.

This biological process could lead to virus repression, serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, or as potential treatments for this disease. One source of concern is attempting to uncover the viral regions in which this binding could occur, as well as how these miRNAs binding could affect the SARS-COV-2 virus's processes. Using extracted sequence features from this base pairing, we predicted the relationships between miRNAs that interact with genes involved in immune function and bind to the SARS-COV-2 genome in their 5' UTR region. We compared two supervised models, SVM and Random Forest, with an unsupervised One-Class SVM. When the results of the confusion matrices were inspected, the results of the supervised models were misleading, resulting in a Type II error. However, with the latter model, we achieved an average accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 96.18%, and specificity of 78%. We hypothesize that studying the bind of miRNAs that affect immunological genes and bind to the SARS-COV-2 virus will lead to potential genetic therapies for fighting the disease or understanding how the immune system is affected when this type of viral infection occurs.","['Gutiérrez-Cárdenas J', 'Wang Z']",2022,30,,Inform Med Unlocked,Gutiérrez-Cárdenas J and Wang Z.

A zero-COVID strategy is needed to end the crisis, but there is a lack of biological evidence. In the present study, we collected available data on SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis and visualization. The study results revealed that the fatality rate of COVID-19 is low, whereas its death toll is high compared to SARS and MERS. Moreover, COVID-19 had a higher asymptomatic rate. In particular, COVID-19 exhibited unique asymptomatic transmissibility. Further, we developed a foolproof operating software in Python language to simulate COVID-19 spread in Wuhan, showing that the cumulative cases of existing asymptomatic spread would be over 100 times higher than that of only symptomatic spread. This confirmed the essential role of asymptomatic transmissibility in the uncontrolled global spread of COVID-19, which enables the necessity of implementing the zero-COVID policy. In conclusion, we revealed the triggering role of the asymptomatic transmissibility of COVID-19 in this unprecedented global crisis, which offers support to the zero-COVID strategy against the recurring COVID-19 spread.","['Zhang C', 'Wang H', 'Wen Z', 'Gu M', 'Liu L', 'Li X']",2022,12,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Zhang C, et al.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China which then started spreading to different countries around the world. ACE2 receptors are present in various organs but the overexpression of ACE2 at lung epithelia makes them more vulnerable to respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors for entry into host cells which may serve as potential target for future therapy.Repurposing of drugs are the present strategy undertaken as the SARS-CoV-2 shows similar respiratory distress symptoms as in the case of SARS and MERS. At present the antiviral medications and vaccines are at the early stages and may take few months to years, to achieve their complete efficacy to solve the public crisis. The technological advancements have brought passive immunisation, which is an anecdotal success, but the ideal approach to future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 is done by vaccines that are under clinical trials. There are a large percentage of population under psychological crisis either due to the fear of infection or stress from the quarantine lives. High levels of viral loads at the initial stages cause higher chances of transmission hence immediate isolations and screening methods must be undertaken. This review mainly focuses on the treatment strategies followed with no definitive approval from authorities. This is an attempt to gather all the materialistic evidences available for now.","['Joseph S', 'Kutty Narayanan A']",2022,12,1,Adv Pharm Bull,Joseph S and Kutty Narayanan A.

35514183,HLAB: learning the BiLSTM features from the ProtBert-encoded proteins for the class I HLA-peptide binding prediction.,"Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is a type of molecule residing on the surfaces of most human cells and exerts an essential role in the immune system responding to the invasive items. The T cell antigen receptors may recognize the HLA-peptide complexes on the surfaces of cancer cells and destroy these cancer cells through toxic T lymphocytes. The computational determination of HLA-binding peptides will facilitate the rapid development of cancer immunotherapies. This study hypothesized that the natural language processing-encoded peptide features may be further enriched by another deep neural network. The hypothesis was tested with the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory-extracted features from the pretrained Protein Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-encoded features of the class I HLA (HLA-I)-binding peptides. The experimental data showed that our proposed HLAB feature engineering algorithm outperformed the existing ones in detecting the HLA-I-binding peptides. The extensive evaluation data show that the proposed HLAB algorithm outperforms all the seven existing studies on predicting the peptides binding to the HLA-A*01:01 allele in AUC and achieves the best average AUC values on the six out of the seven k-mers (k=8,9,...,14, respectively represent the prediction task of a polypeptide consisting of k amino acids) except for the 9-mer prediction tasks.

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key orchestrators of host antiviral defense and tissue tolerance during a variety of respiratory infections, and AM dysfunction is associated with severe COVID-19. In this study, using a mouse model of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, we examined the role of AMs in MERS pathogenesis. Our results show that depletion of AMs using clodronate (CL) liposomes significantly increased morbidity and mortality in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice. Detailed examination of control and AM-depleted lungs at different days postinfection revealed increased neutrophil activity but a significantly reduced MERS-CoV-specific CD4 T-cell response in AM-deficient lungs during later stages of infection. Furthermore, enhanced MERS severity in AM-depleted mice correlated with lung inflammation and lesions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that AMs are critical for the development of an optimal virus-specific T-cell response and controlling excessive inflammation during MERS-CoV infection.","['Channappanavar R', 'Selvaraj M', 'More S', 'Perlman S']",2022,59,4,Vet Pathol,"Channappanavar R, et al.

In March 2020, WHO announced this epidemic had become a global pandemic and that the novel coronavirus may be mild to most people. However, some people may experience a severe illness that results in hospitalization or maybe death. COVID-19 classification remains challenging due to the ambiguity and similarity with other known respiratory diseases such as SARS, MERS, and other viral pneumonia. The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, chills, shortness of breath, loss of smell and taste, headache, sore throat, chest pains, confusion, and diarrhoea. This research paper suggests the concept of transfer learning using the deterministic algorithm in all binary classification models and evaluates the performance of various CNN architectures. The datasets of 746 CT images of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 were divided for training, validation, and testing. Various augmentation techniques were applied to increase the number of datasets except for testing images. The images were then pretrained using CNN to obtain a binary class.

DcHEV is a novel zoonotic pathogen associated with camel contact. This study aimed to genetically characterize DcHEV in domestic and imported camels in Saudi Arabia. DcHEV was detected by RT-PCR in serum samples, PCR-positive samples were subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. DcHEV was detected in 1.77% of samples with higher positivity in domestic DCs. All positive imported dromedaries were from Sudan with age declining prevalence. Domestic DcHEV sequences clustered with sequences from Kenya, Somalia, and UAE while imported sequences clustered with one DcHEV isolate from UAE and both sequences clustered away from isolates reported from Pakistan. Full-genome sequences showed 24 amino acid difference with reference sequences. Our results confirm the detection of DcHEV in domestic and imported DCs.

35484414,Photonics enabled intelligence system to identify SARS-CoV 2 mutations.,"The COVID-19, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV are hazardous epidemics that have resulted in many deaths which caused a worldwide debate. Despite control efforts, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, and the fast spread of this highly infectious illness has posed a grave threat to global health. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation, on the other hand, has been characterized by worrying variations that modify viral characteristics in response to the changing resistance profile of the human population. The repeated transmission of virus mutation indicates that epidemics are likely to occur. Therefore, an early identification system of ongoing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 will provide essential insights for planning and avoiding future outbreaks. This article discussed the following highlights: First, comparing the omicron mutation with other variants; second, analysis and evaluation of the spread rate of the SARS-CoV 2 variations in the countries; third, identification of mutation areas in spike protein; and fourth, it discussed the photonics approaches enabled with artificial intelligence. Therefore, our goal is to identify the SARS-CoV 2 virus directly without the need for sample preparation or molecular amplification procedures. Furthermore, by connecting through the optical network, the COVID-19 test becomes a component of the Internet of healthcare things to improve precision, service efficiency, and flexibility and provide greater availability for the evaluation of the general population.

An electronic literature search was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of the HCWs and general population of the KSA, with regards to transmission of the infection, risk factors and preventative measures. The line list analysis shows that age, gender, comorbidity, exposure to camels and camel milk consumption were associated with an increased risk of fatality; however, year-wise analysis did not show any decline. Over the years, the mean durations between the symptom onset and hospitalization; the hospitalization and laboratory confirmation have reduced. The review of literature shows that the health care workers and the general population had inadequate knowledge about MERS-CoV, lacked motivation and were disconnected from the health authorities. The WHO line list provides information on risk factors for MERS-CoV, KAP analysis helps to know the potential underlying factors.

35476722,Explaining the Varying Patterns of COVID-19 Deaths Across the United States: 2-Stage Time Series Clustering Framework.,"BACKGROUND: Socially vulnerable communities are at increased risk for adverse health outcomes during a pandemic. Although this association has been established for H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 outbreaks, understanding the factors influencing the outbreak pattern for different communities remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: Our 3 objectives are to determine how many distinct clusters of time series there are for COVID-19 deaths in 3108 contiguous counties in the United States, how the clusters are geographically distributed, and what factors influence the probability of cluster membership.
METHODS: We proposed a 2-stage data analytic framework that can account for different levels of temporal aggregation for the pandemic outcomes and community-level predictors. Specifically, we used time-series clustering to identify clusters with similar outcome patterns for the 3108 contiguous US counties. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explain the relationship between community-level predictors and cluster assignment. We analyzed county-level confirmed COVID-19 deaths from Sunday, March 1, 2020, to Saturday, February 27, 2021.
RESULTS: Four distinct patterns of deaths were observed across the contiguous US counties. The multinomial regression model correctly classified 1904 (61.25%) of the counties' outbreak patterns/clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that county-level patterns of COVID-19 deaths are different and can be explained in part by social and political predictors.","['Megahed FM', 'Jones-Farmer LA', 'Ma Y', 'Rigdon SE']",2022,8,7,JMIR Public Health Surveill,"Megahed FM, et al.

35476528,Dromedary camel nanobodies broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is a trimer of S1/S2 heterodimers with three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) at the S1 subunit for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Due to their small size, nanobodies can recognize protein cavities that are not accessible to conventional antibodies. To isolate high-affinity nanobodies, large libraries with great diversity are highly desirable. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) that are transmitted to humans. Here, we built large dromedary camel VHH phage libraries to isolate nanobodies that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. We isolated two VHH nanobodies, NCI-CoV-7A3 (7A3) and NCI-CoV-8A2 (8A2), which have a high affinity for the RBD via targeting nonoverlapping epitopes and show broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants of concern. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) complex structures revealed that 8A2 binds the RBD in its up mode with a long CDR3 loop directly involved in the ACE2 binding residues and that 7A3 targets a deeply buried region that uniquely extends from the S1 subunit to the apex of the S2 subunit regardless of the conformational state of the RBD. At a dose of ≥5 mg/kg, 7A3 efficiently protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting its therapeutic use against COVID-19 variants. The dromedary camel VHH phage libraries could be helpful as a unique platform ready for quickly isolating potent nanobodies against future emerging viruses.","['Hong J', 'Kwon HJ', 'Cachau R', 'Chen CZ', 'Butay KJ', 'Duan Z', 'Li D', 'Ren H', 'Liang T', 'Zhu J', 'Dandey VP', 'Martin NP', 'Esposito D', 'Ortega-Rodriguez U', 'Xu M', 'Borgnia MJ', 'Xie H', 'Ho M']",2022,119,18,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Hong J, et al.

Applications that use k-mers include genome assembly and alignment. However, the wider bioinformatic use of these short sequences has challenges related to the massive scale of genomic sequence data. A single human genome assembly has billions of k-mers. As a result, the computational requirements for analyzing k-mer information is enormous, particularly when involving complete genome assemblies. To address these issues, we developed a new indexing data structure based on a hash table tuned for the lookup of short sequence keys.

Developing simple and accurate testing methods for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis is crucial not only for the control of COVID-19, but also for better response to similar outbreaks in the future. In this work, we present a novel proof-of-concept of a microfluidic microwave sensing method for POC diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This method relies on the antibody immobilized on the microwave sensor to selectively capture and concentrate the SARS-CoV-2 antigen or virus present in a buffer solution flowing through the sensor region in a microchannel. The capturing of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen or virus results in a change in the permittivity of the medium near the sensor region reflected by the resonance frequency shift which is used for detection. The use of microchannels offers precise control of the sample volume and the continuous flow nature also offers the potential to monitor the dynamic capturing process.

35465271,Potentiometric Biosensors Based on Molecular-Imprinted Self-Assembled Monolayer Films for Rapid Detection of Influenza A Virus and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.,"Rapid, yet accurate and sensitive testing has been shown to be critical in the control of spreading pandemic diseases such as COVID-19. Current methods which are highly sensitive and can differentiate different strains are slow and cannot be conveniently applied at the point of care. Rapid tests, meanwhile, require a high titer and are not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between strains. Here, we report a rapid and facile potentiometric detection method based on nanoscale, three-dimensional molecular imprints of analytes on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which can deliver analyte-specific detection of both whole virions and isolated proteins in microliter amounts of bodily fluids within minutes. The detection substrate with nanoscale inverse surface patterns of analytes formed by a SAM identifies a target analyte by recognizing its surface nano- and molecular structures, which can be monitored by temporal measurement of the change in substrate open-circuit potential. The sensor unambiguously detected and differentiated H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virions as well as the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in human saliva with limits of detection reaching 200 PFU/mL and 100 pg/mL for the viral particles and spike proteins, respectively. The demonstrated speed and specificity of detection, combined with a low required sample volume, high sensitivity, ease of potentiometric measurement, and simple sample collection and preparation, suggest that the technique can be used as a highly effective point-of-care diagnostic platform for a fast, accurate, and specific detection of various viral pathogens and their variants.","['Lee WI', 'Subramanian A', 'Mueller S', 'Levon K', 'Nam CY', 'Rafailovich MH']",2022,5,4,ACS Appl Nano Mater,"Lee WI, et al.

35463461,"COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, clinical outcome and Toll-like receptor (7) mRNA expression driven by TLR7 gene polymorphism (rs3853839) in middle-aged individuals without previous comorbidities.","BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors are implicated in the pathophysiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS), according to several studies. The whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the TLR7 gene could be implicated in the virus's pathogenesis since the virus includes ssRNA patterns that could bind to TLR7.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to look into the function of the TLR7 (rs3853839) C/G polymorphism and the expression of TLR7 mRNA transcript in the development, severity and progression of COVID-19.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A case-control study included 285 participants who were divided into two groups: 150 middle-aged people with COVID 19 who had no previous co-morbidities and 135 healthy volunteers who served as controls. TaqMan test was used to genotype the TLR7 (rs3853839) C/G polymorphism, and real-time PCR was used to determine the relative expression of its mRNA transcript. The level of IL-6 in serum was determined using the ELISA method as an indicator of cytokine storm and COVID-19 severity.
RESULTS: The GG genotype was shown to be much more common in COVID-19 patients (38.7%) than controls (4.4%), with an OR of 19.86 (95% CI: 7.85; 50.22) and was linked to disease severity and poor clinical outcomes (hospitalization, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation).As a result, the G allele was considerably higher in cases (57.0%), while the C allele was significantly higher in controls (
CONCLUSION: The GG form of the TLR7 SNP (rs3853839) could be a genetic risk factor for COVID-19 infection, severe illness and poor clinical outcome. TLR7 mRNA expression was also elevated in COVID-19 patients who were severely/critically unwell and had a bad outcome, suggesting that they could be used as COVID-19 prognostic biomarkers.","['El-Hefnawy SM', 'Eid HA', 'Mostafa RG', 'Soliman SS', 'Omar TA', 'Azmy RM']",2022,27,,Gene Rep,"El-Hefnawy SM, et al.

35462786,A co-infection model on TB - COVID-19 with optimal control and sensitivity analysis.,"COVID-19 had been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in the early 2020. Since then, this deadly virus has claimed millions of lives worldwide. Amidst its chaotic spread, several other diseases have faced negligence in terms of treatment and care, of which one such chronic disease is Tuberculosis. Due to huge rise in COVID-19 cases, there had been a drastic decrease in notification of TB cases which resulted in reversal of global TB target progress. Apart from these due to the earlier co-infections of TB with SARS and MERS-CoV viruses, the TB-COVID-19 co-infection posed a severe threat in the spread of the disease. All these factors backed to be major motivation factor in development of this model. Leading with this concern, a TB - COVID-19 co-infection model is developed in this study, considering possibility of waning immunity of both diseases. Considering different epidemiological traits, an epidemiological model with 11 compartments is developed and the co-dynamics is analysed. A detailed stability and bifurcation analysis is performed for the TB only sub-model, COVID-19 only sub-model and the complete TB - COVID-19 model. Impact of key parameters namely, infection rate, waning immunity, and face mask efficacy on disease prevalence is discussed in detail. Sensitivity analysis by means of normalized forward sensitivity index of the basic reproduction number and LHS-PRCC approach is carried to provide a thorough understanding of significance of various parameters in accelerating as well as controlling the disease spread. Optimal control analysis is presented extensively, incorporating controls related to timely and improved TB treatment, and enhanced COVID-19 tests and isolation facilities to curb the spread of these infectious diseases. The simulation results obtained from each of these analyses stress on the importance of different control measures in mitigation of the diseases and are illustrated accordingly. The study suggests that in the times of a pandemic, other disease treatment and care must not be neglected, and adequate care must be taken so that mortality due to co-infection and unavailability of timely treatment can be avoided.","['Bandekar SR', 'Ghosh M']",2022,200,,Math Comput Simul,Bandekar SR and Ghosh M.

35460274,SubPhaser: a robust allopolyploid subgenome phasing method based on subgenome-specific k-mers.,"With advanced sequencing technology, dozens of complex polyploid plant genomes have been characterized. However, for many polyploid species, their diploid ancestors are unknown or extinct, making it impossible to unravel the subgenomes and genome evolution directly. We developed a novel subgenome-phasing algorithm, SubPhaser, specifically designed for a neoallopolyploid or a homoploid hybrid. SubPhaser first searches for the subgenome-specific sequence (k-mer), then assigns homoeologous chromosomes into subgenomes, and further provides tools to annotate and investigate specific sequences. SubPhaser works well on neoallopolyploids and homoploid hybrids containing subgenome-specific sequences like wheat, but fails on autopolyploids lacking subgenome-specific sequences like alfalfa, indicating that SubPhaser can phase neoallopolyploid/homoploid hybrids with high accuracy, sensitivity and performance. This highly accurate, highly sensitive, ancestral data free chromosome phasing algorithm, SubPhaser, offers significant application value for subgenome phasing in neoallopolyploids and homoploid hybrids, and for the subsequent exploration of genome evolution and related genetic/epigenetic mechanisms.","['Jia KH', 'Wang ZX', 'Wang L', 'Li GY', 'Zhang W', 'Wang XL', 'Xu FJ', 'Jiao SQ', 'Zhou SS', 'Liu H', 'Ma Y', 'Bi G', 'Zhao W', 'El-Kassaby YA', 'Porth I', 'Li G', 'Zhang RG', 'Mao JF']",2022,235,2,New Phytol,"Jia KH, et al.

Initially, previously reported inhibitors of related proteases such as the main proteases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were tested. A huge effort was then carried out by the scientific community to design, synthesize and test new small molecules acting as inactivators of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. From the chemical structure view, these compounds can be classified into two main groups: one corresponds to modified peptides displaying an adequate sequence for high affinity and a reactive warhead; and the second is a diverse group including chemical compounds that do not have a peptide framework. Although a drug including a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor has already been commercialized, denoting the importance of this field, more compounds have been demonstrated to be promising potent inhibitors as potential antiviral drugs.","['Agost-Beltrán L', 'de la Hoz-Rodríguez S', 'Bou-Iserte L', 'Rodríguez S', 'Fernández-de-la-Pradilla A', 'González FV']",2022,27,8,Molecules,"Agost-Beltrán L, et al.

In the past two decades, the world has witnessed the emergence of two other similar CoVs, namely SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2013. The extent of spread of these earlier versions was relatively low in comparison to SARS-CoV-2. Despite having numerous reports inclined towards the zoonotic origin of the virus, one cannot simply sideline the fact that no animal originated CoV is thus far identified that is considered similar to the initial edition of SARS-CoV-2; however, under-sampling of the diverse variety of coronaviruses remains a concern. Vaccines are proved to be an effective tool for bringing the end to such a devastating pandemic. Many vaccine platforms are explored for the same but in this review paper, we will discuss the potential of replicating viral vectors as vaccine carriers for SARS-CoV-2.","['Chavda VP', 'Bezbaruah R', 'Athalye M', 'Parikh PK', 'Chhipa AS', 'Patel S', 'Apostolopoulos V']",2022,14,4,Viruses,"Chavda VP, et al.

35458397,Inhibition of the IFN-α JAK/STAT Pathway by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 Proteins in Human Epithelial Cells.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused several global outbreaks with relatively high mortality rates, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV, which emerged in 2012, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, which appeared in 2002. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for immediate and greater understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms used by CoVs. Interferon (IFN)-α is the body's natural antiviral agent, but its Janus kinase/signal transducer and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway is often antagonized by viruses, thereby preventing the upregulation of essential IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Therapeutic IFN-α has disappointingly weak clinical responses in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 infected patients, indicating that these CoVs inhibit the IFN-α JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that in lung alveolar A549 epithelial cells expression of MERS-CoV-nsp2 and SARS-CoV-1-nsp14, but not MERS-CoV-nsp5, increased basal levels of total and phosphorylated STAT1 & STAT2 protein, but reduced IFN-α-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1-3 and induction of MxA. While MERS-CoV-nsp2 and SARS-CoV-1-nsp14 similarly increased basal levels of STAT1 and STAT2 in bronchial BEAS-2B epithelial cells, unlike in A549 cells, they did not enhance basal pSTAT1 nor pSTAT2. However, both viral proteins reduced IFN-α-mediated induction of pSTAT1-3 and ISGs (MxA, ISG15 and PKR) in BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, even though IFN-α-mediated induction of pSTAT1-3 was not affected by MERS-CoV-nsp5 expression in BEAS-2B cells, downstream ISG induction was reduced, revealing that MERS-CoV-nsp5 may use an alternative mechanism to reduce antiviral ISG induction in this cell line. Indeed, we subsequently discovered that all three viral proteins inhibited STAT1 nuclear translocation in BEAS-2B cells, unveiling another layer of inhibition by which these viral proteins suppress responses to Type 1 IFNs. While these observations highlight cell line-specific differences in the immune evasion effects of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 proteins, they also demonstrate the broad spectrum of immune evasion strategies these deadly coronaviruses use to stunt antiviral responses to Type IFN.","['Zhang Y', 'Gargan S', 'Roche FM', 'Frieman M', 'Stevenson NJ']",2022,14,4,Viruses,"Zhang Y, et al.

However, the application of these tests is associated with inherent shortcomings due to the need for trained personnel, long-time centralized laboratories, and expensive instruments. Therefore, there is an interest in developing biosensing diagnostic frontiers that can help in eliminating these shortcomings with a relatively economical, easy-to-use, well-timed, precise and sensitive technology. This study reports the development of fabricated Q-tips designed to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples and contaminated non-absorbable surfaces.

The pandemic is still ongoing and the SARS-CoV-2 variants are still emerging constantly, resulting in an urgent demand for new drugs to treat this disease. Molnupiravir, a biological prodrug of NHC (β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine), is a novel nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). Molnupiravir showed potent therapeutic and prophylactic activity against multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in animal models. In clinical trials, molnupiravir showed beneficial effects for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with a favorable safety profile.

35443505,Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Moderate to Severely Ill Covid-19 Patients.,"UNLABELLED: Convalescent plasma therapy, a classic adaptive immunotherapy used in the treatment of SARS, MERS, and 2009 H1N1 pandemic with acceptable efficacy and safety in the past. Convalescent plasma therapy was taken into consideration in management of COVID 19 disease during the initial days of pandemic but was withdrawn later due to its doubtful beneficial role. This study aims to explore the beneficial role of convalescent plasma and to determine whether convalescent plasma therapy holds a second chance in treating SARS COV-2.
MATERIAL: This cross-sectional observational study includes 82 cases of moderate to severely ill COVID 19 patients who received convalescent plasma therapy and 41 controls who didn't. Regular monitoring of TLC, P/F ratio, N/L ratio inflammatory markers, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, ABG and radiological imaging was done for comparative analysis.
OBSERVATION: In case group 39 patients (47.56%) were on oxygen mask, 17 patients (20.73%) on NIV, 9 Patients on NRM (10.97%), 16 patients (19.51%) on room air, 1(1.21%) on HFNC initially. After 7th day of convalescent plasma therapy 49 patients (59.75%) were on room air which suggests significant improvement in mode of ventilation in case group as compared to control group. Mean respiratory rate in case group was 30.46 CPM initially and 24.7 CPM on day 7th of plasma therapy which is statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Plasma therapy is effective if given in early stage of disease and convalescent plasma donors having adequate antibody titre.","['Sharma S', 'Saluja M', 'Sharma P']",2022,70,4,J Assoc Physicians India,"Sharma S, et al.

35442902,The Korean 3T Practice: New Biosurveillance Model Utilizing New Information Technology and Digital Tools.,"In South Korea, COVID-19 pandemic responses, namely the 3T (testing, tracing, and treating) strategy, emerged as a new biosurveillance regime actively using new information technology (IT) and digital tools. The foundation of the Korean 3T system is epidemiological investigation efforts and clinical practices exploiting the use of new digital and IT tools. Due to these unique features, the Korean 3T system can be referred to as a ""contact-based biosurveillance system,"" which is an advanced version of the traditional biosurveillance models (indicator-based or event-based models). This article illustrates how the contact-based biosurveillance system originated from the experience with the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak. The post-MERS Korean biosurveillance regime actively adopted the utility of new digital and IT tools to strengthen not only the ex-ante epidemic intelligence capabilities (by traditional models) but also the ex-post response and recovery capabilities (digital contact tracing and digital health intervention). However, critics claim that the Korean 3T system may violate individuals' privacy and human rights by addressing the fact that the Korean biosurveillance system would strengthen social surveillance and population control by the government as a ""digital big brother"" in the cyber age. Nevertheless, 3T biosurveillance promises a positive future direction for digital health practice in the current biosurveillance regimes.",['Kim H'],2022,6,5,JMIR Form Res,Kim H.

The wild ancestor of beet crops is the sea beet Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima. Species and subspecies of wild beets are readily crossable with cultivated beets and are thus available for crop improvement. To study genomic relationships in the genus Beta, we sequence and analyse 606 beet genomes, encompassing sugar beet, sea beet, B. v. adanensis, B. macrocarpa, and B. patula. We observe two genetically distinct groups of sea beets, one from the Atlantic coast and the other from the Mediterranean area. Genomic comparisons based on k-mers identify sea beets from Greece as the closest wild relatives of sugar beet, suggesting that domestication of the ancestors of sugar beet may be traced to this area. Our work provides comprehensive insight into the phylogeny of wild and cultivated beets and establishes a framework for classification of further accessions of unknown (sub-)species assignment.","['Wascher FL', 'Stralis-Pavese N', 'McGrath JM', 'Schulz B', 'Himmelbauer H', 'Dohm JC']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Wascher FL, et al.

Immense research is ongoing to control this pandemic condition. Continual research outcomes are indicating that therapeutic and prophylactic agents are the possible hope to prevent the pandemic from spreading and to combat this increasing death count. Experience gained from previous coronavirus infections (eg., SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle Ease Respiratory Syndrome), accumulated clinical knowledge during this pandemic, and research helped to identify a few therapeutic agents for emergency treatment of COVID-19. Thereby, monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, immunomodulators, and supplements are being suggested for treatment depending on the stage of the disease. These recommended treatments are authorized under medical supervision in emergency conditions only. Urgent need to control the pandemic condition had resulted in various approaches of repurposing the existing drugs, However, poorly designed clinical trials and associated outcomes do not provide enough evidence to fully approve treatments against COVID-19. So far, World Health Organization (WHO) authorized three vaccines as prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we discussed about various therapeutic agents, their clinical trials, and limitations of trials for the management of COVID-19.

35434592,SARS-Cov2 acute and post-active infection in the context of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.,"The clinical and immunological spectrum of acute and post-active COVID-19 syndrome overlaps with criteria used to characterize autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, following SARS-Cov2 infection, the innate immune response is altered with an initial delayed production of interferon type I (IFN-I), while the NF-kappa B and inflammasome pathways are activated. In lung and digestive tissues, an alternative and extrafollicular immune response against SARS-Cov2 takes place with, consequently, an altered humoral and memory T cell response leading to breakdown of tolerance with the emergence of autoantibodies. However, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 among SLE and RA patients did not exceed the general population except in those having pre-existing neutralizing autoantibodies against IFN-I. Treatment discontinuation rather than COVID-19 infection or vaccination increases the risk of developing flares. Last but not least, a limited number of case reports of individuals having developed SLE or RA following COVID-19 infection/vaccination have been reported. Altogether, the SARS-Cov2 pandemic represents an unique opportunity to investigate the dangerous interplay between the immune response against infectious agents and autoimmunity, and to better understand the triggering role of infection as a risk factor in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease development.","['Larionova R', 'Byvaltsev K', 'Kravtsova О', 'Takha E', 'Petrov S', 'Kazarian G', 'Valeeva A', 'Shuralev E', 'Mukminov M', 'Renaudineau Y', 'Arleevskaya M']",2022,5,,J Transl Autoimmun,"Larionova R, et al.

They are characterized by strong infectivity, rapid disease progression, high mortality, and poor prognosis. Excessive immune system activation results in cytokine hypersecretion, which is an important reason for the aggravation of symptoms, and can spread throughout the body leading to systemic multiple organ dysfunction, namely, cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Although many diseases related to CRS have been identified, the mechanism of CRS is rarely mentioned clearly. This review is intended to clarify the pathogenetic mechanism of CRS in the deterioration of related diseases, describe the important signaling pathways and clinical pathophysiological characteristics of CRS, and provide ideas for further research and development of specific drugs for corresponding targets to treat CRS.","['Chen P', 'Tang Y', 'He W', 'Yang R', 'Lan Z', 'Chen R', 'Zhang P']",2022,2022,,Mediators Inflamm,"Chen P, et al.

35431429,Caregivers' perceived changes in engaged time with preschool-aged children during COVID-19: Familial correlates and relations to children's learning behavior and emotional distress.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting containment measures have forced many children and their caregivers around the world to spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. Based on a sample of 764 households with preschool-aged children in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, this study examined how primary caregivers perceived changes in the amount of time spent engaging with their children (i.e., engaged time) from the start of the pandemic and whether these changes were associated with children's learning behavior and emotional distress. The results showed that primary caregivers generally perceived increases in the amount of engaged time spent on indoor activities with their children but decreases in the amount of engaged time spent playing with their children outdoors. A bigger family size and greater loss of family income during the pandemic were associated with bigger perceived increases in caregivers' engaged time spent on indoor activities, whilst a higher level of parental education was associated with bigger perceived decreases in engaged time spent playing with children outdoors. The family's poorer physical health and higher levels of chaos during the pandemic were related to smaller perceived increases in caregivers' engaged time spent on educational activities. Finally, although bigger perceived increases in caregivers' indoor engaged time (e.g., time spent on educational activities) were associated with higher levels of positive learning behavior and fewer symptoms of anxiety and withdrawal in the children, bigger perceived decreases in outdoor play time were associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and withdrawal. These findings offer valuable insights into caregivers' allocation of engaged time with their preschool-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic.",['Zhang X'],2022,60,,Early Child Res Q,Zhang X.

35431364,Why was this cited? Explainable machine learning applied to COVID-19 research literature.,"Multiple studies have investigated bibliometric factors predictive of the citation count a research article will receive. In this article, we go beyond bibliometric data by using a range of machine learning techniques to find patterns predictive of citation count using both article content and available metadata. As the input collection, we use the CORD-19 corpus containing research articles-mostly from biology and medicine-applicable to the COVID-19 crisis. Our study employs a combination of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for text understanding, including embeddings-based language model BERT, several systems for detection and semantic expansion of entities: ConceptNet, Pubtator and ScispaCy. To interpret the resulting models, we use several explanation algorithms: random forest feature importance, LIME, and Shapley values. We compare the performance and comprehensibility of models obtained by ""black-box"" machine learning algorithms (neural networks and random forests) with models built with rule learning (CORELS, CBA), which are intrinsically explainable. Multiple rules were discovered, which referred to biomedical entities of potential interest. Of the rules with the highest lift measure, several rules pointed to dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4), a known MERS-CoV receptor and a critical determinant of camel to human transmission of the camel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Some other interesting patterns related to the type of animal investigated were found. Articles referring to bats and camels tend to draw citations, while articles referring to most other animal species related to coronavirus are lowly cited. Bat coronavirus is the only other virus from a non-human species in the betaB clade along with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. MERS-CoV is in a sister betaC clade, also close to human SARS coronaviruses. Thus both species linked to high citation counts harbor coronaviruses which are more phylogenetically similar to human SARS viruses. On the other hand, feline (FIPV, FCOV) and canine coronaviruses (CCOV) are in the alpha coronavirus clade and more distant from the betaB clade with human SARS viruses. Other results include detection of apparent citation bias favouring authors with western sounding names. Equal performance of TF-IDF weights and binary word incidence matrix was observed, with the latter resulting in better interpretability. The best predictive performance was obtained with a ""black-box"" method-neural network. The rule-based models led to most insights, especially when coupled with text representation using semantic entity detection methods. Follow-up work should focus on the analysis of citation patterns in the context of phylogenetic trees, as well on patterns referring to DPP4, which is currently considered as a SARS-Cov-2 therapeutic target.","['Beranová L', 'Joachimiak MP', 'Kliegr T', 'Rabby G', 'Sklenák V']",2022,127,5,Scientometrics,"Beranová L, et al.

35428969,Slower Recovery with Early Lopinavir/Ritonavir use in Pediatric COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study.,"OBJECTIVES: There was initially insufficient understanding regarding suitable pharmacological treatment for pediatric Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) was originally used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. It was also used in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) with positive results. Nonetheless, results from recent randomized controlled trials and observational studies on COVID-19 patients were unfavorable. We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with early treatment with LPV/r for pediatric COVID-19 patients.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 933 COVID-19 patients aged ≤ 18 years were admitted between 21 January 2020 and 31 January 2021 in Hong Kong. Exposure was receiving LPV/r within the first two days of admission. Time to clinical improvement, hospital discharge, seroconversion and hyperinflammatory syndrome, cumulative costs, and hospital length of stay were assessed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard and linear models were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of time-to-event and continuous outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: LPV/r users were associated with longer time to clinical improvement (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.70; p < 0.001), hospital discharge (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.70; p < 0.001) and seroconversion (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80; p < 0.001) when compared with controls. LPV/r users were also associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (6.99 days, 95% CI 6.23-7.76; p < 0.001) and higher costs at 30 days (US$11,709 vs US$8270; p < 0.001) as opposed to controls.
CONCLUSION: Early treatment with LPV/r for pediatric COVID-19 patients was associated with longer time to clinical improvement. Our study advocates the recommendation against LPV/r use for pediatric patients across age groups.","['Wong CKH', 'Low MCH', 'Kwok ACY', 'Lui AYC', 'Lau KTK', 'Au ICH', 'Xiong X', 'Chung MSH', 'Kwan MYW', 'Lau EHY', 'Cowling BJ']",2022,24,3,Paediatr Drugs,"Wong CKH, et al.

The consequences of infection with SARS-CoV-2 vary widely from asymptomatic to severe. Considering the increasing prevalence of different types of virus and acute infection with this disease, strategies to prevent mortality from COVID-19 should be seriously analyzed. In this study, the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were investigated in order to identify risk factors for mortality. Chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), COPD, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, increased D-dimer, male gender, old age, smoking and obesity are among the deadly risk factors associated COVID-19. Furthermore, lymphopenia and neutrophilia are often present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and the ratio of absolute neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) was significantly increased in patients without bacterial infection. These findings could be used in the future to control and prevent disease, because timely identification of patients with risk of COVID-19 is important to provide better treatment strategies for reduction of mortality.",['Kouhpayeh H'],2022,32,2,Eur J Transl Myol,Kouhpayeh H.

35418263,Delivery of MERS antigen encapsulated in α-GalCer-bearing liposomes elicits stronger antigen-specific immune responses.,"Alpha-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) effectively activates the natural killer T (NKT) cells to secrete remarkable amounts of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and therefore, acts as a potential immunoadjuvant in vaccine formulation. In the present study, we prepared α-GalCer-bearing or α-GalCer-free liposomes and loaded them with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus papain-like protease (α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro or Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro). These formulations were injected in mice to investigate the antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The immunisation with α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro or Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro did not induce any notable toxicity in immunised mice. The results demonstrated that mice immunised with α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro showed greater antigen-specific antibody titre, switching of IgG isotyping to IgG2a subclass and higher lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the splenocytes from α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro immunised mice secreted greater levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2 and IL-12. Interestingly, a booster dose induced stronger memory immune responses in mice previously immunised with α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro. In summary, α-GalCer-Lip-MERS-CoV PLpro may prove to be a promising vaccine formulation to protect the individuals against MERS-CoV infection.","['Khan MA', 'Malik A', 'Alruwetei AM', 'Alzohairy MA', 'Alhatlani BY', 'Al Rugaie O', 'Alhumaydhi FA', 'Khan A']",2022,30,8,J Drug Target,"Khan MA, et al.

However, fewer studies were carried out to investigate the neutralizing ability of S2-specific antibodies. In this research, 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit were generated from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients by phage display technology and molecular cloning technology. The binding activity of these S2-mAbs toward SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV-2 S2, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV-2 NTD, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S, SARS-CoV S2 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) S proteins were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Their neutralizing potency toward SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.1.1 and B.1.621 variants were determined by pseudo-virus-based neutralization assay. Results showed that S2E7-mAb had cross-activity to S or S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, while with limited neutralizing activity to pseudo-viruses of SARS-CoV-2 WT and variants. It is undeniable that the binding and neutralizing activities of the S2-targeting mAbs are significantly weaker than the previously reported antibodies targeting RBD and NTD, but our study may provide some evidences for understanding immune protection and identifying targets for vaccine design based on the conserved S2 subunit.","['Gao X', 'Fan L', 'Zheng B', 'Li H', 'Wang J', 'Zhang L', 'Li J', 'Zhu F']",2022,18,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Gao X, et al.

We developed the msa_pipeline workflow (https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/msa_pipeline) to allow practical and sensitive multiple alignment of diverged plant genomes and calculation of conservation scores with minimal user inputs. As high repeat content and genomic divergence are substantial challenges in plant genome alignment, we also explored the effect of different masking approaches and parameters of the LAST aligner using genome assemblies of 33 grass species. Compared with conventional masking with RepeatMasker, a masking approach based on k-mers (nucleotide sequences of k length) increased the alignment rate of coding sequence and noncoding functional regions by 25 and 14%, respectively. We further found that default alignment parameters generally perform well, but parameter tuning can increase the alignment rate for noncoding functional regions by over 52% compared with default LAST settings. Finally, by increasing alignment sensitivity from the default baseline, parameter tuning can increase the number of noncoding sites that can be scored for conservation by over 76%. Overall, tuning of masking and alignment parameters can generate optimized multiple alignments to drive biological discovery in plants.","['Wu Y', 'Johnson L', 'Song B', 'Romay C', 'Stitzer M', 'Siepel A', 'Buckler E', 'Scheben A']",2022,15,2,Plant Genome,"Wu Y, et al.

35413290,Replication of the coronavirus genome: A paradox among positive-strand RNA viruses.,"Coronavirus (CoV) genomes consist of positive-sense single-stranded RNA and are among the largest viral RNAs known to date (∼30 kb). As a result, CoVs deploy sophisticated mechanisms to replicate these extraordinarily large genomes as well as to transcribe subgenomic messenger RNAs. Since 2003, with the emergence of three highly pathogenic CoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), significant progress has been made in the molecular characterization of the viral proteins and key mechanisms involved in CoV RNA genome replication. For example, to allow for the maintenance and integrity of their large RNA genomes, CoVs have acquired RNA proofreading 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity (in nonstructural protein nsp14). In order to replicate the large genome, the viral-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; in nsp12) is supplemented by a processivity factor (made of the viral complex nsp7/nsp8), making it the fastest known RdRp. Lastly, a viral structural protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is primarily involved in genome encapsidation, is required for efficient viral replication and transcription. Therefore, CoVs are a paradox among positive-strand RNA viruses in the sense that they use both a processivity factor and have proofreading activity reminiscent of DNA organisms in addition to structural proteins that mediate efficient RNA synthesis, commonly used by negative-strand RNA viruses. In this review, we present a historical perspective of these unsuspected discoveries and detail the current knowledge on the core replicative machinery deployed by CoVs.","['Grellet E', ""L'Hôte I"", 'Goulet A', 'Imbert I']",2022,298,5,J Biol Chem,"Grellet E, et al.

Several CoVs possess a strong ability to infect humans, termed as human coronavirus (HCoVs). Among seven known HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV belong to highly pathogenic HCoVs, which can cause severe clinical symptoms and even death. Especially, the current COVID-19 pandemic severely threatens human survival and health, which emphasizes the importance of developing effective CoV vaccines and anti-CoV agents to protect humans from HCoV infections. Coronavirus entry inhibitors can block various processes in viral entry, such as receptor binding, proteolytic activation of spike protein, or virus-cell membrane fusion. Coronavirus entry inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, play important roles in the treatment of coronavirus diseases. Thus, we summarize and discuss the development of coronavirus entry inhibitors in this chapter.","['Lan Q', 'Xia S', 'Lu L']",2022,1366,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Lan Q, et al. Coronavirus Entry Inhibitors.

35408772,"Potential Immunogenic Activity of Computationally Designed mRNA- and Peptide-Based Prophylactic Vaccines against MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2: A Reverse Vaccinology Approach.","The continued emergence of human coronaviruses (hCoVs) in the last few decades has posed an alarming situation and requires advanced cross-protective strategies against these pandemic viruses. Among these, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been highly associated with lethality in humans. Despite the challenges posed by these viruses, it is imperative to develop effective antiviral therapeutics and vaccines for these human-infecting viruses. The proteomic similarity between the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) among the three viral species offers a potential target for advanced cross-protective vaccine designs. In this study, putative immunogenic epitopes including Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), Helper T Lymphocytes (HTLs), and Beta-cells (B-cells) were predicted for each RBD-containing region of the three highly pathogenic hCoVs. This was followed by the structural organization of peptide- and mRNA-based prophylactic vaccine designs. The validated 3D structures of these epitope-based vaccine designs were subjected to molecular docking with human TLR4. Furthermore, the CTL and HTL epitopes were processed for binding with respective human Lymphocytes Antigens (HLAs). In silico cloning designs were obtained for the prophylactic vaccine designs and may be useful in further experimental designs. Additionally, the epitope-based vaccine designs were evaluated for immunogenic activity through immune simulation. Further studies may clarify the safety and efficacy of these prophylactic vaccine designs through experimental testing against these human-pathogenic coronaviruses.","['Khan T', 'Khan A', 'Ansari JK', 'Najmi MH', 'Wei DQ', 'Muhammad K', 'Waheed Y']",2022,27,7,Molecules,"Khan T, et al.

35401852,A study of plithogenic graphs: applications in spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally.,"During the last two decades, the world has experienced three major outbreaks of Coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS- CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and the current ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 caused the disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery for the first time in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the disease has spread very fast, and cases have been reported in more than 200 countries/territories. In this study, the idea of Smarandache's pathogenic set is used to discuss the novel COVID-19 spread. We first introduced plithogenic graphs and their subclass, like plithogenic fuzzy graphs. We also established certain binary operations like union, join, Cartesian product, and composition of pathogenic fuzzy graphs, which are helpful when we discuss combining two different graphs. In the end, we investigate the spreading trend of COVID-19 by applying the pathogenic fuzzy graphs. We observe that COVID-19 is much dangerous than (MERS-CoV) and (SARS-CoV). Moreover, as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks were controlled, there are greater chances to overcome the current pandemic of COVID-19 too. Our model suggests that all the countries should stop all types of traveling/movement across the borders and internally too to control the spread of COVID-19. The proposed model also predicts that in case precautionary measures have not been taken then there is a chance of severe outbreak in future.","['Sultana F', 'Gulistan M', 'Ali M', 'Yaqoob N', 'Khan M', 'Rashid T', 'Ahmed T']",2022,,,J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,"Sultana F, et al.

Significant data are showing that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have multiple beneficial activities in combating most features of SARS-CoV-2.
PURPOSE: The aim of current review was to highlight recent progresses in research that showed the evidence of the potential use of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against COVID-19.
METHODOLOGY: We have reviewed the information published from 1979 to October 2020. These studies demonstrated the effects , use and safety of glycyrrhizin and icorice extract against viral infections,bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders of lung ( in vitro and in vivo).  These studies were collated through online electronic databases research (Academic libraries as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Egyptian Knowledge Bank).
RESULTS: Pooled effect size of articles provides information about the rationale for using glycyrrhizin and licorice extract to treat COVID-19. Fifty studies demonstrate antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract. The most frequent mechanism of the antiviral activity is due to disrupting viral uptake into the host cells and disrupting the interaction between receptor- binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV2 and ACE2 in recent articles. Fifty studies indicate that glycyrrhizin and licorice extract have significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Twenty five studies provide evidence for the protective effect of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract against inflammation-induced acute lung injury and cardiovascular disorders.
CONCLUSION: The current study showed several evidence regarding the beneficial effects of glycyrrhizin and licorice extract in combating COVID-19.

35386190,Exploring the Lethality of Human-Adapted Coronavirus Through Alignment-Free Machine Learning Approaches Using Genomic Sequences.,"BACKGROUND: A newly emerging novel coronavirus appeared and rapidly spread worldwide and World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The roles and characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe, on humans. The detection of the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide perspectives for treatment.
METHODS: We developed an alignment-free framework that utilizes machine learning approaches for an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of human-adapted coronavirus using genomic sequences. We performed extensive experiments through six different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms combining digital signal processing to identify the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses using existing strains.
RESULTS: The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human coronaviruses. Our framework achieves high levels of prediction performance that is alignment-free and based on RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this study can offer a reliable real-time estimation for its viral lethality.","['Yin R', 'Luo Z', 'Kwoh CK']",2021,22,8,Curr Genomics,"Yin R, et al.

35371923,Egyptian perspectives on potential risk of paracetamol/acetaminophen-induced toxicities: Lessons learnt during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Paracetamol/Acetaminophen was widely used as a first-line antipyretic and analgesic for COVID-19 patients without giving any attention to the potential risk of related toxicities. A survey was conducted on 176 Egyptians using an online survey portal to assess their knowledge, and attitude regarding potential risk of paracetamol toxicities and whether COVID-19 pandemic affected their practices regarding safe use of paracetamol. The self-administered questionnaire was developed by the researchers and was validated by expert opinions. A pilot testing of the questionnaire was done. Alpha Cronbach test used to assess the internal consistency reliability of the survey revealed good reliability. Overall percent-score revealed that only 24.4% of participants had good knowledge about paracetamol and its related potential toxicities. 62.5% of participants considered paracetamol safer than other medications of the same indications. 42.6% of participants could advise others to use paracetamol without prescription. According to the participants' responses, physicians were less concerned to give instructions about possibility of overdosage. Our results also revealed that participants' administration of paracetamol without physician prescription was more during COVID-19. Practice of paracetamol administration more than the allowed number of tablets/day was significantly more evident during the pandemic. We concluded that the unsupervised use of paracetamol is an alarming sign that should be addressed as this could lead to a high rate of accidental paracetamol toxicity. A lesson learnt from COVID-19 pandemic is the need to implement behavior change measures to mitigate the risk of accidental paracetamol toxicity.","['Mostafa EMA', 'Tawfik AM', 'Abd-Elrahman KM']",2022,9,,Toxicol Rep,"Mostafa EMA, et al.

35370361,CRISPR-Cas13a cascade-based viral RNA assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations in clinical samples.,"SARS-CoV-2 is one of the greatest threats to global human health. Point-of-care diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate rapid therapeutic intervention and mitigate transmission. In this work, we report CRISPR-Cas13a cascade-based viral RNA (Cas13C) assay for label-free and isothermal determination of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations in clinical samples. Cas13a/crRNA was utilized to directly recognize the target of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the recognition events sequentially initiate the transcription amplification to produce light-up RNA aptamers for output fluorescence signal. The recognition of viral RNA via Cas13a-guide RNA ensures a high specificity to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as viral mutations. A post transcription amplification strategy was triggered after CRISPR-Cas13a recognition contributes to an amplification cascade that achieves high sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a limit of detection of 0.216 fM. In addition, the Cas13C assay could be able to discriminate single-nucleotide mutation, which was proven with N501Y in SARS-Cov-2 variant. This method was validated by a 100% agreement with RT-qPCR results from 12 clinical throat swab specimens. The Cas13C assay has the potential to be used as a routine nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 virus in resource-limited regions.","['Wang Y', 'Xue T', 'Wang M', 'Ledesma-Amaro R', 'Lu Y', 'Hu X', 'Zhang T', 'Yang M', 'Li Y', 'Xiang J', 'Deng R', 'Ying B', 'Li W']",2022,362,,Sens Actuators B Chem,"Wang Y, et al.

We aim to provide an updated picture about ecological niches of MERS-CoV and associated socio-environmental drivers. Based on 356 confirmed MERS cases with animal contact reported to the WHO and 63 records of animal infections collected from the literature as of 30 May 2020, we assessed ecological niches of MERS-CoV using an ensemble model integrating three machine learning algorithms. With a high predictive accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 91.66% in test data), the ensemble model estimated that ecologically suitable areas span over the Middle East, South Asia and the whole North Africa, much wider than the range of reported locally infected MERS cases and test-positive animal samples. Ecological suitability for MERS-CoV was significantly associated with high levels of bareland coverage (relative contribution = 30.06%), population density (7.28%), average temperature (6.48%) and camel density (6.20%). Future surveillance and intervention programs should target the high-risk populations and regions informed by updated quantitative analyses.","['Zhang AR', 'Li XL', 'Wang T', 'Liu K', 'Liu MJ', 'Zhang WH', 'Zhao GP', 'Chen JJ', 'Zhang XA', 'Miao D', 'Ma W', 'Fang LQ', 'Yang Y', 'Liu W']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Zhang AR, et al.

35365153,"Molecular phylogeny of coronaviruses and host receptors among domestic and close-contact animals reveals subgenome-level conservation, crossover, and divergence.","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have the potential to cross species barriers. To learn the molecular intersections among the most common coronaviruses of domestic and close-contact animals, we analyzed representative coronavirus genera infecting mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, white-tailed deer, swine, ferret, mink, alpaca, Rhinolophus bat, dolphin, whale, chicken, duck and turkey hosts; reference or complete genome sequences were available for most of these coronavirus genera. Protein sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were built for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The host receptors and enzymes aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), sialic acid synthase (SAS), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), cathepsin L (and its analogs) and furin were also compared.
RESULTS: Overall, the S, E, M, and N proteins segregated according to their viral genera (α, β, or γ), but the S proteins of alphacoronaviruses lacked conservation of phylogeny. Interestingly, the unique polybasic furin cleavage motif found in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) but not in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) exists in several β-coronaviruses and a few α- or γ-coronaviruses. Receptors and enzymes retained host species-dependent relationships with one another. Among the hosts, critical ACE2 residues essential for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding were most conserved in white-tailed deer and cattle.
CONCLUSION: The polybasic furin cleavage motif found in several β- and other coronaviruses of animals points to the existence of an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, and it also offers a counternarrative to the theory of a laboratory-engineered virus. Generally, the S proteins of coronaviruses show crossovers of phylogenies indicative of recombination events. Additionally, the consistency in the segregation of viral proteins of the MERS-like coronavirus (NC_034440.1) from pipistrelle bat supports its classification as a β-coronavirus. Finally, similarities in host enzymes and receptors did not always explain natural cross-infections. More studies are therefore needed to identify factors that determine the cross-species infectivity of coronaviruses.","['Bentum K', 'Shaddox S', 'Ware C', 'Reddy G', 'Abebe W', 'Folitse R', 'Martin P', 'Samuel T']",2022,18,1,BMC Vet Res,"Bentum K, et al.

While SARS-CoV-2 is currently caused a severe epidemic, experts believe that new pathogenic coronavirus would emerge in the future. Therefore, developing broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs is of great significance. In this study, we performed protein sequence and three-dimensional structure analyses for all the 20 virus-encoded proteins across all the 7 coronaviruses, with the purpose to identify highly conserved proteins and binding sites for developing pan-coronavirus drugs. We found that nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16 are highly conserved both in protein sequences (with average identity percentage higher than 52%, average amino acid conservation scores higher than 5.2) and binding pockets (with average amino acid conservation scores higher than 5.8). We also performed the similarity comparison between these 6 proteins and all the human proteins, and found that all the 6 proteins have similarity less than 25%, indicating that the drugs targeting the 6 proteins should have little interference of human protein function. Accordingly, we suggest that nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16 are potential targets for pan-coronavirus drug development.","['Ma M', 'Yang Y', 'Wu L', 'Zhou L', 'Shi Y', 'Han J', 'Xu Z', 'Zhu W']",2022,145,,Comput Biol Med,"Ma M, et al.

To address the public health threat caused by the increasing SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the National Institutes of Health established the SARS-CoV-2 Assessment of Viral Evolution (SAVE) programme. This effort was designed to provide a real-time risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 variants that could potentially affect the transmission, virulence, and resistance to infection- and vaccine-induced immunity. The SAVE programme is a critical data-generating component of the US Government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group to assess implications of SARS-CoV-2 variants on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, and for communicating public health risk. Here we describe the coordinated approach used to identify and curate data about emerging variants, their impact on immunity and effects on vaccine protection using animal models. We report the development of reagents, methodologies, models and notable findings facilitated by this collaborative approach and identify future challenges.

Although derived from highly accurate sequences, evaluation revealed evidence of small errors and structural misassemblies in the initial draft assembly. To correct these errors, we designed a new repeat-aware polishing strategy that made accurate assembly corrections in large repeats without overcorrection, ultimately fixing 51% of the existing errors and improving the assembly quality value from 70.2 to 73.9 measured from PacBio high-fidelity and Illumina k-mers. By comparing our results to standard automated polishing tools, we outline common polishing errors and offer practical suggestions for genome projects with limited resources. We also show how sequencing biases in both high-fidelity and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads cause signature assembly errors that can be corrected with a diverse panel of sequencing technologies.","['Mc Cartney AM', 'Shafin K', 'Alonge M', 'Bzikadze AV', 'Formenti G', 'Fungtammasan A', 'Howe K', 'Jain C', 'Koren S', 'Logsdon GA', 'Miga KH', 'Mikheenko A', 'Paten B', 'Shumate A', 'Soto DC', 'Sović I', 'Wood JMD', 'Zook JM', 'Phillippy AM', 'Rhie A']",2022,19,6,Nat Methods,"Mc Cartney AM, et al.

35360826,NIFtHool: an informatics program for identification of NifH proteins using deep neural networks.,"Atmospheric nitrogen fixation carried out by microorganisms has environmental and industrial importance, related to the increase of soil fertility and productivity. The present work proposes the development of a new high precision system that allows the recognition of amino acid sequences of the nitrogenase enzyme (NifH) as a promising way to improve the identification of diazotrophic bacteria. For this purpose, a database obtained from UniProt built a processed dataset formed by a set of 4911 and 4782 amino acid sequences of the NifH and non-NifH proteins respectively. Subsequently, the feature extraction was developed using two methodologies: (i) k-mers counting and (ii) embedding layers to obtain numerical vectors of the amino acid chains. Afterward, for the embedding layer, the data was crossed by an external trainable convolutional layer, which received a uniform matrix and applied convolution using filters to obtain the feature maps of the model. Finally, a deep neural network was used as the primary model to classify the amino acid sequences as NifH protein or not. Performance evaluation experiments were carried out, and the results revealed an accuracy of 96.4%, a sensitivity of 95.2%, and a specificity of 96.7%. Therefore, an amino acid sequence-based feature extraction method that uses a neural network to detect N-fixing organisms is proposed and implemented.

However, conventional supervised deep learning models are incapable of recognizing novel diseases that do not exist in the training dataset. Automated early-stage detection of novel infectious diseases can be vital in controlling their rapid spread. Moreover, the development of a conventional CAD model is only possible after disease outbreaks and datasets become available for training (viz. COVID-19 outbreak). Since novel diseases are unknown and cannot be included in training data, it is challenging to recognize them through existing supervised deep learning models. Even after data becomes available, recognizing new classes with conventional models requires a complete extensive re-training.

Previously, we reported that direct interactions of nucleocapsid (N) protein and C-terminal domain of Spike protein (Spike CD) are essential for replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Thus, we developed a novel ELISA-based strategy targeting these specific interactions to detect SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Here, we investigated whether the same principles apply to HCoV-OC43. We discovered that the S protein of HCoV-OC43 interacts with N protein and that cell penetrating Spike CD peptide inhibits virus protein expression and replication of HCoV-OC43. The interaction between HCoV-OC43 S and N proteins were recapitulated with a recombinant HCoV-OC43 Spike CD fusion protein and a recombinant HCoV-OC43 N fusion protein ","['Kim J', 'Kim M', 'Kim D', 'Park S', 'Kang M', 'Baek K', 'Choi JK', 'Maharjan S', 'Akauliya M', 'Lee Y', 'Kwon HJ']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Kim J, et al.

35350257,Can food matrices be considered as a potential carrier for COVID-19?,"Humanity is currently facing a life-threatening challenge from the infectious and epidemic disease SARS-CoV-2. To date, the various modes of transmission of the virus have not been fully elucidated. In this regard, there is a possibility of transmission of the virus through food products. The COVID-19 pandemic disease, like those associated with SARS and MERS, is transmitted mainly through the respiratory tract and airborne aerosol particles, but the presence of fragments of the genetic virus (RNA) in the feces of numerous patients proposes that their fecal-oral pathway may be expanded. In addition, people with gastrointestinal disorders such as atrophic gastritis and metaplasia may be susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential carrier of COVID-19 due to environmental or cross-contamination. According to the available evidence, the spread and possibility of transmission of COVID-19 contamination from humans to food products are possible. Beyond that, there is some evidence that some food sources of animal origin, such as pigs and rabbits, can be contaminated by COVID-19. Therefore, the transmission of the virus through some meat products may be conceivable. Due to the rapid release rate of COVID-19 and its stability in various milieus, especially food manufacturing circumstances, it may enter the matrix during different stages of traditional or industrial food processing. Therefore, preventive measures are recommended to be utilized in the food manufacturing sector. The present study explored the risk of different food matrices, including dairy products, bread, meat and meat products, vegetables, fruits, and processed foods, as potential carriers for the transmission of COVID-19.","['Abbasi A', 'Kafil HS', 'Ozma MA', 'Sangtarash N', 'Sabahi S']",2022,30,1,Infez Med,"Abbasi A, et al.

At present, the prevention and control of pests and diseases is mainly carried out through chemical pesticides, and the consequent pesticide residues of P. notoginseng have attracted much attention. This study reviewed the types and detection methods of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng from 1981 to 2021, and compared the limits of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng in China and abroad to provide a reference for rational application of pesticides in P. notoginseng and quality control of medicinal materials, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the P. notoginseng industry in China. Currently, there are only 40 published papers on pesticide residues of P. notoginseng, which is indicative of a serious problem of insufficient research. At present, hundreds of pesticide residues in P. notoginseng can be detected simultaneously by using chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The pesticides detected have gradually changed from early prohibited ones, such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane(DDT), benzene hexachloride(BHC), and parathion, to low toxic ones(e.g., dimethomorph, procymidone, propicona-zole, and difenoconazole). The dietary risk from pesticide residues in P. notoginseng is low, which would not cause harm to consu-mers. This study concluded that in the future, the development of the quality standard for pesticide residues of P. notoginseng should be actively carried out. To increase the pesticides used in actual production in the quality standard based on the existing ones and to guide farmers to use pesticides scientifically will be the focus of future work.","['Zheng K', 'Guo LP', 'Zhang XB', 'Wang CX', 'Qu Y', 'Liu W', 'Zhou T', 'Zhang YY', 'Cui XM', 'Yang Y']",2022,47,6,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,"Zheng K, et al.

35345416,Identification of novel TMPRSS2 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection: a structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics study.,"The scientific insights gained from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks are helping scientists to fast-track the antiviral drug discovery process against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses, as well as influenza viruses, depend on host type 2 transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, for entry and propagation in the human cell. Recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 also uses TMPRSS2 for its cell entry. In the present study, a structure-based virtual screening of 52,337, protease ligands downloaded from the Zinc database was carried out against the homology model of TMPRSS2 protein followed by the molecular dynamics-based simulation to identify potential TMPRSS2 hits. The virtual screening has identified 13 hits with a docking score range of -10.447 to -9.863 and glide energy range of -60.737 to -40.479 kcal/mol. The binding mode analysis shows that the hit molecules form H-bond (Asp180, Gly184 & Gly209), Pi-Pi stacking (His41), and salt bridge (Asp180) type of contacts with the active site residues of TMPRSS2. In the MD simulation of ZINC000013444414, ZINC000137976768, and ZINC000143375720 hits show that these molecules form a stable complex with TMPRSS2. The complex equilibrates well with a minimal RMSD and RMSF fluctuation. All three structures, as predicted in Glide XP docking, show a prominent interaction with the Asp180, Gly184, Gly209, and His41. Further, MD simulation also identifies a notable H-bond interaction with Ser181 for all three hits. Among these hits, ZINC000143375720 shows the most stable binding interaction with TMPRSS2. The present study is successful in identifying TMPRSS2 ligands from zinc data base for a possible application in the treatment of COVID-19.","['Manandhar S', 'Pai KSR', 'Krishnamurthy PT', 'Kiran AVVVR', 'Kumari GK']",2022,33,5,Struct Chem,"Manandhar S, et al.

The low pathogenic HCoVs infect the upper respiratory tract, mainly causing mild, cold-like respiratory diseases. By contrast, highly pathogenic HCoVs mainly infect the lower respiratory tract and cause fatal types of pneumonia, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Highly pathogenic HCoV infection has a high morbidity and mortality, which is usually related to the strong immune response induced by highly proinflammatory cytokines, which is also known as ""cytokine storm"". Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the role of cytokine storm in the process of highly pathogenic HCoV infection.

35338144,MERS-CoV ORF4b employs an unusual binding mechanism to target IMPα and block innate immunity.,"The MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic, emerging virus that produces accessory proteins to antagonize the host innate immune response. The MERS-CoV ORF4b protein has been shown to bind preferentially to the nuclear import adapter IMPα3 in infected cells, thereby inhibiting NF-κB-dependent innate immune responses. Here, we report high-resolution structures of ORF4b bound to two distinct IMPα family members. Each exhibit highly similar binding mechanisms that, in both cases, lack a prototypical Lys bound at their P2 site. Mutations within the NLS region dramatically alter the mechanism of binding, which reverts to the canonical P2 Lys binding mechanism. Mutational studies confirm that the novel binding mechanism is important for its nuclear import, IMPα interaction, and inhibition of innate immune signaling pathways. In parallel, we determined structures of the nuclear binding domain of NF-κB component p50 bound to both IMPα2 and α3, demonstrating that p50 overlaps with the ORF4b binding sites, suggesting a basis for inhibition. Our results provide a detailed structural basis that explains how a virus can target the IMPα nuclear import adapter to impair immunity, and illustrate how small mutations in ORF4b, like those found in closely related coronaviruses such as HKU5, change the IMPα binding mechanism.","['Munasinghe TS', 'Edwards MR', 'Tsimbalyuk S', 'Vogel OA', 'Smith KM', 'Stewart M', 'Foster JK', 'Bosence LA', 'Aragão D', 'Roby JA', 'Basler CF', 'Forwood JK']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Munasinghe TS, et al.

METHODS: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of proportions using studies of adults hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza pneumonia and followed up within 12 months. Searches performed in MEDLINE and Embase. Primary outcomes were proportion of radiological sequelae on CT scans; restrictive impairment; impaired gas transfer. Heterogeneity was explored in meta-regression.
RESULTS: Ninety-five studies (98.9% observational) were included in qualitative synthesis, 70 were suitable for meta-analysis including 60 SARS-CoV-2 studies with a median follow-up of 3 months. In SARS-CoV-2, the overall estimated proportion of inflammatory sequelae was 50% during follow-up (0.50; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58; I
DISCUSSION: Sequelae consistent with parenchymal lung disease were observed following COVID-19 and other viral pneumonitis. Estimates should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity, differences in study casemix and initial severity.

The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Multiple host cellular receptors can trigger the innate immune system to eliminate invading pathogens. However, these CoVs have acquired strategies to evade innate immune responses by avoiding recognition by host sensors, leading to impaired interferon (IFN) production and antagonizing of the IFN signaling pathways. In contrast, the dysregulated induction of inflammasomes, leading to uncontrolled production of IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) and pyroptosis, has been associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review summarizes innate immune evasion strategies employed by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in brief and SARS-CoV-2 in more detail. In addition, we outline potential mechanisms of inflammasome activation and evasion and their impact on disease prognosis.","['Mattoo SU', 'Kim SJ', 'Ahn DG', 'Myoung J']",2022,14,3,Viruses,"Mattoo SU, et al.

35324925,Epitope-based peptide vaccine design and elucidation of novel compounds against 3C like protein of SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-stranded RNA viruses with short clubs on their edges. CoVs are pathogenic viruses that infect several animals and plant organisms, as well as humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions). A noval strain of CoV has been reported and named as SARS-CoV-2. Numerous COVID-19 cases were being reported all over the World. COVID-19 and has a high mortality rate. In the present study, immunoinformatics techniques were utilized to predict the antigenic epitopes against 3C like protein. B-cell epitopes and Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) were designed computationally against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of seven complete strains (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) was performed to elucidate the binding domain and interacting residues. MHC-I binding epitopes were evaluated by analyzing the binding affinity of the top-ranked peptides having HLA molecule. By utilizing the docked complexes of CTL epitopes with antigenic sites, the binding relationship and affinity of top-ranked predicted peptides with the MHC-I HLA protein were investigated. The molecular docking analyses were conducted on the ZINC database library and twelve compounds having least binding energy were scrutinized. In conclusion, twelve CTL epitopes (GTDLEGNFY, TVNVLAWLY, GSVGFNIDY, SEDMLNPNY, LSQTGIAV, VLDMCASLK, LTQDHVDIL, TTLNDFNLV, CTSEDMLNP, TTITVNVLA, YNGSPSGVY, and SMQNCVLKL) were identified against SARS-CoV-2.","['Sajid M', 'Marriam S', 'Mukhtar H', 'Sohail S', 'Sajid M', 'Sehgal SA']",2022,17,3,PLoS One,"Sajid M, et al.

Two lead candidates were assessed for each model virus before selecting and progressing one lead molecule. MERS-7.7G6 was used as the model antibody to demonstrate batch-to-batch process consistency and, together with RVFV-107-104, were scaled up to 200 L. Consistent expression titers were obtained in different batches at a 5 L scale for MERS-7.7G6. Although lower expression levels were observed for MERS-7.7G6 and RVFV-107-104 during scale up to 200 L, product quality attributes were consistent at different scales and in different batches. In addition to this, peptide mapping data suggested no detectable sequence variants for any of these candidates. Functional assays demonstrated comparable neutralizing activity for MERS-7.7G6 and RVFV-107-104 generated at different production scales. Similarly, MERS-7.7G6 batches generated at different scales were shown to provide comparable protection in mouse models. Our study demonstrates that a CHO-based transient expression process is capable of generating consistent product quality at different production scales and thereby supports the potential of using transient gene expression to accelerate the manufacturing of early clinical material.","['Rodriguez-Conde S', 'Inman S', 'Lindo V', 'Amery L', 'Tang A', 'Okorji-Obike U', 'Du W', 'Bosch BJ', 'Wichgers Schreur PJ', 'Kortekaas J', 'Sola I', 'Enjuanes L', 'Kerry L', 'Mahal K', 'Hulley M', 'Daramola O']",2022,14,1,MAbs,"Rodriguez-Conde S, et al.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to SARS-CoV-1 and 50% to MERS-CoV. The mechanisms of infection of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are also similar and occur through the binding of the virus to the type 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme protein (ACE2), which is widely represented in the human body with predominant expression in endocrine tissues. In this connection, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 affect the organs of the endocrine system, causing damage and hormonal changes that affect the prognosis of the course of COVID-19. This literature review is devoted to the analysis of changes in the organs of the endocrine system that occur during infection with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, as well as the potential effect of hormones on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","['Bulgakova SV', 'Treneva EV', 'Zakharova NO']",2022,67,3,Klin Lab Diagn,"Bulgakova SV, et al.

35318674,"SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV encode circular RNAs of spliceosome-independent origin.","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly recognized component of the transcriptome with critical roles in autoimmune diseases and viral pathogenesis. To address the importance of circRNA in RNA viral transcriptome, we systematically identified and characterized circRNAs encoded by the RNA genomes of betacoronaviruses using both bioinformatical and experimental approaches. We predicted 351, 224, and 2764 circRNAs derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respectively. We experimentally identified 75 potential SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs from RNA samples extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells. A systematic comparison of viral and host circRNA features, including abundance, strand preference, length distribution, circular exon numbers, and breakpoint sequences, demonstrated that coronavirus-derived circRNAs had a spliceosome-independent origin. We further showed that back-splice junctions (BSJs) captured by inverse reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction have different level of resistance to RNase R. Through northern blotting with a BSJ-spanning probe targeting N gene, we identified three RNase R-resistant bands that represent SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs that are detected cytoplasmic by single-molecule and amplified fluorescence in situ hybridization assays. Lastly, analyses of 169 sequenced BSJs showed that both back-splice and forward-splice junctions were flanked by homologous and reverse complementary sequences, including but not limited to the canonical transcriptional regulatory sequences. Our findings highlight circRNAs as an important component of the coronavirus transcriptome, offer important evaluation of bioinformatic tools in the analysis of circRNAs from an RNA genome, and shed light on the mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis.","['Yang S', 'Zhou H', 'Liu M', 'Jaijyan D', 'Cruz-Cosme R', 'Ramasamy S', 'Subbian S', 'Liu D', 'Xu J', 'Niu X', 'Li Y', 'Xiao L', 'Tyagi S', 'Wang Q', 'Zhu H', 'Tang Q']",2022,94,7,J Med Virol,"Yang S, et al.

35317833,Space-efficient representation of genomic k-mer count tables.,"MOTIVATION: k-mer counting is a common task in bioinformatic pipelines, with many dedicated tools available. Many of these tools produce in output k-mer count tables containing both k-mers and counts, easily reaching tens of GB. Furthermore, such tables do not support efficient random-access queries in general.
RESULTS: In this work, we design an efficient representation of k-mer count tables supporting fast random-access queries. We propose to apply Compressed Static Functions (CSFs), with space proportional to the empirical zero-order entropy of the counts. For very skewed distributions, like those of k-mer counts in whole genomes, the only currently available implementation of CSFs does not provide a compact enough representation. By adding a Bloom filter to a CSF we obtain a Bloom-enhanced CSF (BCSF) effectively overcoming this limitation. Furthermore, by combining BCSFs with minimizer-based bucketing of k-mers, we build even smaller representations breaking the empirical entropy lower bound, for large enough k. We also extend these representations to the approximate case, gaining additional space. We experimentally validate these techniques on k-mer count tables of whole genomes (E. Coli and C. Elegans) and unassembled reads, as well as on k-mer document frequency tables for 29 E. Coli genomes. In the case of exact counts, our representation takes about a half of the space of the empirical entropy, for large enough k's.","['Shibuya Y', 'Belazzougui D', 'Kucherov G']",2022,17,1,Algorithms Mol Biol,"Shibuya Y, et al.

35314694,Genetic alteration of human MYH6 is mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein: mapping viral variants of cardiac interest.,"Acute cardiac injury has been observed in a subset of COVID-19 patients, but the molecular basis for this clinical phenotype is unknown. It has been hypothesized that molecular mimicry may play a role in triggering an autoimmune inflammatory reaction in some individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigate if linear peptides contained in proteins that are primarily expressed in the heart also occur in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Specifically, we compared the library of 136,704 8-mer peptides from 144 human proteins (including splicing variants) to 9926 8-mers from all the viral proteins in the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. No 8-mers were exactly identical between the reference human proteome and the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. However, there were 45 8-mers that differed by only one amino acid when compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, analysis of protein-coding mutations from 141,456 individuals showed that one of these 8-mers from the SARS-CoV-2 Replicase polyprotein 1a/1ab (KIALKGGK) is identical to an MYH6 peptide encoded by the c.5410 C > A (Q1804K) genetic variation, which has been observed at low prevalence in Africans/African Americans (0.08%), East Asians (0.3%), South Asians (0.06%), and Latino/Admixed Americans (0.003%). Furthermore, analysis of 4.85 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 200 countries shows that viral evolution has already resulted in 20 additional 8-mer peptides that are identical to human heart-enriched proteins encoded by reference sequences or genetic variants. Whether such mimicry contributes to cardiac inflammation during or after COVID-19 illness warrants further experimental evaluation. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring peptides identical to human cardiac proteins should be investigated as ""viral variants of cardiac interest"".","['Anand P', 'Lenehan PJ', 'Niesen M', 'Yoo U', 'Patwardhan D', 'Montorzi M', 'Venkatakrishnan AJ', 'Soundararajan V']",2022,8,1,Cell Death Discov,"Anand P, et al.

35300895,Basic virology of SARS-CoV 2.,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly transmissible pathogenic coronavirus emerged in late 2019 causing a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named 'coronavirus disease 2019' (COVID-19). It has spread fast all over the world posing an extraordinary threat to global public health. Along with SARS-CoV-2, there are seven human coronaviruses. Those causing mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic ones are SARSCoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
OBJECTIVE: This review has highlighted the basic virology of SARS CoV-2 including its origin, structure, genomic characteristics, pathogenesis, immunological response and clinical manifestation along with the key difference of SARS CoV2 from the previous Coronaviruses.
CONTENT: Coronaviruses are spherical and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface. It has a large positive sense, single stranded RNA genome within the nucleocapsid with a helical symmetry. It has been known to cause infection to innumerable mammalian hosts, like humans, cats, bats, civets, dogs, and camels. The viral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded within the 3' end of the genome. Virus binds to the host cell by the S protein with specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol and there is fusion of the viral and cellular membranes followed by the translation of the viral genomic RNA. Following the viral replication and sub-genomic RNA synthesis, there is formation of the mature virus. The virions are then transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are released by exocytosis.","['Ravi V', 'Saxena S', 'Panda PS']",2022,40,2,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Ravi V, et al.

Carbon dots are easily synthesized, cost-effective fluorescent nanoparticles whose surface functionalities enable facile conjugation with biorecognition elements suitable for  molecular detection of viral RNA. Herein, we report that a pair of complementary antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) sequences can lead to a highly specific molecular aggregation of dual colour carbon dots (CDs) in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The nanoprobes used ASOs highly specific to the N-gene of SARS-COV-2. When the ASOs are conjugated to blue and yellow citric acid-derived CDs, the combination of the ASO-CD pairs facilitates aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of the measured fluorescence after hybridization with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We found the sensor capable of differentiating between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples and was found to have a limit of detection of 81 copies per μL. Additionally, we used dialysis to demonstrate that the change in emission upon aggregation is dependent on the compositional heterogeneity of the conjugated-carbon dot mixture.","['Sheffield Z', 'Alafeef M', 'Moitra P', 'Ray P', 'Pan D']",2022,14,13,Nanoscale,"Sheffield Z, et al.

Here, we reported two mouse monoclonal antibodies 7 Eb-4G and 1Ba-3H that specifically recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein without exhibiting cross-reactivity with the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The binding epitopes of 7 Eb-4G and 1Ba-3H were respectively located in the regions of residues 457-476 and 477-496 in the S protein. Only 1Ba-3H exhibited the neutralizing activity for preventing the pseudotyped lentivirus from binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-transfected HEK293T cells. The competitive ELISA further showed that 1Ba-3H interfered with the binding between RBD and ACE2. Epitope mapping experiments demonstrated that a single alanine replacement at residues 480, 482, 484, 485, and 488-491 in the RBD abrogated 1Ba-3H binding. 1Ba-3H exhibited the neutralizing activity against the wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and Epsilon variants of SARS-CoV-2, but lost the neutralizing activity against Gamma variant in the plaque reduction assay. On the contrary, 1Ba-3H enhanced the cellular infection of Gamma variant in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection mediated by the RBD-specific antibody for different SARS-CoV-2 variants must be considered while developing the NAb.","['Lai GC', 'Chao TL', 'Lin SY', 'Kao HC', 'Tsai YM', 'Lu DC', 'Chiang YW', 'Chang SY', 'Chang SC']",2022,200,,Antiviral Res,"Lai GC, et al.

35292244,SARS-CoV-2 gained a novel spike protein S1-N-Terminal Domain (S1-NTD).,"The clue behind the SARS-CoV-2 origin is still a matter of debate. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has gained a novel spike protein S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). In our CLuster ANalysis of Sequences (CLANS) analysis, SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTDs displayed a close relationship with OC43 and HKU1. However, in the complete and S1-NTD-free spike protein, SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 revealed closeness with MERS-CoV. Further, we have divided the S1-NTD of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses into three distinct types (Type-I to III S1-NTD) and the S1-NTD of viruses associated with SARS-CoVs into another three classes (Type-A to C S1-NTD) using CLANS and phylogenetic analyses. In particular, the results of our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and BANAL-20-52 viruses carry Type-I-S1-NTD and other SARS-CoV-2-related-bat viruses have Type-II and III. In addition, it was revealed that the Pangolin-GX and Pangolin-Guangdong lineages inherited Type-I-like and Type-II-like S1-NTD, respectively. Then our CLANS study shows the potential for evolution of Type-I and Type-III S1-NTD from SARS-CoV-related viruses Type-A and Type-B S1-NTDs, respectively. Furthermore, our analysis clarifies the possibility that Type-II S1-NTDs may have evolved from Type-A-S1-NTD of SARS-CoV-related viruses through Type-I S1-NTDs. We also observed that BANAL-20-103, BANAL-20-236, and Pangolin-Guangdong-lineage viruses containing Type-II-like S1-NTD are very close to SARS-CoV-2 in spike genetic areas other than S1-NTD. Possibly, it suggests that the common ancestor spike gene of SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13/BANAL-20-52-like virus may have evolved by recombining the Pangolin-Guangdong/BANAL-20-103/BANAL-20-236-like spike gene to Pangolin-GX-like Type-I-like-S1-NTD in the unsampled bat or undiscovered intermediate host or possibly pangolin. These may then have evolved into SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and BANAL-20-52 virus spike genes by host jump mediated evolution. The potential function of the novel Type-I-S1-NTD and other types of S1-NTDs needs to be studied further to understand better its importance in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and for future pandemic preparedness.","['Desingu PA', 'Nagarajan K', 'Dhama K']",2022,211,,Environ Res,"Desingu PA, et al.

From these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron).

35280919,Nanostructures for drug delivery in respiratory diseases therapeutics: Revision of current trends and its comparative analysis.,"Respiratory diseases are leading causes of death and disability in developing and developed countries. The burden of acute and chronic respiratory diseases has been rising throughout the world and represents a major problem in the public health system. Acute respiratory diseases include pneumonia, influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viral infections; while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and, occupational lung diseases (asbestosis, pneumoconiosis) and other parenchymal lung diseases namely lung cancer and tuberculosis are examples of chronic respiratory diseases. Importantly, chronic respiratory diseases are not curable and treatments for acute pathologies are particularly challenging. For that reason, the integration of nanotechnology to existing drugs or for the development of new treatments potentially benefits the therapeutic goals by making drugs more effective and exhibit fewer undesirable side effects to treat these conditions. Moreover, the integration of different nanostructures enables improvement of drug bioavailability, transport and delivery compared to stand-alone drugs in traditional respiratory therapy. Notably, there has been great progress in translating nanotechnology-based cancer therapies and diagnostics into the clinic; however, researchers in recent years have focused on the application of nanostructures in other relevant pulmonary diseases as revealed in our database search. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles and micelles are the most studied nanostructures in a wide range of diseases; however, liposomal nanostructures are recognized to be some of the most successful commercial drug delivery systems. In conclusion, this review presents an overview of the recent and relevant research in drug delivery systems for the treatment of different pulmonary diseases and outlines the trends, limitations, importance and application of nanomedicine technology in treatment and diagnosis and future work in this field.","['Ibarra-Sánchez LÁ', 'Gámez-Méndez A', 'Martínez-Ruiz M', 'Nájera-Martínez EF', 'Morales-Flores BA', 'Melchor-Martínez EM', 'Sosa-Hernández JE', 'Parra-Saldívar R', 'Iqbal HMN']",2022,70,,J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,"Ibarra-Sánchez LÁ, et al.

In less than a month it was proclaimed as a pandemic by The World Health Organization (WHO). Now, even after a year, it still remains to be a concern as a jeopardy to the global public health. The inception of Covid-19 has been identified as the third encounter of a highly morbific coronavirus after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS - CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS_CoV) causing coronaviruses, in merely two decades. In this review, we illustrate the general features of coronavirus and highlight the pathogenesis of the disease, bringing forth the different theories of disease progression, which may help clinicians and other health professionals to achieve a direction for further research, therapeutic protocols and development of the vaccine for combating SARS - CoV - 2 infection.","['Goyal A', 'Shukla S', 'Acharya S', 'Vagha S', 'Goyal V', 'Goyal M']",2021,10,12,J Family Med Prim Care,"Goyal A, et al.

35272105,Functional reconstitution of the MERS CoV receptor binding motif.,"In the early 1960's the first human coronaviruses (designated 229E and OC43) were identified as etiologic agents of the common cold, to be followed by the subsequent isolation of three more human coronaviruses similarly associated with cold-like diseases. In contrast to these ""mild"" coronaviruses, over the last 20 years there have been three independent events of emergence of pandemic severe and acute life-threatening respiratory diseases caused by three novel beta-coronaviruses, SARS CoV, MERS CoV and most recently SARS CoV2. Whereas the first SARS CoV appeared in November 2002 and spontaneously disappeared by the summer of 2003, MERS CoV has continued persistently to spill over to humans via an intermediary camel vector, causing tens of cases annually. Although human-to-human transmission is rare, the fatality rate of MERS CoV disease is remarkably higher than 30%. COVID-19 however, is fortunately much less fatal, despite that its etiologic agent, SARS CoV2, is tremendously infectious, particularly with the recent evolution of the Omicron variants of concern (BA.1 and BA.2). Of note, MERS CoV prevalence in camel populations in Africa and the Middle East is extremely high. Moreover, MERS CoV and SARS CoV2 co-exist in the Middle East and especially in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where sporadic incidences of co-infection have already been reported. Co-infection, either due to reverse spill-over of SARS CoV2 to camels or in double infected humans could lead to recombination between the two viruses, rendering either SARS CoV2 more lethal or MERS CoV more transmittable. In an attempt to prepare for what could develop into a catastrophic event, we have focused on developing a novel epitope-based immunogen for MERS CoV. Implementing combinatorial phage-display conformer libraries, the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) of the MERS CoV Spike protein has been successfully reconstituted and shown to be recognized by a panel of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.","['Uppalapati L', 'Roitburd-Berman A', 'Weiss-Ottolenghi Y', 'Graham BS', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Ying T', 'Failayev H', 'Tsfadia Y', 'Gershoni JM']",2022,145,,Mol Immunol,"Uppalapati L, et al.

35270214,Analysis of Infection Transmission Routes through Exhaled Breath and Cough Particle Dispersion in a General Hospital.,"Identifying infection transmission routes in hospitals may prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and mass infections. Most previous related research focused on the air movement of passive tracers, which typically represent breathing. In this study, particle evaporation and dispersions with various particle sizes were applied to evaluate particle movement because of breathing and coughing using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Pyeongtaek St. Mary Hospital, where a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) index patient infected several patients on the same floor, was used for a case study. We compared the dispersion characteristics of various particle sizes and validated results by comparing infection rates in different ward. Results indicated that droplets spread across the corridor and dispersed to wards that were more than 17 m apart from the index patient by natural ventilation. Droplets from exhaled breath under steady-state simulation showed a wider range of dispersion than cough droplets under transient simulation, but cough droplet dispersion was more consistent with the actual infection rate in each ward. Cough droplets sized under 75 µm evaporated to 26% of the initial size and started to disperse into the corridor within one minute; in nine minutes, droplets dispersed throughout every ward. This study may increase awareness on the dispersion characteristics of infectious particles.","['Jung M', 'Chung WJ', 'Sung M', 'Jo S', 'Hong J']",2022,19,5,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Jung M, et al.

For COVID-19, key such properties are: (1) SARS-CoV-2 binds to RBCs in vitro and also in the blood of COVID-19 patients; (2) although ACE2 is its target for viral fusion and replication, SARS-CoV-2 initially attaches to sialic acid (SA) terminal moieties on host cell membranes via glycans on its spike protein; (3) certain enveloped viruses express hemagglutinin esterase (HE), an enzyme that releases these glycan-mediated bindings to host cells, which is expressed among betacoronaviruses in the common cold strains but not the virulent strains, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS. The arrangement and chemical composition of the glycans at the 22 N-glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and those at the sialoglycoprotein coating of RBCs allow exploration of specifics as to how virally induced RBC clumping may form. The in vitro and clinical testing of these possibilities can be sharpened by the incorporation of an existing anti-COVID-19 therapeutic that has been found in silico to competitively bind to multiple glycans on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",['Scheim DE'],2022,23,5,Int J Mol Sci,"Scheim DE.

DISCUSSION: Neurological impairment by MERS can be reversible. However, the differential diagnosis of the disease includes ischaemic lesions, multiple sclerosis, malignant lymphoma, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy. Clinicians should consider these diseases when MERS is suspected.

35265460,COVID-19 and MERS: Are their Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography Scanning Signs Related?,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory infection brought about by SARS-COV-2. Most of the patients contaminated by this pathogen are afflicted by respiratory syndrome with multiple stages ranging from mild upper respiratory involvement to severe dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome cases. Keeping in mind the high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting abnormalities, it became the number one modality in COVID-19 diagnosis. A wide diversity of CT features can be found in COVID-19 cases, which can be observed before the onset of clinical signs. The review article is aimed to highlight recent discrepancies in CT-scan and chest X-ray (CXR) characteristics between COVID-19 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
METHOD: This review study was performed in the literature from the beginning of COVID-19 until the middle of April 2021. For this reason, all relevant works through scientific citation websites such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science have been investigated in the mentioned period.
RESULTS: COVID-19 was more reproductive than MERS, while MERS was significantly higher in terms of mortality rate (COVID-19: 2.3% and MERS: 34.4%). Signs of ground-glass opacity (GGO), peripheral consolidation, and GGO accompanying with consolidation are the same signs CXR in both MERS and COVID-19. Indeed, fever, cough, headache, and sore throat are the most symptoms in all studied patients.
CONCLUSION: Both COVID-19 and MERS have the same imaging signs. The most similar chest CT findings are GGO, peripheral consolidation, and GGO superimposed by consolidation in both studied diseases, and no statistical differences were seen among the mean number of chest CT-scans in MERS and COVID-19 cases.","['Ghaderian M', 'Kiani M', 'Shahbazi-Gahrouei S', 'Shahbazi-Gahrouei D', 'Ghadimi Moghadam A', 'Haghani M']",2022,12,1,J Med Signals Sens,"Ghaderian M, et al.

Due to the potent spread of the virus and the scarcity of kits and supplies, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has granted authorization for the use of kits available during this emergency, without an accurate evaluation of their performance. This study compared the performance and cost-effectiveness of seven molecular assays/kits available in São Paulo, Brazil, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 205 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples from suspected cases of COVID-19, were tested using the following assays: (i) GeneFinder COVID-19 plus RealAmp kit; (ii) 2019-nCoV RNA PCR-Fluorescence Probing, Da An Gene Co.; (iii) in-house RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 IAL; (iv) 2019-nCoV kit, IDT; (v) molecular SARS-CoV-2 (E) kit, Bio-Manguinhos; (vi) Allplex 2019-nCoV modified Assay, Seegene Inc, and (vii) Biomol one-step COVID-19 kit, IBMP. The criteria for determining a SARS-CoV-2 true positive result included the cycle threshold cut-off values, the characteristics of exponential/linear curves, the gene target diversity, and a positive result in at least two assays.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the assays listed were GeneFinder 83.6%, Da An Gene 100.0%, IAL 90.4%, IDT 94.6%, Bio-Manguinhos 87.7%, Allplex 97.3%, and IBMP 87.7%.

35259178,Comparative analysis of alignment-free genome clustering and whole genome alignment-based phylogenomic relationship of coronaviruses.,"The SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that causes severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All of them likely crossed the interspecific barrier between animals and humans and are of zoonotic origin, respectively. The origin and evolution of viruses and their phylogenetic relationships are of great importance for study of their pathogenicity and development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. The main objective of the presented study was to compare two methods for identifying relationships between coronavirus genomes: phylogenetic one based on the whole genome alignment followed by molecular phylogenetic tree inference and alignment-free clustering of triplet frequencies, respectively, using 69 coronavirus genomes selected from two public databases. Both approaches resulted in well-resolved robust classifications. In general, the clusters identified by the first approach were in good agreement with the classes identified by the second using K-means and the elastic map method, but not always, which still needs to be explained. Both approaches demonstrated also a significant divergence of genomes on a taxonomic level, but there was less correspondence between genomes regarding the types of diseases they caused, which may be due to the individual characteristics of the host. This research showed that alignment-free methods are efficient in combination with alignment-based methods. They have a significant advantage in computational complexity and provide valuable additional alternative information on the genomes relationships.","['Kirichenko AD', 'Poroshina AA', 'Sherbakov DY', 'Sadovsky MG', 'Krutovsky KV']",2022,17,3,PLoS One,"Kirichenko AD, et al.

Notably, all three were transmitted from animals to humans. This would suggest that animals are potential sources of epidemics for humans. The emerging porcine delta-coronavirus was reported to infect children. This is a red flag that marks the ability of PDCoV to break barriers of cross-species transmission to humans. Therefore, we conducted molecular genetic analysis of global clade PDCoV to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of viral diffusion and genetic diversity. PDCoV was classified into three major lineages, according to distribution and phylogenetic analysis of PDCoV. It can be inferred based on the analysis results of the currently known PDCoV strains that PDCoV might originate in Asia. We also selected six special spike amino acid sequences to align and analyze to find seven significant mutation sites. The accumulation of these mutations may enhance dynamic movements, accelerating spike protein membrane fusion events and transmission. Altogether, our study offers a novel insight into the diversification, evolution, and interspecies transmission and origin of PDCoV and emphasizes the need to study the zoonotic potential of the PDCoV and comprehensive surveillance and enhanced biosecurity precautions for PDCoV.","['Li G', 'Zhai SL', 'Zhou X', 'Chen TB', 'Niu JW', 'Xie YS', 'Si GB', 'Cong F', 'Chen RA', 'He DS']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Li G, et al.

35239449,SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces RETREG1/FAM134B-dependent reticulophagy and triggers sequential ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a very large number of severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths worldwide. However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis and therapy remains limited, emphasizing the urgent need for fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of macroautophagy/autophagy and hijacking of the autophagic machinery are essential for the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation and the function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3a as an inducer of autophagy (in particular reticulophagy) and revealed that ORF3a localizes to the ER and induces RETREG1/FAM134B-related reticulophagy through the HMGB1-BECN1 (beclin 1) pathway. As a consequence, ORF3a induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through reticulophagy and then sensitizes cells to the acquisition of an ER stress-related early apoptotic phenotype and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a hijacks reticulophagy and then disrupts ER homeostasis to induce ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings reveal the sequential induction of reticulophagy, ER stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and imply the therapeutic potential of reticulophagy and ER stress-related drugs for COVID-19.","['Zhang X', 'Yang Z', 'Pan T', 'Long X', 'Sun Q', 'Wang PH', 'Li X', 'Kuang E']",2022,18,11,Autophagy,"Zhang X, et al.

35231852,Electrophysiological confrontation of Lead-DBS-based electrode localizations in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep brain stimulation.,"Microelectrode recordings (MERs) are often used during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgeries to confirm the position of electrodes in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The present study focused on 32 patients who had undergone DBS surgery for advanced Parkinson's disease. The first objective was to confront the anatomical locations of intraoperative individual MERs as determined electrophysiologically with those determined postoperatively by image reconstructions. The second aim was to search for differences in cell characteristics among the three subthalamic nucleus (STN) subdivisions and between the STN and other identified subcortical structures. Using the DISTAL atlas implemented in the Lead-DBS image reconstruction toolbox, each MER location was determined postoperatively and attributed to specific anatomical structures (sensorimotor, associative or limbic STN; substantia nigra [SN], thalamus, nucleus reticularis polaris, zona incerta [ZI]). The STN dorsal borders determined intraoperatively from electrophysiology were then compared with the STN dorsal borders determined by the reconstructed images. Parameters of spike clusters (firing rates, amplitudes - with minimum amplitude of 60 μV -, spike durations, amplitude spectral density of β-oscillations) were compared between structures (ANOVAs on ranks). Two hundred and thirty one MERs were analyzed (144 in 34 STNs, 7 in 4 thalami, 5 in 4 ZIs, 34 in 10 SNs, 41 others). The average difference in depth of the electrophysiological dorsal STN entry in comparison with the STN entry obtained with Lead-DBS was found to be of 0.1 mm (standard deviation: 0.8 mm). All 12 analyzed MERs recorded above the electrophysiologically-determined STN entry were confirmed to be in the thalamus or zona incerta. All MERs electrophysiologically attributed to the SN were confirmed to belong to this nucleus. However, 6/34 MERs that were electrophysiologically attributed to the ventral STN were postoperatively reattributed to the SN. Furthermore, 44 MERs of 3 trajectories, which were intraoperatively attributed to the STN, were postoperatively reattributed to the pallidum or thalamus. MER parameters seemed to differ across the STN, with higher spike amplitudes (H = 10.64, p < 0.01) and less prevalent β-oscillations (H = 9.81, p < 0.01) in the limbic STN than in the sensorimotor and associative subdivisions. Some cells, especially in the SN, showed longer spikes with lower firing rates, in agreement with described characteristics of dopamine cells. However, these probabilistic electrophysiological signatures might become clinically less relevant with the development of image reconstruction tools, which deserve to be applied intraoperatively.","['Al Awadhi A', 'Tyrand R', 'Horn A', 'Kibleur A', 'Vincentini J', 'Zacharia A', 'Burkhard PR', 'Momjian S', 'Boëx C']",2022,34,,Neuroimage Clin,"Al Awadhi A, et al.

35221210,Coronavirus infections from 2002 to 2021: neuropsychiatric manifestations.,"Coronaviruses have been known to infect humans for several decades and there are four endemic subtypes: HCoV (human coronavirus) -229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1. These mainly cause a mild upper respiratory illness, but occasionally in vulnerable individuals they can result in more severe respiratory disease and, rarely, CNS involvement. Prior exposure to these viruses has also been associated with an increased odds of having a major psychiatric illness. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS-CoV, started in 2002 and, as well as causing a more severe respiratory phenotype, was also associated with delirium and affective symptoms acutely. Psychosis occurred in about 1% of individuals and was generally thought to be due to corticosteroid administration. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS-CoV, revealed similar findings. Survivors of both SARS and MERS reported persistent physical and psychological symptoms at least several months after the acute illness. The reported neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 range from the common symptoms of systemic and upper respiratory infections to severe and disabling conditions. Delirium has been described using varying terminology; as well as being a possible presenting feature of COVID-19, it has also been shown to be a marker of severe disease. Stroke, both ischaemic and haemorrhagic, have been reported to be more common in COVID-19 than in other medical illnesses. Mood and anxiety disorders are likely to be common at follow-up, while psychosis remains rare and controversial. 'Long Covid' is likely to represent a highly clinically and aetiologically heterogeneous group.","['Barthorpe A', 'Rogers JP']",2022,91,,Sleep Med,Barthorpe A and Rogers JP.

35216019,Polysaccharides and Their Derivatives as Potential Antiviral Molecules.,"In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that our scientific resources and the medical community are not sufficiently developed to combat rapid viral spread all over the world. A number of viruses causing epidemics have already disseminated across the world in the last few years, such as the dengue or chinkungunya virus, the Ebola virus, and other coronavirus families such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). The outbreaks of these infectious diseases have demonstrated the difficulty of treating an epidemic before the creation of vaccine. Different antiviral drugs already exist. However, several of them cause side effects or have lost their efficiency because of virus mutations. It is essential to develop new antiviral strategies, but ones that rely on more natural compounds to decrease the secondary effects. Polysaccharides, which have come to be known in recent years for their medicinal properties, including antiviral activities, are an excellent alternative. They are essential for the metabolism of plants, microorganisms, and animals, and are directly extractible. Polysaccharides have attracted more and more attention due to their therapeutic properties, low toxicity, and availability, and seem to be attractive candidates as antiviral drugs of tomorrow.","['Claus-Desbonnet H', 'Nikly E', 'Nalbantova V', 'Karcheva-Bahchevanska D', 'Ivanova S', 'Pierre G', 'Benbassat N', 'Katsarov P', 'Michaud P', 'Lukova P', 'Delattre C']",2022,14,2,Viruses,"Claus-Desbonnet H, et al.

35215770,Identifying Inhibitors of -1 Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in a Broad Spectrum of Coronaviruses.,"Recurrent outbreaks of novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) diseases in recent years have highlighted the importance of developing therapeutics with broad-spectrum activity against CoVs. Because all CoVs use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates -1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored whether small-molecule inhibitors of -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 also inhibited -1 PRF in a range of bat CoVs-the most likely source of future zoonoses. Six inhibitors identified in new and previous screens against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs as well as MERS-CoV. Some drugs had strong activity against subsets of these CoV-derived frameshift signals, while having limited to no effect on -1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. Notably, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed -1 PRF significantly for multiple CoV-derived frameshift signals. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit -1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing frameshift signals as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.","['Munshi S', 'Neupane K', 'Ileperuma SM', 'Halma MTJ', 'Kelly JA', 'Halpern CF', 'Dinman JD', 'Loerch S', 'Woodside MT']",2022,14,2,Viruses,"Munshi S, et al.

METHODS: We used the structured questionnaire to interview 1,000 Guangzhou residents by health enquiry hotline. Descriptive analysis was presented to evaluate the knowledge of the participants. Multiple logistic regression model was performed to determine the influence factors for knowledge of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.
RESULTS: A total of 801 individuals completed the survey. About one-third had heard of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika, whereas Ebola and plague about 50%. A total of 32.08% participants had never heard of any of the four diseases. Only 2.08% knew the sexual transmission of Zika and 90.17% had no idea about the epidemic region of plague. No more than 15% knew they should check their health status after returning from the epidemic region. Education level and income were the key factors that influenced knowledge rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The low-level knowledge called for the improvement in health information to the public, especially those with low level of education and income.

35207468,Using Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and High Isolation of Asymptomatic Carriers to Contain the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes.,"More than 40% of the deaths recorded in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were linked to nursing homes. Not only are the residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) typically older and more susceptible to endemic infections, the facilities' high degree of connection to wider communities makes them especially vulnerable to local COVID-19 outbreaks. In 2008, in the wake of the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS epidemics and anticipating an influenza pandemic, we created a stochastic compartmental model to evaluate the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in LTCFs during influenza epidemics. In that model, the most effective NPI by far was a staff schedule consisting of 5-day duty periods with onsite residence, followed by an 4-to-5 day off-duty period with a 3-day quarantine period just prior to the return to work. Unlike influenza, COVID-19 appears to have significant rates of pre-symptomatic transmission. In this study, we modified our prior modeling framework to include new parameters and a set of NPIs to identify and control the degree of pre-symptomatic transmission. We found that infections, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU utilization were projected to be high and largely irreducible, even with rigorous application of all defined NPIs, unless pre-symptomatic carriers can be identified and isolated at high rates. We found that increasingly rigorous application of NPIs is likely to significantly decrease the peak of infections; but even with complete isolation of symptomatic persons, and a 50% reduction in silent transmission, the attack rate is projected to be nearly 95%.","['Schmidt AJ', 'García Y', 'Pinheiro D', 'Reichert TA', 'Nuño M']",2022,12,2,Life (Basel),"Schmidt AJ, et al.

35206580,Classical and Next-Generation Vaccine Platforms to SARS-CoV-2: Biotechnological Strategies and Genomic Variants.,"Several coronaviruses (CoVs) have been identified as human pathogens, including the α-CoVs strains HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and the β-CoVs strains HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are also classified as β-coronavirus. New SARS-CoV-2 spike genomic variants are responsible for human-to-human and interspecies transmissibility, consequences of adaptations of strains from animals to humans. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to receptor ACE2 in humans and animal species with high affinity, suggesting there have been adaptive genomic variants. New genomic variants including the incorporation, replacement, or deletion of the amino acids at a variety of positions in the S protein have been documented and are associated with the emergence of new strains adapted to different hosts. Interactions between mutated residues and RBD have been demonstrated by structural modelling of variants including D614G, B.1.1.7, B1.351, P.1, P2; other genomic variants allow escape from antibodies generated by vaccines. Epidemiological and molecular tools are being used for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution and particularly new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

35204727,New Insights into the Role of the Complement System in Human Viral Diseases.,"The complement system (CS) is part of the human immune system, consisting of more than 30 proteins that play a vital role in the protection against various pathogens and diseases, including viral diseases. Activated via three pathways, the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), and the alternative pathway (AP), the complement system leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) that disrupts the membrane of target cells, leading to cell lysis and death. Due to the increasing number of reports on its role in viral diseases, which may have implications for research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this review aims to highlight significant progress in understanding and defining the role of the complement system in four groups of diseases of viral etiology: (1) respiratory diseases; (2) acute liver failure (ALF); (3) disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); and (4) vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Some of these diseases already present a serious global health problem, while others are a matter of concern and require the collaboration of relevant national services and scientists with the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid their spread.","['Ostrycharz E', 'Hukowska-Szematowicz B']",2022,12,2,Biomolecules,Ostrycharz E and Hukowska-Szematowicz B.

35194606,Omicron-specific mRNA vaccination alone and as a heterologous booster against SARS-CoV-2.,"The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has high transmissibility and recently swept the globe. Due to the extensive number of mutations, this variant has high level of immune evasion, which drastically reduced the efficacy of existing antibodies and vaccines. Thus, it is important to test an Omicron-specific vaccine, evaluate its immune response against Omicron and other variants, and compare its immunogenicity as boosters with existing vaccine designed against the reference wildtype virus (WT). Here, we generated an Omicron-specific lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA vaccine candidate, and tested its activity in animals, both alone and as a heterologous booster to existing WT mRNA vaccine. Our Omicron-specific LNP-mRNA vaccine elicited strong and specific antibody response in vaccination-naive mice. Mice that received two-dose WT LNP-mRNA, the one mimicking the commonly used Pfizer/Moderna mRNA vaccine, showed a >40-fold reduction in neutralization potency against Omicron variant than that against WT two weeks post second dose, which further reduced to background level >3 months post second dose. As a booster shot for two-dose WT mRNA vaccinated mice, a single dose of either a homologous booster with WT LNP-mRNA or a heterologous booster with Omicron LNP-mRNA restored the waning antibody response against Omicron, with over 40-fold increase at two weeks post injection as compared to right before booster. Interestingly, the heterologous Omicron LNP-mRNA booster elicited neutralizing titers 10-20 fold higher than the homologous WT booster against the Omicron variant, with comparable titers against the Delta variant. All three types of vaccination, including Omicron mRNA alone, WT mRNA homologous booster, and Omicron heterologous booster, elicited broad binding antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, Beta, and Delta variants, as well as other Betacoronavirus species such as SARS-CoV, but not Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These data provided direct proof-of-concept assessments of an Omicron-specific mRNA vaccination in vivo, both alone and as a heterologous booster to the existing widely-used WT mRNA vaccine form.","['Fang Z', 'Peng L', 'Filler R', 'Suzuki K', 'McNamara A', 'Lin Q', 'Renauer PA', 'Yang L', 'Menasche B', 'Sanchez A', 'Ren P', 'Xiong Q', 'Strine M', 'Clark P', 'Lin C', 'Ko AI', 'Grubaugh ND', 'Wilen CB', 'Chen S']",2022,,,bioRxiv,"Fang Z, et al.

35156569,Aptamer-based Emerging Tools for Viral Biomarker Detection: A Focus on SARS-CoV-2.,"Viral infections can cause fatal illnesses to humans as well as animals. Early detection of viruses is therefore crucial to provide effective treatment to patients. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly given an alarming call to develop rapid and sensitive detection platforms. The viral diagnostic tools need to be fast, affordable, and easy to operate with high sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to the currently used diagnostic methods. The present detection methods include direct detection of viral antigens or measuring the response of antibodies to viral infections. However, the sensitivity and quantification of the virus are still a significant challenge. Detection tools employing synthetic binding molecules like aptamers may provide several advantages over the conventional methods that use antibodies in the assay format. Aptamers are highly stable and tailorable molecules and are therefore ideal for detection and chemical sensing applications. This review article discusses various advances made in aptamer-based viral detection platforms, including electrochemical, optical, and colorimetric methods to detect viruses, specifically SARS-Cov-2. Considering the several advantages, aptamers could be game-changing in designing high-throughput biosensors for viruses and other biomedical applications in the future.","['Kulabhusan PK', 'Pishva P', 'Çapkın E', 'Tambe P', 'Yüce M']",2023,30,8,Curr Med Chem,"Kulabhusan PK, et al.

35151081,Isothermal gene amplification coupled MALDI-TOF MS for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide for more than a year and has undergone several mutations and evolutions. Due to the lack of effective therapeutics and long-active vaccines, accurate and large-scale screening and early diagnosis of infected individuals are crucial to control the pandemic. Nevertheless, the current widely used RT-qPCR-based methods suffer from complicated temperature control, long processing time and the risk of false-negative results. Herein, we present a three-way junction induced exponential rolling circle amplification (3WJ-eRCA) combined MALDI-TOF MS assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The assay can detect simultaneously the target nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame 1 ab (orf1ab) genes of SARS-CoV-2 in a single test within 30 min, with an isothermal process (55 °C). High specificity to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45), was observed. We have further used the method to detect pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 in various matrices, e.g. water, saliva and urine. The results demonstrated a great potential of the method for large scale screening of COVID-19, which is an important part of the pandemic control.","['Han G', 'Lin Q', 'Yi J', 'Lyu Q', 'Ma Q', 'Qiao L']",2022,242,,Talanta,"Han G, et al.

35143357,Do Sputnik V Vaccine-Induced Antibodies Protect Against Seasonal Coronaviruses? Case Study.,"There are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which circulate among animals, yet there are seven types that infect humans. Three of them can cause severe acute respiratory illness-SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. Other HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause only mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. These four coronaviruses are called seasonal, because they are continuously circulating among human population and are responsible for up to 30% of all respiratory tract infections. Genetically, these low-pathogenic types are related to SARS-CoV-2. That is why questions concerning the cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization between antibodies against different types of coronaviruses have been raised. We addressed these questions by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). We established the upper respiratory infection etiology for three patients who had been vaccinated with Sputnik V and tested positive on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The symptoms included sore throat, nasal congestion, and myalgia. Their blood serum was analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in dynamics: before vaccination, and after the first and second dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, all patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The targeted NGS panel sequencing data analysis showed that these patients were infected with common coronavirus HCoV-OC43. These results suggest that S protein-targeted vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are not protective against seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43.","['Koryukov M', 'Kechin A', 'Shamovskaya D', 'Timofeeva A', 'Filipenko M']",2022,35,2,Viral Immunol,"Koryukov M, et al.

35136710,Screening of potential inhibitors of COVID-19 with repurposing approach via molecular docking.,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the causative organism for a pandemic disease with a high rate of infectivity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to assess the affinity between several available small molecule and proteins, including Abl kinase inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, and Papain-like protease inhibitors, using binding simulation, to test whether they may be effective in inhibiting COVID-19 infection through several mechanisms. The efficiency of inhibitors was evaluated based on docking scores using AutoDock Vina software. Strong ligand-protein interactions were predicted among some of these drugs, that included: Imatinib, Remdesivir, and Telaprevir, and this may render these compounds promising candidates. Some candidate drugs might be efficient in disease control as potential inhibitors or lead compounds against the SARS-CoV-2. It is also worth highlighting the powerful immunomodulatory role of other drugs, such as Abivertinib that inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the progression of COVID-19 infection. The potential role of other Abl kinase inhibitors, including Imatinib in reducing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers, immune regulatory function and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicate that this drug may be useful for COVID-19, as the SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to SARS-CoV.","['Alizadehmohajer N', 'Behmardi A', 'Najafgholian S', 'Moradi S', 'Mohammadi F', 'Nedaeinia R', 'Haghjooy Javanmard S', 'Sohrabi E', 'Salehi R', 'Ferns GA', 'Emami Nejad A', 'Manian M']",2022,11,1,Netw Model Anal Health Inform Bioinform,"Alizadehmohajer N, et al.

35132597,Potential Drug Strategies to Target Coronaviruses.,"INTRODUCTION: As the world has witnessed three severe coronavirus outbreaks in the past two decades, including the recent pandemic COVID19, caused by SARS-CoV2, it has become of utmost importance to develop drugs and vaccines against coronaviruses. The previous two outbreaks, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively. COVID19 is considered the worst of all and has taken more than 4 million lives so far and crippled the socioeconomic life of human beings in the entire world. Extensive research is being carried out to find out a solution that will not only help us to fight the current situation but also prepare us to prevent further intervention by similar viruses in the future. Here, we aim to highlight potential drug target sites in coronavirus infection or life cycle in general.
METHODS: We have gone through the research papers published on coronavirus, with special emphasis on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2, in peer-reviewed journals and tried to identify the possible sites in the coronavirus life cycle which can be used as potential drug targets.
RESULTS: Studies showed that there are several unique enzymes and mechanisms involved in the coronavirus life cycle which can be manipulated to develop drugs against it. However, it has been always a challenge to develop drugs or vaccines against viruses as they utilize the host cell machinery and more difficult against RNA viruses because of their high mutation rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective control of the current (2020) pandemic necessarily depends on the development of either a vaccine or an effective therapeutic agent. In the past, many attempts were taken to develop vaccines after the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, though no successful vaccine reached to the market as the situation came under control. In the current scenario, many laboratories have developed effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2, which have reduced both the severity of the infection and the rate of mortality considerably. However, world needs to be prepared for similar viral outbreaks in future and research must be continued to develop more effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses.","['Sarkar K', 'Sil PC']",2021,1352,,Adv Exp Med Biol,Sarkar K and Sil PC.

35130636,Complexity of the Diagnosis of COVID-19 in the Context of Pandemicity: Need for Excellence in Diagnostic Acumen.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has caused a pandemic devastating many countries worldwide. It is a complex and multifaceted disease with a unique coronavirus etiology, pathogenesis, zoonotic, and human-to-human transmission, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality. Accurate and timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. In this study, we discussed the complexities of COVID-19 diagnostic elements in the context of pandemicity, drawing from our awareness, observations, and lessons learned from two previous coronavirus pandemics, namely SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2002 and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) in 2012, and how they applied to the diagnosis of COVID-19 today. Diagnosis of COVID-19 takes place without physician-patient personal contact due to isolation or quarantine or in the hospital setting, emergency units, and critical care units with the cumbersome barriers of personal protective equipment. Technical diagnosis is important, but we also emphasized the human impact of diagnosing COVID-19. Conveying the diagnosis of a critical disease to patients and families requires aspects of excellence in professionalism: ethics, empathy, and humility. Diagnostic skills in COVID-19 should extend to prognostication for patients suffering at the end of life, so that they will not be deprived of high-quality palliative care and comfort.","['Joishy SK', 'Sadohara M', 'Kurihara M', 'Tokuda Y']",2022,43,1,Korean J Fam Med,"Joishy SK, et al.

35129074,MERS-CoV nsp1 impairs the cellular metabolic processes by selectively downregulating mRNAs in a novel granules.,"MERS-CoV infection can damage the cellular metabolic processes, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Through screening, we found non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of MERS-CoV could inhibit cell viability, cell cycle, and cell migration through its endonuclease activity. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that MERS-CoV nsp1 specifically downregulated the mRNAs of ribosomal protein genes, oxidative phosphorylation protein genes, and antigen presentation genes, but upregulated the mRNAs of transcriptional regulatory genes. Further analysis shown nsp1 existed in a novel ribonucleosome complex formed via liquid-liquid phase separation, which did not co-localize with mitochondria, lysosomes, P-bodies, or stress granules. Interestingly, the nsp1-located granules specifically contained mRNAs of ribosomal protein genes and oxidative phosphorylation genes, which may explain why MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively degraded these mRNAs in cells. Finally, MERS-CoV nsp1 transgenic mice showed significant loss of body weight and an increased sensitivity to poly(I:C)-induced inflammatory death. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which MERS-CoV impairs cell viability, which serves as a potential novel target for preventing MERS-CoV infection-induced pathological damage.","['Pan Z', 'Feng Y', 'Wang Z', 'Lei Z', 'Han Q', 'Zhang J']",2022,13,1,Virulence,"Pan Z, et al.

35128086,Drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2 main protease: Molecular docking and molecular dynamics investigations.,"The current novel corona virus illness (COVID-19) is a developing viral disease that was discovered in 2019. There is currently no viable therapeutic strategy for this illness management. Because traditional medication development and discovery has lagged behind the threat of emerging and re-emerging illnesses like Ebola, MERS-CoV, and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2. Drug developers began to consider drug repurposing (or repositioning) as a viable option to the more traditional drug development method. The goal of drug repurposing is to uncover new uses for an approved or investigational medicine that aren't related to its original use. The main benefits of this strategy are that there is less developmental risk and that it takes less time because the safety and pharmacologic requirements are met. The main protease (Mpro) of corona viruses is one of the well-studied and appealing therapeutic targets. As a result, the current research examines the molecular docking of Mpro (PDB ID: 5R81) conjugated repurposed drugs. 12,432 approved drugs were collected from ChEMBL and drugbank libraries, and docked separately into the receptor grid created on 5R81, using the three phases of molecular docking including high throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP). Based on docking scores and MM-GBSA binding free energy calculation, top three drugs (kanamycin, sulfinalol and carvedilol) were chosen for further analyses for molecular dynamic simulations.","['Omer SE', 'Ibrahim TM', 'Krar OA', 'Ali AM', 'Makki AA', 'Ibraheem W', 'Alzain AA']",2022,29,,Biochem Biophys Rep,"Omer SE, et al.

35126886,D155Y substitution of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a weakens binding with Caveolin-1.,"The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, varies from mild to severe respiratory illness. Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. Protein-protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.","['Gupta S', 'Mallick D', 'Banerjee K', 'Mukherjee S', 'Sarkar S', 'Lee ST', 'Basuchowdhuri P', 'Jana SS']",2022,20,,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Gupta S, et al.

Future outbreaks are also a plausible threat to mankind. As computational biologists, we are committed to address the need for a universal vaccine that can deter all these pathogenic viruses in a single shot. Notably, the spike proteins present in all these viruses function as credible PAMPs that are majorly sensed by human TLR4 receptors. Our study aims to recognize the amino acid sequence(s) of the viral spike proteins that are precisely responsible for interaction with human TLR4 and to screen the immunogenic epitopes present in them to develop a multi-epitope multi-target chimeric vaccine against the coronaviruses. Molecular design of the constructed vaccine peptide is qualified in silico; additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies collectively reveal strong and stable interactions of the vaccine construct with TLRs and MHC receptors.

35124103,The enigma of the 1889 Russian flu pandemic: A coronavirus?,"The ""Russian flu"", which raged from 1889 to 1894, is considered as the first pandemic of the industrial era for which statistics have been collected. This planetary event started in Turkestan and hit the Russian Empire, before reaching all European countries, the United States of America, and the whole world. Contemporaries were surprised by its high contagiousness as evidenced by attack rates averaging 60% in urban populations, its rapid spread in successive waves circling the globe in a few months by rail and sea, and the tendency of the disease to relapse. Despite its low case-fatality rate (0.10%-0.28%), it is estimated to have caused one million deaths worldwide. On serological grounds, it is generally accepted that the causative agent of Russian influenza was Myxovirus influenzae, the virus identified for all influenza pandemics since the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has underscored the extraordinary epidemic potential of coronaviruses, this assumption has recently been questioned. Coronaviruses come from wild reservoirs (bats, rodents, birds, …). They induce respiratory symptoms mimicking influenza, possibly leading to respiratory distress with pneumonia. In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, recent deadly and limited epidemics, such as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, have occurred. Russian influenza presented as an influenza-like syndrome with clinical peculiarities (multivisceral and neurological involvement, skin rash, early iterative relapses), evoking some particularities of Covid-19. Four other coronaviruses circulating in the human population for decades (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) have been found to be responsible for 15 to 30% of seasonal colds. All of these viruses are of animal origin. Recently, phylogenetic studies have revealed the genetic proximity between a bovine coronavirus BCoV and the human virus HCoV-OC43, indicating that the latter emerged around 1890, at the time of the Russian flu, when an epizootic was raging among cattle throughout Europe. Could the current human virus be the attenuated remnant that appeared after the Russian flu in 1894? Was there a coronavirus pandemic before Covid-19 ?",['Berche P'],2022,51,3,Presse Med,Berche P.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of antibody WS6, from a mouse immunized with mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike. WS6 bound diverse beta-coronavirus spikes and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV, and related sarbecoviruses. Epitope mapping revealed WS6 to target a region in the S2 subunit, which was conserved among SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43. The crystal structure at 2-Å resolution of WS6 with its S2 epitope revealed recognition to center on a conserved helix, which was occluded in both prefusion and post-fusion spike conformations. Structural and neutralization analyses indicated WS6 to neutralize by inhibiting fusion, post-viral attachment. Comparison of WS6 to other antibodies recently identified from convalescent donors or mice immunized with diverse spikes indicated a stem-helical supersite - centered on hydrophobic residues Phe1148, Leu1152, Tyr1155, and Phe1156 - to be a promising target for vaccine design.

35118334,The use of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the diagnosis of lung cancer: a narrative review.,"OBJECTIVE: In this article we discuss the current evidence for these concerns and highlight where further work is required to understand the risk from these procedures and how it can be mitigated for.
BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 (coronavirus-19 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has impacted on many aspects of patient care both for those with the virus and those with other illnesses. Of particular concern has been the risk to staff and patients from the spread of the virus in health care settings. This has led to changes in guidelines and practice in community and hospital settings that has implications on patient diagnostic pathways in lung cancer, with a specific emphasis on aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
METHODS: A literature search was carried out and 44 abstracts were initially found. Given the novel status of COVID-19, we included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in our search. Five papers were selected for further analysis. An additional paper was highlighted during our research and therefore included in our review.
CONCLUSIONS: The papers selected assessed the risk of transmission during AGPs. The six articles selected assessed the risk of aerosol transmission during various AGPs (bronchoscopy, pleural procedures and pulmonary function tests) and each found that the risk of viral transmission via aerosol was low. As mentioned above, at the time the paper was written, there was a paucity of evidence regarding AGPs in the era of COVID-19. There is emerging evidence that our understanding of these procedures may be outdated and the risk of transmission maybe lower than previously anticipated. However, we need further reliable evidence to change practice going forward.","['Vythilingam S', 'Quint M', 'Newsom R', 'Hicks A']",2021,5,,Mediastinum,"Vythilingam S, et al.

35113884,Transient dynamics of infection transmission in a simulated intensive care unit.,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a serious public health problem. In previous work, two models of an intensive care unit (ICU) showed that differing population structures had markedly different rates of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission. One explanation for this difference is the models having differing long-term equilbrium dynamics, resulting from different basic reproductive numbers, R0. We find in this system however that this is not the case, and that both models had the same value for R0. Instead, short-term, transient dynamics, characterizing a series of small, self-limiting outbreaks caused by pathogen reintroduction were responsible for the differences. These results show the importance of these short-term factors for disease systems where reintroduction events are frequent, even if they are below the epidemic threshold. Further, we examine how subtle changes in how a hospital is organized-or how a model assumes a hospital is organized-in terms of the admission of new patients may impact transmission rates. This has implications for both novel pathogens introduced into ICUs, such as Ebola, MERS or COVID-19, as well as existing healthcare-associated infections such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.","['Jackson KC', 'Short CT', 'Toman KR', 'Mietchen MS', 'Lofgren E', 'CDC MInD-Healthcare Program']",2022,17,2,PLoS One,"Jackson KC, et al.

35113873,Hidden fraction of Polish population immune to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2021.,"Population immunity (herd immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 derives from two sources: vaccinations or cases of infection with the virus. Infections can be diagnosed as COVID-19 and registered, or they can be asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or even full-blown but undiagnosed and unregistered when patients recovered at home. Estimation of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is difficult and remains a subject of speculations. Here we present a population screening for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in Polish citizens (N = 501) who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected in Wrocław (Lower Silesia) on 15th and 22nd May 2021. Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 22) or from vaccinated citizens (N = 14) served as positive controls. Sera were tested with Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG and IgA (quantitative) that contain specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens: NCP, RBD, Spike S2, E, ACE2, PLPro protein, and antigens for exclusion cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV 229E Np, HCoV NL63 Np. Within the investigated population of healthy individuals who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.3% (262 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.2% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501). These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic.","['Budziar W', 'Gembara K', 'Harhala M', 'Szymczak A', 'Jędruchniewicz N', 'Baniecki K', 'Pikies A', 'Nahorecki A', 'Hoffmann A', 'Kardaś A', 'Szewczyk-Dąbrowska A', 'Klimek T', 'Kaźmierczak Z', 'Witkiewicz W', 'Barczyk K', 'Dąbrowska K']",2022,17,2,PLoS One,"Budziar W, et al.

35112482,"Synthesis of Dihydrobenzofuro[3,2-b]chromenes as Potential 3CLpro Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2: A Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Study.","The recent emergence of pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has raised significant global health concerns. More importantly, there is no specific therapeutics currently available to combat against this deadly infection. The enzyme 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) is known to be essential for viral life cycle as it controls the coronavirus replication. 3CLpro could be a potential drug target as established before in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In the current study, we wanted to explore the potential of fused flavonoids as 3CLpro inhibitors. Fused flavonoids (5a,10a-dihydro-11H-benzofuro[3,2-b]chromene) are unexplored for their potential bioactivities due to their low natural occurrences. Their synthetic congeners are also rare due to unavailability of general synthetic methodology. Here we designed a simple strategy to synthesize 5a,10a-dihydro-11H-benzofuro[3,2-b]chromene skeleton and it's four novel derivatives. Our structural bioinformatics study clearly shows excellent potential of the synthesized compounds in comparison to experimentally validated inhibitor N3. Moreover, in-silico ADMET study displays excellent druggability and extremely low level of toxicity of the synthesized molecules. Further, for better understanding, the molecular dynamic approach was implemented to study the change in dynamicity after the compounds bind to the protein. A detailed investigation through clustering analysis and distance calculation gave us sound comprehensive data about their molecular interaction. In summary, we anticipate that the currently synthesized molecules could not only be a potential set of inhibitors against 3CLpro but also the insights acquired from the current study would be instrumental in further developing novel natural flavonoid based anti-COVID therapeutic spectrums.","['Gorai S', 'Junghare V', 'Kundu K', 'Gharui S', 'Kumar M', 'Patro BS', 'Nayak SK', 'Hazra S', 'Mula S']",2022,17,8,ChemMedChem,"Gorai S, et al.

Here, we carried out quantitative translatome and whole-cell proteomics analyses of primary renal proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells derived from human donors infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV to disseminate virus and cell type-specific changes over time. Our findings revealed shared pathways modified upon infection with both viruses, as well as SARS-CoV-2-specific host cell modulation driving key changes in innate immune activation and cellular protein quality control. Notably, MERS-CoV infection-induced specific changes in mitochondrial biology that were not observed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we identified extensive modulation in pathways associated with kidney failure that changed in a virus- and cell type-specific manner.

To determine if MERS-CoV was present in Kazakhstan, in 2017-2018, we collected swabs and sera from Bactrian camels (n = 3124) and dromedary (n = 5083). The total seropositivity was 0.54% in Bactrian camels and 0.24% in dromedaries; however, we did not detect MERS-CoV RNA in swab samples. There was no difference in the probability of infection between species or sex, but younger camels had a higher probability of being seropositive, suggesting a recent introduction of the virus to Kazakhstan. The infection of both camel species indicates that they both may play a role as natural reservoirs. These results reinforce the need for continual surveillance, especially at the camel-human interface to understand the risk of zoonotic exposure.","['Orynbayev MB', 'Hitch AT', 'Kerimbayev AA', 'Nissanova RK', 'Sultankulova KT', 'Rystayeva RA', 'Omarova ZD', 'Kassenov MM', 'Tailakova ET', 'Smith GJD', 'Mendenhall IH']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Orynbayev MB, et al.

35104060,Analyzing the roles of some species of arthropods in the transmission of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is still listed on the WHO Research and Development Blueprint of emerging pathogens. Dromedary camels remain the only known animal reservoir of the virus. The animal-to-animal as well as the animal-to-human transmission in the MERS-CoV cycles were reported. However, many aspects of these transmission chains are not well studied. One of these directions is the potential roles of various species of arthropods in the transmission of the virus.
OBJECTIVES: The main goal of the current work was to study the roles of several species of arthropods in the transmission of MERS-CoV.
METHODOLOGY: To achieve this goal, we identified some MERS-CoV naturally infected dromedary camel populations. We conducted a longitudinal study among these animals for more than 2 months. This was done by repeated testing of nasal swabs biweekly from some selected animals in this population for the presence of MERS-CoV-RNAs by real-time PCR. During the duration of this study, we collected several species of arthropods (Culicoides, Stomoxys, Musca domestica and some Culex species) that shared the habitat and were circulating in this farm during this longitudinal study.
RESULTS: Our results showing, despite the detection of the viral RNAs in some animals throughout this study, none of the examined species of arthropods tested positive for the viral RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are suggesting that at least the tested species of arthropods may not play roles in the transmission of MERS-CoV. However, more large-scale studies are required to explore any potential roles of arthropods in the transmission cycle of MERS-CoV.","['Hemida MG', 'Al-Sabi M', 'Alhammadi M', 'Almathen F', 'Alnaeem A']",2022,8,3,Vet Med Sci,"Hemida MG, et al.

The COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in China in December 2019 has spread globally. Understanding its pattern of spread and how it affects the populace helps to guide formulation of strategies at curbing its spread, managing the disease and allocation of limited resources in tackling the pandemic.
METHODOLOGY: This is a review article about the epidemiology of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19). Various search engines were used to accumulate literature on the topic; these include PubMed, Google scholar, Ajol.
RESULTS: As at October 29, 2020, SARS-CoV2 has spread to all continents except the Antarctica. Though a zoonotic disease, human to human transmission has resulted to this pandemic is via direct and indirect contact of droplets with mucosal surfaces. Most severe cases occur among the elderly, males, and people with co-morbid diseases. The average incubation period is 2-10 days. When compared with SARS-CoV (Ro: 2.3-3.7, mortality rate 11%) and MERS-CoV (Ro: 0.8-1.3, mortality rate: 34.3%), SARS-Cov-2 is a highly infective (Ro: as high as 6.5) with low mortality rates (average range mortality rates 1.83- 6.3%).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a highly infective novel virus. Older persons and people with medical comorbidities are more susceptible to the severe form of the disease and mortality. As the second wave comes on, a sustainable measure of limiting the spread and consequences of COVID-19 should be more emphasized.","['Buowari DY', 'Ogundipe HD']",2021,19,Suppl 1,Ann Ib Postgrad Med,Buowari DY and Ogundipe HD.

Initially, the SARS-CoV-2 virus came to attention through its effects on the respiratory system. However, its actions in many other organs also have been discovered almost daily. As enzymes are indispensable to uncountable biochemical reactions in the human body, it is not surprising that some enzymes are of relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Past evidence from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks provided hints about the role of enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this setting, ACE-2 is an enzyme of great importance since it is the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data elucidate patterns of enzymatic alterations in COVID-19, which could be associated with organ damage, prognosis, and clinical complications. Further, viral mutations can create new disease behaviors, and these effects are related to the activity of enzymes. This review will discuss the main enzymes related to COVID-19, summarizing the findings on their role in viral entry mechanism, the consequences of their dysregulation, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on them.","['Alves MHME', 'Mahnke LC', 'Macedo TC', 'Silva TKDS', 'Carvalho Junior LB']",2022,197,,Biochimie,"Alves MHME, et al.

35085508,Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Lessons From the Asian Approach: A Narrative Review.,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic put into question the organizational skills of LTCF. The containment measures implemented in several Asian countries avoided heavy death tolls in LTCF in contrast to other countries across the globe. The aim of this review is therefore to investigate and illustrate the measures that were undertaken in Asia to contain and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in LTCF.
DESIGN: Narrative review.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Asian older subjects institutionalized in LTCF.
METHODS: Broad literature research from July 2020-April 2021. The following search terms were used: ""COVID-19 Nursing homes"" AND the country of interest or ""contact tracing."" Eligible categories for inclusion comprise editorials, reviews, government guidelines, letters to the editor, and perspectives. The COVID-19 measures were then subdivided into different sections and compiled into an evidence table.
RESULTS: Prompt measures were put into action since the beginning of the pandemic that avoided the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. Examples range from simple acts of proper hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, swab testing, social distancing, preventive measures on health care workers, organizational measures such as quarantine, outbreak control, visitor restrictions, relationship with acute hospitals, and admission policy. Technology also played a fundamental role in promoting social distancing by using specific robots and in managing contact tracing.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The Asian preventive control guidelines are similar to those recommended elsewhere. Difference in timing and past experience with prior outbreaks such as SARS and MERS might have favored the Asian response. Furthermore, sociocultural values toward older persons by protecting and making sure that LTCF are part of the health care system could have also played a role.","['Calcaterra L', 'Cesari M', 'Lim WS']",2022,23,3,J Am Med Dir Assoc,"Calcaterra L, et al.

35079775,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vaccination Boosts Neutralizing Activity Against Seasonal Human Coronaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: Most of the millions of people that are vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have previously been infected by related circulating human coronaviruses (hCoVs) causing common colds and will experience further encounters with these viruses in the future. Whether COVID-19 vaccinations impact neutralization of seasonal coronaviruses is largely unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed the capacity of sera derived from 24 individuals before and after heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination to neutralize genuine OC43, NL63, and 229E hCoVs, as well as viral pseudoparticles carrying the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-229E spike proteins. Genuine hCoVs or spike containing pseudovirions were incubated with different concentrations of sera and neutralization efficiencies were determined by measuring viral RNA yields, intracellular viral nucleocapsid expression, or reporter gene expression in Huh-7 cells.
RESULTS: All individuals showed strong preexisting immunity against hCoV-OC43. Neutralization of hCoV-NL63 was more variable and all sera showed only modest inhibitory activity against genuine hCoV-229E. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination resulted in efficient cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 but not of MERS-CoV. On average, vaccination significantly increased the neutralizing activity against genuine hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-229E.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous COVID-19 vaccination may confer some cross-protection against endemic seasonal coronaviruses.","['Lawrenz J', 'Xie Q', 'Zech F', 'Weil T', 'Seidel A', 'Krnavek D', 'van der Hoek L', 'Münch J', 'Müller JA', 'Kirchhoff F']",2022,75,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Lawrenz J, et al.

35076815,Broadening the horizon of crop research: a decade of advancements in plant molecular genetics to divulge phenotype governing genes.,"Advancements in sequencing, genotyping, and computational technologies during the last decade (2011-2020) enabled new forward-genetic approaches, which subdue the impediments of precise gene mapping in varied crops. The modern crop improvement programs rely heavily on two major steps-trait-associated QTL/gene/marker's identification and molecular breeding. Thus, it is vital for basic and translational crop research to identify genomic regions that govern the phenotype of interest. Until the advent of next-generation sequencing, the forward-genetic techniques were laborious and time-consuming. Over the last 10 years, advancements in the area of genome assembly, genotyping, large-scale data analysis, and statistical algorithms have led faster identification of genomic variations regulating the complex agronomic traits and pathogen resistance. In this review, we describe the latest developments in genome sequencing and genotyping along with a comprehensive evaluation of the last 10-year headways in forward-genetic techniques that have shifted the focus of plant research from model plants to diverse crops. We have classified the available molecular genetic methods under bulk-segregant analysis-based (QTL-seq, GradedPool-Seq, QTG-Seq, Exome QTL-seq, and RapMap), target sequence enrichment-based (RenSeq, AgRenSeq, and TACCA), and mutation-based groups (MutMap, NIKS algorithm, MutRenSeq, MutChromSeq), alongside improvements in classical mapping and genome-wide association analyses. Newer methods for outcrossing, heterozygous, and polyploid plant genetics have also been discussed. The use of k-mers has enriched the nature of genetic variants which can be utilized to identify the phenotype-causing genes, independent of reference genomes. We envisage that the recent methods discussed herein will expand the repertoire of useful alleles and help in developing high-yielding and climate-resilient crops.","['Singh R', 'Kumar K', 'Bharadwaj C', 'Verma PK']",2022,255,2,Planta,"Singh R, et al.

35076547,Optimized Protocols for the Propagation and Quantification of Infectious Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) Using NCTC Clone 1469 and 929 Cells.,"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a non-human pathogen betacoronavirus that is evolutionarily and structurally related to the human pathogenic viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. However, unlike the human SARS and MERS viruses, MHV requires a biosafety level 2 laboratory for propagating and safe handling, making it a potentially suitable surrogate virus. Despite this utility, few papers discussed the propagation and quantification of MHV using cell lines readily available in biorepositories making their implementations not easily reproducible. This article provides protocols for propagating and quantifying MHV-A59 using the recommended NCTC clone 1469 and clone 929 cell lines from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). More specifically, the methods detail reviving cells, routine cell passaging, preparing freeze stocks, infection of NCTC clone 1469 with MHV and subsequent harvesting, and plaque assay quantification of MHV using NCTC clone 929 cells. Using these protocols, a BSL-2 laboratory equipped for cell culture work would generate at least 6.0 log plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL of MHV lysate and provide an optimized overlay assay using either methylcellulose or agarose as overlays for the titration of infectious virus particles.

35075440,Evaluation of potential miRNA sponge effects of SARS genomes in human.,"To date the coronavirus family is composed of seven different viruses which were commonly known as cold viruses until the appearance of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) in 2012 and the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which caused the COVID-19 global pandemic in 2019. Using bioinformatic approaches we tested the potential interactions of human miRNAs, expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, with the available coronavirus genomes. Putative miRNA binding sites were then compared between pathogenic and non pathogenic virus groups. The pathogenic group shares 6 miRNA binding sites that can be potentially involved in the sequestration of miRNAs already known to be associated with deep vein thrombosis. We then analysed ∼100k SARS-CoV-2 variant genomes for their potential interaction with human miRNAs and this study highlighted a group of 97 miRNA binding sites which is present in all the analysed genomes. Among these, we identified 6 miRNA binding sites specific for SARS-CoV-2 and the other two pathogenic viruses whose down-regulation has been seen associated with deep vein thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, one of these miRNAs, namely miR-20a-5p, whose expression decreases with advancing age, is involved in cytokine signaling, cell differentiation and/or proliferation. We hypothesize that depletion of poorly expressed miRNA could be related with disease severity.","['Pepe G', 'Guarracino A', 'Ballesio F', 'Parca L', 'Ausiello G', 'Helmer-Citterich M']",2022,7,1,Noncoding RNA Res,"Pepe G, et al.

35074468,Betacoronavirus-specific alternate splicing.,"Viruses can subvert a number of cellular processes including splicing in order to block innate antiviral responses, and many viruses interact with cellular splicing machinery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to suppress global mRNA splicing, and at least 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind specifically to one or more human RNAs. Here, we investigate 17 published experimental and clinical datasets related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, datasets from the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS, as well as Streptococcus pneumonia, HCV, Zika virus, Dengue virus, influenza H3N2, and RSV. We show that genes showing differential alternative splicing in SARS-CoV-2 have a similar functional profile to those of SARS-CoV and MERS and affect a diverse set of genes and biological functions, including many closely related to virus biology. Additionally, the differentially spliced transcripts of cells infected by coronaviruses were more likely to undergo intron-retention, contain a pseudouridine modification, and have a smaller number of exons as compared with differentially spliced transcripts in the control groups. Viral load in clinical COVID-19 samples was correlated with isoform distribution of differentially spliced genes. A significantly higher number of ribosomal genes are affected by differential alternative splicing and gene expression in betacoronavirus samples, and the betacoronavirus differentially spliced genes are depleted for binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate characteristic patterns of differential splicing in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS. The alternative splicing changes observed in betacoronaviruses infection potentially modify a broad range of cellular functions, via changes in the functions of the products of a diverse set of genes involved in different biological processes.","['Karlebach G', 'Aronow B', 'Baylin SB', 'Butler D', 'Foox J', 'Levy S', 'Meydan C', 'Mozsary C', 'Saravia-Butler AM', 'Taylor DM', 'Wurtele E', 'Mason CE', 'Beheshti A', 'Robinson PN']",2022,114,2,Genomics,"Karlebach G, et al.

35071824,RNAi-mediated siRNA sequences to combat the COVID-19 pandemic with the inhibition of SARS-CoV2.,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has cost five million lives to date, and was caused by a positive-sense RNA virus named SARS-CoV2. The lack of drugs specific to SARS-CoV2, leads us to search for an effective and specific therapeutic approach. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is able to activate the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway to silence the specific targeted gene and inhibit the viral replication, and it has not yet attracted enough attention as a SARS-CoV2 antiviral agent. It could be a potential weapon to combat this pandemic until the completion of full scale, effective mass vaccination. For this study, specific siRNAs were designed using a web-based bioinformatics tool (siDirect2.0) against 14 target sequences. These might have a high probability of silencing the essential proteins of SARS-CoV2. such as: 3CLpro/Mpro/nsp5, nsp7, Rd-Rp/nsp12, ZD, NTPase/HEL or nsp13, PLpro/nsp3, envelope protein (E), spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF8, ORF3a, nsp2, and its respective 5' and 3'-UTR. Among these potential drug targets, the majority of them contain highly conserved sequences; the rest are chosen on the basis of their role in viral replication and survival. The traditional vaccine development technology using SARS-CoV2 protein takes 6-8 months; meanwhile the virus undergoes several mutations in the candidate protein chosen for vaccine development. By the time the protein-based vaccine reaches the market, the virus would have undergone several mutations, such that the antibodies against the viral sequence may not be effective in restricting the newly mutated viruses. However, siRNA technology can make sequences based on real time viral mutation status. This has the potential for suppressing SARS-CoV2 viral replication, through RNAi technology.",['Saadat KASM'],2022,26,,Gene Rep,Saadat KASM.

In bacteria with prokaryotic cell type, the sigma subunit that combines with RNA polymerase helps in identifying promoters. In Escherichia coli (E.coli), the promoters are identified by different sigma factors consisting of different functionalities. There have been various methods used for prediction of different class of promoters. However, these methods need to be improved for better identification and classification of promoters.

35065260,Bovine-derived antibodies and camelid-derived nanobodies as biotherapeutic weapons against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants: A review article.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected 305 million individuals worldwide and killed about 5.5 million people as of January 10, 2022. SARS-CoV-2 is the third major outbreak caused by a new coronavirus in the previous two decades, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even though vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is considered a critical strategy for preventing virus spread in the population and limiting COVID-19 clinical manifestations, new therapeutic drugs, and management strategies are urgently needed, particularly in light of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants (such as Delta and Omicron variants). However, the use of conventional antibodies has faced many challenges, such as viral escape mutants, increased instability, weak binding, large sizes, the need for large amounts of plasma, and high-cost manufacturing. Furthermore, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the human population and recurrent coronavirus spillovers highlight the need for broadly neutralizing antibodies that are not affected by an antigenic drift that could limit future zoonotic infection. Bovine-derived antibodies and camelid-derived nanobodies are more potent and protective than conventional human antibodies, thanks to their inbuilt characteristics, and can be produced in large quantities. In addition, it was reported that these biotherapeutics are effective against a broad spectrum of epitopes, reducing the opportunity of viral pathogens to develop mutational escape. In this review, we focus on the potential benefits behind our rationale for using bovine-derived antibodies and camelid-derived nanobodies in countering SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants and mutants.","['Saied AA', 'Metwally AA', 'Alobo M', 'Shah J', 'Sharun K', 'Dhama K']",2022,98,,Int J Surg,"Saied AA, et al.

35062368,Immune Profiling of COVID-19 in Correlation with SARS and MERS.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication of the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019, with a death rate reaching up to 40%. The main underlying cause of ARDS is a cytokine storm that results in a dysregulated immune response. This review discusses the role of cytokines and chemokines in SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with particular emphasis on the elevated levels of inflammatory mediators that are shown to be correlated with disease severity. For this purpose, we reviewed and analyzed clinical studies, research articles, and reviews published on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This review illustrates the role of the innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 and identifies the general cytokine and chemokine profile in each of the three infections, focusing on the most prominent inflammatory mediators primarily responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The current treatment protocols or medications in clinical trials were reviewed while focusing on those targeting cytokines and chemokines. Altogether, the identified cytokines and chemokines profiles in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 provide important information to better understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and highlight the importance of using prominent inflammatory mediators as markers for disease diagnosis and management. Our findings recommend that the use of immunosuppression cocktails provided to patients should be closely monitored and continuously assessed to maintain the desirable effects of cytokines and chemokines needed to fight the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The current gap in evidence is the lack of large clinical trials to determine the optimal and effective dosage and timing for a therapeutic regimen.","['Khalil BA', 'Shakartalla SB', 'Goel S', 'Madkhana B', 'Halwani R', 'Maghazachi AA', 'AlSafar H', 'Al-Omari B', 'Al Bataineh MT']",2022,14,1,Viruses,"Khalil BA, et al.

Liposome-mediated delivery of antigens has been shown to induce the antigen-specific stimulation of the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Here, we prepared dried, reconstituted vesicles (DRVs) from DPPC liposomes and used them as the vaccine carrier system for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease (DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro). MERS-CoV PLpro emulsified in the Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA-MERS-CoV PLpro) was used as a control. Immunization of mice with DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro did not induce any notable toxicity, as revealed by the levels of the serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood of immunized mice. Immunization with DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro induced greater antigen-specific antibody titer and switching of IgG1 isotyping to IgG2a as compared to immunization with IFA-MERS-CoV PLpro. Moreover, splenocytes from mice immunized with DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro exhibited greater proliferation in response to antigen stimulation. Moreover, splenocytes from DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro-immunized mice secreted significantly higher IFN-γ as compared to splenocytes from IFA-MERS-CoV PLpro mice. In summary, DRVs-MERS-CoV PLpro may prove to be an effective prophylactic formulation to prevent MERS-CoV infection.","['Khan MA', 'Malik A', 'Alzohairy MA', 'Alruwetei AM', 'Alhatlani BY', 'Rugaie OA', 'Khan A']",2022,27,2,Molecules,"Khan MA, et al.

It has had an acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries during the past 8 months. Widespread testing and tracing efforts are being employed in many countries in attempts to contain and mitigate this pandemic. Recent data has indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common and that the virus RNA can be detected in wastewater. This indicates that wastewater monitoring may provide a potentially efficient tool for the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. In particular, this provides important means of (i) estimating the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements, (ii) managing the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently, and (iii) verifying disease elimination. Here we report different virus concentration methods using polyethylene glycol (PEG), alum, or filtration techniques as well as different RNA extraction methodologies, providing important insights regarding the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage. Virus RNA particles were detected in wastewater in several geographic locations in Israel. In addition, a correlation of virus RNA concentration to morbidity was detected in Bnei-Barak city during April 2020.

35043090,Enhanced endocytosis elevated virulence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 due to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes hyperglycemia. In COVID-19 patients the severity of the disease depends on myriad factors but diabetes mellitus is the most important comorbidity. The current review was conducted to investigate the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and relevant treatment. The literature published in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was reviewed up to September 2021. The keywords including SARS-CoV-2, type 2 diabetes mellitus in COVID-19, hyperglycemia in COVID-19, opportunistic infections in type 2 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 were used in different combinations. Hyperglycemic individuals over-express ACE-2 receptors in the lungs thus increasing the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and replication. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, additionally it also stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α creating a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm might be responsible for respiratory insufficiency in severe COVID-19 patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with immunosuppression and the patients are prone to get many opportunistic infections. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with severe COVID-19 have lymphopenia. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the neutrophils exhibit decreased chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and phagocytosis. Reduction in lymphocyte count and defective neutrophil capacity renders them with COVID-19 susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections increasing the mortality rate.

Due to a centralized setting and a long turnaround, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), the gold standard of viral detection, has fallen short in timely reflecting the epidemic status quo during an urgent outbreak. As such, a rapid screening tool is necessitated to help contain the spread of COVID-19 amid the countries where the vaccine implementations have not been widely deployed. In this work, we propose a saliva-based COVID-19 antigen test using the electrical double layer (EDL)-gated field-effect transistor-based biosensor (BioFET). The detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is validated with limits of detection (LoDs) of 0.34 ng/mL (7.44 pM) and 0.14 ng/mL (2.96 pM) in 1× PBS and artificial saliva, respectively. The specificity is inspected with types of antigens, exhibiting low cross-reactivity among MERS-CoV, Influenza A virus, and Influenza B virus.

35042131,Capacitive biosensor based on vertically paired electrodes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Vertically paired electrodes (VPEs) with multiple electrode pairs were developed for the enhancement of capacitive measurements by optimizing the electrode gap and number of electrode pairs. The electrode was fabricated using a conductive polymer layer of PEDOT:PSS instead of Ag and Pt metal electrodes to increase the VPE fabrication yield because the PEDOT:PSS layer could be effectively etched using a reactive dry etching process. In this study, sensitivity enhancement was realized by decreasing the electrode gap and increasing the number of VPE electrode pairs. Such an increase in sensitivity according to the electrode gap and the number of electrode pairs was estimated using a model analyte for an immunoassay. Additionally, a computer simulation was performed using VPEs with different electrode gaps and numbers of VPE electrode pairs. Finally, VPEs with multiple electrode pairs were applied for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) detection. The capacitive biosensor based on the VPE with immobilized anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP was applied for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 in viral cultures. Using viral cultures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and CoV-strain 229E, the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to satisfy the cutoff value (dilution factor of 1/800) for the medical diagnosis of COVID-19, and the assay results from the capacitive biosensor were compared with commercial rapid kit based on a lateral flow immunoassay.","['Park JH', 'Lee GY', 'Song Z', 'Bong JH', 'Chang YW', 'Cho S', 'Kang MJ', 'Pyun JC']",2022,202,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Park JH, et al.

35039783,"Heptad stereotypy, S/Q layering, and remote origin of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion core.","The fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells, a key event in the pathogenesis of Covid-19, depends on the assembly of a six-helix fusion core (FC) formed by portions of the spike protein heptad repeats (HRs) 1 and 2. Despite the critical role in regulating infectivity, its distinctive features, origin, and evolution are scarcely understood. Thus, we undertook a structure-guided positional and compositional analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 FC, in comparison with FCs of related viruses, tracing its origin and ongoing evolution. We found that clustered amino acid substitutions within HR1, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1, enhance local heptad stereotypy and increase sharply the FC serine-to-glutamine (S/Q) ratio, determining a neat alternate layering of S-rich and Q-rich subdomains along the post-fusion structure. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 ranks among viruses with the highest FC S/Q ratio, together with highly syncytiogenic respiratory pathogens (RSV, NDV), whereas MERS-Cov, HIV, and Ebola viruses display low ratios, and this feature reflects onto S/Q segregation and H-bonding patterns. Our evolutionary analyses revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 FC occurs in other SARS-CoV-1-like Sarbecoviruses identified since 2005 in Hong Kong and adjacent regions, tracing its origin to >50 years ago with a recombination-driven spread. Finally, current mutational trends show that the FC is varying especially in the FC1 evolutionary hotspot. These findings establish a novel analytical framework illuminating the sequence/structure evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 FC, tracing its long history within Sarbecoviruses, and may help rationalize the evolution of the fusion machinery in emerging pathogens and the design of novel therapeutic fusion inhibitors.","['Marchetti C', 'Vaglietti S', 'Rizzo F', 'Di Nardo G', 'Colnaghi L', 'Ghirardi M', 'Fiumara F']",2022,7,2,Virus Evol,"Marchetti C, et al.

35035591,"Deep Learning for Reliable Classification of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS from Chest X-ray Images.","Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and quickly spreading coronavirus infestation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of coronavirus. This work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To the best of our knowledge, this classification scheme has never been investigated in the literature. A unique database was created, so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the decision of deep CNNs. Several deep learning classifiers were trained and tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported: SqueezeNet, ResNet18, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201. Original and preprocessed images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks. Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3 outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and 90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. The classification performance degrades with segmented CXRs compared to plain CXRs. However, the results are more reliable as the network learns from the main region of interest, avoiding irrelevant non-lung areas (heart, bones, or text), which was confirmed by the Score-CAM visualization. All networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (> 96%) with the segmented lung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases in the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.","['Tahir AM', 'Qiblawey Y', 'Khandakar A', 'Rahman T', 'Khurshid U', 'Musharavati F', 'Islam MT', 'Kiranyaz S', 'Al-Maadeed S', 'Chowdhury MEH']",2022,14,5,Cognit Comput,"Tahir AM, et al.

In this study, we have taken a docking-based virtual screening approach to select natural molecules (from plants) with possible therapeutic potential. For this purpose, AUTODOCK Vina-based determination of binding affinity values (blind and active-site oriented) was obtained to short-list molecules with possible inhibitory potential against the main Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6Y2F -the monomeric form). The 4 molecules selected were Chebuloside (-8.2; -8.2), Acetoside (-8.0; -8.0), Corilagin (-8.1; -7.7) and Arjunolic Acid (-8.0; -7.6) (blind and active-site oriented docking scores (Kcal/mol) in parenthesis, respectively). Further, a comparative search, with FDA-approved drugs, has shown that Ouabain was comparable to Chebuloside with a similarity score of 0.227. This in silico finding with respect to Ouabain is significant, since this polycyclic glycoside has been shown to treat COVID-19 positive patients with a cardiovascular disease. Hydrocortisone was similar to Arjunolic acid with a score of 0.539. Again, this likeness is worthy of mention, since hydrocortisone has been used earlier for the treatment of SARS-CoV1 and MERS. However, further experimentation and validation of the results, in suitable biological model systems, are necessary to gain more insight and relevance as well as provide corroborative evidence for our

35033926,Closed dumbbell mediated isothermal amplification of nucleic acids for DNA diagnostic assays.,"Nucleic acid amplification tests have been widely applied in clinical diagnostics, food safety monitoring, and molecular biology. As a well-established isothermal amplification method, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has gained recognition. However, the need for specifically designed four to six primers and non-specific amplification pose challenges for further application of LAMP based detection methods. Here, a novel isothermal amplification method, termed closed dumbbell mediated isothermal amplification (CDA) of nucleic acids, was developed. The primers are easily designed by adding two different parts of middle sequence to the canonical PCR primers at 5'-ends. CDA method was demonstrated in detecting MERS-CoV orf1a gene and H1N1 gene fragments with merits of short core primer, simple primer design process and high amplification efficiency. In addition, CDA showed excellent amplification efficacy over LAMP and competitive annealing mediated isothermal amplification (CAMP) by slight modification of primers targeting at same sequence. Furthermore, real-time and HNB based colorimetric CDA detection of Shigella were developed for practical application, both exhibited 100% success. In all, the developed CDA method with high specificity, simplicity, efficiency and rapidity has shown its great potential for point of care nucleic acids diagnostic.","['Mao R', 'Wang T', 'Zhao Y', 'Wu X', 'Zhang S', 'Cai T']",2022,240,,Talanta,"Mao R, et al.

35033204,"Noninvasive respiratory support for COVID-19 patients: when, for whom, and how?","The significant mortality rate and prolonged ventilator days associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with severe COVID-19 have incited a debate surrounding the use of noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) (i.e., HFNC, CPAP, NIV) as a potential treatment strategy. Central to this debate is the role of NIRS in preventing intubation in patients with mild respiratory disease and the potential beneficial effects on both patient outcome and resource utilization. However, there remains valid concern that use of NIRS may prolong time to intubation and lung protective ventilation in patients with more advanced disease, thereby worsening respiratory mechanics via self-inflicted lung injury. In addition, the risk of aerosolization with the use of NIRS has the potential to increase healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to the virus. We review the existing literature with a focus on rationale, patient selection and outcomes associated with the use of NIRS in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, as well as in patients with acute respiratory failure due to different etiologies (i.e., COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, etc.) to understand the potential role of NIRS in COVID-19 patients. Based on this analysis we suggest an algorithm for NIRS in COVID-19 patients which includes indications and contraindications for use, monitoring recommendations, systems-based practices to reduce HCW exposure, and predictors of NIRS failure. We also discuss future research priorities for addressing unanswered questions regarding NIRS use in COVID-19 with the goal of improving patient outcomes.","['Sullivan ZP', 'Zazzeron L', 'Berra L', 'Hess DR', 'Bittner EA', 'Chang MG']",2022,10,1,J Intensive Care,"Sullivan ZP, et al.

35032947,"The Montefiore-Einstein Rigidity Scale-Revised (MERS-R): Development, administration, reliability, and validity in child and adult Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).","BACKGROUND: Rigidity contributes to severity and functional impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is an unmet need for a valid, reliable, and sensitive outcome measure to assess rigidity in ASD.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Montefiore-Einstein Rigidity Scale-Revised (MERS-R) to assess the Behavioral Rigidity Domain (BRD), Cognitive Rigidity Domain (CRD), and Protest Domain (PD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MERS-R was administered to 93 individuals with ASD (children and adults, high and low IQ) at baseline, Week 2, and Week 12. Internal consistency was assessed for domain scores, Total Rigidity Composite (TRC = BRD + CRD), and Total Composite (TC = BRD + CRD + PD) with Cronbach's α. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) assessed test-retest reliability from baseline to weeks 2 and 12. Pearson's correlations assessed the relationship between the MERS-R and age, sex, and IQ. Convergent validity assessed the correlation of MERS-R scores to the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale-ASD (CY-BOCS-ASD).
RESULTS: Good internal consistency was demonstrated for the BRD, PD, TRC and TC (Cronbach's α = 0.83, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.89, respectively) and adequate internal consistency for the CRD (α = .72). Good or excellent test-test reliability was demonstrated over two weeks (ICC: 0.66─.79), and fair or good reliability over 12 weeks (ICC: 0.56-66). MERS-R scores did not differ by age, sex, or IQ (p: 0.16─.99) with the exception that higher PD scores were associated with younger age (correlation = -0.25, p = 0.01). Significant convergent validity was demonstrated between all MERS-R scores and the CY-BOCS-ASD (p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION: The MERS-R demonstrated internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity and applicability to autistic children and adults of different sexes and IQ levels. It is a valid, sensitive, and reliable instrument to measure behavioral and cognitive rigidity in ASD.","['Taylor BP', 'Liu J', 'Mowrey W', 'Eule E', 'Bolognani F', 'Hollander E']",2022,147,,J Psychiatr Res,"Taylor BP, et al.

This study aimed to evaluate current vaccination non-serious/serious side effects.
METHODS: A multicenter electronic questionnaire via an online platform was conducted over a 1-week period among vaccinated dental staff and dental students inquiring whether they experienced vaccine-related side-effects after vaccine administration.
RESULTS: A total of 1205 respondents with a mean age of 39 (SD: 12) were retained for the analyses. The following vaccines were reported; Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), BBV152 (Covaxin), or BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm). The majority of respondents received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (51.1%) and Gam-COVID-Vac (37.6%).

Following MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS, this is the third severe coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years. To date, there are no exact agents and vaccines available for the treatment of COVID-19 that are clinically successful. Antimicrobial medications are effective in controlling infectious diseases. However, the extensive use of antibiotics makes microbes more resistant to drugs and demands novel bioactive agents' development. Polysaccharides are currently commonly used in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries for their remarkable applications. Polysaccharides appear to have a wide range of anti-virus (anti-coronavirus) and antimicrobial applications. Polysaccharides are able to induce bacterial cell membrane disruption as they demonstrate potency in binding onto the surfaces of microbial cells. Here, the antiviral mechanisms of such polysaccharides and their success in the application of antiviral infections are reviewed. Additionally, this report provides a summary of current advancements of well-recognized polysaccharides as antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents.","['AlMatar M', 'Makky EA', 'Ramli ANM', 'Kafkas NE', 'Köksal F']",2022,15,6,Curr Mol Pharmacol,"AlMatar M, et al.

However, they can act as an intermediate source or vector for transmitting zoonotic viruses to humans, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). After several outbreaks of CCHFV in the Arabian Peninsula, recent studies have demonstrated that CCHFV is endemic in dromedaries and camel ticks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). There is no apparent disease in dromedaries after the bite of infected ticks; in contrast, fever, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, and petechial hemorrhaging are common symptoms in humans, with a case fatality ratio of up to 40%. We used the in-solution hybridization capture of 100 annotated immune genes to genotype 121 dromedaries from the UAE tested for seropositivity to CCHFV. Through univariate linear regression analysis, we identified two candidate genes belonging to the innate immune system: ","['Lado S', 'Futas J', 'Plasil M', 'Loney T', 'Weidinger P', 'Camp JV', 'Kolodziejek J', 'Kannan DO', 'Horin P', 'Nowotny N', 'Burger PA']",2021,11,1,Cells,"Lado S, et al.

This article aims to contribute to this debate by analyzing the structural characteristics of a multisectoral network that emerged and evolved under strong state control during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS) in South Korea. This study particularly focuses on the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The data for the study were collected through a content analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally be conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health disasters, calling for a careful design of governance structures for disaster response.","['Ku M', 'Han A', 'Lee KH']",2021,19,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Ku M, et al.

The Au surface of the chip exerting localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomena was immobilized with a glycopolymer for the detection of cytokines. The glycopolymers were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization for controlled polymer chain length, and thiol-terminated glycopolymers with chain lengths of 20-, 100-, and 200-mers were designed. The thickness of the biomolecular layer on the Au surface was controlled by changing the polymer chain length of the immobilized glycopolymer, and the absorption of proteins onto the Au surface was detected by the shift of absorbance peak wavelength. The value of absorbance peak wavelength shift by protein adsorption increased as the glycopolymer layer thickness became thinner. This difference in LSPR signal response was remarkable for cytokine recognition compared to larger proteins. It was shown that controlling the biomolecular layer thickness was effective for the detection of small proteins, and our research suggested the usefulness of the controlled glycopolymer surface as a molecular recognition material for cytokine detection.","['Terada Y', 'Obara A', 'Takamatsu H', 'Espulgar WV', 'Saito M', 'Tamiya E']",2021,4,11,ACS Appl Bio Mater,"Terada Y, et al.

We report a systematic review and meta-analysis based on all published high-quality data up to and including June 3, 2021 on the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women infected with COVID-19.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science databases were queried from inception up to June 3, 2021.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included all clinical studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and rapid communications) that reported data on any maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19.
METHODS: The data were analyzed as pooled proportions or odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in meta-analysis models.
RESULTS: We included 111 studies enrolling 42,754 COVID-19-positive pregnant women. From COVID-19-positive pregnant women, the incidence rates were 53.2% (95% confidence interval, 48-58.4) for cesarean delivery, 41.5% (95% confidence interval, 36.3-46.8) for spontaneous vaginal delivery, and 6.4% (95% confidence interval, 4.5-9.2) for operative delivery. The rates of some adverse neonatal events, including premature delivery (16.7%; 95% confidence interval, 12.8-21.5) and low birthweight (16.7%; 95% confidence interval, 12.8-21.5) were relatively high in mothers infected with COVID-19. Vertical transmission (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-4.7), neonatal death (3%; 95% confidence interval, 2-4), stillbirth (1.9%; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.4), and maternal mortality (0.012%; 95% confidence interval, 0.010-0.014) were rare adverse events. The mean birthweight was 3069.7 g (95% confidence interval, 3009.7-3129.8 g). In the comparative analysis, COVID-19 significantly increased the risk of premature delivery (odds ratio, 1. 48 [95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.8]), preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1]), stillbirth (odds ratio, 2.36 [95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.462]), neonatal mortality (odds ratio, 3.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.07-10.5]), and maternal mortality (odds ratio, 3.08 [95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.3]). The pooled analyses were homogenous, with mild heterogeneity in premature delivery and preeclampsia outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The data must be interpreted with caution as limited data are available, and no complete assessment of bias is possible at this time. Our data suggest that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 seem to be at a higher risk of lower birth weights and premature delivery. There is no evidence at this time of the sharply increased maternal mortality that was seen previously with both the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS pandemics.","['Marchand G', 'Patil AS', 'Masoud AT', 'Ware K', 'King A', 'Ruther S', 'Brazil G', 'Calteux N', 'Ulibarri H', 'Parise J', 'Arroyo A', 'Coriell C', 'Cook C', 'Ruuska A', 'Nourelden AZ', 'Sainz K']",2022,2,1,AJOG Glob Rep,"Marchand G, et al.

35001773,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in camelids.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the cause of a severe respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate in humans. Since its emergence in mid-2012, 2578 laboratory-confirmed cases in 27 countries have been reported by the World Health Organization, leading to 888 known deaths due to the disease and related complications. Dromedary camels are considered the major reservoir host for this virus leading to zoonotic infection in humans. Dromedary camels, llamas, and alpacas are susceptible to MERS-CoV, developing a mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract infection characterized by epithelial hyperplasia as well as infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and some macrophages within epithelium, lamina propria, in association with abundant viral antigen. The very mild lesions in the lower respiratory tract of these camelids correlate with absence of overt illness following MERS-CoV infection. Unfortunately, there is no approved antiviral treatment or vaccine for MERS-CoV infection in humans. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop intervention strategies in camelids, such as vaccination, to minimize virus spillover to humans. Therefore, the development of camelid models of MERS-CoV infection is key not only to assess vaccine prototypes but also to understand the biologic mechanisms by which the infection can be naturally controlled in these reservoir species. This review summarizes information on virus-induced pathological changes, pathogenesis, viral epidemiology, and control strategies in camelids, as the intermediate hosts and primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans.","['Te N', 'Ciurkiewicz M', 'van den Brand JMA', 'Rodon J', 'Haverkamp AK', 'Vergara-Alert J', 'Bensaid A', 'Haagmans BL', 'Baumgartner W', 'Segalés J']",2022,59,4,Vet Pathol,"Te N, et al.

34999369,Unresolved questions in the zoonotic transmission of MERS.,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the second of three zoonotic coronaviruses to infect humans since 2002, causing severe pneumonia. Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, the causes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Covid-19, respectively, MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels, a domestic/companion animal present across Africa, the Middle East and Central or South Asia and is sporadically transmitted to humans. However, it does not transmit readily from human to human except in hospital and household settings. Human MERS disease is reported only from the Arabian Peninsula (and only since 2012 even though the virus was detected in camels from at least the early 1990's) and in travelers from this region. Remarkably, no zoonotic MERS disease has been detected in Africa or Asia, even in areas of high density of MERS-CoV infected dromedaries. Here, we review aspects of MERS biology and epidemiology that might contribute to this lack of correlation between sites of camel infection and human zoonotic disease. Since MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV have pandemic potential, further investigations into this disparity is critical, to forestall pandemics caused by this virus.","['Peiris M', 'Perlman S']",2022,52,,Curr Opin Virol,Peiris M and Perlman S.

34994297,Discovery of compounds inhibiting SARS-COV-2 multi-targets.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic that has devastated the lives of millions. Researchers around the world are relentlessly working in hopes of finding a cure. Even though the virus shares similarities with reported SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at the genomic and proteomic level, efforts to repurpose already known drugs against SARS-CoV-2 have resulted ineffective. In this succinct review, we discuss the different potential targets in SARS-CoV-2 at both the genomic and proteomic levels. In addition, we analyze the compounds inhibiting individual target protein as well as multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. ACE-2 receptor in humans has also been considered a target, keeping the role of the receptor in mind. The mechanism of action of these compounds has also been highlighted along with their clinical manifestation. Towards the end of the review, a brief note on the drugs currently in clinical trials and the current status of the vaccines are also examined. In conclusion, compounds targeting multiple targets of the virus hold the key in putting an end to the coronavirus malady.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A vaccine against the causative agent of MERS, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is urgently needed. We previously identified a peptide ligand, Co4B, which can enhance antigen (Ag) delivery to the nasal mucosa and promote Ag-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses following intranasal immunization. MERS-CoV infects via the respiratory route; thus, we conjugated the Co4B ligand to the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD), and used this to intranasally immunize C57BL/6 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice. Ag-specific mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig) A and systemic IgG, together with virus-neutralizing activities, were highly induced in mice immunized with Co4B-conjugated S-RBD (S-RBD-Co4B) compared to those immunized with unconjugated S-RBD. Ag-specific T cell-mediated immunity was also induced in the spleen and lungs of mice intranasally immunized with S-RBD-Co4B. Intranasal immunization of hDPP4-Tg mice with S-RBD-Co4B reduced immune cell infiltration into the tissues of virus-challenged mice. Finally, S-RBD-Co4B-immunized mice exhibited were better protected against infection, more likely to survive, and exhibited less body weight loss. Collectively, our results suggest that S-RBD-Co4B could be used as an intranasal vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.","['Yang YL', 'Kim J', 'Jeong Y', 'Jang YS']",2022,40,5,Vaccine,"Yang YL, et al.

SARS-Cov-2 virus belongs to lineage b of beta-CoVs demonstrating a strong phylogenetic similarity with BatCoVRaTG13 type. Spike (S) glycoprotein projections -consisting of two subunits S1/S2- provide a unique crown-like formation (corona) on virion's surface. Concerning their functional role, S1 represents the main receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas S2 is involved in the virus-cell membrane fusion mechanism. On Nov 26th 2021, WHO designated the new SARS-CoV-2 strain - named Omicron, from letter ''όμικρον'' in the Greek alphabet - as a variant of concern (B.1.1529 variant). Potentially this new variant is associated with high transmissibility leading to elevated infectivity and probably increased re-infection rates. Its impact on morbidity/mortality remains under investigation. In the current paper, analyzing and comparing the alterations of SARS-CoV-2 S RNA sequences in the defined variants (Alpha to Omicron), we observed some interesting findings regarding the S1-RBD/S2 mutation/deletion equilibrium that maybe affect and modify its activity.","['Papanikolaou V', 'Chrysovergis A', 'Ragos V', 'Tsiambas E', 'Katsinis S', 'Manoli A', 'Papouliakos S', 'Roukas D', 'Mastronikolis S', 'Peschos D', 'Batistatou A', 'Kyrodimos E', 'Mastronikolis N']",2022,814,,Gene,"Papanikolaou V, et al.

34981054,MERS-CoV endoribonuclease and accessory proteins jointly evade host innate immunity during infection of lung and nasal epithelial cells.,"UNLABELLED: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into humans in 2012, causing highly lethal respiratory disease. The severity of disease may be in part because MERS-CoV is adept at antagonizing early innate immune pathways - interferon (IFN) production and signaling, protein kinase R (PKR), and oligoadenylate synthetase ribonuclease L (OAS/RNase L) - generated in response to viral double-stranded (ds)RNA generated during genome replication. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which we recently reported activates PKR and RNase L and to some extent, IFN signaling. We previously found that MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a (dsRNA binding protein) and NS4b (phosphodiesterase) could weakly suppress these pathways, but ablation of each had minimal effect on virus replication. Here we investigated the antagonist effects of the conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), in combination with NS4a or NS4b. Inactivation of EndoU catalytic activity alone in a recombinant MERS-CoV caused little if any effect on activation of the innate immune pathways during infection. However, infection with recombinant viruses containing combined mutations with inactivation of EndoU and deletion of NS4a or inactivation of the NS4b phosphodiesterase promoted robust activation of the dsRNA-induced innate immune pathways. This resulted in ten-fold attenuation of replication in human lung derived A549 and primary nasal cells. Furthermore, replication of these recombinant viruses could be rescued to the level of WT MERS-CoV by knockout of host immune mediators MAVS, PKR, or RNase L. Thus, EndoU and accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b together suppress dsRNA-induced innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection in order to optimize viral replication.
IMPORTANCE: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes highly lethal respiratory disease. MERS-CoV encodes several innate immune antagonists, accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b unique to the merbeco lineage and the nsp15 protein endoribonuclease (EndoU), conserved among all coronaviruses. While mutation of each antagonist protein alone has little effect on innate immunity, infections with recombinant MERS-CoVs with mutations of EndoU in combination with either NS4a or NS4b, activate innate signaling pathways and are attenuated for replication. Our data indicate that EndoU and accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b together suppress innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection, to optimize viral replication. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 which activates these pathways and consistent with greater mortality observed during MERS-CoV infection compared to SARS-CoV-2.","['Comar CE', 'Otter CJ', 'Pfannenstiel J', 'Doerger E', 'Renner DM', 'Tan LH', 'Perlman S', 'Cohen NA', 'Fehr AR', 'Weiss SR']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Comar CE, et al.

However, the data about recurrent cases is limited. We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of recurrent MERS, and its possible mechanisms.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients with clinically recurrent MERS were reported here, exhibiting neurological symptoms such as limbs weakness and numbness, stand/walk unsteadily, slurred speech and irritability, and typical lesions in the corpus callosum and white matter. One of them experienced another four episodes with a similar clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging findings over a period of 10 years. The Na levels in the present two patients were normal.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Combined with the patients reported previously, recurrence could be seen in both MERS type 1 and type 2 patients, from two to multiple times, with the latter possibly more common. It suggested that some genetic factors might be involved in MERS, especially for MERS type 2 or familial MERS.","['Xue J', 'Duan C', 'Xu G', 'Zhang Y', 'Song Z', 'Yi Z', 'Yang C', 'Li F', 'Liu K', 'Zhao H', 'Liu X']",2022,22,1,BMC Pediatr,"Xue J, et al.

OBJECTIVES: to investigate the effect of systemic administration of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular complications and all-cause mortality in patients hospitalised with respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza.
METHODS: We identified randomised trials published prior to July 28th, 2021. The Mantel-Haenszel random effects method and the Hartung and Knapp adjustment were used to obtain pooled estimates of treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: No randomised trials of glucocorticoids for SARS, MERS or influenza reported relevant outcomes. We included eleven COVID-19 randomised trials (8109 patients). Overall, compared to placebo or standard care, glucocorticoids were not associated with a reduction of in-hospital mortality (p = 0.09). In a pre-specified sub-analysis, in-hospital mortality was reduced by 19% when follow-up was restricted to 14 days from randomisation (5/11 trials, 1329 patients, p = 0.02). With longer follow-up (9/11 trials, 7874 patients), administration of glucocorticoids was associated with a trend to benefit for those requiring mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.57-1.27) but possible harm for those not receiving oxygen at randomisation (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.00 - 1.61), an effect that was significantly different amongst subgroups (p = 0.0359). Glucocorticoids reduced the risk of worsening renal function by 37% (4/11 trials); reported rate of other cardiovascular complications was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of systemic glucocorticoids to patients hospitalised with COVID-19 does not lower mortality overall but may reduce it in those requiring respiratory support and increase it in those who do not.","['Caiazzo E', 'Rezig AOM', 'Bruzzese D', 'Ialenti A', 'Cicala C', 'Cleland JGF', 'Guzik TJ', 'Maffia P', 'Pellicori P']",2022,176,,Pharmacol Res,"Caiazzo E, et al.

The outbreak likely began as several cases caused by probable zoonotic transmission, followed by human-to-human transmission via droplets or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated items. COVID-19 mainly affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in human, and severely affected patients may have multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Despite recent progress in vaccine development, the management of multiple organ failure caused by immune injury is mainly supportive. COVID-19 is more contagious than SARS and MERS, although it has a lower mortality rate. The 2019 outbreak of COVID-19 has been classified by the WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which has drawn attention to the challenge of the disease and caused questioning of scientific strategies for preventing infection and improving clinical outcomes.

34962926,A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies interactors of the autophagy pathway as conserved coronavirus targets.,"Over the past 20 years, 3 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have emerged-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, most recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-demonstrating that coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a serious threat to human health and highlighting the importance of developing effective therapies against them. Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycles. Herein, we conducted 2 independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas-9 knockout (KO) screens to identify MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E host dependency factors (HDFs) required for HCoV replication in the human Huh7 cell line. Top scoring genes were further validated and assessed in the context of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including TMEM41B, MINAR1, and the immunophilin FKBP8, were common host factors required for pan-CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin protein family with the compounds cyclosporine A, and the nonimmunosuppressive derivative alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, which recapitulate the natural site of virus replication.

The S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein (S1 protein) contains the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain. The SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain mutations in the S1 subunit. The spike protein is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and constitutes the viral component of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.
METHODS: Therefore, in this work we assessed the effect of exposure (24 h) to 10 nM SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein on physiologically relevant human bronchial (bro) and alveolar (alv) lung mucosa models cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) (
RESULTS: Exposure to S1 protein induced the surface expression of ACE2, toll like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 in both bro-ALI and alv-ALI models. Transcript expression analysis identified 117 (bro-ALI) and 97 (alv-ALI) differentially regulated genes (
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we observed a typical anti-viral response in the bronchial model and a pro-fibrotic response in the alveolar model.

34960238,A Yellow Fever 17D Virus Replicon-Based Vaccine Platform for Emerging Coronaviruses.,"The tremendous global impact of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as other current and recent outbreaks of (re)emerging viruses, emphasize the need for fast-track development of effective vaccines. Yellow fever virus 17D (YF17D) is a live-attenuated virus vaccine with an impressive efficacy record in humans, and therefore, it is a very attractive platform for the development of novel chimeric vaccines against various pathogens. In the present study, we generated a YF17D-based replicon vaccine platform by replacing the prM and E surface proteins of YF17D with antigenic subdomains from the spike (S) proteins of three different betacoronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV. The prM and E proteins were provided in trans for the packaging of these RNA replicons into single-round infectious particles capable of expressing coronavirus antigens in infected cells. YF17D replicon particles expressing the S1 regions of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike proteins were immunogenic in mice and elicited (neutralizing) antibody responses against both the YF17D vector and the coronavirus inserts. Thus, YF17D replicon-based vaccines, and their potential DNA- or mRNA-based derivatives, may constitute a promising and particularly safe vaccine platform for current and future emerging coronaviruses.","['Oreshkova N', 'Myeni SK', 'Mishra N', 'Albulescu IC', 'Dalebout TJ', 'Snijder EJ', 'Bredenbeek PJ', 'Dallmeier K', 'Kikkert M']",2021,9,12,Vaccines (Basel),"Oreshkova N, et al.

34959504,Non-SARS Non-MERS Human Coronaviruses: Clinical Characteristics and Outcome.,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have become evident sources of human respiratory infections with new emerging HCoVs as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The common four coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are known to cause respiratory illness in humans, but their clinical impact is poorly described in the literature. We analyzed the data of all patients who tested positive for at least one of the four HCoVs from October 2015 to January 2020 in a tertiary care center. HCoVs were detected in 1062 specimens, with an incidence rate of 1.01%, out of all documented respiratory illnesses. Detection of these viruses was reported sporadically throughout the years, with a peak of occurrence during winter seasons. OC43 had the highest incidence (53.7%), followed by NL63 (21.9%), HKU1 (12.6%), and 229E (11.8%). Most of these infections were community-acquired, with symptoms of both upper and lower respiratory tract. Co-detection with other viruses were observed, mostly with rhinovirus. 229E was the most frequent (26.4%) HCoV in patients requiring intensive care, while NL63 and 229E were the most common in patients requiring invasive ventilation. The highest 30-day mortality rate was observed in patients infected with 229E (6.4%). HCoVs are common circulating pathogens that have been present for decades, with 229E being the most virulent in this study cohort.","['Saib I', 'Aleisa S', 'Ardah H', 'Mahmoud E', 'Alharbi AO', 'Alsaedy A', 'Aljohani S', 'Alshehri A', 'Alharbi NK', 'Bosaeed M']",2021,10,12,Pathogens,"Saib I, et al.

Here, we investigated a herd of nine dromedary calves from Umm Al Quwain, the United Arab Emirates that developed respiratory signs. Viral culture of the nasal swabs from the nine calves on Vero cells showed two different types of cytopathic effects (CPEs), suggesting the presence of two different viruses. Three samples showed typical CPEs of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Vero cells, which was confirmed by partial RdRp gene sequencing. Complete genome sequencing of the three MERS-CoV strains showed that they belonged to clade B3, most closely related to another dromedary MERS-CoV isolate previously detected in Dubai. They also showed evidence of recombination between lineages B4 and B5 in ORF1ab. Another three samples showed non-typical CPEs of MERS-CoV with cell rounding, progressive degeneration, and detachment. Electron microscopy revealed spherical viral particles with peplomers and diameter of about 170nm. High-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis showed that the genome organization (3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5') was typical of paramyxovirus. They possessed typical genome features similar to other viruses of the genus ","['Teng JLL', 'Wernery U', 'Lee HH', 'Fung J', 'Joseph S', 'Li KSM', 'Elizabeth SK', 'Fong JYH', 'Chan KH', 'Chen H', 'Lau SKP', 'Woo PCY']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Teng JLL, et al.

We searched MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We included 13 studies. Evidence shows an essential role of TMPRSS2 in Spike protein activation, entry, and spread into host cells. Co-expression of TMPRSS2 with cell surface receptors (ACE2 or DPP4) increased virus entry. This serine protease is involved in the formation of large syncytia between infected cells. TMPRSS2 cleaved the Spike protein of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, and increased virus propagation. Accumulating evidence suggests that TMPRSS2 is an essential protease for virus replication. We highlighted its critical molecular role in membrane fusion and the impact in viral mRNA replication, then promoting/driving pathogenesis and resistance.","['Chaves-Medina MJ', 'Gómez-Ospina JC', 'García-Perdomo HA']",2021,204,1,Arch Microbiol,"Chaves-Medina MJ, et al.

Studies found that severe COVID-19 is characterized by pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes and a cytokine storm. Studies have showen that SARS-CoV2 has significant genomic similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), which was a pandemic in 2002. More importantly, some diligent measures were used to limit its spread according to the evidence of hospital spread. Therefore, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its impact on global health and economy. The purpose of this paper is to review the transmission patterns of the three pneumonia: SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

However, existing alignment-based approaches for metagenomic SNP detection require high-performance computing and enough read coverage to distinguish SNPs from sequencing errors. To address these issues, we developed the GenoTyper for Prokaryotes (GT-Pro), a suite of methods to catalog SNPs from genomes and use unique k-mers to rapidly genotype these SNPs from metagenomes. Compared to methods that use read alignment, GT-Pro is more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster. Using high-quality genomes, we constructed a catalog of 104 million SNPs in 909 human gut species and used unique k-mers targeting this catalog to characterize the global population structure of gut microbes from 7,459 samples. GT-Pro enables fast and memory-efficient metagenotyping of millions of SNPs on a personal computer.","['Shi ZJ', 'Dimitrov B', 'Zhao C', 'Nayfach S', 'Pollard KS']",2022,40,4,Nat Biotechnol,"Shi ZJ, et al.

The main question of the year 2021 is if naturally- or artificially-acquired active immunity will be effective against the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. This review starts with the presentation of the two compartments of antiviral immunity-humoral and cellular, innate and adaptive-underlining how the involved cellular and molecular actors are intrinsically connected in the development of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34942833,Entropy-driven phases at high coverage adsorption of straight rigid rods on two-dimensional square lattices.,"Polymers are frequently deposited on different surfaces, which has attracted the attention of scientists from different viewpoints. In the present approach polymers are represented by rigid rods of length k (k-mers), and the substrate takes the form of an L×L square lattice whose lattice constant matches exactly the interspacing between consecutive elements of the k-mer chain. We briefly review the classical description of the nematic transition presented by this system for k≥7 observing that the high-coverage (θ) transition deserves a more careful analysis from the entropy point of view. We present a possible viewpoint for this analysis that justifies the phase transitions. Moreover, we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, supplemented by thermodynamic integration, to first calculate the configurational entropy of the adsorbed phase as a function of the coverage, and then to explore the different phases (and orientational transitions) that appear on the surface with increasing the density of adsorbed k-mers. In the limit of θ→1 (full coverage) the configurational entropy is obtained for values of k ranging between 2 and 10. MC data are discussed in comparison with recent analytical results [D. Dhar and R. Rajesh, Phys. Rev. E 103, 042130 (2021)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.103.042130]. The comparative study allows us to establish the applicability range of the theoretical predictions. Finally, the structure of the high-coverage phase is characterized in terms of the statistics of k×l domains (domains of l parallel k-mers adsorbed on the surface). A distribution of finite values of l (l≪L) is found with a predominance of k×1 (single k-mers) and k×k domains. The distribution is the same in each lattice direction, confirming that at high density the adsorbed phase goes to a state with mixed orientations and no orientational preference. An order parameter measuring the number of k×k domains in the adsorbed layer is introduced.","['Pasinetti PM', 'Ramirez-Pastor AJ', 'Vogel EE', 'Saravia G']",2021,104,5-1,Phys Rev E,"Pasinetti PM, et al.

34929907,Management of COVID-19 in pregnant women and neonates.,"OBJECTIVE: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause disease in humans and animals. In humans, it usually causes respiratory infections, from the common cold to serious illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The disease is mainly spread between people through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. This virus can last up to three days with plastic and stainless steel SARS CoV-2 can last up to three days, or in aerosols for 3h.
METHOD: The methodology of this research is indirect observation. Existing data analyzed with a preventive intervention approach and then described with a qualitative descriptive method.
RESULT: Based on research that has been carried out, infection with the COVID-19 virus in pregnant women can not only cause severe symptoms in the mother, but also poses a risk of harm to the baby they are carrying. Therefore, preventive measures need to be taken so that pregnant women are not easily infected with the Corona virus.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a new disease that has become a pandemic. This disease should be watched out for because transmission is relatively fast, has a mortality rate that cannot be ignored, and there is no definitive therapy. There are still many knowledge gaps in this field, so further studies are needed.","['Hamzah S', 'Fatimah A', 'Aswad I', 'Kurniaty']",2021,35 Suppl 2,,Gac Sanit,"Hamzah S, et al.

AIMS: This study aimed to provide an update on the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia from January 2019 to October 2020.
METHODS: Data on all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia from January 2019 to 20 October 2020 were retrieved from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia. Data collected were: demographic characteristics of cases, clinical course of the infection, related mortality and association with exposure to confirmed cases or camels.
RESULTS: In total, 299 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the study period. The mean age of cases was 52.4 years. Most of the cases were males (78.9%) and had comorbidities (72.7%), and 11.9% of cases were health care providers. Of the 299 cases, 83 (27.7%) died. Older age and having comorbidities were associated with higher mortality. Exposure to camels was associated with lower mortality. Health care providers also had a lower mortality rate than non-health care providers. Compared with COVID-19, MERS-CoV infection still has a higher mortality rate but with a more predictable pattern and an anticipated deterioration.
CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection remains a public health concern. The percentage of cases that were health care providers (11.9%) is lower than previously reported (19.1-25.0%), possibly due to the various preventive measures put in place to control COVID-19.","['Khan A', 'Nafisah SB', 'Mzahim B', 'Aleid B', 'Almatrafi D', 'Assiri A', 'Jokhdar H']",2021,27,11,East Mediterr Health J,"Khan A, et al.

The SARS-1 genome harbored 11 genes encoding 12 proteins, while SARS-2 genome contained only 10 genes encoding for 10 proteins. MERS genome contained 11 genes encoding 11 proteins. The analysis also revealed a slight variation in the whole genome size of SARS-2 comparing to its siblings resulting from sequential insertions and deletions (indels) throughout the viral genome particularly ORF1AB, spike, ORF10 and ORF8. The effective indels were observed in the gene encoding the spike protein that is responsible for viral attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and initiating infection. These indels are responsible for the newly emerging COVID-19 variants αCoV, βCoV, γCoV and δCoV. Nowadays, few effective COVID-19 vaccines developed based on spike (S) glycoprotein were approved and become available worldwide. Currently available vaccines can relatively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and suppress the disease. The traditional (killed or attenuated virus vaccine and antibody-based vaccine) and innovated vaccine production technologies (RNA- and DNA-based vaccines and viral vectors) are summarized in this review. We finally highlight the most common questions related to COVID-19 disease and the benefits of getting vaccinated.","['Hassanin AA', 'Haidar Abbas Raza S', 'Ahmed Ujjan J', 'Aysh ALrashidi A', 'Sitohy BM', 'Al-Surhanee AA', 'Saad AM', 'Mohamed Al-Hazani T', 'Osman Atallah O', 'Al Syaad KM', 'Ezzat Ahmed A', 'Swelum AA', 'El-Saadony MT', 'Sitohy MZ']",2022,29,4,Saudi J Biol Sci,"Hassanin AA, et al.

34917676,Virology of SARS-CoV-2 and management of nCOVID-19 utilizing immunomodulation properties of human mesenchymal stem cells-a literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review article is to outline the pathology, virology and mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to study the regenerative role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to tackle the lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.
BACKGROUND: The MSCs possess trophic potentialities which enable them to find out the sites of injury or inflammation and because of their pleiotropic and pericytic nature, these cells are capable of differentiating into different cell types. The MSCs can be derived from a variety of tissue sources be it adult or embryonic origin. The one major characteristic of MSCs is that they are immunologically naïve in terms of expression of MHC Class II. This very low or no expression of MHC class II makes them useful in clinical settings where they can be used in allogenic transplant cases. This allogenic transplant possibilities of these MSCs makes them one of the most researched stem cells and investigated for cell-based therapies. Though these MSCs are in clinical settings for long the one even more important characteristic which makes them even more in demand is their immunomodulatory properties which have been used in various cases to mitigate the effect of overstimulation of the immune system. In recent times after the pandemic of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) generated by SARS-CoV-2, the effect of various MSCs isolated from various tissue sources are being utilized to curb the overstimulation of immune response, so that the immune system can be brought under some regulation to ultimately reduce the effect of inflammation.
METHODS: In this review article, we have reviewed the existing literature, data and ongoing clinical trials by using keywords like novel coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mesenchymal stem cells, immunomodulation properties of stem cells, regenerative properties of stem cells, cell therapy, clinical trials of stem cells, clinical trials of COVID-19 and stem cells till 20th August 2020 using database named PubMed, NCBI, Google Scholar, Scopus, Research Gate and Clinicaltrials.gov.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, concluding the therapeutic potential of MSCs in managing and treating COVID-19.","['Sachdeva K', 'Kumar A', 'Mohanty S']",2021,8,,Stem Cell Investig,"Sachdeva K, et al.

In this study, we investigated the genetic structure, the homology of the structural protein sequences, as well as the investigation of the active site of structural proteins. The active site of structural proteins was determined based on the previous studies, and the homology of their amino acid sequences and structure was compared. Multiple sequence alignment of Spike protein of HCoVs showed that the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was located at a similar site to the S1 subunit. The binding motif of PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/disks large/zona occludens-1) of the envelope protein, was conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 according to multiple sequence alignment but showed different changes in the other HCoVs. Overall, spike protein showed the most variation in its active sites, but the other structural proteins were highly conserved. In this study, for the first time, the active site of all structural proteins of HCoVs as a drug target was investigated. The binding site of these proteins can be suitable targets for drugs or vaccines among HCoVs.","['Ahmadi K', 'Zahedifard F', 'Mafakher L', 'Ali Einakian M', 'Ghaedi T', 'Kavousipour S', 'Faezi S', 'Karmostaji A', 'Sharifi-Sarasiabi K', 'Gouklani H', 'Hassaniazad M']",2022,99,4,Chem Biol Drug Des,"Ahmadi K, et al.

34914050,Techniques for Developing and Assessing Immune Responses Induced by Synthetic DNA Vaccines for Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"Vaccines are one of mankind's greatest medical advances, and their use has drastically reduced and in some cases eliminated (e.g., smallpox) disease and death caused by infectious agents. Traditional vaccine modalities including live-attenuated pathogen vaccines, wholly inactivated pathogen vaccines, and protein-based pathogen subunit vaccines have successfully been used to create efficacious vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and yellow fever. These traditional vaccine modalities, however, take many months to years to develop and have thus proven less effective for use in creating vaccines to emerging or reemerging infectious diseases (EIDs) including influenza, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). As factors such as climate change and increased globalization continue to increase the pace of EID development, newer vaccine modalities are required to develop vaccines that can prevent or attenuate EID outbreaks throughout the world. One such modality, DNA vaccines, has been studied for over 30 years and has numerous qualities that make them ideal for meeting the challenge of EIDs including; (1) DNA vaccine candidates can be designed within hours of publishing of a pathogens genetic sequence; (2) they can be manufactured cheaply and rapidly in large quantities; (3) they are thermostable and have reduced requirement for a cold-chain during distribution, and (4) they have a remarkable safety record in the clinic. Optimizations made in plasmid design as well as in DNA vaccine delivery have greatly improved the immunogenicity of these vaccines. Here we describe the process of making a DNA vaccine to an EID pathogen and describe methods used for assessing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA vaccines in small animal models.","['Xu Z', 'Ho M', 'Bordoloi D', 'Kudchodkar S', 'Khoshnejad M', 'Giron L', 'Zaidi F', 'Jeong M', 'Roberts CC', 'Park YK', 'Maslow J', 'Abdel-Mohsen M', 'Muthumani K']",2022,2410,,Methods Mol Biol,"Xu Z, et al.

34912867,Novel Knowledge-Based Transcriptomic Profiling of Lipid Lysophosphatidylinositol-Induced Endothelial Cell Activation.,"To determine whether pro-inflammatory lipid lysophosphatidylinositols (LPIs) upregulate the expressions of membrane proteins for adhesion/signaling and secretory proteins in human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) activation, we developed an EC biology knowledge-based transcriptomic formula to profile RNA-Seq data panoramically. We made the following primary findings: first, G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), the LPI receptor, is expressed in the endothelium of both human and mouse aortas, and is significantly upregulated in hyperlipidemia; second, LPIs upregulate 43 clusters of differentiation (CD) in HAECs, promoting EC activation, innate immune trans-differentiation, and immune/inflammatory responses; 72.1% of LPI-upregulated CDs are not induced in influenza virus-, MERS-CoV virus- and herpes virus-infected human endothelial cells, which hinted the specificity of LPIs in HAEC activation; third, LPIs upregulate six types of 640 secretomic genes (SGs), namely, 216 canonical SGs, 60 caspase-1-gasdermin D (GSDMD) SGs, 117 caspase-4/11-GSDMD SGs, 40 exosome SGs, 179 Human Protein Atlas (HPA)-cytokines, and 28 HPA-chemokines, which make HAECs a large secretory organ for inflammation/immune responses and other functions; fourth, LPIs activate transcriptomic remodeling by upregulating 172 transcription factors (TFs), namely, pro-inflammatory factors NR4A3, FOS, KLF3, and HIF1A; fifth, LPIs upregulate 152 nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial (mitoCarta) genes, which alter mitochondrial mechanisms and functions, such as mitochondrial organization, respiration, translation, and transport; sixth, LPIs activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanism by upregulating 18 ROS regulators; finally, utilizing the Cytoscape software, we found that three mechanisms, namely, LPI-upregulated TFs, mitoCarta genes, and ROS regulators, are integrated to promote HAEC activation. Our results provide novel insights into aortic EC activation, formulate an EC biology knowledge-based transcriptomic profile strategy, and identify new targets for the development of therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory conditions, immune diseases, organ transplantation, aging, and cancers.","['Xu K', 'Shao Y', 'Saaoud F', 'Gillespie A', 'Drummer C', 'Liu L', 'Lu Y', 'Sun Y', 'Xi H', 'Tükel Ç', 'Pratico D', 'Qin X', 'Sun J', 'Choi ET', 'Jiang X', 'Wang H', 'Yang X']",2021,8,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Xu K, et al.

The aim of the study was to find out relevant reasons and offered suggestions to reduce the risk of infection and check clinical outcomes of the infected healthcare workers.
METHODS: This study was conducted in COVID-19 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory, Bolan Medical Complex Hospital Quetta, Baluchistan from May to June 2020. Eight hundred (n=800) health workers and their families were included in this study. Data were obtained with standardized data collection forms shared by the WHO. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected following the WHO protocols. RNA was extracted and amplified using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and radiological results of the RT-PCR confirmed individuals were also recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Among (n=800) health workers and their families 457 (57.1%) were COVID-19 PCR negative, 332 (41.5%) positive and 11 (1.4%) individuals were PCR positive but asymptomatic carriers, 234 (29.5%) were male and 103 (12.9%) were female. Mortality rate in our study was very low, only three patients (0.87%) died of this COVID-19 pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed increased rate of positive cases with fortunately lower mortality rate, although this novel pneumonia was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

34909795,Comprehensive Serological Profile and Specificity of Maternal and Neonatal Cord Blood SARS CoV-2 Antibodies.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile and specificity of maternal and neonatal cord-blood antibody profile in response SARS-CoV-2 virus exposure.
METHODS: This is a Prospective cohort study of delivering patients at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital from April 2020-February 2021. Primary objective was to describe unique maternal and fetal antibody epitope titers and specificity in those patients with COVID-19 history. Serologic profile assessed with a multiplex platform. Antigens used were: HA-trimer Influenza A (Hong Kong H3), spike trimers for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and betacoronaviruses HKU-1 and OC43, as well as the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (N; full length) for SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: 112 maternal samples and 101 maternal and cord blood pairs were analyzed. Thirty-seven had a known history of COVID-19 (positive PCR test) in the pregnancy and of those, 17 (47%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 30 days of delivery. Fifteen of remaining seventy-six (20%) without a known diagnosis had positive maternal serology. For those with history of COVID-19 we identified robust IgG response in maternal blood to CoV2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) full-length and S (RBD) antigens with more modest responses to the S (NTD) antigen. By contrast, the maternal blood IgM response appeared more specific to S (full-length), than N, S (RBD) or S (NTD) epitopes. There were significantly higher maternal and cord blood IgG response not just to CoV2 spike (p < 10 
CONCLUSIONS: Placental transfer is efficient, with robust N and S responses. Both nucleocapsid and spike antibody responses should be studied for a better understanding of COVID-19 immunity. IgG antibodies are cross reactive with related CoV-1 and MERS spike epitopes while IgM, which cannot cross placenta to provide neonatal passive immunity, is more SARS CoV-2 specific. Neonatal cord blood may have significantly different fine-specificity than maternal blood, despite the high efficiency of IgG transfer.","['Boelig RC', 'Chaudhury S', 'Aghai ZH', 'Oliver E', 'Manusco F', 'Berghella V', 'Bergmann-Leitner E']",2021,,,medRxiv,"Boelig RC, et al.

34904435,High-Throughput Activity Assay for Screening Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 Macrodomain.,"Macrodomains are a class of conserved ADP-ribosylhydrolases expressed by viruses of pandemic concern, including coronaviruses and alphaviruses. Viral macrodomains are critical for replication and virus-induced pathogenesis; therefore, these enzymes are a promising target for antiviral therapy. However, no potent or selective viral macrodomain inhibitors currently exist, in part due to the lack of a high-throughput assay for this class of enzymes. Here we developed a high-throughput ADP-ribosylhydrolase assay using the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain Mac1. We performed a pilot screen that identified dasatinib and dihydralazine as ADP-ribosylhydrolase inhibitors. Importantly, dasatinib inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Mac1 but not the closest human homologue, MacroD2. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying selective inhibitors based on ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity, paving the way for the screening of large compound libraries to identify improved macrodomain inhibitors and to explore their potential as antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and future viral threats.","['Dasovich M', 'Zhuo J', 'Goodman JA', 'Thomas A', 'McPherson RL', 'Jayabalan AK', 'Busa VF', 'Cheng SJ', 'Murphy BA', 'Redinger KR', 'Alhammad YMO', 'Fehr AR', 'Tsukamoto T', 'Slusher BS', 'Bosch J', 'Wei H', 'Leung AKL']",2022,17,1,ACS Chem Biol,"Dasovich M, et al.

34903237,Rapid screening and identification of viral pathogens in metagenomic data.,"BACKGROUND: Virus screening and viral genome reconstruction are urgent and crucial for the rapid identification of viral pathogens, i.e., tracing the source and understanding the pathogenesis when a viral outbreak occurs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an efficient and unbiased way to identify viral pathogens in host-associated and environmental samples without prior knowledge. Despite the availability of software, data analysis still requires human operations. A mature pipeline is urgently needed when thousands of viral pathogen and viral genome reconstruction samples need to be rapidly identified.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present a rapid and accurate workflow to screen metagenomics sequencing data for viral pathogens and other compositions, as well as enable a reference-based assembler to reconstruct viral genomes. Moreover, we tested our workflow on several metagenomics datasets, including a SARS-CoV-2 patient sample with NGS data, pangolins tissues with NGS data, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-infected cells with NGS data, etc. Our workflow demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency when identifying target viruses from large scale NGS metagenomics data. Our workflow was flexible when working with a broad range of NGS datasets from small (kb) to large (100 Gb). This took from a few minutes to a few hours to complete each task. At the same time, our workflow automatically generates reports that incorporate visualized feedback (e.g., metagenomics data quality statistics, host and viral sequence compositions, details about each of the identified viral pathogens and their coverages, and reassembled viral pathogen sequences based on their closest references).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our system enabled the rapid screening and identification of viral pathogens from metagenomics data, providing an important piece to support viral pathogen research during a pandemic. The visualized report contains information from raw sequence quality to a reconstructed viral sequence, which allows non-professional people to screen their samples for viruses by themselves (Additional file 1).","['Song S', 'Ma L', 'Xu X', 'Shi H', 'Li X', 'Liu Y', 'Hao P']",2021,14,Suppl 6,BMC Med Genomics,"Song S, et al.

34900951,Perspectives on Assembling Coronavirus Spikes on Fiber Optics to Reveal Broadly Recognizing Antibodies and Generate a Universal Coronavirus Detector.,"In time of COVID-19 biological detection technologies are of crucial relevance. We propose here the use of state of the art optical fiber biosensors to address two aspects of the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Fiber optic biosensors functionalized with HCoV spikes could be used to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) effective against known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and likely future ones. In turn, identified bnAbs, once immobilized onto fiber optic biosensors, should be capable to detect HCoVs as diagnostic and environmental sensing devices. The therapeutic and preventative value of bnAbs is immense as they can be used for passive immunization and for the educated development of a universal vaccine (active immunization). Hence, HCoV bnAbs represent an extremely important resource for future preparedness against coronavirus-borne pandemics. Furthermore, the assembly of bnAb-based biosensors constitutes an innovative approach to counteract public health threats, as it bears diagnostic competence additional to environmental detection of a range of pandemic strains. This concept can be extended to different pandemic viruses, as well as bio-warfare threats that entail existing, emerging and extinct viruses (e.g., the smallpox-causing ","['Sypabekova M', 'Tosi D', 'Vangelista L']",2021,9,,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,"Sypabekova M, et al.

34896854,Porcine deltacoronavirus infection is inhibited by Griffithsin in cell culture.,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging porcine enteric coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea in piglets and results in serious economic losses. There are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs to prevent and treat PDCoV infection currently. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a lectin with potent antiviral activity against enveloped viruses because of its ability to specifically bind N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides. GRFT has been reported to possess antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Here, we first confirmed the antiviral activity of GRFT against PDCoV in vitro. The infected cells (%) and virus titers were significantly decreased at concentration 1 μg/mL or above of GRFT. Time-course experiments revealed that GRFT inhibits PDCoV infection at the adsorption and penetration step. GRFT binding to PDCoV spike (S) protein on the surface wraps the virus and blocks its entry. The outstanding antiviral potency indicates that GRFT has the potential value as a candidate drug for the prevention and treatment of PDCoV infection.","['Tang R', 'Guo L', 'Fan Q', 'Zhang L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Shi D', 'Wu Y', 'Shi H', 'Liu J', 'Chen J', 'Feng L']",2022,264,,Vet Microbiol,"Tang R, et al.

34893799,Longitudinal Analysis of Memory T-Cell Responses in Survivors of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a zoonotic betacoronavirus. The development of effective vaccines and control measures requires a thorough understanding of the immune response to this viral infection.
METHODS: We investigated cellular immune responses up to 5 years after infection in a cohort of 59 MERS survivors by performing enzyme-linked immunospot assay and intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with synthetic viral peptides.
RESULTS: Memory T-cell responses were detected in 82%, 75%, 69%, 64%, and 64% of MERS survivors from 1-5 years post-infection, respectively. Although the frequency of virus-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-secreting T cells tended to be higher in moderately/severely ill patients than in mildly ill patients during the early period of follow-up, there was no significant difference among the different clinical severity groups across all time points. While both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were involved in memory T-cell responses, CD4+ T cells persisted slightly longer than CD8+ T cells. Both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognized the E/M/N proteins better than the S protein and maintained their polyfunctionality throughout the period examined. Memory T-cell responses correlated positively with antibody responses during the initial 3-4 years but not with maximum viral loads at any time point.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of the dynamics of virus-specific memory T-cell immunity after MERS-coronavirus infection, which is relevant to the development of effective T cell-based vaccines.","['Shin HS', 'Kim Y', 'Kang J', 'Um J', 'Park JS', 'Park WB', 'Kim YS', 'Choi JP', 'Rhee JY', 'Joh JS', 'Cho NH', 'Yang JS', 'Lee JY', 'Lim DG']",2022,75,4,Clin Infect Dis,"Shin HS, et al.

34890159,A Method for Localizing Non-Reference Sequences to the Human Genome.,"As the last decade of human genomics research begins to bear the fruit of advancements in precision medicine, it is important to ensure that genomics' improvements in human health are distributed globally and equitably. An important step to ensuring health equity is to improve the human reference genome to capture global diversity by including a wide variety of alternative haplotypes, sequences that are not currently captured on the reference genome.We present a method that localizes 100 basepair (bp) long sequences extracted from short-read sequencing that can ultimately be used to identify what regions of the human genome non-reference sequences belong to.We extract reads that don't align to the reference genome, and compute the population's distribution of 100-mers found within the unmapped reads. We use genetic data from families to identify shared genetic material between siblings and match the distribution of unmapped k-mers to these inheritance patterns to determine the the most likely genomic region of a k-mer. We perform this localization with two highly interpretable methods of artificial intelligence: a computationally tractable Hidden Markov Model coupled to a Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Using a set of alternative haplotypes with known locations on the genome, we show that our algorithm is able to localize 96% of k-mers with over 90% accuracy and less than 1Mb median resolution. As the collection of sequenced human genomes grows larger and more diverse, we hope that this method can be used to improve the human reference genome, a critical step in addressing precision medicine's diversity crisis.","['Chrisman BS', 'Paskov KM', 'He C', 'Jung JY', 'Stockham N', 'Washington PY', 'Wall DP']",2022,27,,Pac Symp Biocomput,"Chrisman BS, et al.

Notwithstanding the unprecedented accelerated speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, just 9 months after the emergence of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, benefiting from previous developments in SARS and MERS vaccines, significant gaps persist in global vaccine preparedness. These gaps include issues related to immunity and protection, particularly to the limited vaccine protection against recent emergence of concerning new viral variants in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil and the consequent need for vaccine redesign. We examine these gaps and discuss the main issues that could impact on global vaccine availability in the current pandemic scenario: (1) breakthroughs and constraints in development and production of leading global COVID-19 vaccines; (2) innovation and technological development advances and gaps, providing information on global patent assignees for COVID-19, SARS, and MERS vaccine patents; (3) local capacity for development and production of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS vaccines in three emerging agro-based countries (India, Brazil, and South Africa); and (4) future scenarios, examining how these issues and vaccines redesign for new SARS-CoV-2 variants could impact on global access to vaccines and implications for circular bioeconomy and sustainability in the post-COVID era.","['Possas C', 'de Souza Antunes AM', 'de Oliveira AM', 'de Souza Mendes Santos CD', 'Ramos MP', 'de Oliveira Rodrigues Schumacher S', 'Homma A']",2021,1,4,Circ Econ Sustain,"Possas C, et al.

34888566,COVID-19 and Future Disease X in Circular Economy Transition: Redesigning Pandemic Preparedness to Prevent a Global Disaster.,"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a world surprisingly unprepared to respond to the new epidemiological scenario, even the developed countries, in spite of warnings from scientists since the 1990s. These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries' populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate ""spillover"" foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster.","['Possas C', 'Marques ETA', 'Risi JB', 'Homma A']",2021,1,4,Circ Econ Sustain,"Possas C, et al.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mild in most people. However, in some elderly people with co-morbid conditions, it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction leading to death. COVID-19 has caused global panic in the healthcare sector and has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy. Drug discovery researchers are expected to contribute rapidly than ever before. The complete genome sequence of coronavirus had been reported barely a month after the identification of first patient. Potential drug targets to combat and treat the coronavirus infection have also been explored. The iterative structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach could significantly contribute towards the discovery of new drug like molecules for the treatment of COVID-19. The existing antivirals and experiences gained from SARS and MERS outbreaks may pave way for identification of potential drug molecules using the approach. SBDD has gained momentum as the essential tool for faster and costeffective lead discovery of antivirals in the past. The discovery of FDA approved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) inhibitors represent the foremost success of SBDD.

34849595,KCOSS: an ultra-fast k-mer counter for assembled genome analysis.,"MOTIVATION: The k-mer frequency in whole genome sequences provides researchers with an insightful perspective on genomic complexity, comparative genomics, metagenomics and phylogeny. The current k-mer counting tools are typically slow, and they require large memory and hard disk for assembled genome analysis.
RESULTS: We propose a novel and ultra-fast k-mer counting algorithm, KCOSS, to fulfill k-mer counting mainly for assembled genomes with segmented Bloom filter, lock-free queue, lock-free thread pool and cuckoo hash table. We optimize running time and memory consumption by recycling memory blocks, merging multiple consecutive first-occurrence k-mers into C-read, and writing a set of C-reads to disk asynchronously. KCOSS was comparatively tested with Jellyfish2, CHTKC and KMC3 on seven assembled genomes and three sequencing datasets in running time, memory consumption, and hard disk occupation. The experimental results show that KCOSS counts k-mer with less memory and disk while having a shorter running time on assembled genomes. KCOSS can be used to calculate the k-mer frequency not only for assembled genomes but also for sequencing data.
AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The KCOSS software is implemented in C++. It is freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/kcoss-2021/KCOSS.

34849572,iProbiotics: a machine learning platform for rapid identification of probiotic properties from whole-genome primary sequences.,"Lactic acid bacteria consortia are commonly present in food, and some of these bacteria possess probiotic properties. However, discovery and experimental validation of probiotics require extensive time and effort. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop effective screening methods for identifying probiotics. Advances in sequencing technology have generated massive genomic data, enabling us to create a machine learning-based platform for such purpose in this work. This study first selected a comprehensive probiotics genome dataset from the probiotic database (PROBIO) and literature surveys. Then, k-mer (from 2 to 8) compositional analysis was performed, revealing diverse oligonucleotide composition in strain genomes and apparently more probiotic (P-) features in probiotic genomes than non-probiotic genomes. To reduce noise and improve computational efficiency, 87 376 k-mers were refined by an incremental feature selection (IFS) method, and the model achieved the maximum accuracy level at 184 core features, with a high prediction accuracy (97.77%) and area under the curve (98.00%). Functional genomic analysis using annotations from gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) databases, as well as analysis of genes associated with host gastrointestinal survival/settlement, carbohydrate utilization, drug resistance and virulence factors, revealed that the distribution of P-features was biased toward genes/pathways related to probiotic function. Our results suggest that the role of probiotics is not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of k-mer genomic components, providing new insights into the identification and underlying mechanisms of probiotics. This work created a novel and free online bioinformatic tool, iProbiotics, which would facilitate rapid screening for probiotics.","['Sun Y', 'Li H', 'Zheng L', 'Li J', 'Hong Y', 'Liang P', 'Kwok LY', 'Zuo Y', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang H']",2022,23,1,Brief Bioinform,"Sun Y, et al. iProbiotics: a machine learning platform for rapid identification of probiotic properties from whole-genome primary sequences. iProbiotics: a machine learning platform for rapid identification of probiotic properties from whole-genome primary sequences. 2022; 23:(unknown pages). doi: 10.1093/bib/bbab477",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34849572/

34845015,Structure-function analysis of the nsp14 N7-guanine methyltransferase reveals an essential role in Betacoronavirus replication.,"As coronaviruses (CoVs) replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, they rely on their own capping machinery to ensure the efficient translation of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs), protect them from degradation by cellular 5' exoribonucleases (ExoNs), and escape innate immune sensing. The CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bifunctional replicase subunit harboring an N-terminal 3'-to-5' ExoN domain and a C-terminal (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain that is presumably involved in viral mRNA capping. Here, we aimed to integrate structural, biochemical, and virological data to assess the importance of conserved N7-MTase residues for nsp14's enzymatic activities and virus viability. We revisited the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp14 to perform an in silico comparative analysis between betacoronaviruses. We identified several residues likely involved in the formation of the N7-MTase catalytic pocket, which presents a fold distinct from the Rossmann fold observed in most known MTases. Next, for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues was used to assess their importance for in vitro enzymatic activity. Most of the engineered mutations abolished N7-MTase activity, while not affecting nsp14-ExoN activity. Upon reverse engineering of these mutations into different betacoronavirus genomes, we identified two substitutions (R310A and F426A in SARS-CoV nsp14) abrogating virus viability and one mutation (H424A) yielding a crippled phenotype across all viruses tested. Our results identify the N7-MTase as a critical enzyme for betacoronavirus replication and define key residues of its catalytic pocket that can be targeted to design inhibitors with a potential pan-coronaviral activity spectrum.","['Ogando NS', 'El Kazzi P', 'Zevenhoven-Dobbe JC', 'Bontes BW', 'Decombe A', 'Posthuma CC', 'Thiel V', 'Canard B', 'Ferron F', 'Decroly E', 'Snijder EJ']",2021,118,49,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Ogando NS, et al.

Remediation effect, as well as energy consumption and risk evaluation of the two strategies under different current density conditions of electroplating-contaminated soil suspension were performed, the following conclusions were drawn. MERs based on both the anode and cathode processes exhibited a synergetic effect because the DC electric field and extractants dissolved more metals from the soil phase into the liquid phase of the suspension compared to a usual soil washing treatment. The maximum Cr, Cu, and Ni removal efficiencies of MERs based on the anode process were 79.5%, 86.2%, and 85.0%, respectively, compared to 27.5%, 72.5%, and 65.9% based on the cathode process. Risk assessment results showed lower soil environmental risk after MER based on the cathode process than after MER based on the anode process. In this study, MER based on the cathode process as an evolving soil remediation strategy was found to present high simultaneous remediation ability for soil heavy metals and leaching materials, showing its advantages of environmental friendliness and economic effectiveness.","['Song Y', 'Gao S', 'Yuan X', 'Sun R', 'Wang R']",2022,423,Pt B,J Hazard Mater,"Song Y, et al.

34843462,COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy among health care workers: A cross-sectional survey from a MERS-CoV experienced nation.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine perception, acceptance, confidence, hesitancy, and barriers among health care workers (HCWs).
METHODS: An online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCWs in Saudi Arabia, which is a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The factors associated with vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis, and the level of anxiety was measured using a validated instrument to measure general anxiety levels.
RESULTS: Out of the 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire-of which 62.4% were women-70% were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa = 1.551, 95% CI: 1.122-2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa = 2.151; 95% CI: 1.708-2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa = 1.539; 95% CI: 1.259-1.881), and HCWs who rely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.125-2.013) were significantly associated with reporting a willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed that the vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa = 0.394, 95% CI: 0.298-0.522).
CONCLUSION: Most HCWs are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once they are available; the satisfactoriness of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs is crucial because health professionals' knowledge and confidence toward vaccines are important determining factors for not only their own vaccine acceptance but also recommendation for such vaccines to their patients.","['Barry M', 'Temsah MH', 'Alhuzaimi A', 'Alamro N', 'Al-Eyadhy A', 'Aljamaan F', 'Saddik B', 'Alhaboob A', 'Alsohime F', 'Alhasan K', 'Alrabiaah A', 'Alaraj A', 'Halwani R', 'Jamal A', 'Alsubaie S', 'Al-Shahrani FS', 'Memish ZA', 'Al-Tawfiq JA']",2021,16,11,PLoS One,"Barry M, et al.

34840405,An overview of solutions for airborne viral transmission reduction related to HVAC systems including liquid desiccant air-scrubbing.,"The spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects the health of people and the economy worldwide. As air transmits the virus, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings, enclosed spaces and public transport play a significant role in limiting the transmission of airborne pathogens at the expenses of increased energy consumption and possibly reduced thermal comfort. On the other hand, liquid desiccant technology could be adopted as an air scrubber to increase indoor air quality and inactivate pathogens through temperature and humidity control, making them less favourable to the growth, proliferation and infectivity of microorganisms. The objectives of this study are to review the role of HVAC in airborne viral transmission, estimate its energy penalty associated with the adoption of HVAC for transmission reduction and understand the potential of liquid desiccant technology. Factors affecting the inactivation of pathogens by liquid desiccant solutions and possible modifications to increase their heat and mass transfer and sanitising characteristics are also described, followed by an economic evaluation. It is concluded that the liquid desiccant technology could be beneficial in buildings (requiring humidity control or moisture removal in particular when viruses are likely to present) or in high-footfall enclosed spaces (during virus outbreaks).","['Giampieri A', 'Ma Z', 'Ling-Chin J', 'Roskilly AP', 'Smallbone AJ']",2022,244,,Energy (Oxf),"Giampieri A, et al.

34835131,Cross-Reactive Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in Pre-COVID-19 Blood Samples from Sierra Leoneans.,"Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced lower COVID-19 caseloads and fewer deaths than countries in other regions worldwide. Under-reporting of cases and a younger population could partly account for these differences, but pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses is another potential factor. Blood samples from Sierra Leonean Lassa fever and Ebola survivors and their contacts collected before the first reported COVID-19 cases were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies binding to proteins of coronaviruses that infect humans. Results were compared to COVID-19 subjects and healthy blood donors from the United States. Prior to the pandemic, Sierra Leoneans had more frequent exposures than Americans to coronaviruses with epitopes that cross-react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The percentage of Sierra Leoneans with antibodies reacting to seasonal coronaviruses was also higher than for American blood donors. Serological responses to coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans did not differ by age or sex. Approximately a quarter of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about a third neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Prior exposures to coronaviruses that induce cross-protective immunity may contribute to reduced COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sierra Leone.","['Borrega R', 'Nelson DKS', 'Koval AP', 'Bond NG', 'Heinrich ML', 'Rowland MM', 'Lathigra R', 'Bush DJ', 'Aimukanova I', 'Phinney WN', 'Koval SA', 'Hoffmann AR', 'Smither AR', 'Bell-Kareem AR', 'Melnik LI', 'Genemaras KJ', 'Chao K', 'Snarski P', 'Melton AB', 'Harrell JE', 'Smira AA', 'Elliott DH', 'Rouelle JA', 'Sabino-Santos G', 'Drouin AC', 'Momoh M', 'Sandi JD', 'Goba A', 'Samuels RJ', 'Kanneh L', 'Gbakie M', 'Branco ZL', 'Shaffer JG', 'Schieffelin JS', 'Robinson JE', 'Fusco DN', 'Sabeti PC', 'Andersen KG', 'Grant DS', 'Boisen ML', 'Branco LM', 'Garry RF']",2021,13,11,Viruses,"Borrega R, et al.

34834309,Nanotechnology Applications of Flavonoids for Viral Diseases.,"Recent years have witnessed the emergence of several viral diseases, including various zoonotic diseases such as the current pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Other viruses, which possess pandemic-causing potential include avian flu, Ebola, dengue, Zika, and Nipah virus, as well as the re-emergence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronaviruses. Notably, effective drugs or vaccines against these viruses are still to be discovered. All the newly approved vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2-induced disease COVID-19 possess real-time possibility of becoming obsolete because of the development of 'variants of concern'. Flavonoids are being increasingly recognized as prophylactic and therapeutic agents against emerging and old viral diseases. Around 10,000 natural flavonoid compounds have been identified, being phytochemicals, all plant-based. Flavonoids have been reported to have lesser side effects than conventional anti-viral agents and are effective against more viral diseases than currently used anti-virals. Despite their abundance in plants, which are a part of human diet, flavonoids have the problem of low bioavailability. Various attempts are in progress to increase the bioavailability of flavonoids, one of the promising fields being nanotechnology. This review is a narrative of some anti-viral dietary flavonoids, their bioavailability, and various means with an emphasis on the nanotechnology system(s) being experimented with to deliver anti-viral flavonoids, whose systems show potential in the efficient delivery of flavonoids, resulting in increased bioavailability.","['Jannat K', 'Paul AK', 'Bondhon TA', 'Hasan A', 'Nawaz M', 'Jahan R', 'Mahboob T', 'Nissapatorn V', 'Wilairatana P', 'Pereira ML', 'Rahmatullah M']",2021,13,11,Pharmaceutics,"Jannat K, et al.

34833011,A Max-Margin Model for Predicting Residue-Base Contacts in Protein-RNA Interactions.,"Protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are essential for many biological processes, so understanding aspects of the sequences and structures involved in PRIs is important for unraveling such processes. Because of the expensive and time-consuming techniques required for experimental determination of complex protein-RNA structures, various computational methods have been developed to predict PRIs. However, most of these methods focus on predicting only RNA-binding regions in proteins or only protein-binding motifs in RNA. Methods for predicting entire residue-base contacts in PRIs have not yet achieved sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, some of these methods require the identification of 3D structures or homologous sequences, which are not available for all protein and RNA sequences. Here, we propose a prediction method for predicting residue-base contacts between proteins and RNAs using only sequence information and structural information predicted from sequences. The method can be applied to any protein-RNA pair, even when rich information such as its 3D structure, is not available. In this method, residue-base contact prediction is formalized as an integer programming problem. We predict a residue-base contact map that maximizes a scoring function based on sequence-based features such as ","['Kashiwagi S', 'Sato K', 'Sakakibara Y']",2021,11,11,Life (Basel),"Kashiwagi S, et al.

34822314,A medical escape room to build intern workplace social capital in an internal medicine residency program.,"PURPOSE: Trainee well-being is a growing focus in graduate medical education. One emerging area in occupational literature is the psychosocial environment of the workplace, of which a large component is workplace social capital (WSC). WSC encompasses how well a group connects to one another. Medical escape rooms (MERs) recently have been studied in various healthcare settings and are one proposed intervention to increase WSC.
METHODS: This is a single-center before-and-after survey study at the Loyola University Medical Center in 2021 to measure the effect of a MER on WSC amongst interns. Our Chief Resident created a 1-hour MER. WSC scores were measured using a modified version of a validated WSC scale. Scores were analyzed with paired t-test analysis and chi-square analysis. Open-ended feedback was also collected.
RESULTS: Of 52 eligible intern residents, 51 (98%) participated in the MER, and 41 (80%) completed the pre- and post-activity survey. All six survey statements had a greater percentage of positive responses following the MER. The average score across all participants and questions was 4.66 out of 5 on the pre-survey, and 4.90 on the post-survey (

34822046,Some Factors Influencing Calling Behavior and Mass Emission Rate of Sex Pheromone from the Gland of the Moth Chloridea virescens.,"To attract a mate, females of most moth species synthesize and emit sex pheromone from a specific gland in a behavior termed ""calling"". In a broad temporal sense, calling behavior and pheromone synthesis are synchronized through the overlap of their circadian rhythms. However, the limited amount of pheromone a female produces each day must be managed so that pheromone is emitted at a sufficient (to attract males) mass emission rate (MER) over the entire calling period, typically many hours. We are studying pheromone synthesis and emission in the moth Chloridea (formerly Heliothis) virescens (family Noctuidae). One way that female C. virescens manage pheromone over their calling period is by calling intermittently; the period between calling bouts allows females to replenish pheromone, and resume calling at high MERs. However, militating against replenishment is loss of pheromone through putative catabolism. In this paper, we examined three aspects pertaining to pheromone MER in C. virescens: (i) the effect of adult feeding on calling behavior, (ii) the effect of certain behavioral/physical parameters on MER, and (iii) the relative loss (putative catabolism) of pheromone in retracted (non-calling) and everted (calling) glands. We found that (i) adult feeding increases calling duration, consistent with the known concomitant increase in pheromone production, (ii) various physical factors relating to the gland, including degree of eversion (surface area), orientation to airstream, and air velocity over the gland influence MER, and (iii) putative catabolism occurs in both retracted and everted glands, but substantially less pheromone is lost in the everted gland primarily because of the high MER when the gland is first everted. Together, these data demonstrate that, over the calling period, the efficient use of pheromone for emission by female C. virescens is dependent on the interaction among synthesis, storage, catabolism, and calling behavior.","['Foster SP', 'Anderson KG']",2022,48,2,J Chem Ecol,Foster SP and Anderson KG.

34820236,Evolutionary Perspective and Theories on the Possible Origin of SARS-CoV-2.,"OBJECTIVE: From the currently available next-generation sequencing data, we have tried to analyze different theories on the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and thereby to identify the origin of its intermediate host. Genome sequence-based phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment were performed.
METHODS: We used the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) platform for phylogenetic analysis and the MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log- Expectation (MUSCLE) algorithm for whole genome sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), BJ01, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), bat coronavirus RaTG13, and pangolin coronavirus.
RESULTS: From these two analyses, we have found that RaTG13 is the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 and not the pangolin coronavirus in spite of having sequence homology-based similarity in the genes. Comparing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and interacting spike (S) protein that interacts directly with the host human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the bat coronavirus RaTG13 was found to be the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2. Through multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences, we found the furin-like cleavage site RRARS only in SARS-CoV-2 at the junction of the two subunits S1/S2 of the spike protein.
CONCLUSIONS: The possible zoonotic transfer that has happened in SARS-CoV-2 seems to not be from the pangolin, but RaTG13 remains closest relative to SARS-CoV-2. Further studies, such as systematic reviews of the literature and meta-analyses, are needed to reach a conclusion regarding the evolutionary trajectory of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.",['Saeed AA'],2021,13,10,Cureus,Saeed AA.

34816260,Microglia do not restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication following infection of the central nervous system of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice.,"UNLABELLED: Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, infection with SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen responsible for COVID-19, is often associated with neurologic symptoms that range from mild to severe, yet increasing evidence argues the virus does not exhibit extensive neuroinvasive properties. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human iPSC-derived neurons and that infection shows limited anti-viral and inflammatory responses but increased activation of EIF2 signaling following infection as determined by RNA sequencing. Intranasal infection of K18 human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in lung pathology associated with viral replication and immune cell infiltration. In addition, ∼50% of infected mice exhibited CNS infection characterized by wide-spread viral replication in neurons accompanied by increased expression of chemokine ( 
IMPORTANCE: Understanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to both host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS is of critical importance given the increasing number of viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating within the nervous system. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of microglia in aiding in host defense following experimental infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of K18-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms that range in severity are common in COVID-19 patients and understanding immune responses that contribute to restricting neurologic disease can provide important insight into better understanding consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS.","['Olivarria GM', 'Cheng Y', 'Furman S', 'Pachow C', 'Hohsfield LA', 'Smith-Geater C', 'Miramontes R', 'Wu J', 'Burns MS', 'Tsourmas KI', 'Stocksdale J', 'Manlapaz C', 'Yong WH', 'Teijaro J', 'Edwards R', 'Green KN', 'Thompson LM', 'Lane TE']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Olivarria GM, et al.

34816207,Sensitive to Infection but Strong in Defense-Female Sex and the Power of Oestradiol in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The incidence of SARS-CoV2 infections is around 15% higher in premenopausal women compared to age matched men, yet the fatality rate from COVID-19 is significantly higher in men than women for all age strata. Sex differences have also been observed in recent epidemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with SARS-CoV 2 virus infection sex differences appear more dramatic. The regulation and expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the key for this special coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. 17β-oestradiol increases expression level and activity of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the alternative signaling pathway of Ang II via the angiotensin II receptor type II (AT2R) and the Mas receptor is more dominant in female sex than in male sex. Maybe a hint to explain the higher infection risk in women. The same hormonal milieu plays a major role in protecting women where morbidity and mortality are concerned, since the dominant female hormone, oestradiol, has immune-modulatory properties that are likely to be protective against virus infections. It is also known that the X chromosome contains the largest number of immune-related genes, potentially conferring an advantage to women in efficient immune responsiveness. Lifestyle factors are also likely to be contributory. Premenopausal women could possibly face higher exposure to infection (hence higher infection rates) because economic conditions are often less favorable for them with less opportunity for home office work because of jobs requiring mandatory attendance. Due to the additional task of childcare, it is likely that contact times with other people will be longer. Women generally make healthier lifestyle choices, thus reducing the disease burden that confers high risk of mortality in COVID-19 infected men. This narrative review aims to present key concepts and knowledge gaps on the effects of oestrogen associated with SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 disease.","['Newson L', 'Manyonda I', 'Lewis R', 'Preissner R', 'Preissner S', 'Seeland U']",2021,2,,Front Glob Womens Health,"Newson L, et al.

We trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp, and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural, and immunologic features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","['Park JJ', 'Chen S']",2022,3,2,Patterns (N Y),Park JJ and Chen S.

To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11- to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2- to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques and humans, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.","['Grobben M', 'van der Straten K', 'Brouwer PJ', 'Brinkkemper M', 'Maisonnasse P', 'Dereuddre-Bosquet N', 'Appelman B', 'Lavell AA', 'van Vught LA', 'Burger JA', 'Poniman M', 'Oomen M', 'Eggink D', 'Bijl TP', 'van Willigen HD', 'Wynberg E', 'Verkaik BJ', 'Figaroa OJ', 'de Vries PJ', 'Boertien TM', 'Amsterdam UMC COVID-19 S3/HCW study group', 'Bomers MK', 'Sikkens JJ', 'Le Grand R', 'de Jong MD', 'Prins M', 'Chung AW', 'de Bree GJ', 'Sanders RW', 'van Gils MJ']",2021,10,,Elife,"Grobben M, et al.

We report on the environmental stability, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of MERS-CoV, as well as isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. Although most MERS-CoV isolates had similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the camel-derived isolate C/KSA/13 had reduced surface stability, and another camel isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model.

34807954,TMPRSS2 promotes SARS-CoV-2 evasion from NCOA7-mediated restriction.,"Interferons play a critical role in regulating host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, but the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized. The IFN-inducible short isoform of human nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) inhibits endocytic virus entry, interacts with the vacuolar ATPase, and promotes endo-lysosomal vesicle acidification and lysosomal protease activity. Here, we used ectopic expression and gene knockout to demonstrate that NCOA7 inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as by lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike in lung epithelial cells. Infection with the highly pathogenic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, or seasonal, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped viruses was also inhibited by NCOA7. Importantly, either overexpression of TMPRSS2, which promotes plasma membrane fusion versus endosomal fusion of SARS-CoV-2, or removal of Spike's polybasic furin cleavage site rendered SARS-CoV-2 less sensitive to NCOA7 restriction. Collectively, our data indicate that furin cleavage sensitizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike to the antiviral consequences of endosomal acidification by NCOA7, and suggest that the acquisition of furin cleavage may have favoured the co-option of cell surface TMPRSS proteases as a strategy to evade the suppressive effects of IFN-induced endo-lysosomal dysregulation on virus infection.","['Khan H', 'Winstone H', 'Jimenez-Guardeño JM', 'Graham C', 'Doores KJ', 'Goujon C', 'Matthews DA', 'Davidson AD', 'Rihn SJ', 'Palmarini M', 'Neil SJD', 'Malim MH']",2021,17,11,PLoS Pathog,"Khan H, et al.

We aim to assess the severity and duration of anorexia and weight loss within the infection and recovery period in these patients.
METHOD: We retrospectively identified 233 COVID-19 patients (older than 18 years) were admitted to the Rasoul-e Akram Hospital, from August to December 2020. Their medical records were reviewed by researchers. Then, patients who had inclusion criteria were asked about duration and severity of anorexia, and also weight alternation during the infection and after the recovery period.
RESULT: Analyzed data were collected from 233 COVID-19 patients showed the mean duration of anorexia was 7.08 ± 10.41 days with a significant loss of appetite (- 75.55 ± 88.09, P-value < 0.001) at the period of anorexia compare to appetite improvement. Also, results demonstrated patients, especially males and severe illness subjects, significantly lost weight (P-value <0.001).Conclusion: anorexia and weight loss occur in people infected with the coronavirus and may affect the recovery process of these patients by reducing their food intake.

Information on MERS-CoV has relied on small sample of patients. We updated the epidemiology, laboratory and clinical characteristics, and survival patterns of MERS-CoV retrospectively with the largest sample of followed patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of line-listed records of non-random, continuously admitted patients who were suspected (6,873) or confirmed with MERS-CoV (501) admitted to one of the four MERS-CoV referral hospitals in Saudi Arabia, 2014-2019.
FINDINGS: Of the 6,873 MERS-CoV suspected persons, the majority were male (56%) and Saudi nationals (83%) and 95% had no known history that increased their risk of exposure to MERS-CoV patients or vectors (95%). More confirmed cases reported history that increased their risk of MERS-CoV infection (41%). Among the suspected, MERS-CoV confirmation (7.4% overall) was independently associated with being male, known transmission link to MERS-CoV patients or vectors, fever, symptoms for 7 days, admission through intensive care unit, and diabetes. Among persons with confirmed MERS-CoV, single symptoms were reported by 20%, 3-symptom combinations (fever, cough and dyspnea) reported by 21% and 2-symptom combinations (fever, cough) reported by 16%. Of the two-thirds (62%) of MERS-CoV confirmed patients who presented with co-morbidity, 32% had 2-""comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension). More than half of the MERS-CoV patents showed abnormal chest X-ray, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase. About a quarter of MERS-CoV patients had positive cultures on blood, urine, or respiratory secretions. During an average hospital stay of 18 days (range 11 to 30), 64% developed complications involving liver, lungs, or kidneys. Ventilation requirement (29% of MERS-CoV cases) was independently associated with abnormal chest X-ray, viremia (Ct value <30), elevated creatinine, and prothrombin time. Death (21% overall) was independently associated with older age, dyspnea and abnormal chest X-ray on admission, and low hemoglobulin levels.
INTERPRETATIONS: With two-thirds of the symptomatic persons developing multiorgan complications MERS-CoV remains the coronavirus with the highest severity (29%) and case fatality rate (21%) among the three lethal coronaviruses. Metabolic abnormalities appear to be an independent risk factor for sustained MERS-CoV transmission. The poorly understood transmission dynamics and non-specific clinical and laboratory features call for high index of suspicion among respiratory disease experts to help early detection of outbreaks. We reiterate the need for case control studies on transmission.

34805226,Impaired Dendritic Cell Homing in COVID-19.,"The high mortality of COVID-19 is mostly attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whose histopathological correlate is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Furthermore, severe COVID-19 is often accompanied by a cytokine storm and a disrupted response of the adaptive immune system. Studies aiming to depict this dysregulation have mostly investigated the peripheral cell count as well as the functionality of immune cells. We investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on antigen-presenting cells using multiplexed immunofluorescence. Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be impairing the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). DC maturation involves a switch in surface antigen expression, which enables the cells' homing to lymph nodes and the subsequent activation of T-cells. As quantitative descriptions of the local inflammatory infiltrate are still scarce, we compared the cell population of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the lungs of COVID-19 autopsy cases in different stages of DAD. We found an increased count of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in later stages. Interestingly, mDCs also showed no significant upregulation of maturation markers in DAD-specimens with high viral load. Accumulation of immature mDCs, which are unable to home to lymph nodes, ultimately results in an inadequate T-cell response.","['Borcherding L', 'Teksen AS', 'Grosser B', 'Schaller T', 'Hirschbühl K', 'Claus R', 'Spring O', 'Wittmann M', 'Römmele C', 'Sipos É', 'Märkl B']",2021,8,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Borcherding L, et al.

Among the study cohort, 38 patients (95%) received invasive ventilation, 35 (88%) vasopressors, 21 (53%) renal replacement therapy and 17 (43%) corticosteroids. Median (Q1,Q3) ELISA optical density (OD) ratio significantly increased with time (p < 0.001) from 0.11 (0.07, 1.43) on day 1; to 0.69 (0.11, 2.08) on day 3, 2.72 (1.84, 3.54) on day 7, 2.51 (0.35, 3.35) on day 14 and 3.77 (3.70, 3.84) on day 28. Early antibody response (day 1-3) was observed in 13/39 patients (33%) and was associated with lower mortality (hazard ratio: 0.31, 95% CI 0.10, 0.96, p = 0.04) but was not associated with faster clearance of MERS-CoV RNA. In conclusion, among critically ill patients with MERS, early antibody response was associated with lower mortality but not with faster clearance of MERS-CoV RNA. These findings have important implications for understanding pathogenesis and potential immunotherapy.","['Arabi YM', 'Hajeer AH', 'Balkhy H', 'Al Johani S', 'Sadat M', 'Al-Dawood A', 'Abu Taleb A', 'Jose J', 'Al Qasim E', 'Al Ajlan A']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Arabi YM, et al.

34797527,Posttreatment Strategy Against Hypoxia and Ischemia Based on Selective Targeting of Nonnuclear Estrogen Receptors with PaPE-1.,"Newly synthesized Pathway Preferential Estrogen-1 (PaPE-1) selectively activates membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), namely, mERα and mERβ, and has been shown to evoke neuroprotection; however, its effectiveness in protecting brain tissue against hypoxia and ischemia has not been verified in a posttreatment paradigm. This is the first study showing that a 6-h delayed posttreatment with PaPE-1 inhibited hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal death, as indicated by neutral red uptake in mouse primary cell cultures in vitro. The effect was accompanied by substantial decreases in neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in terms of LDH release and Fluoro-Jade C staining of damaged cells, respectively. The mechanisms of the neuroprotective action of PaPE-1 also involved apoptosis inhibition demonstrated by normalization of both mitochondrial membrane potential and expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and proteins such as Fas, Fasl, Bcl2, FAS, FASL, BCL2, BAX, and GSK3β. Furthermore, PaPE-1-evoked neuroprotection was mediated through a reduction in ROS formation and restoration of cellular metabolic activity that had become dysregulated due to hypoxia and ischemia. These data provide evidence that targeting membrane non-GPER estrogen receptors with PaPE-1 is an effective therapy that protects brain neurons from hypoxic/ischemic damage, even when applied with a 6-h delay from injury onset.","['Wnuk A', 'Przepiórska K', 'Pietrzak BA', 'Kajta M']",2021,39,6,Neurotox Res,"Wnuk A, et al.

Here, we report fabricated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) complex coupled with in-house developed SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 antibody (SARS-CoV-2 Ab) to measure the response with Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). The biophysical characterisation of FTO/AuNPs/SARS-CoV-2Ab was done via UV-Visible spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The fabricated FTO/AuNPs/SARS-CoV-2Ab immunosensor was optimised for response time, antibody concentration, temperature, and pH. Under optimum conditions, the FTO/AuNPs/Ab based immunosensor displayed high sensitivity with limit of detection (LOD) up to 0.63 fM in standard buffer and 120 fM in spiked saliva samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 antigen (Ag) with negligible cross reactivity Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spike protein.

The sea of scientific literature published over a short time-span to understand and mitigate this global phenomenon necessitates concerted efforts to organize our findings and focus on the unexplored facets of the disease. In this work, we applied natural language processing (NLP) based approaches on scientific literature published on COVID-19 to infer significant keywords that have contributed to our social, economic, demographic, psychological, epidemiological, clinical, and medical understanding of this pandemic. We identify key terms appearing in COVID literature that vary in representation when compared to other virus-borne diseases such as MERS, Ebola, and Influenza. We also identify countries, topics, and research articles that demonstrate that the scientific community is still reacting to the short-term threats such as transmissibility, health risks, treatment plans, and public policies, underpinning the need for collective international efforts towards long-term immunization and drug-related challenges. Furthermore, our study highlights several long-term research directions that are urgently needed for COVID-19 such as: global collaboration to create international open-access data repositories, policymaking to curb future outbreaks, psychological repercussions of COVID-19, vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 variants and their long-term efficacy studies, and mental health issues in both children and elderly.","['Bose P', 'Roy S', 'Ghosh P']",2021,9,,IEEE Access,"Bose P, et al.

Their specificity was confirmed by traditional PCR. Two of these sex-specific sequences were also validated as female-specific in other eight sturgeon species and two hybrid sturgeons. The identified female-specific DNA fragments suggest that the family Acipenseridae has a ZZ/ZW sex-determining system. However, one of the two DNA sequences has been deleted in some sturgeons such as Sterlet sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus), Beluga (Huso huso) and Kaluga (H. dauricus). The difference of sex-specific sequences among sturgeons indicates that there are different sex-specific regions among species of sturgeon. This study not only provided the sex-specific DNA sequences for management, conservation and studies of sex-determination mechanisms in sturgeons, but also confirmed the capability of the workflow to identify sex-specific DNA sequences in the polyploid species with complex genomes.","['Ruan R', 'Feng T', 'Li Y', 'Yue H', 'Ye H', 'Du H', 'Liu Q', 'Ruan J', 'Li C', 'Wei Q']",2021,113,6,Genomics,"Ruan R, et al.

34784198,Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of Recognition of Human Interferon-Stimulated Gene Product 15 by Coronavirus Papain-Like Proteases: A Multiscale Simulation Study.,"The papain-like protease (PLpro) of the coronavirus (CoV) family plays an essential role in processing the viral polyprotein and immune evasion. Additional proteolytic activities of PLpro include deubiquitination and deISGylation, which can reverse the post-translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with ubiquitin or (Ub) or Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). These activities regulate innate immune responses against viral infection. Thus, PLpro is a potential antiviral target. Here, we have described the structural and energetic basis of recognition of PLpro by the human ISG15 protein (hISG15) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation across the CoV family, i.e., MERS-CoV (MCoV), SARS-CoV (SCoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2). The cumulative simulation length for all trajectories was 32.0 μs. In the absence of the complete crystal structure of complexes, protein-protein docking was used. A mutation (R167E) was introduced across all three PLpro to study the effect of mutation on the protein-protein binding. Our study reveals that the apo-ISG15 protein remains closed while it adopts an open conformation when bound to PLpro, although the degree of openness varies across the CoV family. The binding free energy analysis suggests that hISG15 binds more strongly with SCoV2-PLpro compared to SCoV or MCoV. The intermolecular electrostatic interaction drives the hISG15-PLpro complexation. Our study showed that SCoV or MCoV-PLpro binds more strongly with the C-domain of hISG15, while SCoV2-PLpro binds more favorably the N-domain of hISG15. Overall, our study explains the molecular basis of differential deISGylating activities of PLpro among the CoV family and the specificity of SCoV2-PLpro toward hISG15.","['Roy R', 'Jonniya NA', 'Poddar S', 'Sk MF', 'Kar P']",2021,61,12,J Chem Inf Model,"Roy R, et al.

34780468,Estimating repeat spectra and genome length from low-coverage genome skims with RESPECT.,"The cost of sequencing the genome is dropping at a much faster rate compared to assembling and finishing the genome. The use of lightly sampled genomes (genome-skims) could be transformative for genomic ecology, and results using k-mers have shown the advantage of this approach in identification and phylogenetic placement of eukaryotic species. Here, we revisit the basic question of estimating genomic parameters such as genome length, coverage, and repeat structure, focusing specifically on estimating the k-mer repeat spectrum. We show using a mix of theoretical and empirical analysis that there are fundamental limitations to estimating the k-mer spectra due to ill-conditioned systems, and that has implications for other genomic parameters. We get around this problem using a novel constrained optimization approach (Spline Linear Programming), where the constraints are learned empirically. On reads simulated at 1X coverage from 66 genomes, our method, REPeat SPECTra Estimation (RESPECT), had 2.2% error in length estimation compared to 27% error previously achieved. In shotgun sequenced read samples with contaminants, RESPECT length estimates had median error 4%, in contrast to other methods that had median error 80%. Together, the results suggest that low-pass genomic sequencing can yield reliable estimates of the length and repeat content of the genome.

34778573,Penta-peptide ATN-161 based neutralization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"SARS-CoV-2 has become a big challenge for the scientific community worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cell by the spike protein binding with an ACE2 receptor present on the host cell. Developing safe and effective inhibitor appears an urgent need to interrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptor in order to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have examined the penta-peptide ATN-161 as potential inhibitor of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, where ATN-161 has been commercially approved for the safety and possess high affinity and specificity towards the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We carried out experiments and confirmed these phenomena that the virus bindings were indeed minimized. ATN-161 peptide can be used as an inhibitor of protein-protein interaction (PPI) stands as a crucial interaction in biological systems. The molecular docking finding suggests that the binding energy of the ACE2-spike protein complex is reduced in the presence of ATN-161. Protein-protein docking binding energy (-40.50 kcal/mol) of the spike glycoprotein toward the human ACE2 and binding of ATN-161 at their binding interface reduced the biding energy (-26.25 kcal/mol). The finding of this study suggests that ATN-161 peptide can mask the RBD of the spike protein and be considered as a neutralizing candidate by binding with the ACE2 receptor. Peptide-based masking of spike S1 protein (RBD) and its neutralization is a highly promising strategy to prevent virus penetration into the host cell. Thus masking of the RBD leads to the loss of receptor recognition property which can reduce the chance of infection host cells.","['Rabbani G', 'Ahn SN', 'Kwon H', 'Ahmad K', 'Choi I']",2021,28,,Biochem Biophys Rep,"Rabbani G, et al.

34777794,False-positive HIV in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection; a case report.,"INTRODUCTION: A small portion of Corona Virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases associated with co-infections, however occasionally they turn out to be false positive due to possible cross-reactivities. The current report aims to present a rare case of false-positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a COVID-19 patient.
CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old female complaining from thyroid problems referred for thyroid operation. She had mild symptoms of COVID-19. Her preoperative laboratory findings were normal, except for HIV screening test which was repetitively positive. RNA PCR was performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV, it revealed a negative result. The patient underwent thyroidectomy as planned and was given the required supportive treatment to recover from COVID-19. Two-month follow up revealed that she was negative for COVID-19 on PCR testing, and HIV immunoassay test was no longer positive.
DISCUSSION: Due to structural similarities between the spike protein chains of SARS-CoV-2 and some other viruses such as dengue, Zika, and other closely related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), the protein can potentially interfere with the immunoassay tests. Although HIV immunoassay tests have high sensitivity and specificity, false-positive results have been reported, such as in the case of Epstein Barr virus, Influenza vaccination, and the Australian COVID-19 vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Similarity between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can lead to antibody cross-reactivities, yielding false-positive results on immunoassay screening tests.","['Salih RQ', 'Salih GA', 'Abdulla BA', 'Ahmed AD', 'Mohammed HR', 'Kakamad FH', 'Salih AM']",2021,71,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Salih RQ, et al.

Like other viruses, HP-hCoVs interact with their host cells in sophisticated manners for infection and pathogenesis. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge about the interference of HP-hCoVs in multiple cellular processes and their impacts on viral infection. HP-hCoVs employed various strategies to suppress and evade from immune response, including shielding viral RNA from recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), impairing IFN-I production, blocking the downstream pathways of IFN-I, and other evasion strategies. This summary provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between HP-hCoVs and the host cells, which is helpful to understand the mechanism of viral pathogenesis and develop antiviral therapies.","['Li JY', 'Zhou ZJ', 'Wang Q', 'He QN', 'Zhao MY', 'Qiu Y', 'Ge XY']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Li JY, et al.

34767789,Modeling coronavirus spike protein dynamics: implications for immunogenicity and immune escape.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines. While concentrated research efforts have focused primarily on antibody-based vaccines that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccines have either been approved or received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring updated second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e., neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor-binding domain. Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins and present a new, to our knowledge, approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses.","['Kunkel G', 'Madani M', 'White SJ', 'Verardi PH', 'Tarakanova A']",2021,120,24,Biophys J,"Kunkel G, et al.

34757083,Mapping antibody binding using multiplexed epitope substitution analysis.,"A more complete understanding of antibody epitopes would aid the development of diagnostics, therapeutic antibodies, and vaccines. However, current methods for mapping antibody binding to epitopes require a targeted experimental approach, which limits throughput. To address these limitations, we developed Multiplexed Epitope Substitution Analysis (MESA) which can rapidly characterize various distinct epitopes using millions of antibody-binding peptides. We screened peptides from a random 12-mer library that bound to human serum antibody repertoires and determined their sequences using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Computationally, we divided target epitope sequences into overlapping k-mer subsequences and substituted the positions in each k-mer with all 20 amino acids, mimicking a saturation mutagenesis. We then determined enrichments of the substituted k-mers in the screened peptide dataset and used these enrichments to identify substitutions favored for binding at each position in the target epitope, ultimately revealing the precise binding motif. To validate MESA, we determined binding motifs for monoclonal antibodies spiked into serum, recovering the expected binding positions and amino acid preferences. To characterize epitopes bound by a population, we analyzed 50 serum specimens to determine the binding motifs within various target epitopes from common pathogens. Additionally, by analyzing various HSV-1 glycoprotein epitopes, MESA revealed unique binding signatures for HSV-1 seropositive specimens and demonstrated the variability of binding signatures within a population. These results demonstrate that MESA can rapidly identify and characterize binding motifs for an unlimited number of epitopes from a single experiment, accelerating discoveries and enhancing our understanding of antibody-epitope interactions.","['Paull ML', 'Bozekowski JD', 'Daugherty PS']",2021,499,,J Immunol Methods,"Paull ML, et al.

34756886,A natural product compound inhibits coronaviral replication in vitro by binding to the conserved Nsp9 SARS-CoV-2 protein.,"The Nsp9 replicase is a conserved coronaviral protein that acts as an essential accessory component of the multi-subunit viral replication/transcription complex. Nsp9 is the predominant substrate for the essential nucleotidylation activity of Nsp12. Compounds specifically interfering with this viral activity would facilitate its study. Using a native mass-spectrometry-based approach to screen a natural product library for Nsp9 binders, we identified an ent-kaurane natural product, oridonin, capable of binding to purified SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 with micromolar affinities. By determining the crystal structure of the Nsp9-oridonin complex, we showed that oridonin binds through a conserved site near Nsp9's C-terminal GxxxG-helix. In enzymatic assays, oridonin's binding to Nsp9 reduces its potential to act as substrate for Nsp12's Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain. We also showed using in vitro cellular assays oridonin, while cytotoxic at higher doses has broad antiviral activity, reducing viral titer following infection with either SARS-CoV-2 or, to a lesser extent, MERS-CoV. Accordingly, these preliminary findings suggest that the oridonin molecular scaffold may have the potential to be developed into an antiviral compound to inhibit the function of Nsp9 during coronaviral replication.","['Littler DR', 'Liu M', 'McAuley JL', 'Lowery SA', 'Illing PT', 'Gully BS', 'Purcell AW', 'Chandrashekaran IR', 'Perlman S', 'Purcell DFJ', 'Quinn RJ', 'Rossjohn J']",2021,297,6,J Biol Chem,"Littler DR, et al.

34751250,"Corticosteroids for treatment of COVID-19: effect, evidence, expectation and extent.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 occurrence as a global pandemic in March 2020. The treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients is based on the experience gained from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection during 2003. There is no clinically accepted therapeutic drug(s) accessible yet for the treatment of COVID-19.
MAIN BODY: Corticosteroids, i.e., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone and prednisone are used alone or in combination for the treatment of moderate, severe and critically infected COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen as per current management strategies and guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Institutes of Health. Corticosteroids are recorded in the WHO model list of essential medicines and are easily accessible worldwide at a cheaper cost in multiple formulations and various dosage forms. Corticosteroid can be used in all age group of patients, i.e., children, adult, elderly and during pregnancy or breastfeeding women. Corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in both primary and secondary immune cells, thereby reducing the generation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and lowering the activation of T cells, monocytes and macrophages. The corticosteroids should not be used in the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients because corticosteroids suppress the immune response and reduce the symptoms and associated side effects such as slow recovery, bacterial infections, hypokalemia, mucormycosis and finally increase the chances of death.
CONCLUSION: Intensive research on corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 treatment is urgently needed to elucidate their mechanisms and importance in contributing toward successful prevention and treatment approaches. Hence, this review emphasizes on recent advancement on corticosteroid therapy for defining their importance in overcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, their mechanism, efficacy and extent of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","['Patel VK', 'Shirbhate E', 'Patel P', 'Veerasamy R', 'Sharma PC', 'Rajak H']",2021,10,1,Beni Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci,"Patel VK, et al.

34746020,Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Using Duplex Reverse Transcription-Multienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification in a Point-of-Care Testing.,"In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide. Portable nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 are critically important for diagnostics. In this study, we used an isothermal amplification method-Multienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification (MIRA)-for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. We designed the primers and probes in ORF1ab and N gene of SARS-CoV-2. The amplicons could be monitored by lateral flow dipsticks (LFDs). The reaction temperature, time, concentrations of primers and probes, and working volume were optimized. Four commercial swab collection buffers were used to test the amplification efficacy of our assay without RNA extraction. Our assay was able to amplify duplex targets of SARS-CoV-2 in one single reaction using one-step RT-MIRA. The assay worked well in a low volume of 10 μl at 38°C for 20 min. Using three collection buffers without guanidinium, our assay was able to amplify efficaciously without RNA extraction. The 95% limit of detection (LoD) of the RT-MIRA assay was 49.5 (95% CI, 46.8-52.7) copies/ml for ORF1ab gene and 48.8 (95% CI, 46.5-52.6) copies/ml for N gene. There is no cross-reaction with other human respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus 229E in our assay.

34745235,Structural Insights on the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern Spike Glycoprotein: A Computational Study With Possible Clinical Implications.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) and, consequently, SARS2 has evolved into multiple SARS2 variants driving subsequent waves of infections. In particular, variants of concern (VOC) were identified to have both increased transmissibility and virulence ascribable to mutational changes occurring within the spike protein resulting to modifications in the protein structural orientation which in-turn may affect viral pathogenesis. However, this was never fully elucidated. Here, we generated spike models of endemic HCoVs (HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, SARS CoV, MERS CoV), original SARS2, and VOC (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Model quality check, structural superimposition, and structural comparison based on RMSD values, TM scores, and contact mapping were all performed. We found that: 1) structural comparison between the original SARS2 and VOC whole spike protein model have minor structural differences (TM > 0.98); 2) the whole VOC spike models putatively have higher structural similarity (TM > 0.70) to spike models from endemic HCoVs coming from the same phylogenetic cluster; 3) original SARS2 S1-CTD and S1-NTD models are structurally comparable to VOC S1-CTD (TM = 1.0) and S1-NTD (TM > 0.96); and 4) endemic HCoV S1-CTD and S1-NTD models are structurally comparable to VOC S1-CTD (TM > 0.70) and S1-NTD (TM > 0.70) models belonging to the same phylogenetic cluster. Overall, we propose that structural similarities (possibly ascribable to similar conformational epitopes) may help determine immune cross-reactivity, whereas, structural differences (possibly associated with varying conformational epitopes) may lead to viral infection (either reinfection or breakthrough infection).","['Cueno ME', 'Imai K']",2021,12,,Front Genet,Cueno ME and Imai K.

34740598,Increased complications of COVID-19 in people with cardiovascular disease: Role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysregulation.,"The rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a dramatic negative impact on public health and economies worldwide. Recent studies on COVID-19 complications and mortality rates suggest that there is a higher prevalence in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) patients. Past investigations on the associations between pre-existing CVDs and susceptibility to coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have demonstrated similar results. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This has impeded adequate risk stratification and treatment strategies for CVD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Generally, dysregulation of the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the counter regulator, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a hallmark of cardiovascular risk and CVD. ACE2 is the main host receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Although further studies are required, dysfunction of ACE2 after virus binding and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) signaling may worsen the outcomes of people affected by COVID-19 and with preexisting CVD. Here, we review the current knowledge and outline the gaps related to the relationship between CVD and COVID-19 with a focus on the RAAS. Improved understanding of the mechanisms regulating viral entry and the role of RAAS may direct future research with the potential to improve the prevention and management of COVID-19.","['Augustine R', 'S A', 'Nayeem A', 'Salam SA', 'Augustine P', 'Dan P', 'Maureira P', 'Mraiche F', 'Gentile C', 'Hansbro PM', 'McClements L', 'Hasan A']",2022,351,,Chem Biol Interact,"Augustine R, et al.

34737318,Distinct SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity patterns elicited by natural infection and mRNA vaccination.,"We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021. A total of 8476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after a vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, Common CoV, and Influenza. Twenty-six percent of specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; out of 852 seropositive individuals 77 had symptoms and 9 sought medical care. The antibody response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length, and S2 domain of spike. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and not cross-reactive against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. A vaccination campaign at the University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) started on December, 2020 and 6724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% pre-vaccination to 79% post-vaccination in January, 93% in February, and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced higher antibody levels than natural exposure, especially against the RBD domain and cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was observed. Nucleocapsid protein antibodies can be used to distinguish vaccinees to classify pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Previously infected individuals developed higher antibody titers to the vaccine than non pre-exposed individuals. Hospitalized patients in intensive care with severe disease reach significantly higher antibody levels than mild cases, but lower antibody levels compared to the vaccine. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader antibody response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Assis R', 'Jain A', 'Nakajima R', 'Jasinskas A', 'Khan S', 'Palma A', 'Parker DM', 'Chau A', 'Specimen Collection Group', 'Obiero JM', 'Tifrea D', 'Leung A', 'Grabar C', 'Muqolli F', 'Khalil G', 'Escobar JC', 'Ventura J', 'Davies DH', 'Albala B', 'Boden-Albala B', 'Schubl S', 'Felgner PL']",2021,6,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Assis R, et al.

34736354,Waning antibodies from inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination offer protection against infection without antibody-enhanced immunopathology in rhesus macaque pneumonia models.,"Inactivated coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as potential vaccines have been reported to result in enhanced respiratory diseases (ERDs) in murine and nonhuman primate (NHP) pneumonia models after virus challenge, which poses great safety concerns of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) for the rapid wide application of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in humans, especially when the neutralizing antibody levels induced by vaccination or initial infection quickly wane to nonneutralizing or subneutralizing levels over the time. With passive transfer of diluted postvaccination polyclonal antibodies to mimic the waning antibody responses after vaccination, we found that in the absence of cellular immunity, passive infusion of subneutralizing or nonneutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could still provide some level of protection against infection upon challenge, and no low-level antibody-enhanced infection was observed. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-infused group and control group showed similar, mild to moderate pulmonary immunopathology during the acute phase of virus infection, and no evidence of vaccine-related pulmonary immunopathology enhancement was found. Typical immunopathology included elevated MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-33 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; alveolar epithelial hyperplasia; and exfoliated cells and mucus in bronchioles. Our results corresponded with the recent observations that no pulmonary immunology was detected in preclinical studies of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in either murine or NHP pneumonia models or in large clinical trials and further supported the safety of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","['Li D', 'Luan N', 'Li J', 'Zhao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Long R', 'Jiang G', 'Fan S', 'Xu X', 'Cao H', 'Wang Y', 'Liao Y', 'Wang L', 'Liu L', 'Liu C', 'Li Q']",2021,10,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Li D, et al.

34735717,"COVID-19 in pregnant women and children: Insights on clinical manifestations, complexities, and pathogenesis.","Pregnancy changes the body's immune system to counteract the spectrum of infections, including COVID-19, which can pose complications. Pregnant women are less likely to contract COVID-19 infections than the general public. However, pregnant women are at slightly increased risk of becoming severely unwell if they do catch COVID-19, and congenital conditions in pregnant women may worsen the state of infection and lead to critical stages and even mortality. The possibility of vertical transmission has been reported in only a few cases of COVID-19; however, it was not noted in cases of SARS and MERS. Vaccination coverage in pregnant women remains a challenge. Children are the next suspected and vulnerable population to acquire infection after the first and second waves. Children are disproportionately infected compared with older populations, but the severity of infection is less compared to adults. This review highlights the complexities of COVID-19 in pregnant women and the underlying reasons why children tend to be comparatively less severely affected. Ethnicity, nutrition, lifestyle, and therapeutics influence the severity of infection in children. Low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, indigenous virus competence, and maternal immunity is the first-line defense for children against COVID-19. Habituating herbal medicines from childhood may help support a robust and defensive immune system to counteract novel antigens and encourage healthy generations.","['Meyyazhagan A', 'Pushparaj K', 'Balasubramanian B', 'Kuchi Bhotla H', 'Pappusamy M', 'Arumugam VA', 'Easwaran M', 'Pottail L', 'Mani P', 'Tsibizova V', 'Di Renzo GC']",2022,156,2,Int J Gynaecol Obstet,"Meyyazhagan A, et al.

34729457,High infectious disease burden as a basis for the observed high frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Following the coronavirus outbreaks described as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the world has again been challenged by yet another corona virus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infections were first detected in a Chinese Province in December 2019 and then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. An infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 may result in asymptomatic, uncomplicated or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fatal disease has been linked with the uncontrolled ""cytokine storm"" manifesting with complications mostly in people with underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary disease conditions. The severity of COVID-19 disease and the associated mortality has been disproportionately lower in terms of number of cases and deaths in Africa and also Asia in comparison to Europe and North America. Also, persons of colour residing in Europe and North America have been identified as a highly susceptible population due to a combination of several socioeconomic factors and poor access to quality healthcare. Interestingly, this has not been the case in sub-Saharan Africa where majority of the population are even more deprived of the aforementioned factors. On the contrary, sub-Saharan Africa has recorded the lowest levels of mortality and morbidity associated with the disease, and an overwhelming proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Whilst it can be argued that these lower number of cases in Africa may be due to challenges associated with the diagnosis of the disease such as lack of trained personnel and infrastructure, the number of persons who get infected and develop symptoms is proportionally lower than those who are asymptomatic, including asymptomatic cases that are never diagnosed. This review discusses the most probable reasons for the significantly fewer cases of severe COVID-19 disease and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.","['Kusi KA', 'Frimpong A', 'Partey FD', 'Lamptey H', 'Amoah LE', 'Ofori MF']",2021,4,,AAS Open Res,"Kusi KA, et al.

34731091,SARS-CoV-2 infection mediates differential expression of human endogenous retroviruses and long interspersed nuclear elements.,"SARS-CoV-2 promotes an imbalanced host response that underlies the development and severity of COVID-19. Infections with viruses are known to modulate transposable elements (TEs), which can exert downstream effects by modulating host gene expression, innate immune sensing, or activities encoded by their protein products. We investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on TE expression using RNA-Seq data from cell lines and from primary patient samples. Using a bioinformatics tool, Telescope, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection led to upregulation or downregulation of TE transcripts, a subset of which differed from cells infected with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV or MERS), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). Differential expression of key retroelements specifically identified distinct virus families, such as Coronaviridae, with unique retroelement expression subdividing viral species. Analysis of ChIP-Seq data showed that TEs differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infection were enriched for binding sites for transcription factors involved in immune responses and for pioneer transcription factors. In samples from patients with COVID-19, there was significant TE overexpression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and downregulation in PBMCs. Thus, although the host gene transcriptome is altered by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the retrotranscriptome may contain the most distinctive features of the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Marston JL', 'Greenig M', 'Singh M', 'Bendall ML', 'Duarte RRR', 'Feschotte C', 'Iñiguez LP', 'Nixon DF']",2021,6,24,JCI Insight,"Marston JL, et al.

Due to the lack of therapeutic or preventive agents against MERS-CoV, developing an effective vaccine is essential for preventing a viral outbreak. To address this, we developed a recombinant S1 subunit of MERS-CoV spike protein fused with the human IgG4 Fc fragment (LV-MS1-Fc) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Thereafter, we identified the baculovirus gp64 signal peptide-directed secretion of LV-MS1-Fc protein in the extracellular fluid. To demonstrate the immunogenicity of the recombinant LV-MS1-Fc proteins, BALB/c mice were inoculated with 2.5 μg of LV-MS1-Fc. The inoculated mice demonstrated a significant humoral immune response, measured via total IgG and neutralizing antibodies. In addition, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice vaccinated with LV-MS1-Fc showed the protective capacity of LV-MS1-Fc against MERS-CoV with no inflammatory cell infiltration. These data showed that the S1 and Fc fusion protein induced potent humoral immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, and conferred protection against coronavirus viral challenge, indicating that LV-MS1-Fc is an effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.","['Jung BK', 'An Y', 'Park JE', 'Chang KS', 'Jang H']",2022,299,,J Virol Methods,"Jung BK, et al.

34727365,"Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infections, before and after COVID-19: a review of animal studies.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus, which was first identified in December 2019 in China, has resulted in a yet ongoing viral pandemic. Coronaviridae could potentially cause several disorders in a wide range of hosts such as birds and mammals. Although infections caused by this family of viruses are predominantly limited to the respiratory tract, Betacoronaviruses are potentially able to invade the central nervous system (CNS) as well as many other organs, thereby inducing neurological damage ranging from mild to lethal in both animals and humans. Over the past two decades, three novel CoVs, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, emerging from animal reservoirs have exhibited neurotropic properties causing severe and even fatal neurological diseases. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses has yet to be fully known. Both clinical features of the previous CoV epidemics (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) and lessons from animal models used in studying neurotropic CoVs, especially SARS and MERS, constitute beneficial tools in comprehending the exact mechanisms of virus implantation and in illustrating pathogenesis and virus dissemination pathways in the CNS. Here, we review the animal research which assessed CNS infections with previous more studied neurotropic CoVs to demonstrate how experimental studies with appliable animal models can provide scientists with a roadmap in the CNS impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, animal studies can finally help us discover the underlying mechanisms of damage to the nervous system in COVID-19 patients and find novel therapeutic agents in order to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Bakhtazad A', 'Garmabi B', 'Joghataei MT']",2021,27,6,J Neurovirol,"Bakhtazad A, et al.

34723077,Impact of Weather Parameters and Population Density on the COVID-19 Transmission: Evidence from 81 Provinces of Turkey.,"Weather factors are effective to transmission of various diseases. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and kinds of influenza can be given as example these diseases. The novel corona virus which is called COVID-19 is the most dangerous problem all around the world in these days. Early studies have revealed that COVID-19 cases are affected by environmental factors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the number of novel coronavirus cases and several weather parameters in 81 provinces of Turkey. Mean incubation period of COVID-19 is in question. Thus, this paper also aims to provide better understanding of the exact incubation period in Turkey by employing four different timeframe which are on the day (lag 0), 3 days ago (lag 3), 7 days ago (lag 7) and 14 days ago (lag 14). We have considered population density as a control variable. The dataset cover COVID-19 cases, population density, average temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point, wind speed, and sunshine duration for 81 provinces of Turkey. We find that population density has a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases. We also find that in lag 3, all parameters except for sunshine duration are negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant. However, only 3 parameters, temperature, air pressure and dew point are negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant for lag 0, lag 7 and lag 14. In addition, temperature, air pressure and dew point parameters are negative and significant in all timeframes.","['Selcuk M', 'Gormus S', 'Guven M']",2021,5,1,Earth Syst Environ,"Selcuk M, et al.

34722371,The Post Pandemic Revitalization Plan for the Medical Tourism Sector in South Korea: A Brief Review.,"The significant impacts of recent infectious diseases (MERS, COVID-19) demand fundamental changes and alternatives in different markets, such as tourism and the medical tourism industry. In this study, we aimed to have a historical investigation on how infectious diseases have affected the tourism industry in Korea, to reach practical implications for managing the medical tourism sector. The impact of global infectious diseases, including MERS, and COVID-19, on the tourism industry was studied in South Korea. First, the available information was collected to clarify how these two outbreaks have impacted the tourism market in South Korea, and then the government's countermeasures were studied. Investigating among the policies resulted in practical implications for the post-pandemic revitalizing plan for the medical tourism market. The infectious outbreak caused a significant decrease in the number of inbound tourists to South Korea, moreover, the crisis response system of the government has been useful so far. Hence, several practical implications can be achieved for the medical tourism market. A framework is suggested which involves 5 stages of strategies to revitalize medical tourism market. It presents remedies to revitalize the medical tourism industry and to enter the global market again. Korea's quarantine model, which succeeded in preventing COVID-19, can be a preemptive response to another pandemic in the future. The medical tourism industry policy based on Korea's quarantine model will contribute to the revitalization of the international medical tourism industry after COVID-19.","['Seo BR', 'Kim KL']",2021,50,9,Iran J Public Health,Seo BR and Kim KL.

34720363,Spatiotemporal behaviors of the ridership of a public transportation system during an epidemic outbreak: case of MERS in Seoul.,"During May and June 2015, an outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in Korea, which raised the fear of contagion throughout society and suppressed the use of public transportation systems. Exploring daily ridership data of the Seoul bus transportation system, along with the number of infected patients and search volume in web portals, we observe that ridership decreased abruptly while attention was heavily focused online. Then this temporal reduction recovered exponentially with a characteristic time of 3 weeks when newly confirmed cases began to decrease. We also find with the data of ranked keywords of web portals that areas with severely reduced ridership tended to cluster and spatiotemporal variations of such clusters were highly associated with general hospitals where MERS patients were treated. On the other hand, the spatial reduction in ridership relaxed algebraically with the distance from a general hospital while the outbreak was severe. We further probe the influence of the epidemic outbreak in the framework of linear response theory, which relates the responses to the epidemic outbreak (""perturbation"") with correlations in the absence of the perturbation. Indeed, the spatial correlation function of the ridership changes is observed to follow a power law, sharing the same exponent as the spatial relaxation of the response function. This new theoretical approach offers a useful tool for understanding responses of public transportation system to epidemic or accidental disasters.","['Lee JH', 'Goh S', 'Kim JW', 'Lee K', 'Choi MY']",2021,79,11,J Korean Phys Soc,"Lee JH, et al.

34712107,Viral Inactivation with Emphasis on SARS-CoV-2 Using Physical and Chemical Disinfectants.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a world health concern leading to severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Virus transmission occurs through person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets, and contaminated hands or surfaces. Accordingly, we aim at reviewing the literature on all information available about the persistence of coronaviruses, including human and animal coronaviruses, on inanimate surfaces and inactivation strategies with biocides employed for chemical and physical disinfection.
METHOD: A comprehensive search was systematically conducted in main databases from 1998 to 2020 to identify various viral disinfectants associated with HCoV and methods for control and prevention of this newly emerged virus.
RESULTS: The analysis of 62 studies shows that human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can be efficiently inactivated by physical and chemical disinfectants at different concentrations (70, 80, 85, and 95%) of 2-propanol (70 and 80%) in less than or equal to 60 s and 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Additionally, glutaraldehyde (0.5-2%), formaldehyde (0.7-1%), and povidone-iodine (0.1-0.75%) could readily inactivate coronaviruses. Moreover, dry heat at 56°C, ultraviolet light dose of 0.2 to 140 J/cm
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study can help researchers, policymakers, health decision makers, and people perceive and take the correct measures to control and prevent further transmission of COVID-19.

34710354,Stabilized coronavirus spike stem elicits a broadly protective antibody.,"Current coronavirus (CoV) vaccines primarily target immunodominant epitopes in the S1 subunit, which are poorly conserved and susceptible to escape mutations, thus threatening vaccine efficacy. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to remove the S1 subunit from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein and develop stabilized stem (SS) antigens. Vaccination with MERS SS elicits cross-reactive β-CoV antibody responses and protects mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. High-throughput screening of antibody-secreting cells from MERS SS-immunized mice led to the discovery of a panel of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Among them, antibody IgG22 binds with high affinity to both MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 S proteins, and a combination of electron microscopy and crystal structures localizes the epitope to a conserved coiled-coil region in the S2 subunit. Passive transfer of IgG22 protects mice against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Collectively, these results provide a proof of principle for cross-reactive CoV antibodies and inform the development of pan-CoV vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.","['Hsieh CL', 'Werner AP', 'Leist SR', 'Stevens LJ', 'Falconer E', 'Goldsmith JA', 'Chou CW', 'Abiona OM', 'West A', 'Westendorf K', 'Muthuraman K', 'Fritch EJ', 'Dinnon KH', 'Schäfer A', 'Denison MR', 'Chappell JD', 'Baric RS', 'Graham BS', 'Corbett KS', 'McLellan JS']",2021,37,5,Cell Rep,"Hsieh CL, et al.

34704923,MERS-CoV infection causes brain damage in human DPP4-transgenic mice through complement-mediated inflammation.,"The highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a severe respiratory virus. Recent reports indicate additional central nervous system (CNS) involvement. In this study, human DPP4 transgenic mice were infected with MERS-CoV, and viral antigens were first detected in the midbrain-hindbrain 4 days post-infection, suggesting the virus may enter the brainstem via peripheral nerves. Neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain were infected, followed by damage of the blood brain barrier (BBB), as well as microglial activation and inflammatory cell infiltration, which may be caused by complement activation based on the observation of deposition of complement activation product C3 and high expression of C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5a receptor (C5aR1) in neurons and glial cells. It may be concluded that these effects were mediated by complement activation in the brain, because of their reduction resulted from the treatment with mouse C5aR1-specific mAb. Such mAb significantly reduced nucleoprotein expression, suppressed microglial activation and decreased activation of caspase-3 in neurons and p38 phosphorylation in the brain. Collectively, these results suggest that MERS-CoV infection of CNS triggers complement activation, leading to inflammation-mediated damage of brain tissue, and regulating of complement activation could be a promising intervention and adjunctive treatment for CNS injury by MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses.","['Jiang Y', 'Chen Y', 'Sun H', 'Zhang X', 'He L', 'Li J', 'Zhao G', 'Sun S']",2021,102,10,J Gen Virol,"Jiang Y, et al.

A multi-coronavirus protein microarray was created containing full-length proteins, overlapping protein fragments of various lengths, and peptide libraries from SARS-CoV-2 and four other human coronaviruses. Sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multicoronavirus arrays to identify specific antibody reactivity. High-level IgG, IgM, and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M, and N of SARS-CoV-2, as well as accessory proteins such as ORF3a and ORF7a, were observed that were specific to COVID-19 patients. Antibody reactivity against overlapping 100-, 50-, and 30-amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins was used to identify antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM, and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses.

In each phase, two camel herds were studied. These herds were located in Al-azraq and in Al-ramtha area and were named Al-azraq and Al-ramtha herds, respectively. The same camel herd of Al-zarqa area was sampled in both phases while two different camel herds, one in each phase, were sampled in Al-ramtha area. Blood and nasal swabs were collected from same selected animals in all visits to each herd in both phases. Additionally, nasal swabs and retropharyngeal lymph node tissue samples were collected from sixty-one camels slaughtered at Al-ramtha abattoir during phase 2 to enhance virus isolation opportunities and phylogenetic analysis. All sampled animals from Al-azraq camel herd were either borderline or seropositive on spike 1 based ELISA assay and negative on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in both phases. In Al-ramtha camel herds, an unsteady pattern prevailed in animals' seropositivity in both phases and viral RNA was detected in all animals in the end of phase 1 and in one animal during phase 2. For the seroconversion, anti-MERS-CoV spike 1 antibodies were detected in two animals in phase 1 in the first collection only. While, in phase 2, intermittent seroconversion pattern was observed in several samples over time of collections that ended with all animals became seropositive in the last collection (after nineteen days from viral RNA detection).

This study evaluated HCWs' emotions, stressor experiences and coping strategies during the pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at the University Medical Center in Ho Chi Minh City. The questionnaire was adapted from the MERS-CoV Staff Questionnaire to measure HCWs' emotions, stressor experiences and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Among the 1423 participants eligible in the data analysis, the majority were female (71.1%) with a mean age of 34.2 (standard deviation 7.8) years. While most participants reported that they did their job because of their professionalism and duty as HCWs (87.4%), a high number reported feeling nervous and scared (86.0%). Most participants reported worry about transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to their families or friends (76.6%) and concern that a small mistake or lapse in concentration could infect themselves and others (76.7%). The most common coping strategies were following strict personal protective measures (95.3%), avoiding going out (92.5%) and reading about SARS-CoV-2 (92.3%). Females who had a higher educational level and less than 5-years work experience and those who worked at clinical departments and subclinical departments were more vulnerable.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates an urgent need for psychological support for HCWs, especially for those at high risk of having stress.

34702917,Gut microbiota of bats: pro-mutagenic properties and possible frontiers in preventing emerging disease.,"Bats are potential natural reservoirs for emerging viruses, causing deadly human diseases, such as COVID-19, MERS, SARS, Nipah, Hendra, and Ebola infections. The fundamental mechanisms by which bats are considered ""living bioreactors"" for emerging viruses are not fully understood. Some studies suggest that tolerance to viruses is linked to suppressing antiviral immune and inflammatory responses due to DNA damage by energy generated to fly. Our study reveals that bats' gut bacteria could also be involved in the host and its microbiota's DNA damage. We performed screening of lactic acid bacteria and bacilli isolated from bats' feces for mutagenic and oxidative activity by lux-biosensors. The pro-mutagenic activity was determined when expression of recA increased with the appearance of double-strand breaks in the cell DNA, while an increase of katG expression in the presence of hydroxyl radicals indicated antioxidant activity. We identified that most of the isolated bacteria have pro-mutagenic and antioxidant properties at the same time. This study reveals new insights into bat gut microbiota's potential involvement in antiviral response and opens new frontiers in preventing emerging diseases originating from bats.","['Popov IV', 'Mazanko MS', 'Kulaeva ED', 'Golovin SN', 'Malinovkin AV', 'Aleshukina IS', 'Aleshukina AV', 'Prazdnova EV', 'Tverdokhlebova TI', 'Chikindas ML', 'Ermakov AM']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Popov IV, et al.

34698547,"Pathogenesis, Symptomatology, and Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through Analysis of Viral Genomics and Structure.","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in late 2019, has since spread around the world and infected hundreds of millions of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While this viral species was unknown prior to January 2020, its similarity to other coronaviruses that infect humans has allowed for rapid insight into the mechanisms that it uses to infect human hosts, as well as the ways in which the human immune system can respond. Here, we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host. Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus's structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally, prior research into interactions between the human immune system and coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system's protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.

34696436,Utilizing the VirIdAl Pipeline to Search for Viruses in the Metagenomic Data of Bat Samples.,"According to various estimates, only a small percentage of existing viruses have been discovered, naturally much less being represented in the genomic databases. High-throughput sequencing technologies develop rapidly, empowering large-scale screening of various biological samples for the presence of pathogen-associated nucleotide sequences, but many organisms are yet to be attributed specific loci for identification. This problem particularly impedes viral screening, due to vast heterogeneity in viral genomes. In this paper, we present a new bioinformatic pipeline, VirIdAl, for detecting and identifying viral pathogens in sequencing data. We also demonstrate the utility of the new software by applying it to viral screening of the feces of bats collected in the Moscow region, which revealed a significant variety of viruses associated with bats, insects, plants, and protozoa. The presence of alpha and beta coronavirus reads, including the MERS-like bat virus, deserves a special mention, as it once again indicates that bats are indeed reservoirs for many viral pathogens. In addition, it was shown that alignment-based methods were unable to identify the taxon for a large proportion of reads, and we additionally applied other approaches, showing that they can further reveal the presence of viral agents in sequencing data.

34696338,"Evolutionary Dynamics and Epidemiology of Endemic and Emerging Coronaviruses in Humans, Domestic Animals, and Wildlife.","Diverse coronavirus (CoV) strains can infect both humans and animals and produce various diseases. CoVs have caused three epidemics and pandemics in the last two decades, and caused a severe impact on public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the emergence and evolution of endemic and emerging CoV diversity in humans and animals. For diverse bird species, the Infectious Bronchitis Virus is a significant one, whereas feline enteric and canine coronavirus, recombined to produce feline infectious peritonitis virus, infects wild cats. Bovine and canine CoVs have ancestral relationships, while porcine CoVs, especially SADS-CoV, can cross species barriers. Bats are considered as the natural host of diverse strains of alpha and beta coronaviruses. Though MERS-CoV is significant for both camels and humans, humans are nonetheless affected more severely.

34696302,Genetic Insights into the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection among Saudi People.,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated for the first time in Saudi Arabia from a patient suffering from atypical pneumonia. The Saudi Genome database was built by King Abdulaziz Medical City via the next-generation sequencing of 7000 candidates.
METHOD: A large list of point mutations were reported in the region of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene. The DPP4 amino acid residues correlated to MERS-CoV entry and the site of activity of DPP4 inhibitors was investigated. We retrieved the SNPs (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) with a variation frequency of >0.05.
RESULTS: SNP 2:162,890,175 and SNP 2:162,891,848 in the intronic region were located within 50 bp of amino acid residues responsible for MERS-CoV entry, amino acids 259-296 and 205-258, respectively. The variation frequency of SNP 2:162,890,175 was 2321 out of 2379 screened individuals. Moreover, mutation of SNP 2:162,891,848, which is located near amino acid residues E205 and E206 (crucial for the activity of DPP4 inhibitors), occurred in 76 out of 2379 screened individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows high variation frequency in the DPP4 region reported in the Saudi Genome database. The identified SNPs are of high significance for MERS-CoV infection in better understanding disease pathogenesis.","['Abuelizz HA', 'AlRasheed MM', 'Alhoshani A', 'Alhawassi T']",2021,9,10,Vaccines (Basel),"Abuelizz HA, et al.

Recent studies have shown that using medical imaging techniques can be useful in developing an automatic computer-aided diagnosis system to detect pandemic diseases with high accuracy at an early stage. In this study, a large margin piecewise linear classifier was developed to diagnose COVID-19 compared to a wide range of viral pneumonia, including SARS and MERS, using chest x-ray images. In the proposed method, a preprocessing pipeline was employed. Moreover, deep pre- and post-rectified linear unit (ReLU) features were extracted using the well-known VGG-Net19, which was fine-tuned to optimize transfer learning. Afterward, the canonical correlation analysis was performed for feature fusion, and fused deep features were passed into the LMPL classifier. The introduced method reached the highest performance in comparison with related state-of-the-art methods for two different schemes (normal, COVID-19, and typical viral pneumonia) and (COVID-19, SARS, and MERS pneumonia) with 99.39% and 98.86% classification accuracy, respectively.","['Azouji N', 'Sami A', 'Taheri M', 'Müller H']",2021,139,,Comput Biol Med,"Azouji N, et al.

34686605,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine based on a propagation-defective RNA replicon elicited sterilizing immunity in mice.,"Self-amplifying RNA replicons are promising platforms for vaccine generation. Their defects in one or more essential functions for viral replication, particle assembly, or dissemination make them highly safe as vaccines. We previously showed that the deletion of the envelope (E) gene from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) produces a replication-competent propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-ΔE). Evaluation of this replicon in mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor, showed that the single deletion of the E gene generated an attenuated mutant. The combined deletion of the E gene with accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 resulted in a highly attenuated propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E]). This RNA replicon induced sterilizing immunity in mice after challenge with a lethal dose of a virulent MERS-CoV, as no histopathological damage or infectious virus was detected in the lungs of challenged mice. The four mutants lacking the E gene were genetically stable, did not recombine with the E gene provided in trans during their passage in cell culture, and showed a propagation-defective phenotype in vivo. In addition, immunization with MERS-CoV-Δ[3,4a,4b,5,E] induced significant levels of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that MERS-CoV RNA replicons are highly safe and promising vaccine candidates.","['Gutiérrez-Álvarez J', 'Honrubia JM', 'Sanz-Bravo A', 'González-Miranda E', 'Fernández-Delgado R', 'Rejas MT', 'Zúñiga S', 'Sola I', 'Enjuanes L']",2021,118,43,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Gutiérrez-Álvarez J, et al.

Despite the development and administration of multiple vaccines, the mutation of newer strains and challenges to universal immunity has shifted the focus to the lack of efficacious drugs for therapeutic intervention for the disease. As with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other non-respiratory viruses, flavonoids present themselves as a promising therapeutic intervention given their success in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and more recently, in clinical studies. This review focuses on data from in vitro studies analyzing the effects of flavonoids on various key SARS-CoV-2 targets and presents an analysis of the structure-activity relationships for the same. From 27 primary papers, over 69 flavonoids were investigated for their activities against various SARS-CoV-2 targets, ranging from the promising 3C-like protease (3CLpro) to the less explored nucleocapsid (N) protein; the most promising were quercetin and myricetin derivatives, baicalein, baicalin, EGCG, and tannic acid. We further review promising in silico studies featuring activities of flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 and list ongoing clinical studies involving the therapeutic potential of flavonoid-rich extracts in combination with synthetic drugs or other polyphenols and suggest prospects for the future of flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2.","['Kaul R', 'Paul P', 'Kumar S', 'Büsselberg D', 'Dwivedi VD', 'Chaari A']",2021,22,20,Int J Mol Sci,"Kaul R, et al.

IPC guidelines were adopted and developed based on experience gained during the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current evidence on IPC in healthcare settings and patients with COVID-19 to prevent nosocomial infections during the actual pandemic. A search was run on PubMed using the terms ('COVID-19' [Mesh]) AND ('Infection Control' [Mesh]) between 2019 and 2021. We identified 86 studies that were in accordance with our aim and summarized them under certain themes as they related to COVID-19 infection control measures. All the guidelines recommend early diagnosis and rapid isolation of COVID-19 patients. The necessary precautions should be taken comprising the whole process, starting with an infectious disease plan, administrative and engineering controls, triage, and PPE training. Guidelines should target modes of transmission, droplet, aerosol, and oral-fecal, while recommending control precautions.

However, data on CNS and PNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 with respect to CSF, serum and neuroimaging markers is still lacking.
METHODS: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 and PNS Complication"" looking for transverse myelitis, vasculitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis (AHNE), cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), published between 1 December 2019 to 15 July 2021.
RESULTS: Of the included 106 CNS manifestations in our study, CNS inflammatory disorders included transverse myelitis (17, 14.7%), AHNE (12, 10.4%), ADEM (11, 9.5%), CLOCC/MERS (10, 8.6%) and vasculitis (4, 3.4%). Others were nonspecific encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures and stroke. Most patients were >50 years old (75, 70.8%) and male (64, 65.3%). Most (59, 63.4%) were severe cases of COVID-19 and 18 (18%) patients died. Of the included 94 PNS manifestations in our study, GBS (89, 92.7%) was the most common. Most of these patients were >50 years old (73, 77.7%) and male (59, 64.1%). Most (62, 67.4%) were non-severe cases of COVID-19, and ten patients died.
CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive review of the clinical and paraclinical findings in CNS and PNS manifestations of COVID-19 provide insights on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurotropism.

The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has quickly spread throughout the world. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), have led to a global epidemic with high morbidity and mortality. Human pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys, and blood vessels. The efforts to contain the virus are undergoing throughout the world, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence.

This pneumonia causes not only respiratory symptoms but also multiple organ dysfunction, including thrombotic diseases such as ischemic stroke. The purpose of this review is to explore whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and its related pathophysiological mechanisms. Based on the high thrombosis rate and frequent strokes of COVID-19 patients, combined with related laboratory indicators and pathological results, the discussion is mainly from two aspects: nerve invasion and endothelial dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the CNS through blood-borne and neuronal retrograde pathways, causing cerebrovascular diseases. In addition, the endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 is almost certain. Cytokine storm causes thromboinflammation, and downregulation of ACE2 leads to RAS imbalance, which eventually lead to ischemic stroke.","['Tang X', 'Zheng F']",2022,43,1,Neurol Sci,Tang X and Zheng F.

It was first reported in 2019 in China and has now dramatically spread across the world. It is crucial to develop therapeutics to mitigate severe disease and viral spread. The receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown anti-viral activity in previous reports suggesting that this domain has high potential for development as therapeutics. To evaluate the potential antiviral activity of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins, we determined the RBD residues of SARS-CoV-2 using a homology search with RBD of SARS-CoV. For efficient expression and purification, the signal peptide of spike protein was identified and used to generate constructs expressing recombinant RBD proteins. Highly purified RBD protein fused with the Fc domain of human IgG showed potent anti-viral efficacy, which was better than that of a protein fused with a histidine tag. Intranasally pre-administrated RBD protein also inhibited the attachment of SARS-COV-2 to mouse lungs.

34663436,Effects of sequence motifs in the yeast 3' untranslated region determined from massively parallel assays of random sequences.,"BACKGROUND: The 3' untranslated region (UTR) plays critical roles in determining the level of gene expression through effects on activities such as mRNA stability and translation. Functional elements within this region have largely been identified through analyses of native genes, which contain multiple co-evolved sequence features.
RESULTS: To explore the effects of 3' UTR sequence elements outside of native sequence contexts, we analyze hundreds of thousands of random 50-mers inserted into the 3' UTR of a reporter gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We determine relative protein expression levels from the fitness of transformants in a growth selection. We find that the consensus 3' UTR efficiency element significantly boosts expression, independent of sequence context; on the other hand, the consensus positioning element has only a small effect on expression. Some sequence motifs that are binding sites for Puf proteins substantially increase expression in the library, despite these proteins generally being associated with post-transcriptional downregulation of native mRNAs. Our measurements also allow a systematic examination of the effects of point mutations within efficiency element motifs across diverse sequence backgrounds. These mutational scans reveal the relative in vivo importance of individual bases in the efficiency element, which likely reflects their roles in binding the Hrp1 protein involved in cleavage and polyadenylation.
CONCLUSIONS: The regulatory effects of some 3' UTR sequence features, like the efficiency element, are consistent regardless of sequence context. In contrast, the consequences of other 3' UTR features appear to be strongly dependent on their evolved context within native genes.","['Savinov A', 'Brandsen BM', 'Angell BE', 'Cuperus JT', 'Fields S']",2021,22,1,Genome Biol,"Savinov A, et al.

34660513,"Cross-Species Transmission of Coronaviruses in Humans and Domestic Mammals, What Are the Ecological Mechanisms Driving Transmission, Spillover, and Disease Emergence?","Coronaviruses cause respiratory and digestive diseases in vertebrates. The recent pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2, is taking a heavy toll on society and planetary health, and illustrates the threat emerging coronaviruses can pose to the well-being of humans and other animals. Coronaviruses are constantly evolving, crossing host species barriers, and expanding their host range. In the last few decades, several novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans and domestic animals. Novel coronaviruses have also been discovered in captive wildlife or wild populations, raising conservation concerns. The evolution and emergence of novel viruses is enabled by frequent cross-species transmission. It is thus crucial to determine emerging coronaviruses' potential for infecting different host species, and to identify the circumstances under which cross-species transmission occurs in order to mitigate the rate of disease emergence. Here, I review (broadly across several mammalian host species) up-to-date knowledge of host range and circumstances concerning reported cross-species transmission events of emerging coronaviruses in humans and common domestic mammals. All of these coronaviruses had similar host ranges, were closely related (indicative of rapid diversification and spread), and their emergence was likely associated with high-host-density environments facilitating multi-species interactions (e.g., shelters, farms, and markets) and the health or well-being of animals as end- and/or intermediate spillover hosts. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms of the cross-species transmission events that have ultimately led to a surge of emerging coronaviruses in multiple species in a relatively short period of time in a world undergoing rapid environmental change.",['Nova N'],2021,9,,Front Public Health,"Nova N.

34658531,A systems analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic response in the United Kingdom - Part 1 - The overall context.,"The most common reaction to suggesting that we could learn valuable lessons from the way the current pandemic has been/ is being handled, is to discourage the attempt; as it is suggested that it can all be done more accurately and authoritatively after the inevitable Public Inquiry (Slater, 2019). On the other hand, a more constructive approach, is to capture and understand the work that was actually done.This would include normal activities, as well as positive adaptations to challenges and failures that may have occurred. Such an approach aimed at improving what worked, rather than blaming people for what went wrong, has the potential to contribute more successfully to controlling the consequences of the current crisis. Such an approach should thus be aimed at detecting and feeding back lessons from emerging and probably unexpected behaviours and helping to design the system to adapt better to counter the effects. The science and discipline of Human Factors (HF) promotes system resilience. This can be defined as an organisation's ability to adjust its functioning before, during or after significant disturbances (such as a pandemic), enabling adaptation and operation under both anticipated and unanticipated circumstances. A ""functional"" approach methodology enables the identification of where the system and its various interdependent functions (an activity or set of activities that are required to give a certain output), could be improved and strengthened; if not immediately, at least for the future. Along these lines, suggestions for adding key resilience functions are additionally identified and outlined. The application and insights gained from this functional approach to the 2015 MERS-Cov pandemic in South Korea has been seen as contributing substantially to the effective response to the current crisis in that country (Min, submitted for publication). In this paper, we present an overarching framework for a series of projects that are planned to carry out focussed systems-based analysis to generate learning from key aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic response in the United Kingdom.","['Slater D', 'Hollnagel E', 'MacKinnon R', 'Sujan M', 'Carson-Stevens A', 'Ross A', 'Bowie P']",2022,146,,Saf Sci,"Slater D, et al.

34648601,Effect of identified non-synonymous mutations in DPP4 receptor binding residues among highly exposed human population in Morocco to MERS-CoV through computational approach.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) has been identified as the main receptor of MERS-CoV facilitating its cellular entry and enhancing its viral replication upon the emergence of this novel coronavirus. DPP4 receptor is highly conserved among many species, but the genetic variability among direct binding residues to MERS-CoV restrained its cellular tropism to humans, camels and bats. The occurrence of natural polymorphisms in human DPP4 binding residues is not well characterized. Therefore, we aimed to assess the presence of potential mutations in DPP4 receptor binding domain (RBD) among a population highly exposed to MERS-CoV in Morocco and predict their effect on DPP4 -MERS-CoV binding affinity through a computational approach. DPP4 synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were identified by sanger sequencing, and their effect were modelled by mutation prediction tools, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to evaluate structural changes in human DPP4 protein bound to MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein. We identified eight mutations, two synonymous mutations (A291 =, R317 =) and six non-synonymous mutations (N229I, K267E, K267N, T288P, L294V, I295L). Through docking and MD simulation techniques, the chimeric DPP4 -MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein complex models carrying one of the identified non-synonymous mutations sustained a stable binding affinity for the complex that might lead to a robust cellular attachment of MERS-CoV except for the DPP4 N229I mutation. The latter is notable for a loss of binding affinity of DPP4 with MERS-CoV S1 RBD that might affect negatively on cellular entry of the virus. It is important to confirm our molecular modelling prediction with in-vitro studies to acquire a broader overview of the effect of these identified mutations.","['Abbad A', 'Anga L', 'Faouzi A', 'Iounes N', 'Nourlil J']",2021,16,10,PLoS One,"Abbad A, et al.

Although coronaviruses have widely been studied as respiratory tract pathogens, their effects on the hepatobiliary system have seldom been reported. Overall, the manifestations of liver injury caused by coronaviruses typically involve decreased albumin and elevated aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. Several pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed, including direct damage, immune-mediated injury, ischemia and hypoxia, thrombosis and drug hepatotoxicity. The interaction between pre-existing liver disease and coronavirus infection has been illustrated, whereby coronaviruses influence the occurrence, severity, prognosis and treatment of liver diseases. Drugs and vaccines used for treating and preventing coronavirus infection also have hepatotoxicity.

34646553,Review of proposed different irradiation methods to inactivate food-processing viruses and microorganisms.,"Coronaviruses, which have been enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses, were first mentioned in the mid-1960s and can attack people as well as a wide range of animals (including mammals and birds). Three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as the cause of large-scale epidemics over the last two decades: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Epithelial cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract are the principal targeted cells, and viral shedding occurs via these systems in diverse ways such as through fomites, air, or feces. Patients infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) reported having visited the Wuhan seafood wholesale market shortly before disease onset. The clinical data on established 2019-nCoV cases reported so far indicate a milder disease course than that described for patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. This study aimed to review radiation inactivation of these viruses in the food industry in three sections: visible light, ionizing radiation (alpha ray, beta ray, X-ray, gamma ray, neutron, plasma, and ozone), and nonionizing radiation (microwave, ultraviolet, infrared, laser light, and radiofrequency). Due to the obvious possibility of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission, using at least one of these three methods in food processing and packaging during coronavirus outbreaks will be critical for preventing further outbreaks at the community level.","['Shahi S', 'Khorvash R', 'Goli M', 'Ranjbaran SM', 'Najarian A', 'Mohammadi Nafchi A']",2021,9,10,Food Sci Nutr,"Shahi S, et al.

Over the last two decades, emergence of novel viral diseases such as SARS, influenza A/H1N1(09) pdm; MERS; Nipah virus disease; Ebola haemorrhagic fever and the current COVID-19 has resulted in massive outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics thereby causing profound losses of human life, health and economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 200 countries, reporting a global case load of 167,878,000 with 2 per cent mortality as on May 26, 2021. This has highlighted the importance of reducing human- animal interfaces to prevent such zoonoses. Rapid deforestation, shrinking of boundaries between human and animal, crisis for natural habitation, increasing demands for wildlife products and threat of extinction compounded by biodiversity narrowing compel to increased human-animal conflict and contact. Large quantities of animal waste generated due to animal agriculture may also allow rapid selection, amplification, dissemination of zoonotic pathogens and facilitate zoonotic pathogen adaptation and hinder host evolution for resistance. Public health system faces challenges to contain such epidemics due to inadequate understanding, poor preparedness, lack of interdisciplinary approach in surveillance and control strategy and deficient political commitments. Because the management measures are beyond the purview of health system alone, policy-level adaptation in the transdisciplinary issues are required, emphasizing the engagement of multiple stakeholders towards wildlife protection, alternative land use, community empowerment for natural resource management and regulation on business of wildlife products to ensure comprehensive one health practice.","['Debnath F', 'Chakraborty D', 'Deb AK', 'Saha MK', 'Dutta S']",2021,153,5&6,Indian J Med Res,"Debnath F, et al.

34633933,Assessing Global-Local Secondary Structure Fingerprints to Classify RNA Sequences with Deep Learning.,"RNA elements that are transcribed but not translated into proteins are called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They play wide-ranging roles in biological processes and disorders. Just like proteins, their structure is often intimately linked to their function. Many examples have been documented where structure is conserved across taxa despite sequence divergence. Thus, structure is often used to identify function. Specifically, the secondary structure is predicted and ncRNAs with similar structures are assumed to have same or similar functions. However, a strand of RNA can fold into multiple possible structures, and some strands even fold differently in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ncRNAs often function as RNA-protein complexes, which can affect structure. Because of these, we hypothesized using one structure per sequence may discard information, possibly resulting in poorer classification accuracy. Therefore, we propose using secondary structure fingerprints, comprising two categories: a higher-level representation derived from RNA-As-Graphs (RAG), and free energy fingerprints based on a curated repertoire of small structural motifs. The fingerprints take into account the difference between global and local structural matches. We also evaluated our deep learning architecture with k-mers. By combining our global-local fingerprints with 6-mer, we achieved an accuracy, precision, and recall of 91.04%, 91.10%, and 91.00%.","['Sutanto K', 'Turcotte M']",2021,PP,,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,Sutanto K and Turcotte M.

There are limited direct data on SARS-CoV-2 long-term immune responses and reinfection. The aim of this study is to use data on the durability of immunity among evolutionarily close coronavirus relatives of SARS-CoV-2 to estimate times to reinfection by a comparative evolutionary analysis of related viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63.
METHODS: We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the 
FINDINGS: We obtained antibody optical density data for six human-infecting coronaviruses, extending from 128 days to 28 years after infection between 1984 and 2020. These data provided a means to estimate profiles of the typical antibody decline and probabilities of reinfection over time under endemic conditions. Reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under endemic conditions would likely occur between 3 months and 5·1 years after peak antibody response, with a median of 16 months. This protection is less than half the duration revealed for the endemic coronaviruses circulating among humans (5-95% quantiles 15 months to 10 years for HCoV-OC43, 31 months to 12 years for HCoV-NL63, and 16 months to 12 years for HCoV-229E). For SARS-CoV, the 5-95% quantiles were 4 months to 6 years, whereas the 95% quantiles for MERS-CoV were inconsistent by dataset.
INTERPRETATION: The timeframe for reinfection is fundamental to numerous aspects of public health decision making. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, reinfection is likely to become increasingly common. Maintaining public health measures that curb transmission-including among individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2-coupled with persistent efforts to accelerate vaccination worldwide is critical to the prevention of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

34627061,Factors associated with poor outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Experience from a MERS-CoV referral hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in millions of deaths, including more than 6000 deaths in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Identifying key predictors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality among infected cases would help in identifying individuals at risk to optimize their care. We aimed to determine factors of poor outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large academic hospital in Riyadh, KSA that serves as a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) referral center.
METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients between March 15 and August 31, 2020. The study was conducted at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC). COVID-19 infection was confirmed using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-COV-2. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory, radiological features, and length of hospital stay were obtained. Poor outcomes were, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Out of 16,947 individuals tested in KSUMC, 3480 (20.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of those 743 patients (21%) were hospitalized. There were 62% males, 77% were younger than 65 years. Of all cases, 204 patients (28%) required ICU admission, 104 (14%) required IMV, and 117 (16%) died in hospital. In bivariate analysis, multiple factors were associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Further multivariate analysis revealed the following factors were associated with mortality: respiratory rate more than 24/min and systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg in the first 24h of presentation, lymphocyte count <1 × 10
CONCLUSION: Variable factors were identified as predictors of different outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The only predictor of IMV was a low initial Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The presence of tachypnea, hypotension, lymphopenia, and elevated AST in the first 48h of presentation were independently associated with mortality. This study provides possible independent predictors of mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation.

34626822,Alignment-free sequence comparison for virus genomes based on location correlation coefficient.,"Coronaviruses (especially SARS-CoV-2) are characterized by rapid mutation and wide spread. As these characteristics easily lead to global pandemics, studying the evolutionary relationship between viruses is essential for clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing has played an important role in evolutionary analysis. Recent alignment-free methods can overcome the problems of traditional alignment-based methods, which consume both time and space. This paper proposes a novel alignment-free method called the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV), which defines a correlation measure of the L-step delay of a nucleotide location from its location in the original DNA sequence. The numerical feature is a 16×L-dimensional numerical vector describing the distribution characteristics of the nucleotide positions in a DNA sequence. The proposed L-step delay correlation measure is interestingly related to some types of L+1 spaced mers. Unlike traditional gene comparison, our method avoids the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment, and hence improves the speed of sequence comparison. Our method is applied to evolutionary analysis of the common human viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Dengue virus, Hepatitis B virus, and human rhinovirus and achieves the same or even better results than alignment-based methods.

34624714,Bioinformatics analysis of rhinovirus capsid proteins VP1-4 sequences for cross-serotype vaccine development.,"BACKGROUND: Rhinoviruses (RV) are associated with the development and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They've also been linked to more severe diseases like pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, croup, and otitis media. Because of the hypervariable sequences in the same serotypes, no effective vaccine against rhinoviruses has been developed to date. With the availability of new full-length genome sequences for all RV-A and RV-B serotyped strains, this study used bioinformatics to find a suitable RV strain with the highest similarity matrices to the other strains.
METHODS: The full genomic sequences of all known different RV-A and -B prototypes were downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and divided into minor low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and major intercellular adhesion molecule groups (ICAM). The sequences were edited using Biological Sequence Alignment Editor, v 7.2.0 (BioEdit software) to study each capsid protein (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and analyzed using the EMBL-EBI ClustalW server and the more current Clustal Omega tool for the calculation of the identities and similarities.
RESULTS: We analyzed and predicted immunogenic motifs from capsid proteins that are conserved across distinct RV serotypes using a bioinformatics technique. The amino acid sequences of VP3 were found to be the most varied, while VP4 was the most conserved protein among all RV-A and RV-B strains. Among all strains studied, RV-74 demonstrated the highest degree of homology to other strains and could be a potential genetic source for recombinant protein production. Nine highly conserved regions with a minimum length of 9-mers were identified, which could serve as potential immune targets against rhinoviruses.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, bioinformatics analysis conducted in the current study has paved the way for the selection of immunogenic targets. Bioinformatically, the ideal strain's capsid protein is suggested to contain the most common RVs immunogenic sites.","['Alshrari AS', 'Hudu SA', 'Asdaq SMB', 'Ali AM', 'Kin CV', 'Omar AR', 'Pei CP', 'Sekawi Z']",2021,14,11,J Infect Public Health,"Alshrari AS, et al.

34609683,Association between human coronaviruses' epidemic and environmental factors on a global scale.,"Environmental factors could influence the epidemic of virus in human; however, the association remains intricate, and the evidence is still not clear in human coronaviruses (HCoVs). We aimed to explore and compare the associations between HCoVs' epidemic and environmental factors globally. Four common HCoVs' data were collected by a systematic literature review, and data of MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 were collected from the World Health Organization's reports. Monthly positive rates of common HCoVs and incidence rates of MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 were calculated. Geographical coordinates were used to link virus data and environmental data. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to quantitatively estimate the association of environmental factors with HCoVs' epidemic. We found that there are wide associations between HCoVs and environmental factors on a global scale, and some of the associations were nonlinear. In addition, COVID-19 has the most similarities in associations' direction with common HCoVs, especially for HCoV-HKU1 in four environmental factors including the significantly negative associations with average temperature, precipitation, vegetation coverage (p<0.05), and the U-shaped association with temperature range. This study strengthened the relevant research evidences and provided significant insights into the epidemic rules of HCoVs in general. The similarities between COVID-19 and common HCoVs indicated that it is critically important to strengthen surveillance on common HCoVs and pay more attention to environmental factors' role in surveillance and early warning of HCoVs' epidemic.","['Yan X', 'Wang Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhang X', 'Wang L', 'Lu Z', 'Jia Z']",2022,29,10,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Yan X, et al.

34607539,"The Relation of the Viral Structure of SARS-CoV-2, High-Risk Condition, and Plasma Levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15 in COVID-19 Patients Compared to SARS and MERS Infections.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) has a high mortality rate due to widespread infection and strong immune system reaction. Interleukins (ILs) are among the main immune factors contributing to the deterioration of the immune response and the formation of cytokine storms in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infections.
INTRODUCTION: This review article aimed at investigating the relationship between virus structure, risk factors, and patient plasma interleukin levels in infections caused by the coronavirus family.
METHODS: The keywords ""interleukin,"" ""coronavirus structure,"" ""plasma,"" and ""risk factors"" were searched to find a relationship among different interleukins, coronavirus structures, and risk factors in ISI, PUBMED, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases.
RESULTS: Patients with high-risk conditions with independent panels of immune system markers are more susceptible to death caused by SARS-CoV-2. IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15 are probably secreted at different levels in patients with coronavirus infections despite the similarity of inflammatory markers. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV increase the secretion of IL-4, while it remains unchanged in MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection demonstrates increased IL-10 levels. Although IL-10 levels usually increase in SARS-CoV infection, different levels are recorded in SARS-CoV-2, i.e., it increases in some patients while it decreases in others. This difference may be due to factors such as the patient's condition and the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. MERS-CoV increases IL-15 secretion while its levels remain unchanged in SARS-CoV-2. The levels of IL-15 in patients with SARS-CoV have not been studied.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the different structures of SARS-CoV-2, such as length of spike or nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and susceptibility of patients due to differences in their risk factors, may lead to differences in immune marker secretion and pathogenicity. Therefore, identifying and controlling interleukin levels can play a significant role in managing the symptoms and developing individual-specific treatments.","['Mousavizadeh L', 'Soltani R', 'Abedini K', 'Ghasemi S']",2022,22,7,Curr Mol Med,"Mousavizadeh L, et al.

34602210,Colorimetric and electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen with a gold nanoparticle-based biosensor.,"Since emerging in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread globally, wreaked havoc for public health and economies worldwide and, given the high infectivity and unexpectedly rapid spread of the virus responsible-that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-urged the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. In response, reducing the virus's adverse effects requires developing methods of early diagnosis that are reliable, are inexpensive and offer rapid response. As demonstrated in this article, the colorimetric and electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen with gold nanoparticle-based biosensors may be one such method. In the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, gold nanoparticles aggregated rapidly and irreversibly due to antibody-antigen interaction and consequently changed in colour from red to purple, as easily observable with the naked eye or UV-Vis spectrometry by way of spectral redshifting with a detection limit of 48 ng/mL. Moreover, electrochemical detection was achieved by dropping developed probe solution onto the commercially available and disposable screen-printed gold electrode without requiring any electrode preparation and modification. The method identified 1 pg/mL of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and showed a linear response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. Both methods were highly specific to detecting the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen but not other antigens, including influenza A (i.e. H1N1), MERS-CoV and Streptococcus pneumoniae, even at high concentrations.","['Karakuş E', 'Erdemir E', 'Demirbilek N', 'Liv L']",2021,1182,,Anal Chim Acta,"Karakuş E, et al.

Previous experience with co-infections and superinfections in patients infected with other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS), the influenza patients admitted to hospitals and prevention of the unknown led to the increased empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in hospitals. The breakdown of antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs determine an increase in infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly in intensive care units. Most of these infections are related to high-risk carbapenemase-producing clones and occasionally with resistance to new β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. On the contrary, in the primary care, there has been a decrease in the use of antimicrobials during the first wave, although it would not have had a significant impact on pathogens associated with community-acquired infections. The accumulated experience reaffirms the need to maintain antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs in future health crises.","['Ruiz-Garbajosa P', 'Cantón R']",2021,34 Suppl 1,Suppl1,Rev Esp Quimioter,Ruiz-Garbajosa P and Cantón R.

34589184,Structural determinants of peptide-dependent TAP1-TAP2 transit passage targeted by viral proteins and altered by cancer-associated mutations.,"The TAP1-TAP2 complex transports antigenic peptide substrates into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In ER, the peptides are further processed and loaded on the major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules by the peptide loading complex (PLC). The TAP transporters are linked with the PLC; a target for cancers and viral immune evasion. But the mechanisms whereby the cancer-derived mutations in TAP1-TAP2 or viral factors targeting the PLC, interfere peptide transport are only emerging. This study describes that transit of peptides through TAP can take place via two different channels (4 or 8 helices) depending on peptide length and sequence. Molecular dynamics and binding affinity predictions of peptide-transporters demonstrated that smaller peptides (8-10 mers; e.g. AAGIGILTV, SIINFEKL) can transport quickly through the transport tunnel compared to longer peptides (15-mer; e.g. ENPVVHFFKNIVTPR). In line with a regulated and selective peptide transport by TAPs, the immunopeptidome upon IFN-γ treatment in melanoma cells induced the shorter length (9-mer) peptide presentation over MHC-I that exhibit a relatively weak binding affinity with TAP. A conserved distance between N and C terminus residues of the studied peptides in the transport tunnel were reported.

34585882,Clinical Spectrum of COVID-19 Cases and their Correlation with S.LDH Levels- An Observational Study from Southeast Rajasthan.,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus or commonly referred to as the covid-19, has been a threat to the global health as well as the world economy. It all started from the Wuhan city of china in December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia cases with severe acute respiratory symptoms were reported with unknown etiology, majority of cases linked to the exposure to wholesale seafood market in Hunan. On January 7th, after the nomenclature of this causative agent was done as Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID19, the struggles to combat and try to control this illness have only so far been less helpful as more and more countries have exponential proportion of cases. On the other side of the illness are the efforts being done constantly to study the characteristics of the virus, newer treatment agents, expanding testing facilities and finally to find a vaccine as soon as possible. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two beta corona viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20-24 have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the beta coronavirus. Four viruses - (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection. Although asymptomatic infected can also be a source. Transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact (defined as that within 1m distance and lasting for several minutes). A possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations has also not been denied as of yet. Since the information regarding the illness, the treatment principles have been in constant scrutiny and have been changed dynamically as we get to know more about the virus, studies of covid19 cases would be a major stepping stone in acquiring maximum if not hundred percent knowledge about covid19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational retrospective case study was done for a fixed duration of a month i.e from 23/05/2020 to 23/06/2020. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included under the study.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Age &gt;40yrs with symptoms of severe acute respiratory Illness (screened as per the symptom suggestive of acute respiratory illness, mohfw.gov.in) Asymptomatic aged &gt;40yrs with comorbidities and in direct contact with confirmed cases of covid19.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients. Autoimmune disease patients History of psychiatric illness The patients were isolated in different wards based on the presence or absence and severity of symptoms. Detailed history, general and systemic examination and investigations were done. Samples of throat and nasal swab were sent for RT-PCR assay of covid19 testing done by Real time reverse transcriptase based PCR. Regular monitoring of patients was done. Treatment given based on the most recent guidelines update by the ICMR and made available by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data was analysed by using SPSS 22.0 (trial version) software and T test, Chi-square Pierson's correlation and other appropriate statistical test will be used to analyse the data. Aims Objectives: To understand the symptomatology, disease course and complications of covid19. To study the changes in laboratory parameters in association with severity of illness. To study the effect of presence of comorbidities with respect to the outcome of covid19 Ethical Considerations: Since it being a retrospective observational study, complete patient confidentiality was being maintained while collecting and analysing the data as well as during the tabulation of the results.","['Gupta D', 'Sharma R', 'Patwardhan B', 'Mathur RD']",2021,69,9,J Assoc Physicians India,"Gupta D, et al.

The overall pooled prevalence of stigma across all populations was 34% [95% CI: 28-40%], including enacted stigma (36% [95% CI: 28-44%]) and perceived stigma (31% [95% CI: 22-40%]). The prevalence of stigma in patients, community population, and health care workers, was 38% [95% CI: 12- 65%], 36% [95% CI: 28-45%], and 30% [95% CI: 20-40%], respectively. The prevalence of stigma in participants from low- and middle-income countries was 37% [95% CI: 29-45%], which is higher than that from high-income countries (27% [95% CI: 18-36%]) though this difference was not statistically significant. A similar trend of prevalence of stigma was also observed in individuals with lower education (47% [95% CI: 23-71%]) compared to higher education level (33% [95% CI: 23-4%]).

Although coronavirus was first discovered in the 1960s and was known to cause respiratory infection in humans, no information was available about the epidemic pattern of the virus until the past two decades. This review addresses the pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, diagnosis, management strategies, the pattern of the past and present events, and the possibility of future outbreaks of the endemic human coronaviruses. Several studies have described bats as presumptive natural reservoirs of coronaviruses. In essence, the identification of a diverse group of similar SARS coronaviruses in bats suggests the possibility of a future epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-like) coronaviruses originating from different reservoir hosts. The study also identified a lack of vaccines to prevent human coronavirus infections in humans in the past, however, the recent breakthrough in vaccine discovery and approval for emergency use for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is commendable. The high rates of genomic substitution and recombination due to errors in RNA replication and the potential for independent species crossing suggest the chances of an entirely new strain evolving. Therefore, rapid research efforts should be deployed for vaccination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a possible future outbreak. More sensitization and enlightenment on the need to adopt good personal hygiene practices, social distancing, and scientific evaluation of existing medications with promising antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 is required. In addition, intensive investigations to unravel and validate the possible reservoirs, the intermediate host, as well as insight into the ability of the virus to break the species barrier are needed to prevent future viral spillover and possible outbreaks.","['Kayode AJ', 'Banji-Onisile FO', 'Olaniran AO', 'Okoh AI']",2021,10,9,Pathogens,"Kayode AJ, et al.

34577722,Integrated Microfluidic-Based Platforms for On-Site Detection and Quantification of Infectious Pathogens: Towards On-Site Medical Translation of SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Platforms.,"The rapid detection and quantification of infectious pathogens is an essential component to the control of potentially lethal outbreaks among human populations worldwide. Several of these highly infectious pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been cemented in human history as causing epidemics or pandemics due to their lethality and contagiousness. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of these highly infectious pathogens that have recently become one of the leading causes of globally reported deaths, creating one of the worst economic downturns and health crises in the last century. As a result, the necessity for highly accurate and increasingly rapid on-site diagnostic platforms for highly infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically over the last two years. Current conventional non-microfluidic diagnostic techniques have limitations in their effectiveness as on-site devices due to their large turnaround times, operational costs and the need for laboratory equipment. In this review, we first present criteria, both novel and previously determined, as a foundation for the development of effective and viable on-site microfluidic diagnostic platforms for several notable pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. This list of criteria includes standards that were set out by the WHO, as well as our own ""seven pillars"" for effective microfluidic integration. We then evaluate the use of microfluidic integration to improve upon currently, and previously, existing platforms for the detection of infectious pathogens. Finally, we discuss a stage-wise means to translate our findings into a fundamental framework towards the development of more effective on-site SARS-CoV-2 microfluidic-integrated platforms that may facilitate future pandemic diagnostic and research endeavors. Through microfluidic integration, many limitations in currently existing infectious pathogen diagnostic platforms can be eliminated or improved upon.","['Escobar A', 'Chiu P', 'Qu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu CQ']",2021,12,9,Micromachines (Basel),"Escobar A, et al.

Similarly, to previous coronaviruses leading to past pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), a growing body of evidence support that a substantial minority of patients surviving the acute phase of the disease present with long-term sequelae lasting for up to 6 months following acute infection. The clinical spectrum of these manifestations is widespread across multiple organs and consists of the long-COVID-19 syndrome. The aim of the current review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the pulmonary manifestations of the long COVID-19 syndrome including clinical symptoms, parenchymal, and functional abnormalities, as well as highlight epidemiology, risk factors, and follow-up strategies for early identification and timely therapeutic interventions. The literature data on management considerations including the role of corticosteroids and antifibrotic treatment, as well as the therapeutic potential of a structured and personalized pulmonary rehabilitation program are detailed and discussed.","['Boutou AK', 'Asimakos A', 'Kortianou E', 'Vogiatzis I', 'Tzouvelekis A']",2021,11,9,J Pers Med,"Boutou AK, et al.

The widely used alignment-dependent approaches to study viral diversity are limited in their utility as sequence dissimilarity increases, particularly when expanded to the genus or higher ranks of viral species lineage. Herein, we present an alignment-independent algorithm, implemented as a tool, UNIQmin, to determine the effective viral sequence diversity at any rank of the viral taxonomy lineage.

34570933,"Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002. Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses are the most likely origin. The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted lineages. However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans and Artiodactyla. Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history of zoonotic transmission events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of Orthocoronavirinae. We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses. Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans. Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses.","['Jacob Machado D', 'Scott R', 'Guirales S', 'Janies DA']",2021,37,5,Cladistics,"Jacob Machado D, et al.

34568118,Flashback and lessons learnt from history of pandemics before COVID-19.,"With an increasing frequency of infectious disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic causing mortality around the world and the threat of similar future events looming large, mankind is faced with the herculean task of counteracting such threats with the best possible strategies and public health decisions. It is key that such decisions should be guided by previous examples of similar health emergencies. Here we review some of the significant infectious disease outbreaks, including epidemics and pandemics occurring worldwide in the past including their impact at population and global levels, unique challenges presented by each and the measures taken by authorities worldwide as well as the crucial lessons each epidemic or pandemic provided. This review highlights that throughout history measures such as contact tracing, quarantine and isolation have been incredibly effective in limiting an outbreak in its severity, thus ensuring accurate information flow to the public is as essential as limiting the spread of misinformation. With global populations rising, surveillance for emerging and re-emerging pathogens will play an immense role in preventing future epidemics or pandemics. And finally that even though for novel strains or pathogens, although vaccines are thought to be an irreplaceable defense, but their development and distribution in time to curb an epidemic has seldom been witnessed and remains an important challenge for the future. Hence, we conclude that looking at these past examples not only highlights the important knowledge gained for the strategies to devise, but also the mistakes that can be avoided in the way forward.","['Parihar S', 'Kaur RJ', 'Singh S']",2021,10,7,J Family Med Prim Care,"Parihar S, et al.

34565757,AI for the collective analysis of a massive number of genome sequences: various examples from the small genome of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 to the human genome.,"In genetics and related fields, huge amounts of data, such as genome sequences, are accumulating, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) suitable for big data analysis has become increasingly important. Unsupervised AI that can reveal novel knowledge from big data without prior knowledge or particular models is highly desirable for analyses of genome sequences, particularly for obtaining unexpected insights. We have developed a batch-learning self-organizing map (BLSOM) for oligonucleotide compositions that can reveal various novel genome characteristics. Here, we explain the data mining by the BLSOM: an unsupervised AI. As a specific target, we first selected SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) because a large number of viral genome sequences have been accumulated via worldwide efforts. We analyzed more than 0.6 million sequences collected primarily in the first year of the pandemic. BLSOMs for short oligonucleotides (e.g., 4-6-mers) allowed separation into known clades, but longer oligonucleotides further increased the separation ability and revealed subgrouping within known clades. In the case of 15-mers, there is mostly one copy in the genome; thus, 15-mers that appeared after the epidemic started could be connected to mutations, and the BLSOM for 15-mers revealed the mutations that contributed to separation into known clades and their subgroups. After introducing the detailed methodological strategies, we explain BLSOMs for various topics, such as the tetranucleotide BLSOM for over 5 million 5-kb fragment sequences derived from almost all microorganisms currently available and its use in metagenome studies. We also explain BLSOMs for various eukaryotes, including fishes, frogs and Drosophila species, and found a high separation ability among closely related species. When analyzing the human genome, we found enrichments in transcription factor-binding sequences in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. The tDNAs (tRNA genes) could be separated according to their corresponding amino acid.","['Ikemura T', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Wada K', 'Wada Y', 'Abe T']",2021,96,4,Genes Genet Syst,"Ikemura T, et al.

34563415,The first pediatric case of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) associated with Neisseria meningitidis.,"BACKGROUND: Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is a clinic-radiological syndrome characterized by neurological deficiencies and reversible magnetic resonance imaging findings in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Usually, it has a good prognosis, and patients recover without any sequelae. A viral infection has caused most MERS cases, and bacterial agents have rarely been reported as a cause of MERS.
CASE REPORT: A 5-month-old male was admitted to the hospital with fever, poor feeding, decreased activity and groaning. He had focal seizures and required mechanical ventilation. A lumbar puncture was performed, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of cerebral spinal fluid was positive for non-typeable serogroup of Neisseria meningitidis. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on day 3 of admission showed T2 hyperintensity and diffusion restriction at the splenium of corpus callosum (SCC). Diffusion restriction in the occipital horn of the left ventricular compatible with empyema was also obvious. According to the findings on cranial MRI, this clinical course was diagnosed as MERS associated with meningitis. His fever resolved in one week, cefotaxime was discontinued after 14 days, and the patient completely recovered. A follow-up MRI performed after three weeks of admission showed complete resolution of the signal intensity changes in the SCC and the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of MERS associated with Neisseria meningitidis in children. Bacterial agents as a cause of MERS should be kept in mind, and we should avoid unnecessary treatment strategies due to the good prognosis of MERS in children.","['Ozenen GG', 'Sahbudak Bal Z', 'Ersayoglu I', 'Eraslan C', 'Aydemir S', 'Ozkinay F', 'Kurugol Z']",2022,44,2,Brain Dev,"Ozenen GG, et al.

34562891,Detection of Infectious Viruses Using CRISPR-Cas12-Based Assay.,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has severely influenced public health and economics. For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein (Cas)-based assays have been emerged because of their simplicity, sensitivity, specificity, and wide applicability. Herein, we have developed a CRISPR-Cas12-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In the assay, the target amplicons are produced by isothermal reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and recognized by a CRISPR-Cas12a/guide RNA (gRNA) complex that is coupled with the collateral cleavage activity of fluorophore-tagged probes, allowing either a fluorescent measurement or naked-eye detection on a lateral flow paper strip. This assay enables the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 at a low concentration of 10 copies per sample. Moreover, the reliability of the method is verified by using nasal swabs and sputum of COVID-19 patients. We also proved that the current assay can be applied to other viruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), with no major changes to the basic scheme of testing. It is anticipated that the CRISPR-Cas12-based assay has the potential to serve as a point-of-care testing (POCT) tool for a wide range of infectious viruses.","['Talwar CS', 'Park KH', 'Ahn WC', 'Kim YS', 'Kwon OS', 'Yong D', 'Kang T', 'Woo E']",2021,11,9,Biosensors (Basel),"Talwar CS, et al.

The mechanisms of coronavirus transmission and dissemination in the human body determine the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. An important problem is the possibility that viral particles overcome tissue barriers such as the intestine, respiratory tract, blood-brain barrier, and placenta. In this work, we will 1) consider the issue of endocytosis and the possibility of transcytosis and paracellular trafficking of coronaviruses across tissue barriers with an emphasis on the intestinal epithelium; 2) discuss the possibility of antibody-mediated transcytosis of opsonized viruses due to complexes of immunoglobulins with their receptors; 3) assess the possibility of the virus transfer into extracellular vesicles during intracellular transport; and 4) describe the clinical significance of these processes.

34555693,A simple pan-specific RNN model for predicting HLA-II binding peptides.,"The prediction of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II binding peptides plays important roles in understanding the mechanism of immune recognition and developing effective epitope-based vaccines. In this work, gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) was successfully employed to establish a pan-specific prediction model of HLA-II-binding peptides by using only the HLA and peptide sequence information. In comparison with the existing pan-specific models of HLA-II-binding peptides, the GRU-based RNN model covered a broad spectrum of HLA-II molecules including 50 HLA-DR, 47 HLA-DQ, and 19 HLA-DP molecules with peptide lengths varying from 8 to 43 mers. The results demonstrated strong discriminant capabilities of the GRU-based RNN model, of which the AUC values were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.88 for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. Also, the GRU-based model showed state-of-the-art performances in predicting the binding peptides with the length ranging from 8-32 mers, which provides an efficient method for predicting HLA-II-binding peptides of longer lengths in comparison with the available methods. Overall, taking the advantages of the RNN architecture, the established pan-specific GRU model can be used for predicting accurately the HLA-II-binding peptides in a simple and direct manner.","['Heng Y', 'Kuang Z', 'Xie W', 'Lan H', 'Huang S', 'Chen L', 'Shi T', 'Xu L', 'Pan X', 'Mei H']",2021,139,,Mol Immunol,"Heng Y, et al.

DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: In July 2020, we searched Medline, PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), BNI (ProQuest), WHO COVID-19 Database (https://search.bvsalud.org/) MedRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/), bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) and also Google Scholar, TRIP database and NICE Evidence, forwards citation searching and reference checking of included papers, from 2016 onwards.
REVIEW METHODS: We included quantitative and qualitative research reporting (i) the views, perceptions and experiences of patients who have received fundamental nursing care whilst in hospital with COVID-19, MERS, SARS, H1N1 or EVD or (ii) the views, perceptions and experiences of professional nurses and non-professionally registered care workers who have provided that care. We included review articles, commentaries, protocols and guidance documents. One reviewer performed data extraction and quality appraisal and was checked by another person.
RESULTS: Of 3086 references, we included 64 articles; 19 empirical research and 45 review articles, commentaries, protocols and guidance documents spanning five pandemics. Four main themes (and 11 sub-themes) were identified. Barriers to delivering fundamental care were wearing personal protective equipment, adequate staffing, infection control procedures and emotional challenges of care. These barriers were addressed by multiple adaptations to communication, organization of care, staff support and leadership.
CONCLUSION: To prepare for continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, evaluative studies of adaptations to fundamental healthcare delivery must be prioritized to enable evidence-based care to be provided in future.
IMPACT: Our review identifies the barriers nurses experience in providing fundamental care during a pandemic, highlights potential adaptations that address barriers and ensure positive healthcare experiences and draws attention to the need for evaluative research on fundamental care practices during pandemics.","['Whear R', 'Abbott RA', 'Bethel A', 'Richards DA', 'Garside R', 'Cockcroft E', 'Iles-Smith H', 'Logan PA', 'Rafferty AM', 'Shepherd M', 'Sugg HVR', 'Russell AM', 'Cruickshank S', 'Tooze S', 'Melendez-Torres GJ', 'Thompson Coon J']",2022,78,1,J Adv Nurs,"Whear R, et al.

34554082,Rapid and accurate SNP genotyping of clonal bacterial pathogens with BioHansel.,"Hierarchical genotyping approaches can provide insights into the source, geography and temporal distribution of bacterial pathogens. Multiple hierarchical SNP genotyping schemes have previously been developed so that new isolates can rapidly be placed within pre-computed population structures, without the need to rebuild phylogenetic trees for the entire dataset. This classification approach has, however, seen limited uptake in routine public health settings due to analytical complexity and the lack of standardized tools that provide clear and easy ways to interpret results. The BioHansel tool was developed to provide an organism-agnostic tool for hierarchical SNP-based genotyping. The tool identifies split k-mers that distinguish predefined lineages in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data using SNP-based genotyping schemes. BioHansel uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm to type isolates from assembled genomes or raw read sequence data in a matter of seconds, with limited computational resources. This makes BioHansel ideal for use by public health agencies that rely on WGS methods for surveillance of bacterial pathogens.

34552197,Computational modeling and experimental validation of the EPI-X4/CXCR4 complex allows rational design of small peptide antagonists.,"EPI-X4, a 16-mer fragment of albumin, is a specific endogenous antagonist and inverse agonist of the CXC-motif-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and thus a key regulator of CXCR4 function. Accordingly, activity-optimized synthetic derivatives of EPI-X4 are promising leads for the therapy of CXCR4-linked disorders such as cancer or inflammatory diseases. We investigated the binding of EPI-X4 to CXCR4, which so far remained unclear, by means of biomolecular simulations combined with experimental mutagenesis and activity studies. We found that EPI-X4 interacts through its N-terminal residues with CXCR4 and identified its key interaction motifs, explaining receptor antagonization. Using this model, we developed shortened EPI-X4 derivatives (7-mers) with optimized receptor antagonizing properties as new leads for the development of CXCR4 inhibitors. Our work reveals the molecular details and mechanism by which the first endogenous peptide antagonist of CXCR4 interacts with its receptor and provides a foundation for the rational design of improved EPI-X4 derivatives.","['Sokkar P', 'Harms M', 'Stürzel C', 'Gilg A', 'Kizilsavas G', 'Raasholm M', 'Preising N', 'Wagner M', 'Kirchhoff F', 'Ständker L', 'Weidinger G', 'Mayer B', 'Münch J', 'Sanchez-Garcia E']",2021,4,1,Commun Biol,"Sokkar P, et al.

34549987,Direct Activation of Endothelial Cells by SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Is Blocked by Simvastatin.,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may help prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.

34545371,A strategy to assess spillover risk of bat SARS-related coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.,"Emerging diseases caused by coronaviruses of likely bat origin (e.g. SARS, MERS, SADS and COVID-19) have disrupted global health and economies for two decades. Evidence suggests that some bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) could infect people directly, and that their spillover is more frequent than previously recognized. Each zoonotic spillover of a novel virus represents an opportunity for evolutionary adaptation and further spread; therefore, quantifying the extent of this ""hidden"" spillover may help target prevention programs. We derive biologically realistic range distributions for known bat SARSr-CoV hosts and quantify their overlap with human populations. We then use probabilistic risk assessment and data on human-bat contact, human SARSr-CoV seroprevalence, and antibody duration to estimate that ∼400,000 people (median: ∼50,000) are infected with SARSr-CoVs annually in South and Southeast Asia. These data on the geography and scale of spillover can be used to target surveillance and prevention programs for potential future bat-CoV emergence.","['Sánchez CA', 'Li H', 'Phelps KL', 'Zambrana-Torrelio C', 'Wang LF', 'Olival KJ', 'Daszak P']",2021,,,medRxiv,"Sánchez CA, et al.

34545074,Multi-level inhibition of coronavirus replication by chemical ER stress.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens for which no specific treatment is available. Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be exploited to suppress CoV replication. The ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types including primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells, (partially) reverses the virus-induced translational shut-down, improves viability of infected cells and counteracts the CoV-mediated downregulation of IRE1α and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide analyses revealed specific pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral state, including essential (HERPUD1) or novel (UBA6 and ZNF622) factors of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein degradation complexes. Additionally, thapsigargin blocks the CoV-induced selective autophagic flux involving p62/SQSTM1. The data show that thapsigargin hits several central mechanisms required for CoV replication, suggesting that this compound (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs.","['Shaban MS', 'Müller C', 'Mayr-Buro C', 'Weiser H', 'Meier-Soelch J', 'Albert BV', 'Weber A', 'Linne U', 'Hain T', 'Babayev I', 'Karl N', 'Hofmann N', 'Becker S', 'Herold S', 'Schmitz ML', 'Ziebuhr J', 'Kracht M']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Shaban MS, et al.

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) posing a serious threat to global public health and local economies. There are three responsible for this disease; SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Whereas our goal is to test the affinity for a new class of compounds obtained from a hybridization of Chloroquine, Amodiaquine and Mefloquine with three targets SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in order to find new compounds as new inhibitors against Covid-19. In this work, we first used: the molecular docking/dynamics methods and ADME properties to study interaction and affinity between eight new compounds against three targets involved in the Covid-19. The results of the docking simulations and dynamics revealed that inhibitor of the malaria (Ligand 87) has an affinity to interact with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV targets and they can be good inhibitors for treatment of Covid-19. Moreover, they give best affinity compared to the Remdesivir and Chloroquine and other clinical tests.

34536059,Genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses and comparative genetic analysis of MERS-related coronaviruses in South Korea.,"Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir of several potentially zoonotic viruses, including Lyssavirus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV). Here, we performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of South Korean bat viruses. Genetic comparative analysis was performed on the spike glycoprotein gene of the detected MERS-related CoVs. Among 1640 samples (348 oral swabs, 1199 faecal samples, 83 urine samples and 10 bat carcass) collected across 24 South Korean provinces during 2017-2019, CoV was detected in 82 samples (75 faeces and seven oral swab samples) from 11 provinces. Surveillance over the 3 years during which samples were collected revealed significantly higher CoV detection rates between spring and autumn, and a high detection rate in Vespertillionidae and Rhinolophidae bats. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Korean bat CoVs are genetically diverse regardless of their spatiotemporal distribution and their host species, and that the discovered bat CoVs belong to various subgenera within the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera. Twenty detected MERS-related CoVs belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus were similar to the Ia io bat CoV NL140422 and NL13845 strains. A comprehensive genetic analysis of two Korean bat MERS-related CoV spike receptor binding domain (RBDs) (176 and 267 strains) showed that the 18 critical residues that are involved in interactions with the human DPP4 receptor are most similar to the NL13845 strain, which is known to not bind with hDPP4. A deeper analysis of the interfacing residues in the Korean bat MERS-related CoVs RBD-hDPP4 complexes showed that the Korean bat CoVs has fewer polar contacts than the NL13845 strain. Although further study will be needed, these results suggest that Korean bat MERS-related CoVs are unlikely to bind with hDPP4. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring to identifying the origin of new infectious diseases, specifically mutant CoV.","['Lee SY', 'Chung CU', 'Park JS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim YS', 'Na EJ', 'Kim Y', 'Oem JK']",2022,69,4,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Lee SY, et al.

34529572,Extraction of long k-mers using spaced seeds.,"The extraction of k-mers from reads is an important task in many bioinformatics applications, such as all DNA sequence analysis methods based on de Bruijn graphs. These methods tend to be more accurate when the used k-mers are unique in the analyzed DNA, and thus the use of longer k-mers is preferred. When the read lengths of short read sequencing technologies increase, the error rate will become the determining factor for the largest possible value of k. Here we propose LoMeX which uses spaced seeds to extract long k-mers accurately even in the presence of sequencing errors. Our experiments show that LoMeX can extract long k-mers from current Illumina reads with a similar or higher recall than a standard k-mer counting tool. Furthermore, our experiments on simulated data show that when the read length further increases enabling even longer k-mers, the performance of standard k-mer counters declines, whereas LoMeX still extracts long k-mers successfully.","['Leinonen M', 'Salmela L']",2021,PP,,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,Leinonen M and Salmela L.

34524795,Early Warning Diagnostics for Emerging Infectious Diseases in Developing into Late-Stage Pandemics.,"The spread of infectious diseases due to travel and trade can be seen throughout history, whether from early settlers or traveling businessmen. Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks-SARS, MERS, swine flu, and COVID-19-has demonstrated that the causative viruses were circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies chronologically from pre-human predictive technologies to population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally, as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks and pandemics.","['Oeschger TM', 'McCloskey DS', 'Buchmann RM', 'Choubal AM', 'Boza JM', 'Mehta S', 'Erickson D']",2021,54,19,Acc Chem Res,"Oeschger TM, et al.

34520491,"Development of in-house, indirect ELISAs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-associated serology in COVID-19 patients in Panama.","COVID-19 is the name of the acute respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of those that caused the severe outbreaks of SARS and MERS several years ago. Since first appearance on December of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has cause extremely high levels of mortality, morbidity, global economic breakdown, and the consequent human suffering. The main diagnostic test for the confirmation of symptomatic individuals is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, serology techniques, such as ELISA are useful to measure the antibodies produced in humans after contact with the virus, as well as the direct presence of viral antigens. In this study we aim to assemble and evaluate four ELISA assays to measure the presence of IgG or IgM specific for the viral Spike protein in COVID-19 patients, using either the full recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or the fragment corresponding to the receptor binding domain. As a control, we analyzed a group of pre-pandemic serum samples obtained before 2017. Strong reactivity was observed against both antigens. A few pre-pandemic samples displayed high OD values, suggesting the possibility of some cross reactivity. All four assays show very good repeatability, both intra- and inter-assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis allowed the definition of cutoffs and evaluation of performance for each ELISA by estimation of the area under the curve. This performance parameter was high for all tests (AUC range: 0.98-0.99). Multiple comparisons between tests revealed no significant difference between each other (P values: 0.24-0.95). Our results show that both antigens are effective to detect both specific IgG and IgM antibodies, with high sensitivity (range 0.92-0.99), specificity (range 0.93-0.97) and congruence with the RT-PCR test (Cohen´s Kappa range 0.87-0.93). These assays will allow health authorities to have a new tool to estimate seroprevalence, in order to manage and improve the severe sanitary situation caused by this virus.","['de la Guardia C', 'Rangel G', 'Villarreal A', 'Goodridge A', 'Fernández PL', 'Lleonart R']",2021,16,9,PLoS One,"de la Guardia C, et al.

Given a draft genome, one first task is to determine its phylogenetic context, that is, to place it relative to the set of related reference genomes. We provide a new interactive graphical tool that addresses this task using Mash sketches to compare against all bacterial and archaeal representative genomes in the Genome Taxonomy Database taxonomy, all within the framework of SplitsTree5. The phylogenetic context of the query sequences is then displayed as a phylogenetic outline, a new type of phylogenetic network that is more general than a phylogenetic tree, but significantly less complex than other types of phylogenetic networks. We propose to use such networks, rather than trees, to represent phylogenetic context, because they can express uncertainty in the placement of taxa, whereas a tree must always commit to a specific branching pattern. We illustrate the new method using a number of draft genomes of different assembly quality.","['Bagci C', 'Bryant D', 'Cetinkaya B', 'Huson DH']",2021,13,9,Genome Biol Evol,"Bagci C, et al.

34517762,MOV10 Helicase Interacts with Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein and Has Antiviral Activity.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emergent pathogens that may cause life-threatening respiratory diseases in humans. Understanding of CoV-host interactions may help to identify novel therapeutic targets. MOV10 is an RNA helicase involved in different steps of cellular RNA metabolism. Both MOV10 antiviral and proviral activities have been described in a limited number of viruses, but this protein has not been previously associated with CoVs. We found that during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, MOV10 aggregated in cytoplasmic structures colocalizing with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. MOV10-N interaction was confirmed by endogenous MOV10 coimmunoprecipitation, and the presence of other cellular proteins was also detected in MOV10 complexes. MOV10 silencing significantly increased both N protein accumulation and virus titer, with no changes in the accumulation of viral RNAs. Moreover, MOV10 overexpression caused a 10-fold decrease in viral titers. These data indicated that MOV10 has antiviral activity during MERS-CoV infection. We postulated that this activity could be mediated by viral RNA sequestration, and in fact, RNA immunoprecipitation data showed the presence of viral RNAs in the MOV10 cytoplasmic complexes. Expression of wild-type MOV10 or of a MOV10 mutant without helicase activity in MOV10 knockout cell lines, developed by CRISPR-Cas technology, indicated that the helicase activity of MOV10 was required for its antiviral effect. Interestingly MOV10-N interaction was conserved in other mildly or highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although MOV10 antiviral activity was found only in highly pathogenic CoVs, suggesting a potential role of MOV10 in the modulation of human CoVs pathogenesis.

CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old man is admitted with fever, intense hemicranial headache, disorientation, dysarthria and paresthesia in the lips and both upper extremities is presented; and that he is admitted for a suspected diagnosis of viral encephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an elevation of proteins and the electroencephalogram shows generalized slowing, predominantly on the left. MRI shows a well-defined ovoid lesion, isolated in the splenium of the corpus callosum, homogeneous and hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR, with restriction to fluid diffusion and without uptake after gadolinium administration. The patient received empirical treatment with acyclovir and corticosteroids, with good subsequent evolution and disappearance of the lesion described in the control MRI at 3 weeks.

Only 10 proteins are diagnostic of asymptomatic cases, 12 are prognostic of recovery from severe illness, and 28 are prognostic of a fatal outcome of COVID-19. These proteins are implicated in virus-specific/related signaling networks. Notable among the top canonical pathways are humoral immunity, inflammation, acute-phase response signaling, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, coagulation, and the complement system. Furthermore, we confirmed positive viral shedding in 11.76% of 51 additional peripheral blood samples, indicating that caution should be taken to avoid the possible risk of transfusion of infected blood products.
CONCLUSION: We identified COVID-19 and MERS-CoV protein panels that have potential as biomarkers and might assist in the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identified markers further our understanding of COVID-19 disease pathophysiology and may have prognostic or therapeutic potential in predicting or managing host cell responses to human COVID-19 and MERS-CoV infections.","['Alaiya A', 'Alshukairi A', 'Shinwari Z', 'Al-Fares M', 'Alotaibi J', 'AlOmaim W', 'Alsharif I', 'Bakheet R', 'Alharbi L', 'Allam R', 'Asiri A', 'Memish Z', 'Alromaih K', 'Al-Mozaini M']",2021,14,,J Inflamm Res,"Alaiya A, et al.

34499320,Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Viral Disease: Implications for Viral Vaccine Development.,"Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) is a serious barrier to attaining successful virus vaccines in human and veterinary medicine. VAED occurs as two different immunopathologies, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and vaccine-associated hypersensitivity (VAH). ADE contributes to the pathology of disease caused by four dengue viruses (DENV) through control of the intensity of cellular infection. Products of virus-infected cells are toxic. A partially protective yellow fever chimeric tetravalent DENV vaccine sensitized seronegative children to ADE breakthrough infections. A live-attenuated tetravalent whole virus vaccine in phase III testing appears to avoid ADE by providing durable protection against the four DENV. VAH sensitization by viral vaccines occurred historically. Children given formalin-inactivated measles or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines experienced severe disease during breakthrough infections. Tissue responses demonstrated that VAH not ADE caused these vaccine safety problems. Subsequently, measles was successfully and safely contained by a live-attenuated virus vaccine. The difficulty in formulating a safe and effective RSV vaccine is troublesome evidence that avoiding VAH is a major research challenge. VAH-like tissue responses were observed during breakthrough homologous virus infections in monkeys given severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccines.",['Halstead SB'],2021,35,5,BioDrugs,Halstead SB.

Virus-induced pneumonia in humans results from animal contact, with a potential for limited onward transmission. Phenotypic changes have been suspected after a novel recombinant clade (lineage 5) caused large nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea in 2016. However, there has been no functional assessment. Here we perform a comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo comparison of viruses from parental and recombinant virus lineages (lineage 3, n = 7; lineage 4, n = 8; lineage 5, n = 9 viruses) from Saudi Arabia, isolated immediately before and after the shift toward lineage 5. Replication of lineage 5 viruses is significantly increased. Transcriptional profiling finds reduced induction of immune genes IFNB1, CCL5, and IFNL1 in lung cells infected with lineage 5 strains. Phenotypic differences may be determined by IFN antagonism based on experiments using IFN receptor knock out and signaling inhibition. Additionally, lineage 5 is more resilient against IFN pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells (ca. 10-fold difference in replication). This phenotypic change associated with lineage 5 has remained undiscovered by viral sequence surveillance, but may be a relevant indicator of pandemic potential.","['Schroeder S', 'Mache C', 'Kleine-Weber H', 'Corman VM', 'Muth D', 'Richter A', 'Fatykhova D', 'Memish ZA', 'Stanifer ML', 'Boulant S', 'Gultom M', 'Dijkman R', 'Eggeling S', 'Hocke A', 'Hippenstiel S', 'Thiel V', 'Pöhlmann S', 'Wolff T', 'Müller MA', 'Drosten C']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Schroeder S, et al.

MERS is associated with many potential etiologies, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in children. We report an adult patient with CMV-associated MERS.
CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 25-year-old man was admitted with a 4-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an isolated lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum with hyperintensity on T2 and diffusion-weighted sequences and reduced values on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. High throughput gene detection for pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid revealed infection with CMV. The splenial lesion resolved 4 weeks after onset.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report an adult patient with CMV-associated MERS.

It holds for many species, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, for ranges of k which may vary from 7 to 10 as chromosomal lengths vary from 2Mbp to 200 Mbp. Building on this formalism we introduce the concept of k-mer distances between chromosomes. We formulate two k-mer distance measures, D
RESULTS: After defining the various distance measures and summarizing their properties, we also define proximities that rely on the existence of synteny blocks between chromosomes of different bacterial strains. Comparing pairs of strains of bacteria, we find negative correlations between synteny proximities and k-mer distances, thus establishing the meaning of the latter as measures of evolutionary distances among bacterial strains. The synteny measures we use are appropriate for closely related bacterial strains, where considerable sections of chromosomes demonstrate high direct or reversed equality. These measures are not appropriate for comparing different bacteria or eukaryotes. K-mer structural distances can be defined for all species. Because of the arbitrariness of strand choices, we employ only the D
CONCLUSIONS: k-mer distances reflect dissimilarities among global chromosomal structures. They carry information which aggregates all mutations. As such they can complement traditional evolution studies , which mainly concentrate on coding regions.","['Kafri A', 'Chor B', 'Horn D']",2021,22,1,BMC Genomics,"Kafri A, et al.

SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) was the first emerged virus from this family, followed by MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV or COVID 19), which is newly emerged. Many studies have been conducted on the application of chemical and natural drugs for treating these coronaviruses and they are mostly focused on inhibiting the proteases of viruses or blocking their protein receptors through binding to amino acid residues. Among many substances which are introduced to have an inhibitory effect against coronaviruses through the mentioned pathways, natural components are of specific interest. Secondary and primary metabolites from plants, are considered as potential drugs to have an inhibitory effect on coronaviruses. IC50 value (the concentration in which there is 50% loss in enzyme activity), molecular docking score and binding energy are parameters to understand the ability of metabolites to inhibit the specific virus. In this study we reviewed 154 papers on the effect of plant metabolites on different coronaviruses and data of their IC50 values, molecular docking scores and inhibition percentages are collected in tables. Secondary plant metabolites such as polyphenol, alkaloids, terpenoids, organosulfur compounds, saponins and saikosaponins, lectins, essential oil, and nicotianamine, and primary metabolites such as vitamins are included in this study.","['Farshi P', 'Kaya EC', 'Hashempour-Baltork F', 'Khosravi-Drani K']",2022,22,3,Mini Rev Med Chem,"Farshi P, et al.

Symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) typically include dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Recent studies on many COVID-19 patients in Italy and the United Kingdom found increasing anosmia and ageusia among the COVID-19-infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 possibly infects neurons in the nasal passage and disrupts the senses of smell and taste, like other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that could target the central nervous system. Developing a drug based on the T2Rs might be of better understanding and worth finding better molecules to act against COVID-19. In this research, we have taken a taste receptor agonist molecule to find a better core molecule that may act as the best resource to design a drug or corresponding derivatives. Based on the computational docking studies, the antibiotic tobramycin showed the best interaction against 6LU7 COVID-19 main protease. Aromatic carbonyl functional groups of the molecule established intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction with GLN189 amino acid and it showed the two strongest carbonyl interactions with receptor protein resulting in a glide score of -11.159. To conclude, depending on the molecular recognition of the GPCR proteins, the agonist molecule can be recognized to represent the cell secondary mechanism; thus, it provides enough confidence to design a suitable molecule based on the tobramycin drug.","['Dhanaraj P', 'Muthiah I', 'Rozbu MR', 'Nuzhat S', 'Paulraj MS']",2021,8,,Front Mol Biosci,"Dhanaraj P, et al.

34479078,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk healthcare workers in a MERS-CoV endemic area.,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia are a unique population who have had exposures to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It follows that HCWs from this country could have pre-existingMERS-CoV antibodies that may either protect from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or cause false SARS-CoV-2 seropositive results. In this article, we report the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk healthcare workers in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study enrolling 420 high-risk HCWs who are physically in contact with COVID-19 patients in three tertiary hospitals in Riyadh city. The participants were recruited between the 1st of July to the end of December 2020. A 3 ml of the venous blood samples were collected and tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk HCWs was 14.8% based on SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing while only 7.4% were positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for viral RNA. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 seropositive HCWs had symptoms and the most frequent symptoms were body aches, fever, cough, loss of smell and taste, and headache. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG was 1% (4 participants) and only one participant had dual seropositivity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Three MERS-CoV positive samples (75%) turned to be negative after using in-house ELISA and none of the MERS-CoV seropositive samples had detectable neutralization activity.
CONCLUSION: Our SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence results were higher than reported regional seroprevalence studies. This finding was expected and similar to other international findings that targeted high-risk HCWs. Our results provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2- seropositivity in Saudi Arabia similar to other countries was due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 rather than MERS-CoV antibody.","['Alroqi F', 'Masuadi E', 'Alabdan L', 'Nogoud M', 'Aljedaie M', 'Abu-Jaffal AS', 'Barhoumi T', 'Almasoud A', 'Alharbi NK', 'Alsaedi A', 'Khan M', 'Arabi YM', 'Nasr A']",2021,14,9,J Infect Public Health,"Alroqi F, et al.

A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach was applied for risk estimation using dose-response models (DRM) of different surrogate coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) and the virus responsible for most infectious respiratory illnesses (i.e., influenza A H5N1) due to the unavailability of DRM for SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of infectious concentration to genomic copies of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and also unavailable for other coronaviruses. Therefore, literature-based information on enteric viruses was used for formulating the ratio used for QMRA, although it is acknowledged that identifying this information for SARS-CoV-2 is a priority, and in the absence of information specific to SARS-CoV-2, another coronavirus would be a preferable surrogate to the enteric viruses used here.

During the past two decades alone, humans have experienced the emergence of several coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. To date, MERS-CoV has been detected in 27 countries, with a case fatality ratio of approximately 34.5%. Similar to other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV presumably originated from bats; however, the main reservoir and primary source of human infections are dromedary camels. Other species within the Camelidae family, such as Bactrian camels, alpacas, and llamas, seem to be susceptible to the infection as well, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, susceptibility studies on sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, chickens, and horses obtained divergent results. In the present study, we tested nasal swabs and/or sera from 55 sheep, 45 goats, and 52 cattle, collected at the largest livestock market in the United Arab Emirates, where dromedaries are also traded, for the presence of MERS-CoV nucleic acid by RT-qPCR, and for specific antibodies by immunofluorescence assay. All sera were negative for MERS-CoV-reactive antibodies, but the nasal swab of one sheep (1.8%) repeatedly tested positive for MERS-CoV nucleic acid. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the complete N gene of the sheep-derived MERS-CoV revealed >99% nucleotide identity to MERS-CoV sequences of five dromedaries in nearby pens and to three reference sequences. The NGS sequence of the sheep-derived MERS-CoV was confirmed by conventional RT-PCR of a part of the N gene and subsequent Sanger sequencing. All MERS-CoV sequences clustered within clade B, lineage 5.

34462471,A comparative recombination analysis of human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompts evaluation of recombination in human coronavirus (hCoV) evolution. We undertook recombination analyses of 158,118 public seasonal hCoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genome sequences using the RDP4 software. We found moderate evidence for 8 SARS-CoV-2 recombination events, two of which involved the spike gene, and low evidence for one SARS-CoV-1 recombination event. Within MERS-CoV, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 datasets, we noted 7, 1, 9, 14, and 1 high-confidence recombination events, respectively. There was propensity for recombination breakpoints in the non-ORF1 region of the genome containing structural genes, and recombination severely skewed the temporal structure of these data, especially for NL63 and OC43. Bayesian time-scaled analyses on recombinant-free data indicated the sampled diversity of seasonal CoVs emerged in the last 70 years, with 229E displaying continuous lineage replacements. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic based surveillance to detect recombination in SARS-CoV-2, particularly if recombination may lead to immune evasion.","['Pollett S', 'Conte MA', 'Sanborn M', 'Jarman RG', 'Lidl GM', 'Modjarrad K', 'Maljkovic Berry I']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Pollett S, et al.

34458641,Host gene variability and SARS-CoV-2 infection: A review article.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a global threat that influenced healthcare systems around the world. This virus caused an infection in humans with different clinical signs and syndromes, severity, and mortality. The key components of the COVID-19 molecular pathogenesis are coronavirus entry and replication, antigen presentation, humoral and cellular immunity, cytokine storm, coronavirus immune evasion. The analysis of recent literature displayed possible molecular targets in the key components of the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Some of these targets might have gene polymorphisms that influenced the COVID-19 course. Unfortunately, several findings are still putative or extrapolated from SARS and MERS experimental investigations or clinical trials. We systematised original data about gene polymorphisms of possible molecular targets and associations with the COVID-19 course. Most data were obtained for angiotensin-converting enzymes 1 and 2, TMPRSS2 gene polymorphisms. Only a few results were found for gene polymorphisms of adhesion molecules, interferon system components, cytokines, and transcriptional factors, oxidative stress and metabolic molecules, as well as haemocoagulation. Understanding the host gene variability and its associations with COVID-19 can provide insights into the disease pathogenesis, individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity, complications, and mortality prognosis for the disease. Besides, these data might help in the identification of appropriate targets for intervention.","['Kaidashev I', 'Shlykova O', 'Izmailova O', 'Torubara O', 'Yushchenko Y', 'Tyshkovska T', 'Kyslyi V', 'Belyaeva A', 'Maryniak D']",2021,7,8,Heliyon,"Kaidashev I, et al.

34458380,The microbiota-related coinfections in COVID-19 patients: a real challenge.,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected millions of people around the world, especially the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. The infection transmission rate is considered more rapid than other deadly pandemics and severe epidemics encountered earlier, such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza, Marburg, SARS, and MERS. The public health situation therefore is really at a challenging crossroads.
MAIN BODY: The internal and external and resident microbiota community is crucial in human health and is essential for immune responses. This community tends to be altered due to pathogenic infections which would lead to severity of the disease as it progresses. Few of these resident microflora become negatively active during infectious diseases leading to coinfection, especially the opportunistic pathogens. Once such a condition sets in, it is difficult to diagnose, treat, and manage COVID-19 in a patient.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the various reported possible coinfections that arise in COVID-19 patients vis-à-vis other serious pathological conditions. The local immunity in lungs, nasal passages, oral cavity, and salivary glands are involved with different aspects of COVID-19 transmission and pathology. Also, the role of adaptive immune system is discussed at the site of infection to control the infection along with the proinflammatory cytokine therapy.","['Mohapatra RK', 'Dhama K', 'Mishra S', 'Sarangi AK', 'Kandi V', 'Tiwari R', 'Pintilie L']",2021,10,1,Beni Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci,"Mohapatra RK, et al.

Although some repurposed drugs have shown potential therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, specific therapeutic agents targeting coronaviruses have not yet been developed. During coronavirus replication, a replicase gene cluster, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is alternatively translated via a process called -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) by an RNA pseudoknot structure encoded in viral RNAs. The coronavirus frameshifting has been identified previously as a target for antiviral therapy. In this study, the frameshifting efficiencies of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were determined using an in vitro -1 PRF assay system.

Although much progress has been made since the COVID-19 pandemic started, much about SARS-CoV-2 and its disease, COVID-19, is still poorly understood. The highly pathogenic hCoVs differ in some respects, but also share some similarities in clinical presentation, the risk factors associated with severe disease, and the characteristic immunopathology associated with the progression to severe disease. This review aims to highlight these overlapping aspects of the highly pathogenic hCoVs-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2-briefly discussing the importance of an appropriately regulated immune response; how the immune response to these highly pathogenic hCoVs might be dysregulated through interferon (IFN) inhibition, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA); and how these could link to the ensuing cytokine storm. The treatment approaches to highly pathogenic hCoV infections are discussed and it is suggested that a greater focus be placed on T-cell vaccines that elicit a cell-mediated immune response, using rapamycin as a potential agent to improve vaccine responses in the elderly and obese, and the potential of stapled peptides as antiviral agents.","['Schoeman D', 'Fielding BC']",2021,13,8,Viruses,Schoeman D and Fielding BC.

34452063,Risk Factors Associated with the Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 and Its Variants in the Context of Cytokine Storm and Therapeutics/Vaccine Development Challenges.,"The recent appearance of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has brought to light the importance of understanding this highly pathogenic agent to prevent future pandemics. This virus is from the same single-stranded positive-sense RNA family, Coronaviridae, as two other epidemic-causing viruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. During this pandemic, one crucial focus highlighted by WHO has been to understand the risk factors that may contribute to disease severity and predict COVID-19 outcomes. In doing so, it is imperative to understand the virology of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunological response eliciting the clinical manifestation and progression of COVID-19. In this review, we provide clinical data-based analyses of how multiple risk factors (such as sex, race, HLA genotypes, blood groups, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, smoking, and asthma) contribute to the inflammatory overactivation and cytokine storm (frequently seen in COVID-19 patients) with a focus on the IL-6 pathway. We also draw comparisons to the virulence and pathophysiology of SARS and MERS to establish parallels in immune response and discuss the potential for therapeutic approaches that may limit disease progression in patients with higher risk profiles than others. Moreover, we cover the latest information on approved or upcoming COVID-19 vaccines. This paper also provides perspective on emerging variants and associated opportunistic infections such as black molds and fungus that have added to mortality in some parts of the world, such as India. This compilation of existing COVID-19 studies and data will provide an excellent referencing tool for the research, clinical, and public health communities.","['Hanna J', 'Tipparaju P', 'Mulherkar T', 'Lin E', 'Mischley V', 'Kulkarni R', 'Bolton A', 'Byrareddy SN', 'Jain P']",2021,9,8,Vaccines (Basel),"Hanna J, et al.

This systematic review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement. From each of the included studies, the characteristics of the intervention and comparison groups, demographic data and results were extracted independently; Remdesivir is well tolerated and helps to accelerate clinical improvement but is ineffective in reducing mortality. Favipiravir is safe and shows promising results regarding symptom resolution but does not improve viral clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events and it has not proven to be effective. No significant differences were observed between patients treated with ribavirin or umifenovir and their respective control groups; Remdesivir and favipiravir are well tolerated and effective in accelerating clinical improvement.

34448593,MetaProb 2: Metagenomic Reads Binning Based on Assembly Using Minimizers and K-Mers Statistics.,"Current technologies allow the sequencing of microbial communities directly from the environment without prior culturing. One of the major problems when analyzing a microbial sample is to taxonomically annotate its reads to identify the species it contains. The major difficulties of taxonomic analysis are the lack of taxonomically related genomes in existing reference databases, the uneven abundance ratio of species, and sequencing errors. Microbial communities can be studied with reads clustering, a process referred to as genome binning. In this study, we present MetaProb 2 an unsupervised genome binning method based on reads assembly and probabilistic k-mers statistics. The novelties of MetaProb 2 are the use of minimizers to efficiently assemble reads into unitigs and a community detection algorithm based on graph modularity to cluster unitigs and to detect representative unitigs. The effectiveness of MetaProb 2 is demonstrated in both simulated and real datasets in comparison with state-of-art binning tools such as MetaProb, AbundanceBin, Bimeta, and MetaCluster.

In severe COVID-19 patients, type-2 T helper cells release numerous cytokines; this excessive immune response is named as cytokine storm. The cytokine storm, which is the hallmark of the COVID-19 induced by the disease and aggravates due to lack of proper immune response, similar to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the disease status may progress forward to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and death.

34443556,"Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening, Quantum Mechanics Calculations, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Approaches Identified Potential Natural Antiviral Drug Candidates against MERS-CoV S1-NTD.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly infectious zoonotic virus first reported into the human population in September 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula. The virus causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness in humans with an unusually high fatality rate. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of receptor-binding S1 subunit of coronavirus spike (S) proteins can recognize a variety of host protein and mediates entry into human host cells. Blocking the entry by targeting the S1-NTD of the virus can facilitate the development of effective antiviral drug candidates against the pathogen. Therefore, the study has been designed to identify effective antiviral drug candidates against the MERS-CoV by targeting S1-NTD. Initially, a structure-based pharmacophore model (SBPM) to the active site (AS) cavity of the S1-NTD has been generated, followed by pharmacophore-based virtual screening of 11,295 natural compounds. Hits generated through the pharmacophore-based virtual screening have re-ranked by molecular docking and further evaluated through the ADMET properties. The compounds with the best ADME and toxicity properties have been retrieved, and a quantum mechanical (QM) based density-functional theory (DFT) has been performed to optimize the geometry of the selected compounds. Three optimized natural compounds, namely Taiwanhomoflavone B (Amb23604132), 2,3-Dihydrohinokiflavone (Amb23604659), and Sophoricoside (Amb1153724), have exhibited substantial docking energy >-9.00 kcal/mol, where analysis of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory found the low chemical reactivity correspondence to the bioactivity of the compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed the stability of the selected natural compound to the binding site of the protein. Additionally, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) predicted the good value of binding free energies (ΔG bind) of the compounds to the desired protein.

However, humans encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and they caused a broad range of symptoms, from mild to life-threatening, depending on the virus and immunocompetence of the host. Most human coronaviruses interact with the proteins and/or double-membrane vesicles of autophagy, the membrane trafficking pathway that degrades and recycles the intracellular protein aggregates, organelles, and pathogens, including viruses. However, coronaviruses often neutralize and hijack this pathway to complete their life cycle. In this review, we discuss the interactions of human coronaviruses and autophagy, including recent data from SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Some of these interactions (for example, viral block of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion), while being conserved across multiple coronaviruses, are accomplished via different molecular mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular interplay between human coronaviruses and autophagy for developing efficient therapies against coronaviral diseases.","['Shroff A', 'Nazarko TY']",2021,10,8,Cells,Shroff A and Nazarko TY.

The similarity of the primary structures of the viral and human proteins can provoke an autoimmune process. Using an open-access protein database Uniprot, we have compared the SARS CoV-2 proteome with those of other organisms.

They are scattered along the entire length of the S protein molecule, while some of them fuse into sequences of considerable length. Except for one, all these n-mers project from the virus particle and therefore can be involved in providing mimicry and misleading the immune system.

Multivariate analysis to control for confounding demonstrated that borrowing of camels, particularly males, for breeding purposes was associated with increased MERS-CoV seroprevalence among receiving herds, suggesting a potential route of viral transmission between herds. Increasing age, herd size, and use of water troughs within herds were also associated with increased seroprevalence. Closed herd management practices were found to be protective. Future vaccination strategies among camel populations in Jordan could potentially prioritize breeding males, which are likely to be shared between herds. In addition, targeted management interventions with the potential to reduce transmission between herds should be considered; voluntary closed herd schemes offer a possible route to achieving disease-free herds.","['Holloway P', 'Gibson M', 'van Doremalen N', 'Nash S', 'Holloway T', 'Letko M', 'Cardwell JM', 'Al Omari B', 'Al-Majali A', 'Abu-Basha E', 'Mangtani P', 'Munster VJ', 'Guitian J']",2021,27,9,Emerg Infect Dis,"Holloway P, et al.

34422375,Pleural abnormalities in COVID-19: a narrative review.,"OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to provide a detailed overview of pleural abnormalities in patients with coronavirus disease 19 or COVID-19.
BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a novel beta coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Although pulmonary parenchymal and vascular changes associated with COVID-19 are well established, pleural space abnormalities have not been the primary focus of investigations.
METHODS: Narrative overview of the medical literature regarding pleural space abnormalities in COVID-19. The appropriate manuscripts were identified by searching electronic medical databases and by hand searching the bibliography of the identified papers. Pleural abnormalities on transverse and ultrasound imaging are discussed. The incidence, clinical features, pathophysiology, and fluid characteristics of pleural effusion are reviewed. Studies reporting pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are examined to evaluate for pathogenesis and prognosis. A brief comparative analysis of pleural abnormalities among patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been provided.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic pleural abnormalities are common in COVID-19, but the incidence of pleural effusion appears to be low. Pneumothorax is rare and does not independently predispose the patient to worse outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 infects the pleural space; however, whether the pleural fluid can propagate the infection is unclear.","['Saha BK', 'Chong WH', 'Austin A', 'Kathuria R', 'Datar P', 'Shkolnik B', 'Beegle S', 'Chopra A']",2021,13,7,J Thorac Dis,"Saha BK, et al.

However, personal protective equipment (PPE) efficacy is not considered for aerosol or airborne transmission of infectious diseases. This review discusses the inhalation of virus-laden aerosols as a viable mechanism of transmission of various respiratory infectious diseases and PPE efficacy.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews, and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was used.
RESULTS: The transmission of infectious disease is of concern for all respirable diseases discussed (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, influenza, and tuberculosis), and the effectiveness of facemasks is dependent on the efficiency of the filter, fit, and proper use.
CONCLUSION: PPE should be the last resort in preventing the spread of infectious disease and should only be used for protection and not to control the transmission.","['Locke L', 'Dada O', 'Shedd JS']",2021,63,11,J Occup Environ Med,"Locke L, et al.

TF-expressing cells also release TF-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation that can be measured using an EVTF activity assay. This review summarizes studies that analyze TF expression, TF-positive EVs, activation of coagulation, and thrombosis after infection with influenza A virus (IAV) and coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of mice with IAV increased TF expression in lung epithelial cells as well as increased EVTF activity and activation of coagulation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Infection of mice with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 also increased lung TF expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on the BALF from severe COVID-19 patients revealed increased TF mRNA expression in epithelial cells. TF expression was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with SARS-CoV. TF was also expressed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes in platelet-monocyte aggregates, and neutrophils isolated from COVID-19 patients. Elevated circulating EVTF activity was observed in severe IAV and COVID-19 patients. Importantly, EVTF activity was associated with mortality in severe IAV patients and with plasma D-dimer, severity, thrombosis, and mortality in COVID-19 patients. These studies strongly suggest that increased TF expression in patients infected with IAV and pathogenic CoVs contributes to thrombosis.","['Mackman N', 'Grover SP', 'Antoniak S']",2021,19,11,J Thromb Haemost,"Mackman N, et al.

34417462,Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly of the Vero cell line genome.,"The Vero cell line is the most used continuous cell line for viral vaccine manufacturing with more than 40 years of accumulated experience in the vaccine industry. Additionally, the Vero cell line has shown a high affinity for infection by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and recently SARS-CoV-2, emerging as an important discovery and screening tool to support the global research and development efforts in this COVID-19 pandemic. However, the lack of a reference genome for the Vero cell line has limited our understanding of host-virus interactions underlying such affinity of the Vero cell towards key emerging pathogens, and more importantly our ability to redesign high-yield vaccine production processes using Vero genome editing. In this paper, we present an annotated highly contiguous 2.9 Gb assembly of the Vero cell genome. In addition, several viral genome insertions, including Adeno-associated virus serotypes 3, 4, 7, and 8, have been identified, giving valuable insights into quality control considerations for cell-based vaccine production systems. Variant calling revealed that, in addition to interferon, chemokines, and caspases-related genes lost their functions. Surprisingly, the ACE2 gene, which was previously identified as the host cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, also lost function in the Vero genome due to structural variations.","['Sène MA', 'Kiesslich S', 'Djambazian H', 'Ragoussis J', 'Xia Y', 'Kamen AA']",2021,6,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Sène MA, et al.

Their most common natural hosts are bat and bird species, which are mostly split across four virus genera. Molecular clock analyses of orthocoronaviruses suggested the most recent common ancestor of these viruses might have emerged either around 10,000 years ago or, using models accounting for selection, many millions of years. Here, we reassess the evolutionary history of these viruses. We present time-aware phylogenetic analyses of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus from 123 orthocoronaviruses isolated from birds and bats, including those in New Zealand, which were geographically isolated from other bats around 35 million years ago. We used this age, as well as the age of the avian-mammals split, to calibrate the molecular clocks, under the assumption that these ages are applicable to the analyzed viruses. We found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all orthocoronaviruses is likely 150 or more million years, supporting clock analyses that account for selection.","['Hayman DTS', 'Knox MA']",2021,563,,Virology,Hayman DTS and Knox MA.

Therefore, the race to expand research to understand some good molecular targets for vaccine and therapeutic development for SARS-CoV-2 is inevitable. The newly discovered coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA, and enveloped virus, assigned to the beta CoV genus. The virus (SARS-CoV-2) is more infectious than the previously detected coronaviruses (MERS and SARS). Findings from many studies have revealed that S protein and RdRp are good targets for drug repositioning, novel therapeutic development (antibodies and small molecule drugs), and vaccine discovery. Therapeutics such as chloroquine, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, spike binding peptides, and small molecules could alter the ability of S protein to bind to the ACE-2 receptor, and drugs such as remdesivir (targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp), favipir, and emetine could prevent SASR-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. The novel vaccines such as mRNA1273 (Moderna), 3LNP-mRNAs (Pfizer/BioNTech), and ChAdOx1-S (University of Oxford/Astra Zeneca) targeting S protein have proven to be effective in combating the present pandemic. Further exploration of the potential of S protein and RdRp is crucial in fighting the present pandemic.","['Muhammed Y', 'Yusuf Nadabo A', 'Pius M', 'Sani B', 'Usman J', 'Anka Garba N', 'Mohammed Sani J', 'Opeyemi Olayanju B', 'Zeal Bala S', 'Garba Abdullahi M', 'Sambo M']",2021,3,5,Biosaf Health,"Muhammed Y, et al.

34394299,Corona viruses: reaching far beyond the common cold.,"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one of the most common causes of the ""common cold"". Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms ""human coronaviruses"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARSCoV"", ""SARS-CoV2"", ""COVID-19"", and ""common cold"" in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library.
FINDINGS: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic.","['Coerdt KM', 'Khachemoune A']",2021,21,1,Afr Health Sci,Coerdt KM and Khachemoune A.

METHODS: All nucleic acid testing (NAT) was performed using throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, and anal swabs, which were tested by Fluorescent quantitative realtime PCR. Re-positive cases were defined as a discharged patient who re-tested positive by NAT. Micro-neutralization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed based on the methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses. IgM and IgG against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by ELISA.
RESULTS: A total 255 (16.04%) of 1590 COVID-19 patients were re-positive. The re-positive cases were more likely to occur in patients in the 20-39 years age group and in patients with disease of moderate severity. Quantitative PCR showed that cycle threshold (Ct) values and viral loads were both far lower than in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The viral load in re-positive cases was very low. Viral culture of the samples from re-positive patients showed no cytopathic effect, and NAT of the culture medium of viral cultures all exhibited negative results.
CONCLUSION: The viral load in re-positive cases was very low; patients were not infectious and the risk of human-to-human transmission was extremely low.

Though China has witnessed rapid economic growth over the last two decades, the country can improve it further through adopting sustainable green energy and establishing more energy-efficient industries to strike a good balance between economic and social developments. The oil and carbon dioxide emission performances form the most important metrics. This study uses panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2008 to 2017 to assess the effect of environmental regulation on energy production. The nonradial directional distance function (NDDF) is used to measure the total factor energy efficiency index (TFEEI). The panel system GMM model, which can effectively address endogenous problems and regional variability, is utilized to research the nonlinear relationship between environmental regulations and EEI under various environmental regulations to study it. The findings reveal a considerably modest total average EEI amount for energy-intensive industries, averaging between 0.55 and 0.58, which is way below the ideal value (i.e., 1). Furthermore, the results of the dynamic panel data model revealed a significant U-shaped relationship between China's EEI and environmental regulation. The results show that as the values of market-based environmental regulations (MERs) and command and control environmental regulations (CCERs) exceed the corresponding levels, the impact of environmental regulation on the TFEEI increases gradually. This study will aid policymakers in better understanding the efficacy of different levels of environmental regulations to make more educated decisions.",['Ngo TQ'],2022,29,3,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Ngo TQ.

34389034,Evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more recently, the independent evolution of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has generated renewed interest in virus evolution and cross-species transmission. While all known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are speculated to have originated in animals, very little is known about their evolutionary history and factors that enable some CoVs to co-exist with humans as low pathogenic and endemic infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), while others, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved to cause severe disease. In this review, we highlight the origins of all known HCoVs and map positively selected for mutations within HCoV proteins to discuss the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we discuss emerging mutations within SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOC), along with highlighting the demonstrated or speculated impact of these mutations on virus transmission, pathogenicity, and neutralization by natural or vaccine-mediated immunity.","['Singh J', 'Pandit P', 'McArthur AG', 'Banerjee A', 'Mossman K']",2021,18,1,Virol J,"Singh J, et al.

34388333,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system: a review of neurological impacts caused by human coronaviruses.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. While coronaviruses typically have low rates of neurotropic effects, the massive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that a substantial population will suffer from potential SARS-CoV-2-related neurological disorders. The rapid and recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 means little research exists on its potential neurological effects. Here we analyze the effects of similar viruses to provide insight into the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system and beyond. Seven coronavirus strains (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) can infect humans. Many of these strains cause neurological effects, such as headaches, dizziness, strokes, seizures, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. Certain studies have also linked coronaviruses with multiple sclerosis and extensive central nervous system injuries. Reviewing these studies provides insight into the anticipated effects for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This review will first describe the effects of other coronaviruses that have caused severe disease (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) on the nervous system, as well as their proposed origins, non-neurological effects, and neurological infection mechanisms. It will then discuss what is known about SARS-CoV-2 in these areas with reference to the aforementioned viruses, with the goal of providing a holistic picture of SARS-CoV-2.","['Day C', 'Studders C', 'Arklie K', 'Kaur A', 'Teetzen K', 'Kirsch R', 'Abelseth L', 'Fraser I', 'Abelseth E', 'Willerth SM']",2022,33,3,Rev Neurosci,"Day C, et al.

34386006,Antibody Mediated Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and Human Coronaviruses: Multiplex Beads Assay and Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling to Generate Immune Repertoire Cartography.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel zoonotic coronavirus. Emerging evidence indicates that preexisting humoral immunity against other seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) plays a critical role in the specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. However, current work to assess the effects of preexisting and cross-reactive anti-HCoVs antibodies has been limited. To address this issue, we have adapted our previously reported multiplex assay to simultaneously and quantitatively measure anti-HCoV antibodies. The full mPlex-CoV panel covers the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of three highly pathogenic HCoVs (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) and four human seasonal strains (OC43, HKU1, NL63, 229E). Combining this assay with volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS), we measured the anti-HCoV IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in fingerstick blood samples. The results demonstrate that the mPlex-CoV assay has high specificity and sensitivity. It can detect strain-specific anti-HCoV antibodies down to 0.1 ng/ml with 4 log assay range and with low intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV). We also estimate multiple strain HCoVs IgG, IgA and IgM concentration in VAMS samples in three categories of subjects: pre-COVID-19 (n=21), post-COVID-19 convalescents (n=19), and COVID-19 vaccine recipients (n=14). Using metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, HCoVs IgG concentrations in fingerstick blood samples were well separated between the pre-COVID-19, post-COVID-19 convalescents, and COVID-19 vaccine recipients. In addition, we demonstrate how multi-dimensional scaling analysis can be used to visualize IgG mediated antibody immunity against multiple human coronaviruses. We conclude that the combination of VAMS and the mPlex-Cov assay is well suited to performing remote study sample collection under pandemic conditions to monitor HCoVs antibody responses in population studies.","['Wang J', 'Li D', 'Zhou Q', 'Wiltse A', 'Zand MS']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Wang J, et al.

34383754,DeepG4: A deep learning approach to predict cell-type specific active G-quadruplex regions.,"DNA is a complex molecule carrying the instructions an organism needs to develop, live and reproduce. In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered that DNA is composed of two chains forming a double-helix. Later on, other structures of DNA were discovered and shown to play important roles in the cell, in particular G-quadruplex (G4). Following genome sequencing, several bioinformatic algorithms were developed to map G4s in vitro based on a canonical sequence motif, G-richness and G-skewness or alternatively sequence features including k-mers, and more recently machine/deep learning. Recently, new sequencing techniques were developed to map G4s in vitro (G4-seq) and G4s in vivo (G4 ChIP-seq) at few hundred base resolution. Here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (DeepG4) to map cell-type specific active G4 regions (e.g. regions within which G4s form both in vitro and in vivo). DeepG4 is very accurate to predict active G4 regions in different cell types. Moreover, DeepG4 identifies key DNA motifs that are predictive of G4 region activity. We found that such motifs do not follow a very flexible sequence pattern as current algorithms seek for. Instead, active G4 regions are determined by numerous specific motifs. Moreover, among those motifs, we identified known transcription factors (TFs) which could play important roles in G4 activity by contributing either directly to G4 structures themselves or indirectly by participating in G4 formation in the vicinity. In addition, we used DeepG4 to predict active G4 regions in a large number of tissues and cancers, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for researchers.

34377979,CONSULT: accurate contamination removal using locality-sensitive hashing.,"A fundamental question appears in many bioinformatics applications: Does a sequencing read belong to a large dataset of genomes from some broad taxonomic group, even when the closest match in the set is evolutionarily divergent from the query? For example, low-coverage genome sequencing (skimming) projects either assemble the organelle genome or compute genomic distances directly from unassembled reads. Using unassembled reads needs contamination detection because samples often include reads from unintended groups of species. Similarly, assembling the organelle genome needs distinguishing organelle and nuclear reads. While k-mer-based methods have shown promise in read-matching, prior studies have shown that existing methods are insufficiently sensitive for contamination detection. Here, we introduce a new read-matching tool called CONSULT that tests whether k-mers from a query fall within a user-specified distance of the reference dataset using locality-sensitive hashing. Taking advantage of large memory machines available nowadays, CONSULT libraries accommodate tens of thousands of microbial species. Our results show that CONSULT has higher true-positive and lower false-positive rates of contamination detection than leading methods such as Kraken-II and improves distance calculation from genome skims. We also demonstrate that CONSULT can distinguish organelle reads from nuclear reads, leading to dramatic improvements in skim-based mitochondrial assemblies.","['Rachtman E', 'Bafna V', 'Mirarab S']",2021,3,3,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Rachtman E, et al.

34375189,"The use of Pseudotyped Coronaviruses for the Screening of Entry Inhibitors: Green Tea Extract Inhibits the Entry of SARS-CoV-1, MERSCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 by Blocking Receptor-spike Interaction.","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of animals and birds. Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 inculcates the need for the development of effective intervention strategies.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aim to produce pseudotyped coronaviruses of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and show its applications, including virus entry, neutralization, and screening of entry inhibitors from natural products.
METHODS: Here, we generated VSV-based pseudotyped coronaviruses (CoV-PVs) for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Recombinant spike proteins of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells followed by infection with recombinant VSV. High titer pseudoviruses were harvested and subjected to distinct validation assays, which confirms the proper spike pseudotyping. Further, specific receptor-mediated entry was confirmed by antibody neutralization and soluble form of receptor inhibition assay on Vero E6 cells. Next, these CoV-PVs were used for screening of antiviral activity of natural products such as green tea and Spirulina extract.
RESULTS: Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used as antiviral agents. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind to their receptors for cellular entry. SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV anti-sera neutralize SARS-CoV-1-PV and SARS-CoV-2-PV, and MERS-CoV-PV, respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 with CoV-PVs inhibited entry of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 PVs but not MERS-CoV-PV. Also, transient expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARS-CoV-1-PV, SARS-CoV-2-PV, and MERS-CoV-PV, respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known entry inhibitors of enveloped viruses, Spirulina, and green tea extracts against CoV-PVs. SARSCoV- 1-PV, MERS-CoV-PV, and SARS-CoV-2-PV entry was blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or Spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect by binding to the S1 domain of the spike and blocking the spike interaction with its receptor.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses are an ideal tool for studying viral entry, quantification of neutralizing antibodies, and screening of entry inhibitors in a BSL-2 facility. Moreover, green tea might be a promising natural remedy against emerging coronaviruses.","['Joseph J', 'Karthika T', 'Das VRA', 'Raj VS']",2022,23,8,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,"Joseph J, et al.

34374351,Performance Comparison of Five SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays for Seroprevalence Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Seroprevalence studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, including asymptomatic and past infections, are important to estimate the scale of the disease outbreak and to establish quarantine measures. We evaluated the clinical performance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays available in Korea for use in seroprevalence studies.
METHODS: The sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, and interference of five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays were evaluated using the following: 398 serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, 510 negative control samples from before 2018 (pre-pandemic), 163 serum samples from patients with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and other viral infections, and five samples for the interference study.
RESULTS: The sensitivities of the five assays ranged from 92.2% to 98%, and their specificities, including cross-reactivity and interference, ranged from 97.5% to 100%. The agreement rates were excellent (kappa >0.9). Adjustment of the cutoff values could be considered through ROC curve analysis. The positive predictive values of the individual assays varied from 3.5% to 100% at a 0.1% prevalence but were as high as ≥95% when two assays were combined.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in Korea is considered to be exceptionally low at present; thus, we recommend using a combination of two or more SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays rather than a single assay. These results could help select SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays for COVID-19 seroprevalence studies in Korea.","['Park Y', 'Hong KH', 'Lee SK', 'Hyun J', 'Oh EJ', 'Lee J', 'Lee H', 'Song SH', 'Kee SJ', 'Kwon GC', 'Kim SH', 'Do HN', 'Kim AR', 'Lee JW', 'Kim SS', 'Kim HS']",2022,42,1,Ann Lab Med,"Park Y, et al.

34373501,Detection of three pandemic causing coronaviruses from non-respiratory samples: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"SARS-CoV-2 has posed an unprecedented challenge to the world. Pandemics have been caused previously by viruses of this family like Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS CoV). Although these viruses are primarily respiratory viruses, but they have been isolated from non-respiratory samples as well. Presently, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from different clinical specimens using Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerized Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to establish the profile of detecting SARS-CoV-2, MERS CoV, SARS CoV from different types of clinical specimens other than the respiratory using a standard diagnostic test (qRT-PCR). A total of 3429 non-respiratory specimens were recorded: SARS CoV (total sample-802), MERS CoV (total sample-155), SARS CoV-2 (total sample-2347). Out of all the samples studied high positive rate was seen for saliva with 96.7% (14/14; 95% CI 87.6-100.0%) for SARS CoV and 57.5% (58/250; 95% CI - 1.2 to 116.2%) for SARS CoV-2, while low detection rate in urine samples for SARS CoV-2 with 2.2% (8/318; 95% CI 0.6-3.7%) and 9.6% (12/61; 95% CI - 0.9 to 20.1%) for SARS CoV but there was relatively higher positivity in urine samples for MERS CoV with detection rate of 32.4% (2/38; 95% CI - 37.3 to 102.1%). In Stool sample positivity was 54.9% (396/779; 95% CI 41.0-68.8%), 45.2% (180/430; 95% CI 28.1-62.3%) and 34.7% (4/38; 95% CI - 29.5 to 98.9%) for SARS CoV-2, MERS CoV, and SARS CoV, respectively. In blood sample the positivity was 33.3% (7/21; 95% CI 13.2-53.5%), 23.7% (42/277; 95% CI 10.5-36.9%) and 2.5% (2/81; 95% CI 0.00-5.8%) for MERS CoV, SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 along with previous two pandemic causing viruses from this family, were highly detected stool and saliva. A low positive rate was recorded in blood samples. Viruses were also detected in fluids along with unusual samples like semen and vaginal secretions thus highlighting unique pathogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2.","['Mishra C', 'Meena S', 'Meena JK', 'Tiwari S', 'Mathur P']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Mishra C, et al.

34372695,"Specificity and Mechanism of Coronavirus, Rotavirus, and Mammalian Two-Histidine Phosphoesterases That Antagonize Antiviral Innate Immunity.","The 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A)-dependent endoribonuclease, RNase L, is a principal mediator of the interferon (IFN) antiviral response. Therefore, the regulation of cellular levels of 2-5A is a key point of control in antiviral innate immunity. Cellular 2-5A levels are determined by IFN-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) and by enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Importantly, many coronaviruses (CoVs) and rotaviruses encode 2-5A-degrading enzymes, thereby antagonizing RNase L and its antiviral effects. A-kinase-anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), a mammalian counterpart, could possibly limit tissue damage from excessive or prolonged RNase L activation during viral infections or from self-double-stranded RNAs that activate OAS. We show that these enzymes, members of the two-histidine phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily, constitute a subfamily referred here as 2',5'-PEs. 2',5'-PEs from the mouse CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (NS2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (NS4b), group A rotavirus (VP3), and mouse (AKAP7) were investigated for their evolutionary relationships and activities. While there was no activity against 3',5'-oligoribonucleotides, they all cleaved 2',5'-oligoadenylates efficiently but with variable activity against other 2',5'-oligonucleotides.

34372350,A Review on the Development of Gold and Silver Nanoparticles-Based Biosensor as a Detection Strategy of Emerging and Pathogenic RNA Virus.,"The emergence of highly pathogenic and deadly human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV within the past two decades and currently SARS-CoV-2, have resulted in millions of human death across the world. In addition, other human viral diseases, such as mosquito borne-viral diseases and blood-borne viruses, also contribute to a higher risk of death in severe cases. To date, there is no specific drug or medicine available to cure these human viral diseases. Therefore, the early and rapid detection without compromising the test accuracy is required in order to provide a suitable treatment for the containment of the diseases. Recently, nanomaterials-based biosensors have attracted enormous interest due to their biological activities and unique sensing properties, which enable the detection of analytes such as nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), aptamers, and proteins in clinical samples. In addition, the advances of nanotechnologies also enable the development of miniaturized detection systems for point-of-care (POC) biosensors, which could be a new strategy for detecting human viral diseases. The detection of virus-specific genes by using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes has become a particular interest due to their higher sensitivity and specificity compared to immunological methods based on antibody or antigen for early diagnosis of viral infection. Hence, this review has been developed to provide an overview of the current development of nanoparticles-based biosensors that target pathogenic RNA viruses, toward a robust and effective detection strategy of the existing or newly emerging human viral diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. This review emphasizes the nanoparticles-based biosensors developed using noble metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) by virtue of their powerful characteristics as a signal amplifier or enhancer in the detection of nucleic acid.

Owing to its crucial role in the invasion of the host cell, spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the major targets in these studies.

Being a heavily glycosylated protein, numerous studies have investigated its glycan composition. However, none of the studies have explored the isomeric glycan distribution of this protein. Furthermore, this isomeric glycan distribution has never been compared to that in S1 proteins of other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which were responsible for past epidemics. This study explores the uncharted territory of the isomeric glycan distribution in the coronaviruses' S1 protein using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.

Feature tracking and mapping analysis to detect persistent myocardial involvement.,"BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 patients may incur myocardial involvement secondary to systemic inflammation. Our aim was to detect possible oedema/diffuse fibrosis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) mapping and to study myocardial deformation of the left ventricle (LV) using feature tracking (FT).
METHODS: Prospective analysis of consecutively recruited post-COVID-19 patients undergoing CMR. T1 and T2 mapping sequences were acquired and FT analysis was performed using 2D steady-state free precession cine sequences. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Included were 57 post-COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, mean age 59 ± 15 years, men 80.7%. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (33.3%) and dyslipidaemia (36.8%).

No between-group differences were observed for native T1 nor for circumferential strain (CS) or radial strain (RS) values (18.6 ± 3.3% vs 19.2 ± 2.1% (p = 0.52) and 32.3 ± 8.1% vs 33.6 ± 7.1% (p = 0.9), respectively). A sub-group analysis for the contact-to-CMR interval (<8 weeks vs ≥ 8 weeks) showed that FT-CS (15.6 ± 2.2% vs 18.9 ± 2.6%, p < 0.01) and FT-RS (24.9 ± 5.8 vs 33.5 ± 7.2%, p < 0.01) values were lower for the shorter interval.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID-19 patients compared to heathy controls had raised T2 values (related to oedema), but similar native T1, FT-CS and FT-RS values. FT-CS and FT-RS values were lower in post-COVID-19 patients undergoing CMR after < 8 weeks compared to ≥ 8 weeks.","['Urmeneta Ulloa J', 'Martínez de Vega V', 'Salvador Montañés O', 'Álvarez Vázquez A', 'Sánchez-Enrique C', 'Hernández Jiménez S', 'Sancho García FD', 'López Ruiz L', 'Recio Rodríguez M', 'Pizarro G', 'Carnevali Ruiz D', 'Ángel Cabrera J']",2021,36,,Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,"Urmeneta Ulloa J, et al.

34368076,Identification of Potential Binding Sites of Sialic Acids on the RBD Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still an emergent pandemic for humans. The virus infection is achieved by penetrating its spike protein to host cells via binding with ACE2. Moreover, recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 may have multiple receptors that need to be further revealed. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar sequences of the spike protein with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which can invade host cells by binding to either DPP4 or sialic acids. Sialic acids can be linked to the terminal of glycoproteins and gangliosides are used as one of the receptors of many types of viruses. Therefore, it is very interesting to determine whether sialic acid is a potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2. To address this question, we took N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a type of predominant sialic acid found in human cells, as the molecular probe to computationally search the surface of the spike protein to locate the potential binding sites of Neu5Ac. SPR analysis and mass spectrum analysis confirmed the interaction between Neu5Ac and spike protein. This study shows that sialic acids can moderately interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by binding between the two RBDs of the spike protein, indicating it could be a potential secondary or auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2.","['Li B', 'Wang L', 'Ge H', 'Zhang X', 'Ren P', 'Guo Y', 'Chen W', 'Li J', 'Zhu W', 'Chen W', 'Zhu L', 'Bai F']",2021,9,,Front Chem,"Li B, et al.

34367154,Gene Expression Meta-Analysis Reveals Interferon-Induced Genes Associated With SARS Infection in Lungs.,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) corona virus (CoV) infections are a serious public health threat because of their pandemic-causing potential. This work is the first to analyze mRNA expression data from SARS infections through meta-analysis of gene signatures, possibly identifying therapeutic targets associated with major SARS infections.
METHODS: This work defines 37 gene signatures representing SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections in human lung cultures and/or mouse lung cultures or samples and compares them through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). To do this, positive and negative infectious clone SARS (icSARS) gene panels are defined from GSEA-identified leading-edge genes between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, both from human cultures. GSEA then is used to assess enrichment and identify leading-edge icSARS panel genes between icSARS gene panels and 27 other SARS-CoV gene signatures. The meta-analysis is expanded to include five MERS-CoV and three SARS-CoV2 gene signatures. Genes associated with SARS infection are predicted by examining the intersecting membership of GSEA-identified leading-edges across gene signatures.
RESULTS: Significant enrichment (GSEA p<0.001) is observed between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, and those leading-edge genes defined the positive (233 genes) and negative (114 genes) icSARS panels. Non-random significant enrichment (null distribution p<0.001) is observed between icSARS panels and all verification icSARSvsmock signatures derived from human cultures, from which 51 over- and 22 under-expressed genes are shared across leading-edges with 10 over-expressed genes already associated with icSARS infection. For the icSARSvsmock mouse signature, significant, non-random significant enrichment held for only the positive icSARS panel, from which nine genes are shared with icSARS infection in human cultures. Considering other SARS strains, significant, non-random enrichment (p<0.05) is observed across signatures derived from other SARS strains for the positive icSARS panel. Five positive icSARS panel genes, CXCL10, OAS3, OASL, IFIT3, and XAF1, are found across mice and human signatures regardless of SARS strains.
CONCLUSION: The GSEA-based meta-analysis approach used here identifies genes with and without reported associations with SARS-CoV infections, highlighting this approach's predictability and usefulness in identifying genes that have potential as therapeutic targets to preclude or overcome SARS infections.","['Park A', 'Harris LK']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,Park A and Harris LK.

34362224,SARS-CoV-2 and the Brain: What Do We Know about the Causality of 'Cognitive COVID?,"The second year of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic has seen the need to identify and assess the long-term consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection on an individual's overall wellbeing, including adequate cognitive functioning. 'Cognitive COVID' is an informal term coined to interchangeably refer to acute changes in cognition during COVID-19 and/or cognitive sequelae with various deficits following the infection. These may manifest as altered levels of consciousness, encephalopathy-like symptoms, delirium, and loss of various memory domains. Dysexecutive syndrome is a peculiar manifestation of 'Cognitive COVID' as well. In the previous major outbreaks of viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza. There have been attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms describing the causality of similar symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review, therefore, is attempting to highlight the current understanding of the various direct and indirect mechanisms, focusing on the role of neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the general pro-inflammatory state, and the pandemic-associated psychosocial stressors in the causality of 'Cognitive COVID.' Neurotropism is associated with various mechanisms including retrograde neuronal transmission via olfactory pathway, a general hematogenous spread, and the virus using immune cells as vectors. The high amounts of inflammation caused by COVID-19, compounded with potential intubation, are associated with a deleterious effect on the cognition as well. Finally, the pandemic's unique psychosocial impact has raised alarm due to its possible effect on cognition. Furthermore, with surfacing reports of post-COVID-vaccination cognitive impairments after vaccines containing mRNA encoding for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize their causality and ways to mitigate the risk. The potential impact on the quality of life of an individual and the fact that even a minor proportion of COVID-19 cases developing cognitive impairment could be a significant burden on already overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world make it vital to gather further evidence regarding the prevalence, presentation, correlations, and causality of these events and reevaluate our approach to accommodate early identification, management, and rehabilitation of patients exhibiting cognitive symptoms.","['Ali Awan H', 'Najmuddin Diwan M', 'Aamir A', 'Ali M', 'Di Giannantonio M', 'Ullah I', 'Shoib S', 'De Berardis D']",2021,10,15,J Clin Med,"Ali Awan H, et al.

34360860,K-mer Content Changes with Node Degree in Promoter-Enhancer Network of Mouse ES Cells.,"Maps of Hi-C contacts between promoters and enhancers can be analyzed as networks, with cis-regulatory regions as nodes and their interactions as edges. We checked if in the published promoter-enhancer network of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells the differences in the node type (promoter or enhancer) and the node degree (number of regions interacting with a given promoter or enhancer) are reflected by sequence composition or sequence similarity of the interacting nodes. We used counts of all k-mers (k = 4) to analyze the sequence composition and the Euclidean distance between the k-mer count vectors (k-mer distance) as the measure of sequence (dis)similarity. The results we obtained with 4-mers are interpretable in terms of dinucleotides. Promoters are GC-rich as compared to enhancers, which is known. Enhancers are enriched in scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) patterns and depleted of CpGs. Furthermore, we show that promoters are more similar to their interacting enhancers than vice-versa. Most notably, in both promoters and enhancers, the GC content and the CpG count increase with the node degree. As a consequence, enhancers of higher node degree become more similar to promoters, whereas higher degree promoters become less similar to enhancers. We confirmed the key results also for human keratinocytes.","['Szyman K', 'Wilczyński B', 'Dąbrowski M']",2021,22,15,Int J Mol Sci,"Szyman K, et al.

34358163,"Accelerated Development of COVID-19 Vaccines: Technology Platforms, Benefits, and Associated Risks.","Multiple preventive COVID-19 vaccines have been developed during the ongoing SARS coronavirus (CoV) 2 pandemic, utilizing a variety of technology platforms, which have different properties, advantages, and disadvantages. The acceleration in vaccine development required to combat the current pandemic is not at the expense of the necessary regulatory requirements, including robust and comprehensive data collection along with clinical product safety and efficacy evaluation. Due to the previous development of vaccine candidates against the related highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the antigen that elicits immune protection is known: the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or specific domains encoded in that protein, e.g., the receptor binding domain. From a scientific point of view and in accordance with legal frameworks and regulatory practices, for the approval of a clinic trial, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut requires preclinical testing of vaccine candidates, including general pharmacology and toxicology as well as immunogenicity. For COVID-19 vaccine candidates, based on existing platform technologies with a sufficiently broad data base, pharmacological-toxicological testing in the case of repeated administration, quantifying systemic distribution, and proof of vaccination protection in animal models can be carried out in parallel to phase 1 or 1/2 clinical trials. To reduce the theoretical risk of an increased respiratory illness through infection-enhancing antibodies or as a result of Th2 polarization and altered cytokine profiles of the immune response following vaccination, which are of specific concern for COVID-19 vaccines, appropriate investigative testing is imperative. In general, phase 1 (vaccine safety) and 2 (dose finding, vaccination schedule) clinical trials can be combined, and combined phase 2/3 trials are recommended to determine safety and efficacy. By applying these fundamental requirements not only for the approval and analysis of clinical trials but also for the regulatory evaluation during the assessment of marketing authorization applications, several efficacious and safe COVID-19 vaccines have been licensed in the EU by unprecedentedly fast and flexible procedures. Procedural and regulatory-scientific aspects of the COVID-19 licensing processes are described in this review.","['Wagner R', 'Hildt E', 'Grabski E', 'Sun Y', 'Meyer H', 'Lommel A', 'Keller-Stanislawski B', 'Müller-Berghaus J', 'Cichutek K']",2021,9,7,Vaccines (Basel),"Wagner R, et al.

34357528,Enabling Artificial Intelligence for Genome Sequence Analysis of COVID-19 and Alike Viruses.,"Recent pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been growing lethally with unusual speed. It has infected millions of people and continues a mortifying influence on the global population's health and well-being. In this situation, genome sequence analysis and advanced artificial intelligence techniques may help researchers and medical experts to understand the genetic variants of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequence analysis of COVID-19 is crucial to understand the virus's origin, behavior, and structure, which might help produce/develop vaccines, antiviral drugs, and efficient preventive strategies. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence based system to perform genome sequence analysis of COVID-19 and alike viruses, e.g., SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome, and Ebola. The system helps to get important information from the genome sequences of different viruses. We perform comparative data analysis by extracting basic information of COVID-19 and other genome sequences, including information of nucleotides composition and their frequency, tri-nucleotide compositions, count of amino acids, alignment between genome sequences, and their DNA similarity information. We use different visualization methods to analyze these viruses' genome sequences and, finally, apply machine learning based classifier support vector machine to classify different genome sequences. The data set of different virus genome sequences are obtained from an online publicly accessible data center repository. The system achieves good classification results with an accuracy of 97% for COVID-19, 96%, SARS, and 95% for MERS and Ebola genome sequences, respectively.","['Ahmed I', 'Jeon G']",2022,14,2,Interdiscip Sci,Ahmed I and Jeon G.

34353261,siRNA as a Potential Therapy for COVID-19.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a highly contagious virus causing COVID-19 disease that severely impacted the world health, education, and economy systems in 2020. The numbers of infection cases and reported deaths are still increasing with no specific treatment identified yet to halt this pandemic. Currently, several proposed treatments are under preclinical and clinical investigations now, alongside the race to vaccinate as many individuals as possible. The genome of SARS-CoV2 shares a similar gene organization as other viruses in the Coronaviridae family. It is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. This feature suggests that RNA interference (RNAi) is an attractive prophylactic and therapeutic option for the control of this pandemic and other possible future pandemics of the corona viruses. RNAi utilizes the use of siRNA molecules, which are 21-29 nt duplexes RNA molecules that intervene with targeted gene expression in the cytoplasm by a specific mechanism of complementary destruction of mRNA. Previous experience with SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed that siRNA molecules were effective against these viruses in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, there have been extensive advances in siRNA technology in the past decade from chemistry and target selection considerations; which concluded with the successful approval of two commercial products based on siRNA technology. In addition, the current knowledge of the genome structure and functionality of the corona viruses enables the recognition of conserved sequences to optimize siRNA targeting and avoid viral escape through mutations, either for the current SARS-CoV2 as well as future corona viruses.","['Aljaberi A', 'Migdadi EM', 'Khadra KMA', 'Samak MA', 'Basheti IA', 'Al-Zoubi N']",2022,19,7,Curr Drug Deliv,"Aljaberi A, et al. siRNA as a Potential Therapy for COVID-19. siRNA as a Potential Therapy for COVID-19. 2022; 19:731-744. doi: 10.2174/1567201818666210805145320",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34353261/
34351542,SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry: an in silico investigation of potential inhibitory roles of terpenoids.,"BACKGROUND: Targeting viral cell entry proteins is an emerging therapeutic strategy for inhibiting the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, 106 bioactive terpenoids from African medicinal plants were screened through molecular docking analysis against human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In silico absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion-toxicity (ADMET) and drug-likeness prediction, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, binding free energy calculations, and clustering analysis of MD simulation trajectories were performed on the top docked terpenoids to respective protein targets.
RESULTS: The results revealed eight terpenoids with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of different targets. Two pentacyclic terpenoids (24-methylene cycloartenol and isoiguesteri) interacted with the hACE2 binding hotspots for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while the abietane diterpenes were found accommodated within the S1-specificity pocket, interacting strongly with the active site residues TMPRSS2. 3-benzoylhosloppone and cucurbitacin interacted with the RBD and S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. These interactions were preserved in a simulated dynamic environment, thereby, demonstrating high structural stability. The MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations corroborated the docking interactions. The top docked terpenoids showed favorable drug-likeness and ADMET properties over a wide range of molecular descriptors.
CONCLUSION: The identified terpenoids from this study provides core structure that can be exploited for further lead optimization to design drugs against SARS-CoV-2 cell-mediated entry proteins. They are therefore recommended for further in vitro and in vivo studies towards developing entry inhibitors against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","['Gyebi GA', 'Ogunyemi OM', 'Ibrahim IM', 'Ogunro OB', 'Adegunloye AP', 'Afolabi SO']",2021,19,1,J Genet Eng Biotechnol,"Gyebi GA, et al.

34348612,Role of Potential COVID-19 Immune System Associated Genes and the Potential Pathways Linkage with Type-2 Diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus is an enclosed positive-sense RNA virus with club-like spikes extending from its surface. It is most typically associated with acute respiratory infections in humans, but its capacity to infect many host species and cause multiple illnesses makes it a complicated pathogen. The frequent encounters between wild animals and humans are a typical cause of infection. The zoonotic infections SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are among the most common causes of serious respiratory illnesses in humans.
AIM: The main goal of this research was to look at gene expression profiles in human samples that were either infected with coronavirus or were not, and compare the varied expression patterns and their functional implications.
METHODS: The previously researched samples were acquired from a public database for this purpose, and the study was conducted, which included gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, and network-level comprehension. The results for differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways, and networks for prospective genes and gene sets are presented in the analysis. In terms of COVID-19 gene expression and its relationship to type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: We see a lot of genes that have different gene expression patterns than normal for coronavirus infection, but in terms of pathways, it appears that there are only a few sets of functions that are affected by altered gene expression, and they are related to infection, inflammation, and the immune system.
CONCLUSION: Based on our study, we conclude that the potential genes which are affected due to infection are NFKBIA, MYC, FOXO3, BIRC3, ICAM1, IL8, CXCL1/2/5, GADD45A, RELB, SGK1, AREG, BBC3, DDIT3/4, EGR1, MTHFD2, and SESN2 and the functional changes are mainly associated with these pathways: TNF, cytokine, NF-kB, TLR, TCR, BCR, Foxo, and TGF signaling pathways are among them and there are additional pathways such as hippo signaling, apoptosis, estrogen signaling, regulating pluropotency of stem cells, ErbB, Wnt, p53, cAMP, MAPK, PI3K-AKT, oxidative phosphorylation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, prolactin signaling, adipocytokine, neurotrophine signaling, and longevity regulating pathways. SMARCD3, PARL, GLIPR1, STAT2, PMAIP1, GP1BA, and TOX genes and PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, Foxo, phagosome, adrenergic, osteoclast differentiation, platelet activation, insulin, cytokine- cytokine interaction, apoptosis, ECM, JAK-STAT, and oxytocin signaling appear as the linkage between COVID-19 and Type-2 diabetes.","['Helmi N', 'Alammari D', 'Mobashir M']",2022,25,14,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,"Helmi N, et al.

34346317,Investigation of nonsynonymous mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor by molecular docking and MM/GBSA approach.,"COVID-19 is an infectious and pathogenic viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that leads to septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike-protein (S-protein) interacts with the human cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of pathological mutations of S-protein is still unclear. In this perspective, we investigated the impact of mutations in the S-protein and their interaction with the ACE2 receptor for SAR-CoV-2 viral infection. We examined the stability of pathological nonsynonymous mutations in the S-protein, and the binding behavior of the ACE2 receptor with the S-protein upon nonsynonymous mutations using the molecular docking and MM_GBSA approaches. Using the extensive bioinformatics pipeline, we screened the destabilizing (L8V, L8W, L18F, Y145H, M153T, F157S, G476S, L611F, A879S, C1247F, and C1254F) and stabilizing (H49Y, S50L, N501Y, D614G, A845V, and P1143L) nonsynonymous mutations in the S-protein. The docking and binding free energy (ddG) scores revealed that the stabilizing nonsynonymous mutations show increased interaction between the S-protein and the ACE2 receptor compared to native and destabilizing S-proteins and that they may have been responsible for the virulent high level. Further, the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) approach reveals the structural transition of mutants (N501Y and D614G) S-protein. These insights might help researchers to understand the pathological mechanisms of the S-protein and provide clues regarding mutations in viral infection and disease propagation. Further, it helps researchers to develop an efficient treatment approach against this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","['Aljindan RY', 'Al-Subaie AM', 'Al-Ohali AI', 'Kumar D T', 'Doss C GP', 'Kamaraj B']",2021,135,,Comput Biol Med,"Aljindan RY, et al.

Common infections during pregnancy that have long been recognized as congenitally and perinatally transmissible to newborns include toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex viruses (originally coined as ToRCH infections). In addition, enterovirus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis virus, varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Zika and Dengue virus, and, more recently, coronavirus infections including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (especially the novel SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), constitute relevant targets for current research on maternal-fetal interactions in viral infections during pregnancy. Appropriate maternal education from preconception to the early postnatal period is crucial to promote healthy pregnancies in general and to prevent and/or reduce the impact of viral infections in particular. Specifically, an adequate lifestyle based on proper nutrition plans and feeding interventions, whenever possible, might be crucial to reduce the risk of virus-related gestational diseases and accompanying complications in later life. Here we aim to provide an overview of the emerging literature addressing the impact of nutrition in the context of potentially harmful viral infections during pregnancy.","['Mate A', 'Reyes-Goya C', 'Santana-Garrido Á', 'Sobrevia L', 'Vázquez CM']",2021,1867,11,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,"Mate A, et al.

34343467,Suitability of Google Trends™ for Digital Surveillance During Ongoing COVID-19 Epidemic: A Case Study from India.,"OBJECTIVE: Digital surveillance has shown mixed results as a supplement to traditional surveillance. Google Trends™ (GT) (Google, Mountain View, CA, United States) has been used for digital surveillance of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. We used GT to correlate the information seeking on COVID-19 with number of tests and cases in India.
METHODS: Data was obtained on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org. We used a comprehensive search strategy to retrieve GT data on COVID-19 related information-seeking behavior in India between January 1 and May 31, 2020 in the form of relative search volume (RSV). We also used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between RSV and daily new COVID-19 cases and tests.
RESULTS: GT RSV showed high time-lag correlation with both daily reported tests and cases for the terms ""COVID 19,"" ""COVID,"" ""social distancing,"" ""soap,"" and ""lockdown"" at the national level. In 5 high-burden states, high correlation was observed for these 5 terms along with ""Corona."" Peaks in RSV, both at the national level and in high-burden states corresponded with media coverage or government declarations on the ongoing pandemic.
CONCLUSION: The correlation observed between GT data and COVID-19 tests/cases in India may be either due to media-coverage-induced curiosity, or health-seeking curiosity.","['Satpathy P', 'Kumar S', 'Prasad P']",2021,17,,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,"Satpathy P, et al.

34340553,The TMPRSS2 Inhibitor Nafamostat Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Pulmonary Infection in Mouse Models of COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initiates host cell entry when its spike protein (S) binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In airway epithelia, the spike protein is cleaved by the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, facilitating membrane fusion and entry at the cell surface. This dependence on TMPRSS2 and related proteases suggests that protease inhibitors might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract. Here, we tested two serine protease inhibitors, camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, for their ability to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 and that of a second pathogenic coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both camostat and nafamostat reduced infection in primary human airway epithelia and in the Calu-3 2B4 cell line, with nafamostat exhibiting greater potency. We then assessed whether nafamostat was protective against SARS-CoV-2 ","['Li K', 'Meyerholz DK', 'Bartlett JA', 'McCray PB']",2021,12,4,mBio,"Li K, et al.

Four of these viruses, including HCoV-NL63, -229E, -HKU1 and -OC43, usually cause mild-to-moderate respiratory diseases with a seasonal pattern. Since 2000, three new HCoVs have emerged with a significant mortality rate. Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused an epidemic in some countries, SARS-CoV-2 escalated into a pandemic. All HCoVs can cause severe complications in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. The bat origin of HCoVs, the presence of intermediate hosts and the nature of their viral replication suggest that other new coronaviruses may emerge in the future. Despite the fact that all HCoVs share similarities in viral replication, they differ in their accessory proteins, incubation period and pathogenicity. This study aims to review these differences between the seven HCoVs.","['Kesheh MM', 'Hosseini P', 'Soltani S', 'Zandi M']",2022,32,2,Rev Med Virol,"Kesheh MM, et al.

34338591,"Evolving ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the human and animal coronaviruses: targeting, transmission and evolution.","A world-wide COVID-19 pandemic intensified strongly the studies of molecular mechanisms related to the coronaviruses. The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses, RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

34336361,"A Review on Expression, Pathological Roles, and Inhibition of TMPRSS2, the Serine Protease Responsible for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Activation.","SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, uses the host cell membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for anchoring its spike protein, and the subsequent membrane fusion process is facilitated by host membrane proteases. Recent studies have shown that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease known for similar role in previous coronavirus infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, enabling host cell fusion of the virus. TMPRSS2 is known to be expressed in the epithelial cells of different sites including gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary system. The infection site of the SARS-CoV-2 correlates with the coexpression sites of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Besides, age-, sex-, and comorbidity-associated variation in infection rate correlates with the expression rate of TMPRSS2 in those groups. These findings provide valid reasons for the assumption that inhibiting TMPRSS2 can have a beneficial effect in reducing the cellular entry of the virus, ultimately affecting the infection rate and case severity. Several drug development studies are going on to develop potential inhibitors of the protease, using both conventional and computational approaches. Complete understanding of the biological roles of TMPRSS2 is necessary before such therapies are applied.","['Sarker J', 'Das P', 'Sarker S', 'Roy AK', 'Momen AZMR']",2021,2021,,Scientifica (Cairo),"Sarker J, et al.

The onset age ranged from 8 months to 12 years old, with an average age of 4 years and 2 months. All children developed normally before onset, and three of them had a history of febrile convulsion. More than half of the patients (62.9%) had preceding infections of gastrointestinal tract. All the cases developed seizures, and most (71.4%) had more than one time. Other neurological symptoms included dizziness/headache, consciousness disorder, limb weakness, blurred vision, and dysarthria. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum in all, extending to other areas of the corpus callosum, bilateral semi-ovoid center, and adjacent periventricular in two cases. The clinical symptoms were relieved after steroids, intravenous immunogloblin, and symptomatic treatment, without abnormal neurodevelopment during the followed-up (2 months-2 years).

Among them, 8a exhibited the most potential effects against both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, indicating a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus profile. The mechanism study disclosed that 8a might block a late stage of viral entry, mainly via inhibiting host cathepsin B activity rather than directly targeting cathepsin B protein. Also, 8a could significantly reduce the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and MCP-1, the major contributors to cytokine storm. Therefore, 8a is a promising agent with the advantages of broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus and anti-cytokine effects, thus worthy of further investigation.","['Wang K', 'Wu JJ', 'Xin-Zhang', 'Zeng QX', 'Zhang N', 'Huang WJ', 'Tang S', 'Wang YX', 'Kong WJ', 'Wang YC', 'Li YH', 'Song DQ']",2021,115,,Bioorg Chem,"Wang K, et al.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 was first reported in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China and reached most corners of the globe in less than two months. In just over a year since the initial infections, COVID-19 infected almost 100 million people worldwide. Although similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has resisted treatments that are effective against other coronaviruses. Crystal structures of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, spike protein and main protease, have been reported and can serve as targets for studies in neutralizing this threat. We have employed molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning to identify from a library of 26 million molecules possible candidate compounds that may attenuate or neutralize the effects of this virus.

The spike glycoprotein is typically considered a suitable target for MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. A computational strategy can be used to design an antigenic vaccine against a pathogen. Therefore, we used immunoinformatics and computational approaches to design a multi-epitope vaccine that targets the spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV. After using numerous immunoinformatics tools and applying several immune filters, a poly-epitope vaccine was constructed comprising cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL)-, helper T-cell lymphocyte (HTL)-, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-inducing epitopes. In addition, various physicochemical, allergenic, and antigenic profiles were evaluated to confirm the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. Molecular interactions, binding affinities, and the thermodynamic stability of the vaccine were examined through molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches, during which we identified a stable and strong interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In silico immune simulations were performed to assess the immune-response triggering capabilities of the vaccine. This computational analysis suggested that the proposed vaccine candidate would be structurally stable and capable of generating an effective immune response to combat viral infections; however, experimental evaluations remain necessary to verify the exact safety and immunogenicity profile of this vaccine.","['Mahmud S', 'Rafi MO', 'Paul GK', 'Promi MM', 'Shimu MSS', 'Biswas S', 'Emran TB', 'Dhama K', 'Alyami SA', 'Moni MA', 'Saleh MA']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Mahmud S, et al.

While antibody responses displaying cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal/common cold human coronaviruses (hCoVs) have been reported, potential cross-reactivity with aCoVs and the diagnostic implications are incompletely understood. Here, we probed for antibody binding against all seven hCoVs and 49 aCoVs represented as 12,924 peptides within a phage-displayed antigen library. Antibody repertoires of 269 recovered COVID-19 patients showed distinct changes compared to 260 unexposed pre-pandemic controls, not limited to binding of SARS-CoV-2 antigens but including binding to antigens from hCoVs and aCoVs with shared motifs to SARS-CoV-2. We isolated broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients that bind a shared motif of SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, and several aCoVs, demonstrating that interspecies cross-reactivity can be mediated by a single immunoglobulin. Employing antibody binding data against the entire CoV antigen library allowed accurate discrimination of recovered COVID-19 patients from unexposed individuals by machine learning. Leaving out SARS-CoV-2 antigens and relying solely on antibody binding to other hCoVs and aCoVs achieved equally accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection without knowledge of its unique antigens solely from cross-reactive antibody responses against other hCoVs and aCoVs suggests a potential diagnostic strategy for the early stage of future pandemics.

Although the receptor binding characteristics of human coronaviruses are well documented, the role of carbohydrate binding in addition to recognition of proteinaceous receptors has not been fully explored. Using natural glycan microarray technology, we identified N-glycans in the human lung that are recognized by various human and animal coronaviruses. All viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2, bound strongly to a range of phosphorylated, high mannose N-glycans and to a very specific set of sialylated structures.

34324165,Waning antibody responses in COVID-19: what can we learn from the analysis of other coronaviruses?,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Due to the continuing surge in incidence and mortality globally, determining whether protective, long-term immunity develops after initial infection or vaccination has become critical.
METHODS/RESULTS: In this narrative review, we evaluate the latest understanding of antibody-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and to other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the four endemic human coronaviruses) in order to predict the consequences of antibody waning on long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We summarise their antibody dynamics, including the potential effects of cross-reactivity and antibody waning on vaccination and other public health strategies. At present, based on our comparison with other coronaviruses we estimate that natural antibody-mediated protection for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to last for 1-2 years and therefore, if vaccine-induced antibodies follow a similar course, booster doses may be required. However, other factors such as memory B- and T-cells and new viral strains will also affect the duration of both natural and vaccine-mediated immunity.
CONCLUSION: Overall, antibody titres required for protection are yet to be established and inaccuracies of serological methods may be affecting this. We expect that with standardisation of serological testing and studies with longer follow-up, the implications of antibody waning will become clearer.","['Hamady A', 'Lee J', 'Loboda ZA']",2022,50,1,Infection,"Hamady A, et al.

34323192,Assessment of COVID-19 Treatment Advised in Different Ethnic Populations.,"A virus is an infectious agent that can only replicate within a host organism and can infect a variety of living organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals. Viruses are so small that a microscope is necessary to visualize them, and they have a very simple structure. A coronavirus is a group of viruses that can cause diseases, for instance, the basic cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The patients affected with the COVID-19 infection will encounter respiratory sickness and can recuperate without requiring normal therapy. Individuals with clinical issues like cardiovascular problems, diabetes, and respiratory illness will suffer from the ailment. COVID-19 disease spreads through aerosols or the nose when an infected individual hacks or sneezes. In 2019, a new disease, known as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was discovered in China, and on March 11, 2020, it was declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO), spreading rapidly across 194 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. The best way to stop the spread of the transmission is to be instructed about COVID-19 and how it spreads. In this survey, we are endeavoring to focus on the drugs and vaccines that are used for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.","['Arjun B', 'Krishnendu PR', 'Pappachen LK', 'Zachariah SM']",2022,17,2,Curr Drug Saf,"Arjun B, et al.

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant indicated the higher transmission among human-to-human and increasing hospitalisation. SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in domestic animals showing human-to-pet transmission. In the current study, we report the first direct known human-to-cat transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant within the same family. Previous findings showed that companion animals can get infected by COVID-19 patients after 3-6 weeks; however, according to our molecular findings, the cat was infected by the viral variant at the same period. Moreover, B.1.1.7 infection caused and developed several clinical symptoms including cardiac and ocular abnormalities. Overall, our findings determined the first direct and high transmission ability of the B.1.1.7 variant from COVID-19 affected family members to cat.

This review explores the current evidence of epidemiological and environmental factors associated with high transmission of COVID-19. Even transmission and symptoms found among cats, dogs, ferrets, and tiger suggested low species barrier of the virus. The airborne transmission was found even up to 4 m, and fecal transmission with virus particles and RNA in sewage and wastewater suggests rethinking containment strategies. However, temperature, humidity, and pollution were also associated with transmission and mortality trends of COVID-19.

Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62%-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite.

Although this symbiosis is in part species specific, different rhizobial strains may colonize the same nodule. Some rhizobial strains are commonly known as better competitors than others, but detailed analyses that aim to predict rhizobial competitive abilities based on genomes are still scarce. Here, we performed a bacterial genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis to define the genomic determinants related to the competitive capabilities in the model rhizobial species Sinorhizobium meliloti. For this, 13 tester strains were green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged and assayed versus 3 red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged reference competitor strains (Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C) in a Medicago sativa nodule occupancy test.

34305617,"Remdesivir Strongly Binds to RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase, Membrane Protein, and Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2: Indication From Molecular Modeling and Simulations.","Development of new drugs is a time-taking and expensive process. Comprehensive efforts are being made globally toward the search of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and lopinavir have been included in the treatment regimen and shown effective results in several cases. Among the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, remdesivir is found to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral action against many single-stranded RNA viruses including pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this study, we proposed that remdesivir strongly binds to membrane protein (Mprotein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and main protease (Mprotease) of SARS-CoV-2. It might show antiviral activity by inhibiting more than one target. It has been found that remdesivir binds to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP with -7.8, -7.4, and -7.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The structure dynamics study suggested that binding of remdesivir leads to unfolding of RDRP. It has been found that strong binding of remdesivir to Mprotein leads to decrease in structural deviations and gyrations.

34303688,Evaluation of a multiplexed coronavirus antigen array for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in COVID-19 convalescent plasma.,"Mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic requires an understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. However, throughout the development of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assays during the past year, cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses remained a question. To address these issues, we evaluated IgG in COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples for reactivity against three SARS-CoV-2 antigens including full-length spike, receptor binding domain, and the proximal extracellular fusion domain, and spike antigens from other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63) using the VaxArray Coronavirus SeroAssay which is a multiplexed antigen assay developed by InDevR Inc. These results were compared to two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs targeting either the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike antigens and a live virus focus reduction neutralizing antibody test (FRNT). The VaxArray platform showed high specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, evident from lack of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens despite significant reactivity to endemic coronavirus antigens in pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive samples reacted weakly to SARS-CoV spike but not to MERS-CoV. While the VaxArray platform had overall comparable results to the spike and nucleocapsid IgG ELISAs, results were more similar to the spike antigen ELISA and the platform displayed a higher sensitivity and specificity than both ELISAs. Samples with FRNT titers below 1/23 reported negative on VaxArray, while positive samples on VaxArray had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers. These results suggest that the VaxArray Coronavirus SeroAssay performs with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and positive results on the platform indicate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity.","['Huey L', 'Andersen G', 'Merkel PA', 'Morrison TE', 'McCarthy M', 'DomBourian MG', 'Annen K', 'Dawson ED', 'Rowlen KL', 'Knight V']",2021,497,,J Immunol Methods,"Huey L, et al.

34297627,Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses Through Human Monocytes and Tissue Macrophages.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) contribute significantly to the burden of respiratory diseases, frequently as upper respiratory tract infections. Recent emergence of novel coronaviruses in the last few decades has highlighted the potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses. In this literature review, we shall explore the disease-causing mechanism of the virus through human monocytes and macrophages. Common strains will be discussed; however, this review will center around coronaviruses responsible for epidemics, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1 and -2 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Macrophages are key players in the immune system and have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of lethal coronaviruses. In physiology, they are white blood cells that engulf and digest cellular debris, foreign substances, and microbes. They play a critical role in innate immunity and help initiate adaptive immunity. Human coronaviruses utilize various mechanisms to undermine the innate immune response through its interaction with macrophages and monocytes. It is capable of entering immune cells through DPP4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase 4) receptors and antibody-dependent enhancement, delaying initial interferon response which supports robust viral replication. Pathogenesis includes triggering the production of overwhelming pro-inflammatory cytokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection, which propagate prolonged pro-inflammatory response. The virus has also been found to suppress the release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, leading to an aberrant inflammatory response. Elevated serum cytokines are also believed to contribute to pathological features seen in severe disease such as coagulopathy, acute lung injury, and multiorgan failure.",['Huang C'],2021,34,9,Viral Immunol,Huang C.

34287009,Amplicon and Metagenomic Analysis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus and the Microbiome in Patients with Severe MERS.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional zoonotic spill over into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors, and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are coincident in the Middle East and thus a rapid way of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology is needed. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are coinfections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterize these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, an amplicon-based approach was developed and coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated with clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole-genome or near-whole-genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants, including deletion mutants. The metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified, which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses.

The virus emerged in bats and was disseminated to humans in December 2019 via still unknown intermediate species in Wuhan, China. It is disseminated by inhalation or breaks out with infected droplets and the incubation period is between 2 and 14 days. The symptoms usually include high body temperature, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, low energy or tiredness, and weakness. The condition is moderate in most people; but in the elderly and those with comorbidities, it advances to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. Popular research work includes normal/low WBC with upraised C-reactive protein (CRP). Treatment is generally supportive and requires home seclusion of suspected persons and rigorous infection control methods at hospitals. The Covid-19 has lower fatality than SARS and MERS. Among the proposed therapeutic regimen, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdisevir, azithromycin, toclizumab, and cromostat mesylate have shown promising results, and the limited benefit was seen with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. Early development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine started based on the full-length genome analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Several subunit vaccines, peptides, nucleic acids, plant-derived, and recombinant vaccines are under pipeline. Research work, development of new medicines and vaccines, and efforts to reduce disease morbidity and mortality must be encouraged to improve our position in the fight against this disease and to protect human life.","['Rufaida', 'Mahmood T', 'Kedwai I', 'Ahsan F', 'Shamim A', 'Shariq M', 'Parveen S']",2021,33,1,J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,"Rufaida, et al.

34280186,Hamming-shifting graph of genomic short reads: Efficient construction and its application for compression.,"Graphs such as de Bruijn graphs and OLC (overlap-layout-consensus) graphs have been widely adopted for the de novo assembly of genomic short reads. This work studies another important problem in the field: how graphs can be used for high-performance compression of the large-scale sequencing data. We present a novel graph definition named Hamming-Shifting graph to address this problem. The definition originates from the technological characteristics of next-generation sequencing machines, aiming to link all pairs of distinct reads that have a small Hamming distance or a small shifting offset or both. We compute multiple lexicographically minimal k-mers to index the reads for an efficient search of the weight-lightest edges, and we prove a very high probability of successfully detecting these edges. The resulted graph creates a full mutual reference of the reads to cascade a code-minimized transfer of every child-read for an optimal compression. We conducted compression experiments on the minimum spanning forest of this extremely sparse graph, and achieved a 10 - 30% more file size reduction compared to the best compression results using existing algorithms. As future work, the separation and connectivity degrees of these giant graphs can be used as economical measurements or protocols for quick quality assessment of wet-lab machines, for sufficiency control of genomic library preparation, and for accurate de novo genome assembly.","['Liu Y', 'Li J']",2021,17,7,PLoS Comput Biol,Liu Y and Li J.

Various methods have been used to treat SARS-CoV-2 that is generally based on the information obtained from the therapeutic approaches used for SARS-COV and MERS patients. In this article, we introduce a theoretical strategy in which a two-domain fusion protein presents the virus to the immune system. This fusion protein contains a viral-binding domain such as the ACE2 domain and a domain such as the hepatitis B antigen that has previously been exposed to the immune system. This two-domain fusion protein, could be called ""virus-presenting fusion protein"", would attach to the virus spike protein via the ACE2 domain while the hepatitis B antigen would be bound by anti-hepatitis B antibodies facilitating the opsonization and presentation of the virus to the immune system. We believe that this virus-presenting fusion protein will accelerate the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","['Rahmani R', 'Eivazi N', 'Paknejad M', 'Aminian M']",2021,32,3,Virusdisease,"Rahmani R, et al.

34274470,Therapeutic perceptions in antisense RNA-mediated gene regulation for COVID-19.,"COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is widely accepted that the world will not return to its prepandemic normality until safe and effective vaccines are available and a global vaccination program has been successfully implemented. Antisense RNAs are single-stranded RNAs that occur naturally or are synthetic and enable hybridizing and protein-blocking translation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify target markers in the RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, with a length between 21 and 28 bases that could enable the development of vaccines and therapies based on antisense RNA. We used a search algorithm in C language to compare 3159 complete nucleotide sequences from SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from the repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The objective was to verify whether any common sequences were present in all 3159 strains of SARS-CoV-2. In the first of three datasets (SARS-CoV-2), the algorithm found two sequences each of 21 nucleotides (Sequence 1: CTACTGAAGCCTTTGAAAAAA; Sequence 2: TGTGGTTATACCTACTAAAAA). In the second dataset (SARS-CoV) and third dataset (MERS-CoV), no sequences of size N between 21 and 28 were found. Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 were input into BLAST® ≫ blastn and recognized by the platform. The gene identified by the sequences found by the algorithm was the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV-2. Considerable progress in antisense RNA research has been made in recent years, and great achievements in the application of antisense RNA have been observed. However, many mechanisms of antisense RNA are not yet understood. Thus, more time and money must be invested into the development of therapies for gene regulation mediated by antisense RNA to treat COVID-19 as no effective therapy for this disease has yet been found.","['de Jesus SF', 'Santos LI', 'Rodrigues Neto JF', 'Vieira TM', 'Mendes JB', ""D'angelo MFSV"", 'Guimaraes ALS']",2021,800,,Gene,"de Jesus SF, et al.

34272088,Alterations of Lipid Profile in COVID-19: A Narrative Review.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 100 million infections and over 3 million deaths worldwide. Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial to guide prognostic and therapeutic implications. Viral infections are known to alter the lipid profile and metabolism of their host cells, similar to the case with MERS and SARS-CoV-2002. Since lipids play various metabolic roles, studying lipid profile alterations in COVID-19 is an inevitable step as an attempt to achieve better therapeutic strategies, as well as a potential prognostic factor in the course of this disease. Several studies have reported changes in lipid profile associated with COVID-19. The most frequently reported changes are a decline in serum cholesterol and ApoA1 levels and elevated triglycerides. The hyper-inflammatory state mediated by the Cytokine storm disturbs several fundamental lipid biosynthesis pathways. Virus replication is a process that drastically changes the host cell's lipid metabolism program and overuses cell lipid resources. Lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels are associated with higher severity and mortality rates and with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Studies suggest that arachidonic acid omega-3 derivatives might help modulate hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm resulting from pulmonary involvement. Also, statins have been shown to be beneficial when administered after COVID-19 diagnosis via unclear mechanisms probably associated with anti-inflammatory effects and HDL-C rising effects.","['Rezaei A', 'Neshat S', 'Heshmat-Ghahdarijani K']",2022,47,3,Curr Probl Cardiol,"Rezaei A, et al.

34268202,Frontier Therapeutics and Vaccine Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): A Review.,"COVID-19 is considered as the third human coronavirus and has a high potential for transmission. Fast public health interventions through antibodies, anti-virals or novel vaccine strategies to control the virus and disease transmission have been extremely followed. SARS-CoV-2 shares about 79% genomic similarity with SARS-CoV and approximately 50% with MERS-CoV. Based on these similarities, prior knowledge in treating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be used as the basis of majority of the alternatives for controlling SARS-CoV-2. Immunotherapy is an effective strategy for clinical treatment of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Passive antibody therapy, which decreases the virus replication and disease severity, is assessed as an effective therapeutic approach to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. The close similarity between SARS-CoV-2 genome with the SARS-CoV genome caused both coronaviruses to bind to the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that found in the human lung. There are several strategies to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which the majority of them are based on those developed previously for SARS-CoV. The interaction between the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 on the host cell surface leads to the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. S protein, which is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies, has been targeted by most of these strategies. Vaccines that induce an immune response against the S protein to inhibit its binding with the host ACE2 receptor, can be considered as effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aimed to review frontier therapeutics and vaccination strategies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","['Sheikhshahrokh A', 'Ranjbar R', 'Saeidi E', 'Safarpoor Dehkordi F', 'Heiat M', 'Ghasemi-Dehkordi P', 'Goodarzi H']",2020,49,Suppl 1,Iran J Public Health,"Sheikhshahrokh A, et al.

The extent to which confirmed cases can predict the morbidity and mortality in a society remains an unresolved issue. The research objective is therefore to test a generic model's predictability through time, based on percentage of confirmed cases on hospitalized patients, ICU patients and deceased. This study reports the explanatory and predictive ability of COVID-19-related healthcare data, such as whether there is a spread of a contagious and virulent virus in a society, and if so, whether the morbidity and mortality can be estimated in advance in the population. The model estimations stress the implementation of a pandemic strategy containing a proactive protocol entailing what, when, where, who and how countermeasures should be in place when a virulent virus (e.g. SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS) or pandemic strikes next time. Several lessons for the future can be learnt from the reported model estimations. One lesson is that COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in a population is indeed predictable. Another lesson is to have a proactive protocol of countermeasures in place.","['Svensson G', 'Rodriguez R', 'Padin C']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Svensson G, et al.

The simulative study investigated the nucleotide sequence of closely related strains of respiratory syndrome viruses, codon-by-codon with maximum likelihood analysis, z selection, and the divergence time. The simulated results, dN/dS > 1 signify that an entire substitution model tends towards the hypothesis's positive evolution. The effect of transition/transversion proportion, Z-test of selection, and the evolution associated with these respiratory syndromes, are also analyzed. Z-test of selection for neutral and positive evolution indicates lower to positive values of dN-dS (0.012, 0.019) due to multiple substitutions in a short span. Modified Nei-Gojobori (P) statistical technique results also favor multiple substitutions with the transition/transversion rate from 1 to 7. The divergence time analysis also supports the result of dN/dS and imparts substantiating proof of evolution.

34260643,Environmental stability of porcine respiratory coronavirus in aquatic environments.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of viruses that are best known as the causative agents of human diseases like the common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. CoVs spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. There is, however, concern about potential waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, as it has been found in wastewater facilities and rivers. To date, little is known about the stability of SARS-CoV-2 or any other free coronavirus in aquatic environments. The inactivation of terrestrial CoVs in seawater is rarely studied. Here, we use a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) that is commonly found in animal husbandry as a surrogate to study the stability of CoVs in natural water. A series of experiments were conducted in which PRCV (strain 91V44) was added to filtered and unfiltered fresh- and saltwater taken from the river Scheldt and the North Sea. Virus titres were then measured by TCID50-assays using swine testicle cell cultures after various incubation times. The results show that viral inactivation of PRCV in filtered seawater can be rapid, with an observed 99% decline in the viral load after just two days, which may depend on temperature and the total suspended matter concentration. PRCV degraded much slower in filtered water from the river Scheldt, taking over 15 days to decline by 99%, which was somewhat faster than the PBS control treatment (T99 = 19.2 days). Overall, the results suggest that terrestrial CoVs are not likely to accumulate in marine environments. Studies into potential interactions with exudates (proteases, nucleases) from the microbial food web are, however, recommended.","['De Rijcke M', 'Shaikh HM', 'Mees J', 'Nauwynck H', 'Vandegehuchte MB']",2021,16,7,PLoS One,"De Rijcke M, et al.

The mean age of the infected patients was estimated to be between 50 and 69 years old. Accordingly, the COVID-19 mortality rate was calculated as 15%. In this regard, the essential component of prevention and planning is knowledge of laboratory and demographic findings among COVID-19 patients; therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate laboratory and demographic findings among these patients worldwide. This systematic review was performed on the articles published in English between January 1, 2019 and May 4, 2020, using MeSH-compliant keywords such as ""COVID-19"", ""Laboratory, coronavirus disease-19 testing"", and "" demography "" in international databases (PubMed, and web of science Scopus).

Epidemiological status changes dynamically as the pandemy is far from ending. Several complications of presented virus may be similar to those observed in other viral infections. Despite lacking data, the heart involvement may be comparable to cardiac complications observed previously in those with SARS as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In COVID-19 we observe elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, troponins, myoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin, which is likely the result of myocardial injury. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury include direct toxicity through the viral invasion of cardiac myocytes, ACE-2 receptor-mediated CV (cardiac and endothelial) injury, microvascular dysfunction and thrombosis and cytokine release syndrome (mainly IL-6 mediated). Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmia.","['Bielecka-Dabrowa A', 'Cichocka-Radwan A', 'Lewek J', 'Pawliczak F', 'Maciejewski M', 'Banach M']",2021,22,2,Rev Cardiovasc Med,"Bielecka-Dabrowa A, et al.

Viruses, nature's nanomachines, have already existed for thousands of years. In 2019, the whole world had to come together to confront a life-threatening nanomachine named ""SARS-CoV-2"", which causes COVID-19 illness. SARS-CoV-2, a smart nanomachine, attaches itself to the ACE2 and CD147 receptors present on the cell surfaces of the lungs, kidneys, heart, brain, intestines, testes, etc. and triggers pathogenesis. Cell entry triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses resulting in tissue damage, with the worst affected cases leading to death. SARS-CoV-2 influences several receptors and signalling pathways; therefore, finding a biomaterial that caps these signalling pathways and ligand sites is of interest. This research aimed to compare the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and its elderly sisters, MERS and SARS.

However, MERS with extensive lesions (MERS type-2) is rarely associated with adenovirus. There are only three published cases of MERS type-2 associated with adenovirus infection.
CASE: We present a 10-year-old previously healthy girl who presented with speech difficulty and mild encephalopathy after three days of prodromal illness. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral diffusion restriction in the parietal white matter, splenium and genu of the corpus callosum without mass effect and slight thickening at the splenium of corpus callosum with no contrast enhancement. With empirical and support treatment, her neurological examination was completely normal by the 18th hour. The nasopharyngeal respiratory adenoviral PCR resulted positive. She was discharged with total clinical and radiological resolution on the 10th day of admission. The case was diagnosed with MERS type-2 which is rarely associated with adenoviral infection.

34252928,Sequence-specific minimizers via polar sets.,"MOTIVATION: Minimizers are efficient methods to sample k-mers from genomic sequences that unconditionally preserve sufficiently long matches between sequences. Well-established methods to construct efficient minimizers focus on sampling fewer k-mers on a random sequence and use universal hitting sets (sets of k-mers that appear frequently enough) to upper bound the sketch size. In contrast, the problem of sequence-specific minimizers, which is to construct efficient minimizers to sample fewer k-mers on a specific sequence such as the reference genome, is less studied. Currently, the theoretical understanding of this problem is lacking, and existing methods do not specialize well to sketch specific sequences.
RESULTS: We propose the concept of polar sets, complementary to the existing idea of universal hitting sets. Polar sets are k-mer sets that are spread out enough on the reference, and provably specialize well to specific sequences. Link energy measures how well spread out a polar set is, and with it, the sketch size can be bounded from above and below in a theoretically sound way. This allows for direct optimization of sketch size. We propose efficient heuristics to construct polar sets, and via experiments on the human reference genome, show their practical superiority in designing efficient sequence-specific minimizers.

34250551,Alexithymia and Emotion Regulation Strategies in Adolescent Gamblers with and Without At-Risk Profiles.,"Alexithymia, difficulties in emotion regulation, and negative affect play an important role in adolescents who present pathological gambling. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were, firstly, to analyze the differences between alexithymia, difficulties in emotion regulation, and positive and negative affect in adolescents with and without risk of gambling problems. Secondly, the relationships between all the variables of the study in adolescents with and without risk of problem gambling were analyzed separately. Thirdly, we analyzed the mediating role of positive and negative affect in the relationship between alexithymia and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (ERS) in adolescents at risk of gambling problems. The sample was composed of 206 adolescents with ages ranging from 12 to 18 years (M = 15.52; SD = 1.43). They were divided into two groups according to the score obtained in the South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised for Adolescents (SOGS-RA). Thus, 84 were included in the group without risk of gambling problems and 122 in the group at risk of gambling problems. The results obtained revealed higher scores in negative affect and pathological gambling in the group at risk of gambling problems. Likewise, positive relationships between alexithymia, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (MERS), and affect were found. Mediation analyses showed that difficulties in identifying feelings were indirectly related to greater use of dysfunctional ERS through their relationship with negative affect in at-risk gamblers.","['Estévez A', 'Jauregui P', 'Macía L', 'Martín-Pérez C']",2022,38,1,J Gambl Stud,"Estévez A, et al.

We made the following findings: The majority of IGs are upregulated in the first 12 hours post-infection (PI), and maintained until 48 hours PI in human microvascular EC infected by middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (an EC model for COVID-19). The expressions of IGs are modulated in 21 human EC transcriptomic datasets by various PAMPs/DAMPs, including LPS, LPC, shear stress, hyperlipidemia and oxLDL. Upregulation of many IGs such as nucleic acid sensors are shared between ECs infected by MERS-CoV and those stimulated by PAMPs and DAMPs. Human heart EC and mouse aortic EC express all four types of coronavirus receptors such as ANPEP, CEACAM1, ACE2, DPP4 and virus entry facilitator TMPRSS2 (heart EC); most of coronavirus replication-transcription protein complexes are expressed in HMEC, which contribute to viremia, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular comorbidities of COVID-19. ECs have novel trained immunity (TI), in which subsequent inflammation is enhanced. Upregulated proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, CSF1 and CSF3 and TI marker IL-32 as well as TI metabolic enzymes and epigenetic enzymes indicate TI function in HMEC infected by MERS-CoV, which may drive cytokine storms. Upregulated CSF1 and CSF3 demonstrate a novel function of ECs in promoting myelopoiesis. Mechanistically, the ER stress and ROS, together with decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, facilitate a proinflammatory response and TI. Additionally, an increase of the regulators of mitotic catastrophe cell death, apoptosis, ferroptosis, inflammasomes-driven pyroptosis in ECs infected with MERS-CoV and the upregulation of pro-thrombogenic factors increase thromboembolism potential. Finally, NRF2-suppressed ROS regulate innate immune responses, TI, thrombosis, EC inflammation and death. These transcriptomic results provide novel insights on the roles of ECs in coronavirus infections such as COVID-19, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), inflammation, transplantation, autoimmune disease and cancers.","['Shao Y', 'Saredy J', 'Xu K', 'Sun Y', 'Saaoud F', 'Drummer C', 'Lu Y', 'Luo JJ', 'Lopez-Pastrana J', 'Choi ET', 'Jiang X', 'Wang H', 'Yang X']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Shao Y, et al.

In this study, immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays revealed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of MERS-CoV interacted with human translation elongation factor 1A (EF1A), an essential component of the translation system with important roles in protein translation, cytokinesis, and filamentous actin (F-actin) bundling. The C-terminal motif (residues 359-363) of the N protein was the crucial domain involved in this interaction.

We consider the impact of six major pandemic episodes - H3N2 Flu (1968), SARS (2003), H1N1 Swine Flu (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016) - on cross-country inequalities in samples of 46-167 countries observed over 1950-2019. Results show that the past pandemics have moderately increased income inequality in the affected countries in the period of four to five years after the pandemic's start. On the other hand, we do not find any robust negative impacts on wealth inequality. The results concerning gender inequality are less consistent, but we find some evidence of declining gender equality among the hardest hit countries. Moreover, the gender gap in unemployment grew within the four years after the onset of the pandemic.",['Brzezinski M'],2021,43,,Econ Hum Biol,Brzezinski M.

Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) was, initially discovered as a potent antiviral agent, over 50 years ago, and has recently garnered renewed interest as a promising factor involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. When new disease epidemics appear such as SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), IAV (Influenza A virus), and in particular the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is especially timely to review the complexity of immune system responses to viral infections. Here we consider the controversial roles of effectors like IFNγ, discussing its actions in immunomodulation and immunotolerance. We explore the possibility that modulation of IFNγ could be used to influence the course of such infections. Importantly, not only could endogenous expression of IFNγ influence the outcome, there are existing IFNγ therapeutics that can readily be applied in the clinic. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlled by IFNγ suggests that the exact timing for application of IFNγ-based therapeutics could be crucial: it should be earlier to significantly reduce the viral load and thus decrease the overall severity of the disease.","['Todorović-Raković N', 'Whitfield JR']",2021,146,,Cytokine,Todorović-Raković N and Whitfield JR.

Tools that track the number and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and help in making policy decisions for controlling the outbreak. However, the current surveillance web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive and require specific computational knowledge. We developed a user-friendly web tool, named OUTBREAK, that facilitates epidemic surveillance by showing in an animated graph the timeline and geolocations of cases of an outbreak. It permits even non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in real-time. We applied our tool to visualize the SARS 2003, MERS, and COVID19 epidemics, and provided them as examples on the website. Through the zoom feature, it is also possible to visualize cases at city and even neighborhood levels. We made the tool freely available at https://outbreak.sysbio.tools/ .

34232978,"A Comparison of the Clinical, Viral, Pathologic, and Immunologic Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Diseases.","CONTEXT.—: The purpose of this review was to compare 3 coronavirus diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, respectively.
OBJECTIVE.—: To cover the following topics: clinical considerations, viral characteristics, pathology, immune response, pathogenesis, and the prognosis associated with each coronavirus disease in humans.
DATA SOURCES.—: Clinically, flu-like symptoms are usual at the time of presentation for all 3 diseases, but these vary from asymptomatic to severe multisystem involvement. The pathology associated with symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19 has been well described, the most prominent of which is diffuse alveolar damage. The immune response to each of these viruses is highly complex and includes both humoral and cellular components that can have a significant impact on prognosis. In severe cases of COVID-19, a dysregulated innate host immune system can initiate a hyperinflammatory syndrome dominated by endothelial dysfunction that can lead to a hypercoagulable state with microthrombi, resulting in a systemic microvascular and macrovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS.—: The severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics have been limited, involving approximately 8000 and 2500 individuals, respectively. In contrast, COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic with more than 177 million cases and 3.9 million deaths as of June 15, 2021, and fatality rates ranging from less than 0.1% to approximately 10% depending upon the country.

34230929,Betacoronavirus-specific alternate splicing.,"Viruses can subvert a number of cellular processes in order to block innate antiviral responses, and many viruses interact with cellular splicing machinery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to suppress global mRNA splicing, and at least 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind specifically to one or more human RNAs. Here, we investigate 17 published experimental and clinical datasets related to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as datasets from the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS as well as Streptococcus pneumonia, HCV, Zika virus, Dengue virus, influenza H3N2, and RSV. We show that genes showing differential alternative splicing in SARS-CoV-2 have a similar functional profile to those of SARS-CoV and MERS and affect a diverse set of genes and biological functions, including many closely related to virus biology. Additionally, the differentially spliced transcripts of cells infected by coronaviruses were more likely to undergo intron-retention, contain a pseudouridine modification and a smaller number of exons than differentially spliced transcripts in the control groups. Viral load in clinical COVID-19 samples was correlated with isoform distribution of differentially spliced genes. A significantly higher number of ribosomal genes are affected by DAS and DGE in betacoronavirus samples, and the betacoronavirus differentially spliced genes are depleted for binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate characteristic patterns of differential splicing in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS, potentially modifying a broad range of cellular functions and affecting a diverse set of genes and biological functions.","['Karlebach G', 'Aronow B', 'Baylin SB', 'Butler D', 'Foox J', 'Levy S', 'Meydan C', 'Mozsary C', 'Saravia-Butler AM', 'Taylor DM', 'Wurtele E', 'Mason CE', 'Beheshti A', 'Robinson PN']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Karlebach G, et al.

Here we review the incidence and outcomes of alveolar air leaks over 400 patients admitted to our tertiary care institution for moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective audit of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital. Patients who were recognized as either a spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and subcutaneous emphysema were identified. Their clinical features and characteristics were thoroughly documented and clinical outcomes were gathered. Each case has been presented as a brief synopsis.

A variety of pathogens including influenza virus, rotavirus, and adenovirus associated with MERS have been reported. However, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related MERS is relatively rare in infants. In this study, we report two Chinese infants who suffered from RSV-related MERS. Both infants manifested as fever, seizure, and altered states of consciousness with confirmed detections of RSV-RNA in the specimens from throat swab. Clinical symptoms/signs such as apnea and shallow breathing were also noted in these two infants. Furthermore, brain MRI images indicated reversible isolated lesions with transiently reduced diffusion in the SCC. Fortunately, both of these two infants recovered completely following treatment within a month. Our study suggests that RSV may serve as a novel causative agent for MERS in infants.

While human coronavirus infections had been historically associated with only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, three coronaviruses identified since 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, cause life-threatening severe respiratory syndromes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a worldwide health emergency. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccination, rapid and reliable detection is of vital importance to control coronavirus epidemics/pandemics.
AREA COVERED: A literature search was performed in Pubmed covering the detections and diagnostics of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. This review summarized the current knowledge of established and emerging methods for coronavirus detection. The characteristics of different diagnostic approaches were described, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method were analyzed and compared. In addition, future trends in the field of coronavirus detection were also discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Nucleic acid-based RT-PCR is the current golden-standard of coronavirus detection, while immunoassays provide history of coronavirus infection besides diagnostic information. Integrated high-throughput system holds the great potential and is the trend of future detection and diagnosis of virus infection.","['Diao M', 'Lang L', 'Feng J', 'Li R']",2022,20,2,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,"Diao M, et al.

Delay in diagnosis has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/μL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 0.25-2.5 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid. We evaluated 37 nasopharyngeal samples using CDC's N3, N1 and N2 RT-real-time PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 as reference test.

34222613,Statistical study on the impact of different meteorological changes on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and its latitude.,"More than 1 million illnesses and 70,000 deaths were reported due to novel COVID-19 by the end of the first quarter of 2020. In April 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The striking resemblance between COVID-19 and its forerunners SARS and MERS, as well as earlier findings on the impact of meteorological conditions on the spread of SARS and MERS, prompted researchers to investigate the relationship between meteorological conditions and the spread of COVID-19. In this work, we statistically studied the effect of different meteorological parameters such as average temperature, humidity, dew point, and wind speed on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and its latitude (Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey). Our findings revealed that there is a correlation between several meteorological parameters and the spread of COVID-19, but that, contrary to popular belief, the virus does not disappear when the temperature rises. Our theory is that either the virus became active in Egypt and its latitude as the temperature rose, or the humidity became unstable when the temperature rose during the summer season. A log-linear quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relationship between the studied metrological parameters and the spread of COVID-19. The findings of the study will have ramifications for future control and prevention efforts in Egypt and its latitude.","['Hamd A', 'Abdulraheem DE', 'Khan AAP', 'Shaban M', 'Alamry KA', 'Asiri AM']",2022,8,2,Model Earth Syst Environ,"Hamd A, et al.

34221359,Macro level factors influencing strategic responses to emergent pandemics: A scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Strategic planning is critical for successful pandemic management. This study aimed to identify and review the scope and analytic depth of situation analyses conducted to understand their utility, and capture the documented macro-level factors impacting pandemic management.
METHODS: To synthesise this disparate body of literature, we adopted a two-step search and review process. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify all studies since 2000, that have 1) employed a situation analysis; and 2) examined contextual factors influencing pandemic management. The included studies are analysed using a seven-domain systems approach from the discipline of strategic management.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the final review ranging from single country (6) to regional, multi-country studies (13). Fourteen studies had a single disease focus, with 5 studies evaluating responses to one or more of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus disease pandemics. Six studies examined a single domain from political, economic, sociological, technological, ecological or wider industry (PESTELI), 5 studies examined two to four domains, and 8 studies examined five or more domains. Methods employed were predominantly literature reviews. The recommendations focus predominantly on addressing inhibitors in the sociological and technological domains with few recommendations articulated in the political domain. Overall, the legislative domain is least represented.
CONCLUSIONS: Ex-post analysis using the seven-domain strategic management framework provides further opportunities for a planned systematic response to pandemics which remains critical as the current COVID-19 pandemic evolves.","['Zhu NJ', 'Ferlie EB', 'Castro-Sánchez E', 'Birgand G', 'Holmes AH', 'Atun RA', 'Kieltyka H', 'Ahmad R', 'COMPASS (COntrol and Management of PAndemicS through Strategic analysis) study group']",2021,11,,J Glob Health,"Zhu NJ, et al.

34220846,A Comparative Analysis of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid (N) Proteins Reveals the SADS-CoV N Protein Antagonizes IFN-β Production by Inducing Ubiquitination of RIG-I.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a known global threat, and most recently the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 2 million human lives. Delays and interference with IFN responses are closely associated with the severity of disease caused by CoV infection. As the most abundant viral protein in infected cells just after the entry step, the CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein likely plays a key role in IFN interruption. We have conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis and report herein that the N proteins of representative human and animal CoVs from four different genera [swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)] suppress IFN responses by multiple strategies. In particular, we found that the N protein of SADS-CoV interacted with RIG-I independent of its RNA binding activity, mediating K27-, K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and its subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation, thus inhibiting the host IFN response. These data provide insight into the interaction between CoVs and host, and offer new clues for the development of therapies against these important viruses.","['Liu Y', 'Liang QZ', 'Lu W', 'Yang YL', 'Chen R', 'Huang YW', 'Wang B']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Liu Y, et al.

34219846,"Monitoring of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): Origin, transmission, and food preservation methods.","UNLABELLED: Unfortunately, there is limited research on coronavirus survival of food products and also food processing. The knowledge of the physical and chemical characteristics of coronaviruses mostly comes from the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV physical (i.e., thermal processing, chilling and freezing, microwave irradiation, ultraviolet light, gamma irradiation, high hydrostatic pressure) and chemical (acidification and use of common disinfectants in the food industry like chlorinated derivatives and ozone) are means which could be used to inactive the coronaviruses or reduce the infection. These methods can be applied individually or in combination to act better performance. Thermal processing is one of the most effective methods for inactive coronavirus. Heating at 75°C (15-60 min) and 65°C (1 min) was the best temperature for inactive SARS-CoV and MERS virus, respectively. Among irradiation methods (microwave, UV, and gamma), the most effective one is UVC rays. Moreover, the use of disinfectant like chlorinated derivatives is appropriate way to disinfect food product surfaces.
NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: This review provided updated information on effective strategies for inactive coronavirus that can be used in the food industry. SARS-CoV-2 as a new pandemic coronavirus was initiated from contaminated foods and can be transmitted by close contact, aerosols, and food surfaces. Food preservation (physical and chemical) methods could decrease SARS-CoV-2. Probably, heating and UVC are the most effective approach to inactive SARS-CoV-2. Despite the findings of coronavirus inactivation which were here discussed, much research is still needed for the development of new approaches to overcome the coronavirus.","['Farahmandfar R', 'Asnaashari M', 'Hesami B']",2021,45,9,J Food Process Preserv,"Farahmandfar R, et al.

34218691,The Relationship Between Anxiety and Hopelessness Levels Among Nursing Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Factors.,"Outbreaks caused by environmental effects such as COVID-19, MERS, SARS, or Ebola cause problems such as fear, anxiety, loneliness, depression, and hopelessness for people with or without a high risk of illness. This study aims to determine the levels of hopelessness and anxiety experienced by nursing students during the COVID-19 outbreak. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with students of a state university. In the collection of the data, Descriptive Characteristics Form prepared by the researchers, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test (GAD-7), and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were used. The mean GAD-7 score of the students participating in the study was 6.65 ± 5.03 and the mean BHS score was 6.11 ± 4.91. It was determined that the score of GAD-7 and BHS were a significant positive high relationship between them (p < 0.001). Anxiety and hopelessness levels were found to be statistically significantly higher for those whose sleep and eating patterns affected negatively due to the pandemic, those who feared the pandemic and its economic effects, and those who did not want to work in the hospital during the pandemic period.

They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV-1 are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.","['Babarinsa IA', 'Okunoye GO', 'Odukoya O']",2021,263,,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"Babarinsa IA, et al.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has been specifically used to develop an aptasensor. Surface analysis techniques coupled to fluorescence microscopy and plasmonic analysis have been utilized to characterize the biointerface. Spanning a wide protein range (25 ÷ 1000 nM), the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein was detected with a Limit of Detection (LoD) of about 37 nM. Different interferents (BSA, AH1N1 hemagglutinin protein and MERS spike protein) have been tested confirming the specificity of our aptasensor. Finally, a preliminary test in diluted human serum encouraged its application in a point-of-care device, since POF-based aptasensor represent a potentially low-cost compact biosensor, characterized by a rapid response, a small size and could be an ideal laboratory portable diagnostic tool.","['Cennamo N', 'Pasquardini L', 'Arcadio F', 'Lunelli L', 'Vanzetti L', 'Carafa V', 'Altucci L', 'Zeni L']",2021,233,,Talanta,"Cennamo N, et al.

34214175,A sensitive repeat identification framework based on short and long reads.,"Numerous studies have shown that repetitive regions in genomes play indispensable roles in the evolution, inheritance and variation of living organisms. However, most existing methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance on identifying repeats in terms of both accuracy and size, since NGS reads are too short to identify long repeats whereas SMS (Single Molecule Sequencing) long reads are with high error rates. In this study, we present a novel identification framework, LongRepMarker, based on the global de novo assembly and k-mer based multiple sequence alignment for precisely marking long repeats in genomes. The major characteristics of LongRepMarker are as follows: (i) by introducing barcode linked reads and SMS long reads to assist the assembly of all short paired-end reads, it can identify the repeats to a greater extent; (ii) by finding the overlap sequences between assemblies or chomosomes, it locates the repeats faster and more accurately; (iii) by using the multi-alignment unique k-mers rather than the high frequency k-mers to identify repeats in overlap sequences, it can obtain the repeats more comprehensively and stably; (iv) by applying the parallel alignment model based on the multi-alignment unique k-mers, the efficiency of data processing can be greatly optimized and (v) by taking the corresponding identification strategies, structural variations that occur between repeats can be identified. Comprehensive experimental results show that LongRepMarker can achieve more satisfactory results than the existing de novo detection methods (https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/LongRepMarker).","['Liao X', 'Li M', 'Hu K', 'Wu FX', 'Gao X', 'Wang J']",2021,49,17,Nucleic Acids Res,"Liao X, et al.

34213728,In silico analysis and identification of antiviral coumarin derivatives against 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that generated serious damages for both the human population and the global economy. Therefore, it is currently considered as one of the most important global health problems of human societies and there is an urgent need for potent drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this virus. The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the viral replication inside the host and thus is a promising drug target to design and develop effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. This study evaluated some antiviral coumarin phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of coronaviruses 3CLpro by in silico approaches such as molecular docking, ADMET prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-PBSA binding energy calculation. Natural coumarin derivatives were docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and for further investigation, docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores of these natural compounds were compared with 3CLpro referenced inhibitors (ritonavir and lopinavir) and co-crystal inhibitor N3. Molecular docking studies suggested more than half of the coumarin phytochemicals had favorable interaction at the binding pocket of the coronaviruses 3CLpro and exhibited better binding affinities toward 3CLpro than ritonavir and lopinavir. Most antiviral phytochemicals interact strongly with one or both the catalytic dyad residues (His41 and Cys145) and the other key residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations using MM-PBSA were carried out for three 3CLpro-coumarin complexes and 3CLpro-N3/lopinavir. The results confirmed that the 3CLpro-glycycoumarin, 3CLpro-oxypeucedanin hydrate, and 3CLpro-inophyllum P complexes were highly stable, experience fewer conformation fluctuations and share a similar degree of compactness. Also, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness studies showed good results for the selected coumarin phytochemicals.Therefore, the coumarin phytochemicals could be used as antiviral agents in the treatment of COVID-19 after further studies.","['Abdizadeh R', 'Hadizadeh F', 'Abdizadeh T']",2022,26,2,Mol Divers,"Abdizadeh R, et al.

34211370,Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinson's Disease.,"Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinson's disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.","['Awogbindin IO', 'Ben-Azu B', 'Olusola BA', 'Akinluyi ET', 'Adeniyi PA', 'Di Paolo T', 'Tremblay MÈ']",2021,15,,Front Cell Neurosci,"Awogbindin IO, et al.

34209788,Does the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain Interact Effectively with the DPP4 (CD26) Receptor? A Molecular Docking Study.,"ACE2 has been established as the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Since other human coronaviruses are known to use co-receptors for viral cell entry, it has been suggested that DPP4 (CD26) could be a potential additional binding target or co-receptor, supported by early molecular docking simulation studies. However, recent biophysical studies have shown this interaction to be very weak. We have conducted detailed molecular docking simulations to predict the potential binding interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and DPP4 and compare them with the interactions observed in the experimentally determined structure of the complex of MERS-CoV with DPP4. Whilst the overall binding mode of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to DPP4 is predicted to be similar to that observed in the MERS-CoV-DPP4 complex, including a number of equivalent interactions, important differences in the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV result in substantially weakened interactions with DPP4. This is shown to arise from differences in the predicted proximity, nature and secondary structure at the binding interface on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. These findings do not support DPP4 being a significant receptor for SARS-CoV-2.","['Cameron K', 'Rozano L', 'Falasca M', 'Mancera RL']",2021,22,13,Int J Mol Sci,"Cameron K, et al.

This paper focuses on the link between illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and infectious disease pathogens. A literature review through Web of Science and relevant conference proceedings from 1990 to 2020 resulted in documenting 82 papers and 240 identified pathogen cases. Over 60% of the findings referred to pathogens with known zoonotic potential and five cases directly referenced zoonotic spillover events. The diversity of pathogens by taxa included 44 different pathogens in birds, 47 in mammals, 16 in reptiles, two in amphibians, two in fish, and one in invertebrates. This is the highest diversity of pathogen types in reported literature related to IWT. However, it is likely not a fully representative sample due to needed augmentation of surveillance and monitoring of IWT and more frequent pathogen testing on recovered shipments. The emergence of infectious disease through human globalization has resulted in several pandemics in the last decade including SARS, MERS, avian influenza H1N1,and Ebola.

34206865,Multi-Subunit SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Design Using Evolutionarily Conserved T- and B- Cell Epitopes.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a public health crisis worldwide. Although vaccines against the virus are efficiently being rolled out, they are proving to be ineffective against certain emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The high degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoV) presents the opportunity for designing vaccines that may offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, with cross-protection against other HCoVs. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analyses to identify T and B cell epitopes originating from spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope protein sequences found to be evolutionarily conserved among seven major HCoVs. Evolutionary conservation of these epitopes indicates that they may have critical roles in viral fitness and are, therefore, unlikely to mutate during viral replication thus making such epitopes attractive candidates for a vaccine. Our designed vaccine construct comprises of twelve T and six B cell epitopes that are conserved among HCoVs. The vaccine is predicted to be soluble in water, stable, have a relatively long half-life, and exhibit low allergenicity and toxicity. Our docking results showed that the vaccine forms stable complex with toll-like receptor 4, while the immune simulations predicted that the vaccine may elicit strong IgG, IgM, and cytotoxic T cell responses. Therefore, from multiple perspectives, our multi-subunit vaccine design shows the potential to elicit a strong immune-protective response against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants while carrying minimal risk for causing adverse effects.","['Akbay B', 'Abidi SH', 'Ibrahim MAA', 'Mukhatayev Z', 'Ali S']",2021,9,7,Vaccines (Basel),"Akbay B, et al.

34206264,The Impact of Epidemics and Pandemics on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that healthcare workers (HCWs) experience significant psychological distress during an epidemic or pandemic. Considering the increase in emerging infectious diseases and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review and synthesize the available evidence on the psychological impact of disease outbreaks on HCWs. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of epidemics and pandemics on the mental health of HCWs.
METHOD: PubMed, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles databases were systematically searched from inception to June-end 2020 for studies reporting the impact of a pandemic/epidemic on the mental health of HCWs.
RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were included in this review. Of these, 34 (45%) focused on SARS, 28 (37%) on COVID-19, seven (9%) on MERS, four (5%) on Ebola, two (3%) on H1N1, and one (1%) on H7N9. Most studies were cross-sectional (93%) and were conducted in a hospital setting (95%). Common mental health symptoms identified by this review were acute stress disorder, depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The associated risk factors were working in high-risk environments (frontline), being female, being a nurse, lack of adequate personal protective equipment, longer shifts, lack of knowledge of the virus, inadequate training, less years of experience in healthcare, lack of social support, and a history of quarantine.
CONCLUSION: HCWs working in the frontline during epidemics and pandemics experience a wide range of mental health symptoms. It is imperative that adequate psychological support be provided to HCWs during and after these extraordinary distressful events.","['Chigwedere OC', 'Sadath A', 'Kabir Z', 'Arensman E']",2021,18,13,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Chigwedere OC, et al.

34205489,Broad Impact of Exchange Protein Directly Activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) on Respiratory Viral Infections.,"The recently discovered exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), compared with protein kinase A (PKA), is a fairly new family of cAMP effectors. Soon after the discovery, EPAC has shown its significance in many diseases including its emerging role in infectious diseases. In a recent study, we demonstrated that EPAC, but not PKA, is a promising therapeutic target to regulate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication and its associated inflammation. In mammals, there are two isoforms of EPAC-EPAC1 and EPAC2. Unlike other viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus, which use EPAC1 to regulate viral replication, RSV uses EPAC2 to control its replication and associated cytokine/chemokine responses. To determine whether EPAC2 protein has a broad impact on other respiratory viral infections, we used an EPAC2-specific inhibitor, MAY0132, to examine the functions of EPAC2 in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and adenovirus (AdV) infections. HMPV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Pneumoviridae, which also includes RSV, while AdV is a double-stranded DNA virus. Treatment with an EPAC1-specific inhibitor was also included to investigate the impact of EPAC1 on these two viruses. We found that the replication of HMPV, AdV, and RSV and the viral-induced immune mediators are significantly impaired by MAY0132, while an EPAC1-specific inhibitor, CE3F4, does not impact or slightly impacts, demonstrating that EPAC2 could serve as a novel common therapeutic target to control these viruses, all of which do not have effective treatment and prevention strategies.","['Choi EJ', 'Wu W', 'Cong X', 'Zhang K', 'Luo J', 'Ye S', 'Wang P', 'Suresh A', 'Ullah UM', 'Zhou J', 'Bao X']",2021,13,6,Viruses,"Choi EJ, et al.

34202565,The Antiviral Effect of the Chemical Compounds Targeting DED/EDh Motifs of the Viral Proteins on Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"Arenaviruses and coronaviruses include several human pathogenic viruses, such as Lassa virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Although these viruses belong to different virus families, they possess a common motif, the DED/EDh motif, known as an exonuclease (ExoN) motif. In this study, proof-of-concept studies, in which the DED/EDh motif in these viral proteins, NP for arenaviruses, and nsp14 for coronaviruses, could be a drug target, were performed. Docking simulation studies between two structurally different chemical compounds, ATA and PV6R, and the DED/EDh motifs in these viral proteins indicated that these compounds target DED/EDh motifs. The concentration which exhibited modest cell toxicity was used with these compounds to treat LCMV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in two different cell lines, A549 and Vero 76 cells. Both ATA and PV6R inhibited the post-entry step of LCMV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. These studies strongly suggest that DED/EDh motifs in these viral proteins could be a drug target to combat two distinct viral families, arenaviruses and coronaviruses.","['Ngwe Tun MM', 'Morita K', 'Ishikawa T', 'Urata S']",2021,13,7,Viruses,"Ngwe Tun MM, et al.

34202374,Flavonoids as Promising Antiviral Agents against SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Mechanistic Review.,"A newly diagnosed coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all human activities since its discovery. Flavonoids commonly found in the human diet have attracted a lot of attention due to their remarkable biological activities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the benefits of flavonoids in COVID-19 disease. Previously-reported effects of flavonoids on five RNA viruses with similar clinical manifestations and/or pharmacological treatments, including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola, were considered. Flavonoids act via direct antiviral properties, where they inhibit different stages of the virus infective cycle and indirect effects when they modulate host responses to viral infection and subsequent complications. Flavonoids have shown antiviral activity via inhibition of viral protease, RNA polymerase, and mRNA, virus replication, and infectivity. The compounds were also effective for the regulation of interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and sub-cellular inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor-κB and Jun N-terminal kinases. Baicalin, quercetin and its derivatives, hesperidin, and catechins are the most studied flavonoids in this regard. In conclusion, dietary flavonoids are promising treatment options against COVID-19 infection; however, future investigations are recommended to assess the antiviral properties of these compounds on this disease.","['Khazeei Tabari MA', 'Iranpanah A', 'Bahramsoltani R', 'Rahimi R']",2021,26,13,Molecules,"Khazeei Tabari MA, et al.

By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate, and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location, and disease endotype. We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location. The downregulation of ACE2 (COVID-19, SARS) and ANPEP (HCoV-229E) viral receptors wascorrelated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma. Meanwhile, the increase in DPP4 (MERS-CoV), ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1 (influenza) was associated with increased goblet and basal activated cells. Overall, this study elucidates sex, airway location, disease endotype, and changes in epithelial heterogeneity as potential factors underlying asthmatic susceptibility, or lack thereof, to SARS-CoV-2.","['Coden ME', 'Loffredo LF', 'Abdala-Valencia H', 'Berdnikovs S']",2021,13,6,Viruses,"Coden ME, et al.

While autopsy studies have shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rarely causes direct myocardial injury, several syndromes such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome have been implicated in PACS. Additionally, patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 who display biomarker evidence of myocardial injury may have underlying coronary artery disease revealed by the physiological stress of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may benefit from medical optimization.

34192279,Human Coronavirus Infections and Pregnancy.,"Human coronavirus (HCoV) causes potentially fatal respiratory disease. Pregnancy is a physiological state that predisposes women to viral infection. In this review, we aim to present advances in the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment in HCoV in pregnancy. We retrieved information from the Pubmed database up to June 2020, using various search terms and relevant words, including coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2019 coronavirus disease, and pregnancy. Both basic and clinical studies were selected. We found no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to HCoV infection or that those with HCoV infection are more prone to developing severe pneumonia. There is also no confirmed evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of HcoV infection during maternal HCoV infection. Those diagnosed with infection should be promptly admitted to a negative-pressure isolation ward, preferably in a designated hospital with adequate facilities and multi-disciplinary expertise to manage critically ill obstetric patients. Antiviral treatment has been routinely used to treat pregnant women with HCoV infection. The timing and mode of delivery should be individualized, depending mainly on the clinical status of the patient, gestational age, and fetal condition. Early cord clamping and temporary separation of the newborn for at least 2 weeks is recommended. All medical staff caring for patients with HCoV infection should use personal protective equipment. This review highlights the advances in pathogenesis, maternal-fetal outcome, maternal-fetal transmission, diagnosis and treatment in HCoV including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy.","['Fan S', 'Yan S', 'Liu X', 'Liu P', 'Huang L', 'Wang S']",2021,3,1,Matern Fetal Med,"Fan S, et al.

34191943,Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: 'Learning the hard way' - adapting long-term IAPT service provision using lessons from past outbreaks.,"UNLABELLED: Infectious disease outbreaks have occurred sporadically over the centuries. The most significant ones of this century, as reported by the World Health Organization, include the EVD epidemic, SARS pandemic, Swine Flu pandemic and MERS pandemic. The long-term mental health consequences of outbreaks are as profound as physical ones and can last for years post-outbreak. This highlights the need for enhancing the preparedness of pragmatic mental health service provision. Due to its magnitude, the novel COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be the most impactful. Compared with previous outbreaks, COVID-19 has also occurred at higher rates in frontline staff in addition to patients. As COVID-19 is more contagious than earlier outbreaks, there is a need to identify infected people quickly and isolate them and their contacts. This is the current context in which mental health services including IAPT have had to operate. Evidently, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services are a major mental health service provider in the UK that have demonstrated variability in their response to COVID-19. While some IAPT services quickly adapted their existing strengths and resources (e.g. remote working), other services were less prepared. To date, there are no clear unitary guidelines on how IAPT services can use their pre-existing resources to respond to the long-term effects of outbreaks. In light of this, the current paper aims to reflect on the lessons learned from past outbreaks in order to consider how an enhanced remit of IAPT might integrate with other services to meet the long-term needs of patients and staff affected by COVID-19.
KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1)To understand the development of IAPT within the NHS mental health services.(2)To understand the nature of past outbreaks and COVID-19.(3)To reflect on lessons from past outbreaks in order to understand how IAPT can respond to the long-term effects of COVID-19.","['Skilbeck L', 'Spanton C', 'Roylance I']",2020,13,,Cogn Behav Therap,"Skilbeck L, et al.

34189012,Correlation-Based Analysis of COVID-19 Virus Genome Versus Other Fatal Virus Genomes.,"Virus attacks have had devastating effects on mankind. The prominent viruses such as Ebola virus (2012), SARS-CoV or Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus called as the MERS (EMC/2012), Spanish flu (H1N1 virus-1918) and the most recent COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2) are the ones that have created a difficult situation for the survival of the human race. Currently, throughout the world, a global pandemic situation has put economy, livelihood and human existence in a very pathetic situation. Most of the above-mentioned viruses exhibit some similar characteristics and genetic pattern. Analysing such characteristics and genetic pattern can help the researchers to get a deeper insight into the viruses and helps in finding appropriate medicine or cure. To address these issues, this paper proposes an experimental analysis of the above-mentioned viruses data using correlation methods. The virus data considered for the experimental analysis include the distribution of various amino acids, protein sequences, 3D modelling of viruses, pairwise alignment of proteins that comprise the DNA genome of the viruses. Furthermore, this comparative analysis can be used by the researchers and organizations like WHO(World Health Organization), computational biologists, genetic engineers to frame a layout for studying the DNA sequence distribution, percentage of GC (guanine-cytosine) protein which determines the heat stability of viruses. We have used the Biopython to illustrate the gene study of prominent viruses and have derived results and insights in the form of 3D modelling. The experimental results are more promising with an accuracy rate of 96% in overall virus relationship calculation.","['Purohit S', 'Satapathy SC', 'Sibi Chakkaravarthy S', 'Zhang YD']",2021,,,Arab J Sci Eng,"Purohit S, et al.

34186245,Comparative Host Interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 3 and Human Coronavirus Homologs.,"Human coronaviruses have become an increasing threat to global health; three highly pathogenic strains have emerged since the early 2000s, including most recently SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold-like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) data set for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance, nuclear protein import for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.","['Almasy KM', 'Davies JP', 'Plate L']",2021,20,,Mol Cell Proteomics,"Almasy KM, et al.

Although pregnant women are considered at risk for respiratory infections by other viruses, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), little is known about their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this study aims to identify and present the main studies on the topic, including the postpartum period.
METHODS:  In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with medical subject headings (MeSH), such as: 
RESULTS:  The review of the scientific literature on the subject revealed that pregnant women with COVID-19 did not present clinical manifestations significantly different from those of non-pregnant women; however, there are contraindicated therapies. Regarding fetuses, studies were identified that reported that infection by SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women can cause fetal distress, breathing difficulties and premature birth, but there is no substantial evidence of vertical transmission.
CONCLUSION:  Due to the lack of adequate information and the limitations of the analyzed studies, it is necessary to provide detailed clinical data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on the maternal-fetal repercussions caused by this infection. Thus, this review may contribute to expand the knowledge of professionals working in the area as well as to guide more advanced studies on the risk related to pregnant women and their newborns.

These viruses have induced outbreaks worldwide, and there are currently no effective medications against them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop potential drugs against coronaviruses.
METHODS: High-throughput technology is widely used to explore differences in messenger (m)RNA and micro (mi)RNA expression profiles, especially to investigate protein-protein interactions and search for new therapeutic compounds. We integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in MERS-CoV-infected cells and compared them to mock-infected controls from public databases.
RESULTS: Through the bioinformatics analysis, there were 251 upregulated genes and eight highly differentiated miRNAs that overlapped in the two datasets. External validation verified that these genes had high expression in MERS-CoV-infected cells, including RC3H1, NF-κB, CD69, TNFAIP3, LEAP-2, DUSP10, CREB5, CXCL2, etc. We revealed that immune, olfactory or sensory system-related, and signal-transduction networks were discovered from upregulated mRNAs in MERS-CoV-infected cells. In total, 115 genes were predicted to be related to miRNAs, with the intersection of upregulated mRNAs and miRNA-targeting prediction genes such as TCF4, NR3C1, and POU2F2. Through the Connectivity Map (CMap) platform, we suggested potential compounds to use against MERS-CoV infection, including diethylcarbamazine, harpagoside, bumetanide, enalapril, and valproic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study illustrates the crucial roles of miRNA-mRNA interacting networks in MERS-CoV-infected cells. The genes we identified are potential targets for treating MERS-CoV infection; however, these could possibly be extended to other coronavirus infections.","['Wu YH', 'Yeh IJ', 'Phan NN', 'Yen MC', 'Hung JH', 'Chiao CC', 'Chen CF', 'Sun Z', 'Hsu HP', 'Wang CY', 'Lai MD']",2021,54,5,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Wu YH, et al.

34174535,"Meta-analysis and comprehensive study of coronavirus outbreaks: SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: Zoonotic coronaviruses have caused several endemic and pandemic situations around the world. SARS caused the first epidemic alert at the beginning of this century, followed by MERS. COVID-19 appeared to be highly contagious, with human-to-human transmission by aerosol droplets, and reached nearly all countries around the world. A plethora of studies were performed, with reports being published within a short period of time by scientists and medical physicians. It has been difficult to find the relevant data to create an overview of the situation according to studies from accumulated findings and reports. In the present study we aimed to perform a comprehensive study in the context of the case fatality ratios (CFRs) of three major human Coronavirus outbreaks which occurred during the first twenty years of 21st century.
METHODS: In this study, we performed meta-analyses on SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreak events from publicly available records. Study analyses were performed with the help of highly reputable scientific databases such as PubMed, WOS and Scopus to evaluate and present current knowledge on zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks, starting from 2000 to the end of 2020.
RESULTS: A total of 250,194 research studies and records were identified with specific keywords and synonyms for the three viruses in order to cover all publications. In the end, 41 records were selected and included after applying several exclusion and inclusion criteria on identified datasets. SARS was found to have a nearly 11% case fatality ratio (CFR), which means the estimated number of deaths as a proportion of confirmed positive cases; Taiwan was the country most affected by the SARS outbreak based on the CFR analysis. MERS had CFRs of 35.8 and 26 in Saudi Arabia during the 2012 and 2015 outbreaks, respectively. COVID-19 resulted in a 2.2 CFR globally, and the USA reported the highest mortality ratio in the world in the end of first year of COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Some members of the Coronaviridae family can cause highly contagious and devastating infections among humans. Within the last two decades, the whole world has witnessed several deadly emerging infectious diseases, which are most commonly zoonotic in nature. We conclude that pre-existing immunity during the early stages of a pandemic might be important, but case control and management strategies should be improved to decrease CFRs. Finally, we have addressed several concerns in relation to outbreak events in this study.","['Berber E', 'Sumbria D', 'Çanakoğlu N']",2021,14,8,J Infect Public Health,"Berber E, et al.

34172918,Could certain mouthwashes reduce transmissibility of COVID-19?,"Data sources Six electronic databases were searched including PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, and Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Science (LILACS). Grey literature was also examined. There were no restrictions with regards to language, time of publication or participant demographics including gender, age and ethnicity.Study selection Both clinical and in vitro studies were included in the data search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly identified. Study selection was carried out in two phases by two independent reviewers. The studies included fitted the following criteria: studies that hypothesised the use of mouthwashes as a form of intervention to decrease the viral load in saliva contaminated with coronavirus. Two other studies were included in this review and both were conducted in Germany, performed in vitro, which tested povidone-iodine (PVP-I) mouthwash at two different concentrations: 1% and 7%. Both studies used the same culture mediums for clean and dirty conditions, and the evaluated outcome was the viral titre of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The studies were published in 2015 and 2018. Neither study evaluated the action of this mouthwash on SARS-CoV-2 infection.Data extraction and synthesis The extraction of data followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline process. Studies chosen for analysis included assessment of the following data parameters for risk of bias: cell origin and cell type used, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure, magnetic flux density of exposure, environmental background magnetic field, use of control treatment, temperature control, blinding of exposure, randomisation of exposure, measurement of cell vitality, identical methods for control and exposure groups, randomisation of data measurements and potential industry sponsorship.Results One study assessed the effect of the mouthwash on MERS-CoV and the other on both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In both studies, following 15 seconds of exposure to the mouthwash, a reduction in viral load of >99.99% was seen. There was a measurable reduction in viral titre in the samples, with one study reporting a reduction to 4.30 log10 TCID50/ml from 6.00-6.50 log10 TCID50/ml. Other mouthwashes such as hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine were not assessed in these studies.Conclusions The study concludes that PVP-I mouthwash at concentrations of 1% and 7% for 15 seconds may be effective at reducing the viral load of COVID-19 in human saliva. The level of scientific evidence, however, is low.","['Elmahgoub F', 'Coll Y']",2021,22,2,Evid Based Dent,Elmahgoub F and Coll Y. Could certain mouthwashes reduce transmissibility of COVID-19?.

Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust expression of S protein as antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial-scale production.

34161175,Fast and Accurate Algorithms for Mapping and Aligning Long Reads.,"For DNA sequence analysis, we are facing challenging tasks such as the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, and phasing of alleles. Those challenging tasks suffer from the short length of sequencing reads, where each read may cover less than 2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), or less than two occurrences of a repeated region. It is believed that long reads can help to solve those challenging tasks. In this study, we have designed new algorithms for mapping long reads to reference genomes. We have also designed efficient and effective heuristic algorithms for local alignments of long reads against the corresponding segments of the reference genome. To design the new mapping algorithm, we formulate the problem as the longest common subsequence with distance constraints. The local alignment heuristic algorithm is based on the idea of recursive alignment of k-mers, where the size of k differs in each round. We have implemented all the algorithms in C++ and produce a software package named mapAlign. Experiments on real data sets showed that the newly proposed approach can generate better alignments in terms of both identity and alignment scores for both Nanopore and single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT) data sets. For human individuals of both Nanopore and SMRT data sets, the new method can successfully math/align 91.53% and 85.36% of letters from reads to identical letters on reference genomes, respectively. In comparison, the best known method can only align 88.44% and 79.08% letters of reads for Nanopore and SMRT data sets, respectively. Our method is also faster than the best known method.","['Yang W', 'Wang L']",2021,28,8,J Comput Biol,Yang W and Wang L. Fast and Accurate Algorithms for Mapping and Aligning Long Reads.

Corticosteroids have been the mainstay in treating the cytokine storm caused by the virus. In the past, prolonged viral shedding of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was noted in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids. It is unclear whether this also holds true for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). To our knowledge, this case report highlights the longest reported disease course of SARS-CoV2, lasting approximately 210 days.","['Jariwal R', 'Raza N', 'Valdez M', 'Aboeed A', 'Garcia-Pacheco R']",2021,13,5,Cureus,"Jariwal R, et al.

34157472,Multilevel systems biology analysis of lung transcriptomics data identifies key miRNAs and potential miRNA target genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"BACKGROUND: The spread of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected both the public health and the global economy. The current study was aimed at analysing the genetic sequence of this highly contagious corona virus from an evolutionary perspective, comparing the genetic variation features of different geographic strains, and identifying the key miRNAs as well as their gene targets from the transcriptome data of infected lung tissues.
METHODS: A multilevel robust computational analysis was undertaken for viral genetic sequence alignment, phylogram construction, genome-wide transcriptome data interpretation of virus-infected lung tissues, miRNA mapping, and functional biology networking.
RESULTS: Our findings show both genetic similarities as well as notable differences in the S protein length among SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses. All SARS-CoV-2 strains showed a high genetic similarity with the parent Wuhan strain, but Saudi Arabian, South African, USA, Russia and New Zealand strains carry 3 additional genetic variations like P333L (RNA -dependant RNA polymerase), D614G (spike), and P4715L (ORF1ab). The infected lung tissues demonstrated the upregulation of 282 (56.51%) antiviral defensive response pathway genes and downregulation of 217 (43.48%) genes involved in autophagy and lung repair pathways. By miRNA mapping, 4 key miRNAs (hsa-miR-342-5p, hsa-miR-432-5p, hsa-miR-98-5p and hsa-miR-17-5p), targeting multiple host genes (MYC, IL6, ICAM1 and VEGFA) as well as SARS-CoV2 gene (ORF1ab) were identified.
CONCLUSION: Systems biology methods offer a new perspective in understanding the molecular basis for the faster spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral miRNAs identified in this study may aid in the ongoing search for novel personalized therapeutic avenues for COVID patients.","['Banaganapalli B', 'Al-Rayes N', 'Awan ZA', 'Alsulaimany FA', 'Alamri AS', 'Elango R', 'Malik MZ', 'Shaik NA']",2021,135,,Comput Biol Med,"Banaganapalli B, et al.

34154632,Disk compression of k-mer sets.,"K-mer based methods have become prevalent in many areas of bioinformatics. In applications such as database search, they often work with large multi-terabyte-sized datasets. Storing such large datasets is a detriment to tool developers, tool users, and reproducibility efforts. General purpose compressors like gzip, or those designed for read data, are sub-optimal because they do not take into account the specific redundancy pattern in k-mer sets. In our earlier work (Rahman and Medvedev, RECOMB 2020), we presented an algorithm UST-Compress that uses a spectrum-preserving string set representation to compress a set of k-mers to disk. In this paper, we present two improved methods for disk compression of k-mer sets, called ESS-Compress and ESS-Tip-Compress. They use a more relaxed notion of string set representation to further remove redundancy from the representation of UST-Compress. We explore their behavior both theoretically and on real data. We show that they improve the compression sizes achieved by UST-Compress by up to 27 percent, across a breadth of datasets. We also derive lower bounds on how well this type of compression strategy can hope to do.","['Rahman A', 'Chikhi R', 'Medvedev P']",2021,16,1,Algorithms Mol Biol,"Rahman A, et al.

34152557,Classification of Breast Cancer and Breast Neoplasm Scenarios Based on Machine Learning and Sequence Features from lncRNAs-miRNAs-Diseases Associations.,"The influence of non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) and miRNAs (microRNAs), is undeniable in several diseases, for example, in the formation of neoplasms and cancer scenarios. However, there are challenges due to the scarcity of validated datasets and the imbalance in the data. We found that the research of associations between miRNAs-lncRNAs and diseases is limited or done separately. In addition, those investigations, which use Machine Learning models joined with genomic sequence features extracted from miRNAs and lncRNAs, are few compared with using some methods such as genomic expression or Deep Learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a structure of using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models with genomic sequence features, such as k-mers, sequence alignments, and energy folding values, to validate miRNAs and lncRNAs association with breast cancer and neoplasms scenarios. Using One-Class SVM for outlier detection and comparing two supervised models such as SVM and Random Forest, we manage to obtain accuracy results of 95.44% for the One-class model, with 88.79% and 99.65% for the SVM and Random Forest models, respectively.

We designed eleven peptides with stronger estimated HR1 binding affinities than the wild-type peptide to prevent viral fusion with the cell membrane. Eight peptides showed strong inhibition of spike-mediated MERS-CoV cell-cell fusion with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (0.25-2.3 µM). Peptides #4-6 inhibited 95-98.3% of MERS-CoV plaque formation. Notably, peptide four showed strong inhibition of MERS-CoV plaques formation with EC50 = 0.302 µM. All peptides demonstrated safe profiles without cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 10 μM, and this cellular safety, combined with their anti-MERS-CoV antiviral activity, indicate all peptides can be regarded as potential promising antiviral agents.","['Kandeel M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Park BK', 'Al-Taher A', 'Watanabe A', 'Gohda J', 'Kawaguchi Y', 'Oh-Hashi K', 'Kwon HJ', 'Inoue JI']",2021,12,,Front Pharmacol,"Kandeel M, et al.

34142646,Drawing Parallels Among Past Public Health Crises and COVID-19.,"In the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and health-care personnel across severely affected regions. Along with a lack of testing, these shortages delayed surveillance, and possible containment of the virus. The pandemic also took unprecedented tolls on the mental health of many health-care workers who treated and witnessed the deaths of critically ill patients. To address these effects and prepare for a potential second wave, a literature review was performed on the response of health-care systems during the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, 2009, and the epidemics of Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We can use lessons identified to develop a competent and effective response to the current and future pandemics. The public must continue to engage in proper health mitigation strategies, including use of face coverings, physical distancing, and hand washing. The impact the pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline health-care workers cannot be disregarded as it is essential in ensuring effective patient care and mitigating psychological comorbidities. The lessons identified from past public health crises can help contain and limit morbidity and mortality with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","['Contreras GW', 'Burcescu B', 'Dang T', 'Freeman J', 'Gilbreth N', 'Jacobson J', 'Jayaseelan K', 'Markenson DS']",2021,,,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,"Contreras GW, et al.

To tackle this issue, the application of natural language processing (NLP) to biological sequence analysis has received increased attention. In this method, biological sequences are regarded as sentences while the single nucleic acids/amino acids or k-mers in these sequences represent the words. Embedding is an essential step in NLP, which performs the conversion of these words into vectors. Specifically, representation learning is an approach used for this transformation process, which can be applied to biological sequences. Vectorized biological sequences can then be applied for function and structure estimation, or as input for other probabilistic models. Considering the importance and growing trend for the application of representation learning to biological research, in the present study, we have reviewed the existing knowledge in representation learning for biological sequence analysis.","['Iuchi H', 'Matsutani T', 'Yamada K', 'Iwano N', 'Sumi S', 'Hosoda S', 'Zhao S', 'Fukunaga T', 'Hamada M']",2021,19,,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Iuchi H, et al.

34139599,Diseased lungs may hinder COVID-19 development: A possible reason for the low prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients.,"Presently, it remains unclear why the prevalence of lung diseases, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is much lower than other medical comorbidities and the general population among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, why is COPD not the leading risk factor for contracting COVID-19? The same odd phenomenon was also observed with other pathogenic human coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but not other respiratory viral infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. One commonly proposed reason for the low COPD rates among COVID-19 patients is the usage of inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators that may protect against COVID-19. However, another possible reason not discussed elsewhere is that lungs in a diseased state may not be conducive for the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to establish COVID-19. For one, COPD causes mucous plugging in large and small airways, which may hinder SARS-CoV-2 from reaching deeper parts of the lungs (i.e., alveoli). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may only localize to the upper respiratory tract of persons with COPD, causing mild or asymptomatic infections requiring no hospital attention. Even if SARS-CoV-2 reaches the alveoli, cells therein are probably under a heavy burden of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extensively damaged where it may not support efficient viral replication. As a result, limited SARS-CoV-2 virions would be produced in diseased lungs, preventing the development of COVID-19.",['Yong SJ'],2021,153,,Med Hypotheses,Yong SJ.

METHODS: We traced the antibody responses and neutralizing activity against MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in peripheral blood samples collected from 70 recovered MERS patients for 5 years after the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea. We also measured the half-life of neutralizing antibody titres in the longitudinal specimens.
RESULTS: The seropositivity rate persisted for up to 4 years (50.7-56.1%), especially in MERS patients who suffered from severe pneumonia, and then decreased (35.9%) in the fifth year. Although the spike-specific antibody responses decreased gradually, the neutralizing antibody titres decreased more rapidly (half-life: 20 months) in 19 participants without showing negative seroconversion during the study period. Only five (26.3%) participants had neutralizing antibody titres greater than 1/1000 of PRNT

34136764,COVID-19 and neurological symptoms: is the SARS-CoV-2 virus neurotropic?,"IMPORTANCE: The most notable symptoms of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are fever, cough, dyspnea, and in severe cases, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS.) But neurological symptoms including confusion, stroke, and encephalopathy are reported, and anosmia and hypogeusia are also common indicating that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be neurotropic.
OBSERVATIONS: The SARS-Co-1 and 2 viruses bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is present on human brain endothelium and non-neuronal cells in the nasopharynx and lingual epithelium. However, SARS-CoV-1 and 2 do not bind rodent ACE2 avidly, which has required the generation of humanized ACE2 transgenic animal models of disease. Transgenic mouse models suggest that the SARS- CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV are neurotropic and infect and damage the brain, including the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. The symptoms of anosmia and hypogeusia indicate a portal to the brain. The relationship between encephalitis lethargica and post encephalitis parkinsonism to the Spanish Flu (H1N1 influenza virus) is unclear but raises the question of long term neurological complications of pandemics.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is a concern that there may be long term neurological sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Registries and long term neurological follow up with longitudinal cohort studies of COVID19 positive patients are needed.","['Hess DC', 'Rutkowski E', 'Morgan J', 'McCluskey L']",2020,3,5,Cond Med,"Hess DC, et al.

34134991,Targeting highly pathogenic coronavirus-induced apoptosis reduces viral pathogenesis and disease severity.,"Infection by highly pathogenic coronaviruses results in substantial apoptosis. However, the physiological relevance of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections is unknown. Here, with a combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we demonstrated that protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling mediated the proapoptotic signals in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, which converged in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Inhibiting PERK signaling or intrinsic apoptosis both alleviated MERS pathogenesis in vivo. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV induced apoptosis through distinct mechanisms but inhibition of intrinsic apoptosis similarly limited SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis in vitro and markedly ameliorated the lung damage of SARS-CoV-2-inoculated human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence that virus-induced apoptosis is an important disease determinant of highly pathogenic coronaviruses and demonstrates that this process can be targeted to attenuate disease severity.","['Chu H', 'Shuai H', 'Hou Y', 'Zhang X', 'Wen L', 'Huang X', 'Hu B', 'Yang D', 'Wang Y', 'Yoon C', 'Wong BH', 'Li C', 'Zhao X', 'Poon VK', 'Cai JP', 'Wong KK', 'Yeung ML', 'Zhou J', 'Au-Yeung RK', 'Yuan S', 'Jin DY', 'Kok KH', 'Perlman S', 'Chan JF', 'Yuen KY']",2021,7,25,Sci Adv,"Chu H, et al.

Bats in particular have been recognized as reservoirs to a large variety of viruses with the potential to cross-species transmission. In order to assess the risk of bats in Switzerland for such transmissions, we determined the virome of tissue and fecal samples of 14 native and 4 migrating bat species. In total, sequences belonging to 39 different virus families, 16 of which are known to infect vertebrates, were detected. Contigs of coronaviruses, adenoviruses, hepeviruses, rotaviruses A and H, and parvoviruses with potential zoonotic risk were characterized in more detail. Most interestingly, in a ground stool sample of a Vespertilio murinus colony an almost complete genome of a Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was detected by Next generation sequencing and confirmed by PCR. In conclusion, bats in Switzerland naturally harbour many different viruses. Metagenomic analyses of non-invasive samples like ground stool may support effective surveillance and early detection of viral zoonoses.","['Hardmeier I', 'Aeberhard N', 'Qi W', 'Schoenbaechler K', 'Kraettli H', 'Hatt JM', 'Fraefel C', 'Kubacki J']",2021,16,6,PLoS One,"Hardmeier I, et al.

The virus enters into humans by attachment of its Spike protein (S) to the ACE receptor present on the lung epithelial cell surface followed by cleavage of S protein by the cellular transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). After entry, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is released into the cytosol, where it highjacks host replication machinery for viral replication, assemblage, as well as the release of new viral particles. The major drug targets that have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 through host-virus interaction studies include 3CLpro, PLpro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and S proteins.

34130652,Protective population behavior change in outbreaks of emerging infectious disease.,"BACKGROUND: During outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections, the lack of effective drugs and vaccines increases reliance on non-pharmacologic public health interventions and behavior change to limit human-to-human transmission. Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission.
METHODS: This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks.
RESULTS: We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight intrinsic population-level changes in isolation rates in multiple epidemics of three zoonotic infections with established human-to-human transmission and significant morbidity and mortality. These data are particularly useful for disease modelers seeking to forecast the spread of emerging pathogens.","['Lodge EK', 'Schatz AM', 'Drake JM']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lodge EK, et al.

This graphene chemeo-phononic system was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the limit of detection of ∼3.75 and ∼1 fg/mL in artificial saliva and phosphate-buffered saline, respectively. It also exhibited selectivity over proteins in saliva and MERS-CoV spike protein.

Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TMPRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2. Second, we find that innate immune responses in terms of interferons and interferon simulated genes are strong in relevant cells, for example Calu3 cells, but vary markedly with cell type, virus dose, and virus type.","['Cao Y', 'Xu X', 'Kitanovski S', 'Song L', 'Wang J', 'Hao P', 'Hoffmann D']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Cao Y, et al.

In addition, by actively communicating with smart devices and various biometric sensors, it is expanding its application fields to telemedicine, healthcare, and disease prevention. Even though existing IoT and AI technologies can enhance disease detection, monitoring, and quarantine, their impact is very limited because they are not integrated or applied rapidly to the emergence of a sudden epidemic. Especially in the situation where infectious diseases are rapidly spreading, the conventional methods fail to prevent large-scale infections and block global spreads through prediction, resulting in great loss of lives. Therefore, in this paper, various sources of infection information with local limitations are collected through virus disease information collector, and AI analysis and severity matching are performed through AI broker. Finally, through the Integrated Disease Control Center, risk alerts are issued, proliferation block letters are sent, and post-response services are provided quickly. Suppose we further develop the proposed integrated virus disease control model. In that case, it will be possible to proactively detect and warn of risk factors in response to infectious diseases that are rapidly spreading worldwide and strengthen measures to prevent spreading of infection in no time.","['Sim S', 'Cho M']",2023,27,3,Pers Ubiquitous Comput,Sim S and Cho M.

34121768,Comparative analysis of non structural protein 1 of SARS-CoV2 with SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV: An in silico study.,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV2 caused a major pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Non structural protein 1 (nsp1) is found in all beta coronavirus that cause severe respiratory disease. This protein is considered as a virulence factor and has an important role in pathogenesis. This study aims to elucidate the structural conformations of nsp1 to aid in the prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational landscape of nsp1 homologs of SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV. Principal component analysis escorted by free energy landscape revealed that SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein shows greater flexibility compared to SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV nsp1. Sequence comparison reveals that 28 mutations are present in SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein compared to SARS-CoV1 nsp1. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by an immunoinformatics approach. SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and finger domain of POLA1 via hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions.

34120800,"Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum in children: Etiology, clinical and radiological features, and prognosis.","OBJECTIVES: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs) are secondary lesions associated with entities like infection manifested by restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Our objectives are to evaluate the clinic-radiological spectrum of pediatric patients with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CC).
METHODS: Children (0-18 years) admitted between February 2017 and May 2020 with splenial lesions showing diffusion restriction on MRI, either isolated or within involvement of other parts of the brain, were included retrospectively. The primary lesions of the CC (e.g. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute ischemic infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme) were excluded. CLOCCs were divided into infection-associated, metabolic disorder-associated, and trauma-associated lesions, as well as CLOCCs involving other entities. Data were collected from the medical databases.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were determined to have CLOCCs. Twenty-five (61%) were infection-associated, nine (22%) were trauma-associated, and three (7%) were metabolic disorder-associated cases, including 2 inherited disorders of metabolism. There were four (10%) patients with other entities, three with epilepsy, and one had an apparent life-threatening event. Six patients had a known etiology among the infection-associated group; one had multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19 and one had been infected by COVID-19 without any complications. All the infection-associated patients with isolated splenial lesions recovered totally, although six patients required intensive care hospitalization. Four trauma-associated patients had sequela lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: CLOCCs are associated with a spectrum of diseases, including the new coronavirus, COVID-19 infection. Infection-associated CLOCCs has the best prognosis, although severe cases may occur. Sequelae are possible based on the etiology.","['Aksu Uzunhan T', 'Maraş Genç H', 'Kutlubay B', 'Kalın S', 'Bektaş G', 'Yapıcı Ö', 'Çıracı S', 'Sözen HG', 'Şevketoğlu E', 'Palabıyık F', 'Gör Z', 'Çakar NE', 'Kara B']",2021,43,9,Brain Dev,"Aksu Uzunhan T, et al.

34119838,A CRISPR-based and post-amplification coupled SARS-CoV-2 detection with a portable evanescent wave biosensor.,"The continuing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally and its reliable diagnosis is one of the foremost priorities for protecting public health. Herein a rapid (<1 h), easy-to-implement, and accurate CRISPR-based evanescent wave fluorescence biosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 is reported. The collateral effect of Cas13a is combined with a universal autonomous enzyme-free hybridization chain reaction (HCR) by designing a cleavage hairpin reporter, which is cleaved upon target recognition, and hence releasing the initiator sequence to trigger the downstream HCR circuits. Detection of HCR assemblies is accomplished by first adsorbing to the desthiobiotin-modified optical fiber, followed by fluorescence emission induced by an evanescent field. Three Cas13a crRNAs targeting the genes of S, N and Orf1ab of SARS-CoV-2 are programmed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 or broadly detect related coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The HCR amplification coupled Cas13a-based biosensing platform is capable of rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with attomolar sensitivity. This method is further validated by adding target RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in negative oropharyngeal swabs. The good discrimination capability of this technique demonstrates its promising potential for point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19.","['Yang Y', 'Liu J', 'Zhou X']",2021,190,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Yang Y, et al.

34117594,Adapting the listening time for micro-electrode recordings in deep brain stimulation interventions.,"PURPOSE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common treatment for a variety of neurological disorders which involves the precise placement of electrodes at particular subcortical locations such as the subthalamic nucleus. This placement is often guided by auditory analysis of micro-electrode recordings (MERs) which informs the clinical team as to the anatomic region in which the electrode is currently positioned. Recent automation attempts have lacked flexibility in terms of the amount of signal recorded, not allowing them to collect more signal when higher certainty is needed or less when the anatomy is unambiguous.
METHODS: We have addressed this problem by evaluating a simple algorithm that allows for MER signal collection to terminate once the underlying model has sufficient confidence. We have parameterized this approach and explored its performance using three underlying models composed of one neural network and two Bayesian extensions of said network.
RESULTS: We have shown that one particular configuration, a Bayesian model of the underlying network's certainty, outperforms the others and is relatively insensitive to parameterization. Further investigation shows that this model also allows for signals to be classified earlier without increasing the error rate.
CONCLUSION: We have presented a simple algorithm that records the confidence of an underlying neural network, thus allowing for MER data collection to be terminated early when sufficient confidence is reached. This has the potential to improve the efficiency of DBS electrode implantation by reducing the time required to identify anatomical structures using MERs.","['Martin T', 'Gilmore G', 'Haegelen C', 'Jannin P', 'Baxter JSH']",2021,16,8,Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,"Martin T, et al.

However, the molecular basis of these symptoms remains unclear. SARS-CoV-1 E protein interferes with control of cell polarity and cell-cell junction integrity in human epithelial cells by binding to the PALS1 PDZ domain, a key component of the Crumbs polarity complex. We show that C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins bind the PALS1 PDZ domain with 29.6 and 22.8 μM affinity, whereas the related sequence from MERS-CoV did not bind. We then determined crystal structures of PALS1 PDZ domain bound to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E protein PDZ binding motifs. Our findings establish the structural basis for SARS-CoV-1/2 mediated subversion of Crumbs polarity signalling and serve as a platform for the development of small molecule inhibitors to suppress SARS-CoV-1/2 mediated disruption of polarity signalling in epithelial cells.","['Javorsky A', 'Humbert PO', 'Kvansakul M']",2021,4,1,Commun Biol,"Javorsky A, et al.

34109214,Scrutinizing Coronaviruses Using Publicly Available Bioinformatic Tools: The Viral Structural Proteins as a Case Study.,"Since early 2020, the world suffers from a new beta-coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that has devastating effects globally due to its associated disease, Covid-19. Until today, Covid-19, which not only causes life-threatening lung infections but also impairs various other organs and tissues, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused irreparable damage to many others. Since the very onset of the pandemic, huge efforts were made worldwide to fully understand this virus and numerous studies were, and still are, published. Many of these deal with structural analyses of the viral spike glycoprotein and with vaccine development, antibodies and antiviral molecules or immunomodulators that are assumed to become essential tools in the struggle against the virus. This paper summarizes knowledge on the properties of the four structural proteins (spike protein S, membrane protein M, envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its relatives, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that emerged few years earlier. Moreover, attention is paid to ways to analyze such proteins using freely available bioinformatic tools and, more importantly, to bring these proteins alive by looking at them on a computer/laptop screen with the easy-to-use but highly performant and interactive molecular graphics program DeepView. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate non-bioinformaticians and non-specialists in structural biology to scrutinize these and other macromolecules and as such will contribute to establishing procedures to fight these and maybe other forthcoming viruses.","['Beeckmans S', 'Van Driessche E']",2021,8,,Front Mol Biosci,Beeckmans S and Van Driessche E.

Although it is most common in the Arabian Peninsula, it has been exported to 17 countries outside the Middle East, mostly through air travel. The Risk Assessment Guidelines for Infectious Diseases transmitted on Aircraft (RAGIDA) advise authorities on measures to take when an infected individual travelled by air. The aim of this systematic review was to gather all available information on documented MERS-CoV cases that had travelled by air, to update RAGIDA. The databases used were PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Global Index Medicus; Google was searched for grey literature and hand searching was performed on the EU Early Warning and Response System and the WHO Disease Outbreak News. Forty-seven records were identified, describing 21 cases of MERS that had travelled on 31 flights. Contact tracing was performed for 17 cases. Most countries traced passengers sitting in the same row and the two rows in front and behind the case. Only one country decided to trace all passengers and crew. No cases of in-flight transmission were observed; thus, considering the resources it requires, a conservative approach may be appropriate when contact tracing passengers and crew where a case of MERS has travelled by air.","['Berruga-Fernández T', 'Robesyn E', 'Korhonen T', 'Penttinen P', 'Jansa JM']",2021,149,,Epidemiol Infect,"Berruga-Fernández T, et al.

34106949,Coronavirus surveillance in wildlife from two Congo basin countries detects RNA of multiple species circulating in bats and rodents.,"Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet (Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 alpha- and 6 betacoronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.","['Kumakamba C', 'Niama FR', 'Muyembe F', 'Mombouli JV', 'Kingebeni PM', 'Nina RA', 'Lukusa IN', 'Bounga G', ""N'Kawa F"", 'Nkoua CG', 'Atibu Losoma J', 'Mulembakani P', 'Makuwa M', 'Tamufe U', 'Gillis A', 'LeBreton M', 'Olson SH', 'Cameron K', 'Reed P', 'Ondzie A', 'Tremeau-Bravard A', 'Smith BR', 'Pante J', 'Schneider BS', 'McIver DJ', 'Ayukekbong JA', 'Hoff NA', 'Rimoin AW', 'Laudisoit A', 'Monagin C', 'Goldstein T', 'Joly DO', 'Saylors K', 'Wolfe ND', 'Rubin EM', 'Bagamboula MPassi R', 'Muyembe Tamfum JJ', 'Lange CE']",2021,16,6,PLoS One,"Kumakamba C, et al.

34105037,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Virus-Pathophysiological Axis and the Current Treatment Strategies.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease with its first case reported back in 2012 (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia). It is a novel, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA beta coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness. Later, it was found that this patient was infected with MERS. MERS is endemic to countries in the Middle East regions, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. It has been reported that the MERS virus originated from bats and dromedary camels, the natural hosts of MERS-CoV. The transmission of the virus to humans has been thought to be either direct or indirect. Few camel-to-human transmissions were reported earlier. However, the mode of transmission of how the virus affects humans remains unanswered. Moreover, outbreaks in either family-based or hospital-based settings were observed with high mortality rates, especially in individuals who did not receive proper management or those with underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes and renal failure. Since then, there have been numerous reports hypothesising complications in fatal cases of MERS. Over the years, various diagnostic methods, treatment strategies and preventive measures have been strategised in containing the MERS infection. Evidence from multiple sources implicated that no treatment options and vaccines have been developed in specific, for the direct management of MERS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, there are supportive measures outlined in response to symptom-related management. Health authorities should stress more on infection and prevention control measures, to ensure that MERS remains as a low-level threat to public health.","['Alnuqaydan AM', 'Almutary AG', 'Sukamaran A', 'Yang BTW', 'Lee XT', 'Lim WX', 'Ng YM', 'Ibrahim R', 'Darmarajan T', 'Nanjappan S', 'Chellian J', 'Candasamy M', 'Madheswaran T', 'Sharma A', 'Dureja H', 'Prasher P', 'Verma N', 'Kumar D', 'Palaniveloo K', 'Bisht D', 'Gupta G', 'Madan JR', 'Singh SK', 'Jha NK', 'Dua K', 'Chellappan DK']",2021,22,5,AAPS PharmSciTech,"Alnuqaydan AM, et al.

34099577,Phenotypic and genetic characterization of MERS coronaviruses from Africa to understand their zoonotic potential.,"Coronaviruses are pathogens of pandemic potential. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a zoonotic respiratory disease of global public health concern, and dromedary camels are the only proven source of zoonotic infection. More than 70% of MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries are found in East, North, and West Africa, but zoonotic MERS disease is only reported from the Arabian Peninsula. We compared viral replication competence of clade A and B viruses from the Arabian Peninsula with genetically diverse clade C viruses found in East (Egypt, Kenya, and Ethiopia), North (Morocco), and West (Nigeria and Burkina Faso) Africa. Viruses from Africa had lower replication competence in ex vivo cultures of the human lung and in lungs of experimentally infected human-DPP4 (hDPP4) knockin mice. We used lentivirus pseudotypes expressing MERS-CoV spike from Saudi Arabian clade A prototype strain (EMC) or African clade C1.1 viruses and demonstrated that clade C1.1 spike was associated with reduced virus entry into the respiratory epithelial cell line Calu-3. Isogenic EMC viruses with spike protein from EMC or clade C1.1 generated by reverse genetics showed that the clade C1.1 spike was associated with reduced virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells in vitro, in ex vivo human bronchus, and in lungs of hDPP4 knockin mice in vivo. These findings may explain why zoonotic MERS disease has not been reported from Africa so far, despite exposure to and infection with MERS-CoV.","['Zhou Z', 'Hui KPY', 'So RTY', 'Lv H', 'Perera RAPM', 'Chu DKW', 'Gelaye E', 'Oyas H', 'Njagi O', 'Abayneh T', 'Kuria W', 'Walelign E', 'Wanglia R', 'El Masry I', 'Von Dobschuetz S', 'Kalpravidh W', 'Chevalier V', 'Miguel E', 'Fassi-Fihri O', 'Trarore A', 'Liang W', 'Wang Y', 'Nicholls JM', 'Zhao J', 'Chan MCW', 'Poon LLM', 'Mok CKP', 'Peiris M']",2021,118,25,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Zhou Z, et al.

34099556,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Spike protein variants exhibit geographic differences in virulence.,"Human Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases were detected primarily in the Middle East before a major outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015. The Korean outbreak was initiated by a single infected individual, allowing studies of virus evolution in the absence of further MERS-CoV introduction into human populations. In contrast, MERS is primarily a camel disease on the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa, with clinical disease in humans only in the former location. Previous work identified two mutations in the South Korean MERS-CoV, D510G and I529T on the Spike (S) protein, that led to impaired binding to the receptor. However, whether these mutations affected virulence is unknown. To address this question, we constructed isogenic viruses expressing mutations found in the S protein from Korean isolates and showed that isogenic viruses carrying the Korean MERS-CoV mutations, D510G or I529T, were attenuated in mice, resulting in greater survival, less induction of inflammatory cytokines, and less severe lung injury. In contrast, isogenic viruses expressing S proteins from African isolates were nearly fully virulent; other studies showed that West African camel isolates carry mutations in MERS-CoV accessory proteins, which may limit human transmission. These data indicate that following a single-point introduction of the virus, MERS-CoV S protein evolved rapidly in South Korea to adapt to human populations, with consequences on virulence. In contrast, the mutations in S proteins of African isolates did not change virulence, indicating that S protein variation likely does not play a major role in the lack of camel-to-human transmission in Africa.","['Wong LR', 'Zheng J', 'Sariol A', 'Lowery S', 'Meyerholz DK', 'Gallagher T', 'Perlman S']",2021,118,24,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Wong LR, et al.

34099051,Crucial mutation in the exoribonuclease domain of nsp14 of PEDV leads to high genetic instability during viral replication.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) has exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, responsible for proofreading and contributing to replication fidelity. It has been reported that CoVs exhibit variable sensitivity to nsp14-ExoN deficiency. Betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV were viable upon nsp14-ExoN deficiency. While betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were non-viable with disabled nsp14-ExoN. In this study, we investigated the nsp14-ExoN deficiency of alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in viral pathogenesis using reverse genetics.
RESULTS: Eight nsp14-ExoN deficient mutants, targeting the predicted active sites and the Zinc finger or mental-coordinating sites, of PEDV were designed. Only one mutant E191A with a mutation in the Mg
CONCLUSION: The recombinant PEDV variants carrying mutations at the essential functional sites within nsp14-ExoN were either lethal or genetically unstable. Our finding further confirmed the critical role of nsp14-ExoN in CoV life cycle, suggesting that it may be a target for the design of universal anti-CoV drugs.","['Niu X', 'Kong F', 'Hou YJ', 'Wang Q']",2021,11,1,Cell Biosci,"Niu X, et al.

34096485,COVID-19: Protecting Health-Care Workers in South Korea.,"OBJECTIVES: Health-care workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, and the safety of HCWs is important in situations where a prolonged COVID-19 is expected.
METHODS: HCWs were recently put in great danger around the globe; as of December 21, there were 306 confirmed cases in HCWs in South Korea, representing 0.60% of the total 50,591 confirmed cases nationally.
RESULTS: After experiencing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), South Korea has put a range of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures with long-term perspectives in place, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), HCW's infection status tracing, visitor control, and a variety of supports from both national and local public health authorities.

34093548,Nasopharyngeal Type-I Interferon for Immediately Available Prophylaxis Against Emerging Respiratory Viral Infections.,"In addition to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, emerging viruses that cause respiratory viral infections will continue to arise. Increasing evidence suggests a delayed, possibly suppressed, type 1 interferon (IFN-I) response occurs early during COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections such as SARS and MERS. These observations prompt considering IFN-β as a prophylactic or early intervention for respiratory viral infections. A rationale for developing and testing intranasal interferon beta (IFN-β) as an immediately available intervention for new respiratory viral infections that will arise unexpectedly in the future is presented and supported by basic and clinical trial observations. IFN-β prophylaxis could limit the spread and consequences of an emerging respiratory viral infection in at-risk individuals while specific vaccines are being developed.","['Lee AC', 'Jeong Y', 'Lee S', 'Jang H', 'Zheng A', 'Kwon S', 'Repine JE']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Lee AC, et al.

34091654,The effect of coronaviruses on olfaction: systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia without sinonasal inflammation. Here we systematically review the effects of the 7 known human coronaviruses on olfaction to determine if SARS-CoV-2 distinctly affects the olfactory system.
METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv and DOAJ were searched for studies describing pathophysiological, immunohistochemical, cytological and clinical data.
RESULTS: 49 studies were included. Common cold coronaviruses lead to sinonasal inflammation which can cause transient and chronic loss of smell. MERS-CoV entry receptors were not found in the nasal mucosa and it did not impair olfaction. SARS-CoV-1 had low affinity for its receptor ACE2, limiting olfactory effects. Anosmia is frequent in SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2â€™s entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the nasal respiratory epithelium and olfactory supporting cells. SARS-CoV-2 appeared to target the olfactory cleft while diffuse nasal inflammation was not observed. Damage of the olfactory epithelium was observed in animal models. Alternative receptors such as furin and neuropilin-1 and the similarity of viral proteins to odourant receptors could amplify olfactory impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from other coronaviruses due to preferentially targeting olfactory supporting cells. However, SARS-CoV-2 does not cause sinonasal inflammation in spite of preferred entry factor expression in the nasal respiratory epithelium. This raises doubts about the attention given to ACE2. Alternative receptors, odourant receptor mimicry and other as yet unknown mechanisms may be crucial in the pathogenesis of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate infection mechanisms beyond ACE2.","['Zugaj M', 'van Ditzhuijzen NS', 'Golebski K', 'Fokkens WJ']",2021,59,3,Rhinology,"Zugaj M, et al.

34090332,2-kupl: mapping-free variant detection from DNA-seq data of matched samples.,"BACKGROUND: The detection of genome variants, including point mutations, indels and structural variants, is a fundamental and challenging computational problem. We address here the problem of variant detection between two deep-sequencing (DNA-seq) samples, such as two human samples from an individual patient, or two samples from distinct bacterial strains. The preferred strategy in such a case is to align each sample to a common reference genome, collect all variants and compare these variants between samples. Such mapping-based protocols have several limitations. DNA sequences with large indels, aggregated mutations and structural variants are hard to map to the reference. Furthermore, DNA sequences cannot be mapped reliably to genomic low complexity regions and repeats.
RESULTS: We introduce 2-kupl, a k-mer based, mapping-free protocol to detect variants between two DNA-seq samples. On simulated and actual data, 2-kupl achieves higher accuracy than other mapping-free protocols. Applying 2-kupl to prostate cancer whole exome sequencing data, we identify a number of candidate variants in hard-to-map regions and propose potential novel recurrent variants in this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a mapping-free protocol for variant calling between matched DNA-seq samples. Our protocol is suitable for variant detection in unmappable genome regions or in the absence of a reference genome.","['Wang Y', 'Xue H', 'Pourcel C', 'Du Y', 'Gautheret D']",2021,22,1,BMC Bioinformatics,"Wang Y, et al. 2-kupl: mapping-free variant detection from DNA-seq data of matched samples. 2-kupl: mapping-free variant detection from DNA-seq data of matched samples. 2021; 22:304. doi: 10.1186/s12859-021-04185-6",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34090332/

34086547,Different Methods for Molecular and Rapid Detection of Human Novel Coronavirus.,"INTRODUCTION: While PCR has been recognized as one of the appropriate ways to diagnose infectious diseases, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which is a nucleic acid amplification method, can be considered as an alternative to PCR, and it is faster, cost-effective, and easier to perform than nested PCR.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Keywords were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Keywords included PCR, LAMP, RAA, RPA, Virus and COVID-19.
RESULTS: LAMP technology has been extensively applied for the detection of human pathogenic bacteria, crop pests, pathogenic organisms and components in meat products. A new isotheral method, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), can amplify the DNA as well as RPA. RPA involves benefits of isothermal PCR as well as simplicity and rapid amplification. Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay has been favorably used in the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens and solved the technical difficulties posed by DNA amplification methods because it does not need thermal denaturation of the template and involves a low and constant temperature.
CONCLUSION: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, digital PCR, LAMP, nicking endonuclease amplification reaction, recombinase polymerase amplification, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are different nucleic acid amplification tests of COVID-19. LAMP methods can be more specific than qPCR and immunoassays. The LAMP assay can be applied for rapid detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, because LAMP is a highly sensitive and specific DNA/RNA amplification technique.","['Shahrajabian MH', 'Sun W', 'Cheng Q']",2021,27,25,Curr Pharm Des,"Shahrajabian MH, et al.

34084077,SARS-Cov2 S Protein Features Potential Estrogen Binding Site.,"RESEARCH BACKGROUND: During the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic, as well as earlier SARS and MERS epidemics, it has been observed that COVID19-positive women on average tend to have milder symptoms and lower fatality rates than men. There is a number of differences between the sexes known to contribute to different immune responses and severity of the disease, one being the effect of estrogen 
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To assess whether there is a possibility for estrogen binding on the SARS-CoV2 S protein, we used BLAST and HHpred to compare protein sequences of S protein and human estrogen receptor β, while 3D structures of a potential estrogen binding site and an active site of estrogen receptor β were visualized and compared using PyMOL.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the sequence of SARS-CoV2 S protein with the human estrogen receptor β, we identified a potential estrogen binding site on S protein and further determined that it also shares notable similarities with the active site of ER β when observed in 3D structure of their respective proteins. As a control, SARS-CoV2 S protein was compared with the human androgen receptor, and no such similarities were found. The potential estrogen binding site is part of coronavirus S2 superfamily domain, which is involved in host-virus membrane fusion during infection and appears to be conserved throughout the 
NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This preliminary communication shows that SARS-CoV2 S protein features a potential estrogen binding site. Hopefully, this will prompt a more comprehensive study on the possibilities of estrogen binding on the S protein and the effect this might confer on the virus infectivity.","['Tomasović A', 'Stanzer D', 'Krešimir Svetec I', 'Svetec Miklenić M']",2021,59,1,Food Technol Biotechnol,"Tomasović A, et al.

Compliance with IPC measures has critical implications for HCWs safety, patient protection and the care environment.
AIMS: To discuss the body of available literature regarding HCWs' knowledge of IPC and highlight potential factors that may influence compliance to IPC precautions.
DESIGN: A systematic review. A protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis [PRISMA] statement.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Proquest, Wiley online library, Medline, and Nature) were searched from 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2021 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in combination: knowledge, awareness, healthcare workers, infection, compliance, comply, control, prevention, factors. 3417 papers were identified and 30 papers were included in the review.
RESULTS: Overall, the level of HCW knowledge of IPC appears to be adequate, good, and/or high concerning standard precautions, hand hygiene, and care pertaining to urinary catheters. Acceptable levels of knowledge were also detected in regards to IPC measures for specific diseases including TB, MRSA, MERS-CoV, COVID-19 and Ebola. However, gaps were identified in several HCWs' knowledge concerning occupational vaccinations, the modes of transmission of infectious diseases, and the risk of infection from needle stick and sharps injuries. Several factors for noncompliance surrounding IPC guidelines are discussed, as are recommendations for improving adherence to those guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Embracing a multifaceted approach towards improving IPC-intervention strategies is highly suggested. The goal being to improve compliance among HCWs with IPC measures is necessary.","['Alhumaid S', 'Al Mutair A', 'Al Alawi Z', 'Alsuliman M', 'Ahmed GY', 'Rabaan AA', 'Al-Tawfiq JA', 'Al-Omari A']",2021,10,1,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,"Alhumaid S, et al.

34081747,Serological profiles of pan-coronavirus-specific responses in COVID-19 patients using a multiplexed electro-chemiluminescence-based testing platform.,"Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses are an essential tool for determining the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population especially when testing occurs after symptoms have developed and limited contact tracing is in place. The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","['Chaudhury S', 'Hutter J', 'Bolton JS', 'Hakre S', 'Mose E', 'Wooten A', ""O'Connell W"", 'Hudak J', 'Krebs SJ', 'Darden JM', 'Regules JA', 'Murray CK', 'Modjarrad K', 'Scott P', 'Peel S', 'Bergmann-Leitner ES']",2021,16,6,PLoS One,"Chaudhury S, et al.

34079547,Quantification of Cytokine Storms During Virus Infections.,"Highly pathogenic virus infections usually trigger cytokine storms, which may have adverse effects on vital organs and result in high mortalities. The two cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ play key roles in the generation and regulation of cytokine storms. However, it is still unclear whether the cytokine with the largest induction amplitude is the same under different virus infections. It is unknown which is the most critical and whether there are any mathematical formulas that can fit the changing rules of cytokines. Three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), three influenza viruses (2009H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9), Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and enterovirus 71 were included in this analysis. We retrieved the cytokine fold change (FC), viral load, and clearance rate data from these highly pathogenic virus infections in humans and analyzed the correlations among them. Our analysis showed that interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17 are the most common cytokines with the largest induction amplitudes. Equations were obtained: the maximum induced cytokine (max) FC = IFN-γ FC × (IFN-γ FC/IL-4 FC) (if IFN-γ FC/IL-4 FC > 1); max FC = IL-4 FC (if IFN-γ FC/IL-4 FC < 1). For IFN-γ-inducible infections, 1.30 × log2 (IFN-γ FC) = log10 (viral load) - 2.48 - 2.83 × (clearance rate). The clinical relevance of cytokines and their antagonists is also discussed.","['Yuan S', 'Jiang SC', 'Zhang ZW', 'Fu YF', 'Hu J', 'Li ZL']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Yuan S, et al.

34075377,Identification of evolutionary trajectories shared across human betacoronaviruses.,"Comparing the evolution of distantly related viruses can provide insights into common adaptive processes related to shared ecological niches. Phylogenetic approaches, coupled with other molecular evolution tools, can help identify mutations informative on adaptation, whilst the structural contextualization of these to functional sites of proteins may help gain insight into their biological properties. Two zoonotic betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission have caused pandemics in recent times (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), whilst a third virus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for sporadic outbreaks linked to animal infections. Moreover, two other betacoronaviruses have circulated endemically in humans for decades (HKU1 and OC43). To search for evidence of adaptive convergence between established and emerging betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission (HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), we developed a methodological pipeline to classify shared non-synonymous mutations as putatively denoting homoplasy (repeated mutations that do not share direct common ancestry) or stepwise evolution (sequential mutations leading towards a novel genotype). In parallel, we look for evidence of positive selection, and draw upon protein structure data to identify potential biological implications. We find 30 mutations, with four of these [codon sites 18121 (nsp14/residue 28), 21623 (spike/21), 21635 (spike/25) and 23948 (spike/796); SARS-CoV-2 genome numbering] displaying evolution under positive selection and proximity to functional protein regions.

34075371,"Bidirectional genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and seasonal HCoVs.","Several genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been conducted to identify host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the models used have often relied on overexpression of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism.

34073456,Biomedical Text Link Prediction for Drug Discovery: A Case Study with COVID-19.,"Link prediction in artificial intelligence is used to identify missing links or derive future relationships that can occur in complex networks. A link prediction model was developed using the complex heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph, SemNet, to predict missing links in biomedical literature for drug discovery. A web application visualized knowledge graph embeddings and link prediction results using TransE, CompleX, and RotatE based methods. The link prediction model achieved up to 0.44 hits@10 on the entity prediction tasks. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, served as a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of link prediction modeling for drug discovery. The link prediction algorithm guided identification and ranking of repurposed drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 primarily by text mining biomedical literature from previous coronaviruses, including SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). Repurposed drugs included potential primary SARS-CoV-2 treatment, adjunctive therapies, or therapeutics to treat side effects. The link prediction accuracy for nodes ranked highly for SARS coronavirus was 0.875 as calculated by human in the loop validation on existing COVID-19 specific data sets. Drug classes predicted as highly ranked include anti-inflammatory, nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, antimalarials, envelope proteins, and glycoproteins. Examples of highly ranked predicted links to SARS-CoV-2: human leukocyte interferon, recombinant interferon-gamma, cyclosporine, antiviral therapy, zidovudine, chloroquine, vaccination, methotrexate, artemisinin, alkaloids, glycyrrhizic acid, quinine, flavonoids, amprenavir, suramin, complement system proteins, fluoroquinolones, bone marrow transplantation, albuterol, ciprofloxacin, quinolone antibacterial agents, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. Approximately 40% of identified drugs were not previously connected to SARS, such as edetic acid or biotin. In summary, link prediction can effectively suggest repurposed drugs for emergent diseases.","['McCoy K', 'Gudapati S', 'He L', 'Horlander E', 'Kartchner D', 'Kulkarni S', 'Mehra N', 'Prakash J', 'Thenot H', 'Vanga SV', 'Wagner A', 'White B', 'Mitchell CS']",2021,13,6,Pharmaceutics,"McCoy K, et al.

34070175,Overview of Bat and Wildlife Coronavirus Surveillance in Africa: A Framework for Global Investigations.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating health and socio-economic impacts. Human activities, especially at the wildlife interphase, are at the core of forces driving the emergence of new viral agents. Global surveillance activities have identified bats as the natural hosts of diverse coronaviruses, with other domestic and wildlife animal species possibly acting as intermediate or spillover hosts. The African continent is confronted by several factors that challenge prevention and response to novel disease emergences, such as high species diversity, inadequate health systems, and drastic social and ecosystem changes. We reviewed published animal coronavirus surveillance studies conducted in Africa, specifically summarizing surveillance approaches, species numbers tested, and findings. Far more surveillance has been initiated among bat populations than other wildlife and domestic animals, with nearly 26,000 bat individuals tested. Though coronaviruses have been identified from approximately 7% of the total bats tested, surveillance among other animals identified coronaviruses in less than 1%. In addition to a large undescribed diversity, sequences related to four of the seven human coronaviruses have been reported from African bats. The review highlights research gaps and the disparity in surveillance efforts between different animal groups (particularly potential spillover hosts) and concludes with proposed strategies for improved future biosurveillance.","['Geldenhuys M', 'Mortlock M', 'Epstein JH', 'Pawęska JT', 'Weyer J', 'Markotter W']",2021,13,5,Viruses,"Geldenhuys M, et al.

34069833,Impact of Coronavirus Outbreaks on Science and Society: Insights from Temporal Bibliometry of SARS and COVID-19.,"A global event such as the COVID-19 crisis presents new, often unexpected responses that are fascinating to investigate from both scientific and social standpoints. Despite several documented similarities, the coronavirus pandemic is clearly distinct from the 1918 flu pandemic in terms of our exponentially increased, almost instantaneous ability to access/share information, offering an unprecedented opportunity to visualise rippling effects of global events across space and time. Personal devices provide ""big data"" on people's movement, the environment and economic trends, while access to the unprecedented flurry in scientific publications and media posts provides a measure of the response of the educated world to the crisis. Most bibliometric (co-authorship, co-citation, or bibliographic coupling) analyses ignore the time dimension, but COVID-19 has made it possible to perform a detailed temporal investigation into the pandemic. Here, we report a comprehensive network analysis based on more than 20,000 published documents on viral epidemics, authored by over 75,000 individuals from 140 nations in the past one year of the crisis. Unlike the 1918 flu pandemic, access to published data over the past two decades enabled a comparison of publishing trends between the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and those of the 2003 SARS epidemic to study changes in thematic foci and societal pressures dictating research over the course of a crisis.","['Gupta R', 'Prasad A', 'Babu S', 'Yadav G']",2021,23,5,Entropy (Basel),"Gupta R, et al.

34068656,"Micronutrients Deficiency, Supplementation and Novel Coronavirus Infections-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Micronutrients play roles in strengthening and maintaining immune function, but their supplementation and/or deficiency effects on respiratory tract infections are inconclusive. This review aims to systematically assess the associations between micronutrient supplementation or deficiency, with novel coronavirus incidence and disease severity.
METHODS: Systematic literature searches conducted in five electronic databases identified 751 unique studies, of which 33 studies (five supplementation studies, one supplementation and deficiency study, and 27 deficiency studies) were eventually included in this review. Proportions of incidence and severity outcomes in each group, and adjusted summary statistics with their relevant 95% confidence intervaIs (CI) were extracted. Data from 19 studies were pooled in meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance method.
FINDINGS: A total of 360,346 patients across 16 countries, with a mean age between 32 and 87.7 years, were involved across 33 studies. All studies were on COVID-19 infections. In individuals without micronutrient deficiency, there was a significant reduction on odds of COVID-19 incidence (pooled OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.78), and ICU admissions or severe/critical disease onset when combined as a severity outcome (pooled OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.89). Insignificant protective effects were observed on other outcome measures, namely mortality, ICU admission, progression to respiratory-related complications, severe/critical disease onset or requiring respiratory support and hospitalization rate.
CONCLUSION: The absence of micronutrient deficiency significantly reduced COVID-19 incidence and clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients. Usage of micronutrients as prophylaxis and complementary supplement in therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients may be a promising and cost-effective approach warranting in-depth investigation.","['Wang MX', 'Gwee SXW', 'Pang J']",2021,13,5,Nutrients,"Wang MX, et al.

To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants. By February 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 FRNA had been used to screen over 5000 samples, including acute and convalescent plasma or serum samples and therapeutic antibody treatments, for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers.","['Bennett RS', 'Postnikova EN', 'Liang J', 'Gross R', 'Mazur S', 'Dixit S', 'Kocher G', 'Yu S', 'Georgia-Clark S', 'Gerhardt D', 'Cai Y', 'Marron L', 'Lukin VV', 'Holbrook MR']",2021,13,5,Viruses,"Bennett RS, et al.

34064534,Emergent Drug and Nutrition Interactions in COVID-19: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory tract infections ranging from colds to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. In this review, current information on the possible mechanisms as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of COVID-19 and/or their secondary interactions with nutrition were evaluated and some future directions were given.","['Ağagündüz D', 'Çelik MN', 'Çıtar Dazıroğlu ME', 'Capasso R']",2021,13,5,Nutrients,"Ağagündüz D, et al.

34063231,The Interference between SARS-CoV-2 and Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Signaling in Cancer.,"Cancer and viruses have a long history that has evolved over many decades. Much information about the interplay between viruses and cell proliferation and metabolism has come from the history of clinical cases of patients infected with virus-induced cancer. In addition, information from viruses used to treat some types of cancer is valuable. Now, since the global coronavirus pandemic erupted almost a year ago, the scientific community has invested countless time and resources to slow down the infection rate and diminish the number of casualties produced by this highly infectious pathogen. A large percentage of cancer cases diagnosed are strongly related to dysregulations of the tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) family and its downstream signaling pathways. As such, many therapeutic agents have been developed to strategically target these structures in order to hinder certain mechanisms pertaining to the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells such as division, invasion or metastatic potential. Interestingly, several authors have pointed out that a correlation between coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 or MERS viruses and dysregulations of signaling pathways activated by TKRs can be established. This information may help to accelerate the repurposing of clinically developed anti-TKR cancer drugs in COVID-19 management. Because the need for treatment is critical, drug repurposing may be an advantageous choice in the search for new and efficient therapeutic compounds. This approach would be advantageous from a financial point of view as well, given that the resources used for research and development would no longer be required and can be potentially redirected towards other key projects. This review aims to provide an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different TKRs and their respective downstream signaling pathway and how several therapeutic agents targeted against these receptors can interfere with the viral infection. Additionally, this review aims to identify if SARS-CoV-2 can be repurposed to be a potential viral vector against different cancer types.","['Purcaru OS', 'Artene SA', 'Barcan E', 'Silosi CA', 'Stanciu I', 'Danoiu S', 'Tudorache S', 'Tataranu LG', 'Dricu A']",2021,22,9,Int J Mol Sci,"Purcaru OS, et al.

34061781,Immunopathogenesis and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in a very short span of thirteen months has taken a considerable toll on humanity, resulting in over 3 million deaths with more than 150 million confirmed cases as on May 1, 2021. In the scarcity of a potential antiviral and protective vaccine, COVID-19 has posed high public health concerns, panic, and challenges to limit the spread of this pandemic virus. Only recently have a few vaccine candidates been developed, and vaccination programs have started in some countries. Multiple clinical presentations of COVID-19, animal spillover, cross-species jumping, zoonotic concerns, and emergence of virus variants have altogether created havoc during this ongoing pandemic. Several bodies of research are continuously working to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis. To develop a prospective antiviral therapy/vaccine for SARSCoV-2, it is quite essential to gain insight into the immunobiology and molecular virology of SARS-CoV-2. A thorough literature search was conducted up to 28th February 2021 in the PubMed and other databases for the articles describing the immunopathology and immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were critically evaluated and used to compile this article to present an overall update. Some of the information was drawn from studies on previous MERS and SARS viruses. Innate as well as adaptive immunity responses are elicited by exposure to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 establishes a successful infection by escaping the host immunity as well as over activating the innate immune mechanisms that result in severe disease outcomes, including cytokine storm. This review summarizes the immunopathology and molecular immune mechanisms elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their similarities with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.","['Rabaan AA', 'Al-Ahmed SH', 'Al Mutair A', 'Alhumaid S', 'Sule AA', 'Tirupathi R', 'Fawzy M', 'Muhammad J', 'Khan A', 'Hasan A', 'Shrestha DB', 'Sah R', 'Dhawan M', 'Tiwari R', 'Bilal M', 'Ahmad T', 'Dhama K']",2021,29,2,Infez Med,"Rabaan AA, et al.

34061288,SARS coronavirus outbreaks past and present-a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pneumonic disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the 7th Coronavirus to have successfully infected and caused an outbreak in humans. Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses, including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.","['Low ZY', 'Yip AJW', 'Sharma A', 'Lal SK']",2021,57,4,Virus Genes,"Low ZY, et al.

In this study, we continued our efforts to develop more efficient SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors and achieved significant findings. First, we found that the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike fusion protein plays a critical role in viral infectivity and can serve as an ideal template for design of fusion-inhibitory peptides. Second, a panel of novel lipopeptides was generated with greatly improved activity in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 fusion and infection.

Fourth, the new inhibitors also cross-inhibited other human CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Fifth, the structural properties of the new inhibitors were characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and crystallographic approach, which revealed the mechanisms underlying the high binding and inhibition.

34051754,Hypergraph models of biological networks to identify genes critical to pathogenic viral response.,"BACKGROUND: Representing biological networks as graphs is a powerful approach to reveal underlying patterns, signatures, and critical components from high-throughput biomolecular data. However, graphs do not natively capture the multi-way relationships present among genes and proteins in biological systems. Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs that naturally model multi-way relationships and have shown promise in modeling systems such as protein complexes and metabolic reactions. In this paper we seek to understand how hypergraphs can more faithfully identify, and potentially predict, important genes based on complex relationships inferred from genomic expression data sets.
RESULTS: We compiled a novel data set of transcriptional host response to pathogenic viral infections and formulated relationships between genes as a hypergraph where hyperedges represent significantly perturbed genes, and vertices represent individual biological samples with specific experimental conditions. We find that hypergraph betweenness centrality is a superior method for identification of genes important to viral response when compared with graph centrality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the utility of using hypergraphs to represent complex biological systems and highlight central important responses in common to a variety of highly pathogenic viruses.","['Feng S', 'Heath E', 'Jefferson B', 'Joslyn C', 'Kvinge H', 'Mitchell HD', 'Praggastis B', 'Eisfeld AJ', 'Sims AC', 'Thackray LB', 'Fan S', 'Walters KB', 'Halfmann PJ', 'Westhoff-Smith D', 'Tan Q', 'Menachery VD', 'Sheahan TP', 'Cockrell AS', 'Kocher JF', 'Stratton KG', 'Heller NC', 'Bramer LM', 'Diamond MS', 'Baric RS', 'Waters KM', 'Kawaoka Y', 'McDermott JE', 'Purvine E']",2021,22,1,BMC Bioinformatics,"Feng S, et al.

34051382,Harnessing recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid multi-gene detection of SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited settings.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging diagnostic testing capacity worldwide. The mass testing needed to limit the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests to dramatically widen access at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Isothermal molecular assays have emerged as a promising technology, given the faster turn-around time and minimal equipment compared to gold standard laboratory PCR methods. However, unlike PCR, they do not typically target multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes, risking sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they often require multiple steps thus adding complexity and delays. Here we develop a multiplexed, 1-2 step, fast (20-30 min) SARS-CoV-2 molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification to simultaneously detect two conserved targets - the E and RdRP genes. The agile multi-gene platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or dipstick. The analytical sensitivity of the fluorescence test was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick method was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. High specificity was found against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing in decentralised settings, with minimal or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application. This rapid, simple, ultrasensitive and multiplexed molecular test offers valuable advantages over gold standard tests and in future could be configurated to detect emerging variants of concern.","['Cherkaoui D', 'Huang D', 'Miller BS', 'Turbé V', 'McKendry RA']",2021,189,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Cherkaoui D, et al.

34049903,"Association between vitamin D supplementation or serum vitamin D level and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 including clinical course, morbidity and mortality outcomes? A systematic review.","OBJECTIVE: To systemically review and critically appraise published studies of the association between vitamin D supplementation or serum vitamin D level and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19, including clinical course, morbidity and mortality outcomes.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MedRxiv and BioRxiv preprint databases. COVID-19 databases of the WHO, Cochrane, CEBM Oxford and Bern University up to 10 June 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that assessed vitamin D supplementation and/or low serum vitamin D in patients acutely ill with, or at risk of, severe betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2).
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined data extraction form and assessed risk of bias using the Downs and Black Quality Assessment Checklist.
RESULTS: Searches elicited 449 papers, 59 studies were eligible full-text assessment and 4 met the eligibility criteria of this review. The four studies were narratively synthesised and included (1) a cross-sectional study (n=107) suggesting an inverse association between serum vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2; (2) a retrospective cohort study (348 598 participants, 449 cases) in which univariable analysis showed that vitamin D protects against COVID-19; (3) an ecological country level study demonstrating a negative correlation between vitamin D and COVID-19 case numbers and mortality; and (4) a case-control survey (n=1486) showing cases with confirmed/probable COVID-19 reported lower vitamin D supplementation. All studies were at high/unclear risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: There is no robust evidence of a negative association between vitamin D and COVID-19. No relevant randomised controlled trials were identified and there is no robust peer-reviewed published evidence of association between vitamin D levels and severity of symptoms or mortality due to COVID-19. Guideline producers should acknowledge that benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 are as yet unproven despite increasing interest.","['Grove A', 'Osokogu O', 'Al-Khudairy L', 'Mehrabian A', 'Zanganeh M', 'Brown A', 'Court R', 'Taylor-Phillips S', 'Uthman OA', 'McCarthy N', 'Kumar S', 'Clarke A']",2021,11,5,BMJ Open,"Grove A, et al.

34047261,A Short Review on Key Role of Plants and their Extracts in Boosting up Immune Response to Combat COVID-19.,"In the wake of the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, there has been increasing concern among the general public to improve their immune system. The causative agent of COVID-19 is SARS CoV-2, similar to its relative viruses SARS Cov-1 and MERS. Although vaccines have been developed now and are in public use, still the role of a healthy immune system is crucial as new strains of the virus are being discovered and along with emergence of new strains, short and long term side effects of vaccine cannot be excluded. Plants have been used in herbal medicines and many chemicals since ancient times and extracts in them are found to boost the immune system. Therefore, a consciously maintained diet consisting of plant-based immunity boosters is the need of the hour. Plants are known to provide many chemicals, natural therapeutics and vitamins which naturally enhance our immune system. Recently, vaccination research is also being carried out in transgenic plants. In this review, main focus has been put on highlighting some of the key players within the Kingdom Plantae, which, when taken up in regular diet, can significantly boost our immune system capacity and thus helps the human body to combat this deadly virus more efficiently.","['Khan M', 'Saddique MAB', 'Tahir H', 'Amjad MD', 'Ahmad A', 'Masood U', 'Khan D']",2022,22,1,Infect Disord Drug Targets,"Khan M, et al.

AIM: To evaluate the knowledge, awareness, perception, and response of the general public to COVID-19 in China.
METHODS: A detailed questionnaire comprising 47 questions designed in both English and Chinese was developed. The survey was conducted 
RESULTS: Overall, this comprehensive survey revealed that the general public in China is highly aware of the basic information concerning COVID-19 and its precautions. Interestingly, more respondents (99.3%) were aware of the term severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) than COVID-19 (97.2%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (73.4%). Among them, 2.4%, 1.6%, and 0.9% said that they or their family members or friends were affected by COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, respectively. The majority of the respondents (91.2%) indicated that knowledge about COVID-19 was received mainly from WeChat, followed by TV (89%), friends (76.1%), and QQ (a Chinese instant messaging software service) (57.7%).
CONCLUSION: The general public in China is highly aware of COVID-19 and the necessary precautions. Unexpectedly, 2.8% of the participants were unaware of the current epidemic. The remaining information gaps highlight the necessity of further enhancing awareness and preparedness.","['Ma ZR', 'Idris S', 'Pan QW', 'Baloch Z']",2021,11,5,World J Psychiatry,"Ma ZR, et al.

34045884,In vivo and in vitro Evaluation of Cytokine Expression Profiles During Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is associated with a high mortality rate.
AIM: To determine the effect of MERS-CoV on the immune response in infected patients and investigate cytokine production in the A549 epithelial cell line in response to a recombinant MERS-CoV spike protein (rSP) in the presence or absence of anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) antibody (3 independent experiments). Cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine ELISA array.
METHODS: A Bio-Plex multiplex assay and cytokine ELISA were used in our study to measure the cytokine levels.
RESULTS: Comparative analysis of MERS-CoV-infected patients (4 samples) and noninfected healthy controls (HCs) (5 samples) showed that serum levels of the following cytokines and chemokines were significantly higher in MERS-CoV patients than in the HCs (*p < 0.05): interferon (IFN)-α2 (43.4 vs 5.4), IFN-β (17.7 vs 6.2), IFN-γ (43.4 vs 9.7), interleukin (IL)-8 (13.7 vs 0), IL-2 (11.2 vs 3), IL-27p28 (57.8 vs 13.8), and IL-35 (167.5 vs 87.5).
DISCUSSION: Our results revealed that MERS-CoV infection induced a slight increase in IFN levels but triggered a more pronounced increase in expression of the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL-35. A recombinant version of the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein increased the expression of IL-8 (160 pg/mL), IL-2 (100 pg/mL) and IL-12 (65 pg/mL) in A549 lung epithelial cells compared to that in the unstimulated control cells. The presence of anti-DPP4 antibody did not affect cytokine suppression or induction in A549 cells in vitro but decreased the level of IL-8 from 160 pg/mL to 65 pg/mL.
CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV can decrease IFN levels to interfere with the IFN pathway and enhance the production of regulatory cytokines. Inhibition of the increases in IL-27 and IL-35 may contribute to halting MERS-CoV in the early stage of infection.","['Mubarak A', 'Alrfaei B', 'Aljurayyan A', 'Alqafil MM', 'Farrag MA', 'Hamed ME', 'Alosaimi B', 'Almajhdi F', 'Alturaiki W']",2021,14,,J Inflamm Res,"Mubarak A, et al.

34044007,Application of a novel mathematical model to identify intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.,"Intermediate host species provide a crucial link in the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, serving as a population where an emerging pathogen can mutate to become human-transmissible. Identifying such species is thus a key component of predicting and possibly mitigating future epidemics. Despite this importance, intermediate host species have not been investigated in much detail, and have generally only been identified by testing for the presence of pathogens in multiple candidate species. In this paper, we present a mathematical model able to identify likely intermediate host species for emerging zoonoses based on ecological data for the candidates and epidemiological data for the pathogen. Since coronaviruses frequently emerge through intermediate host species and, at the time of writing, pose an urgent pandemic threat, we apply the model to the three emerging coronaviruses of the twenty-first century, accurately predicting palm civets as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-1 and dromedary camels as intermediate hosts for MERS. Further, we suggest mink, pangolins, and ferrets as intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2. With the capacity to evaluate intermediate host likelihood among different species, researchers can focus testing for possible infection sources and interventions more effectively.",['Royce K'],2021,526,,J Theor Biol,Royce K.

34042415,Phageome-based vaccination and human innate immune modulation could be a useful strategy to control human Coronavirus infections.,"Human Coronavirus (CoV) infections, including SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-CoV-2, usually cause fatal lower and upper respiratory tract infections due to exacerbated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We aim to summarize different aspects, such as CoV immune evasion mechanisms and host innate immune response to these infections, and their role in pathogenesis. We have also elaborated the up-to-date findings on different vaccine development strategies and progress against CoVs in both humans and non-human models. Most importantly, we have described the Phageome-human immune interaction, its therapeutic usage as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory agent, and implications for multiple vaccine development systems. The data suggest that endogenous phages might play a vital role in eliminating the infection and regulating the body's immune system. Considering the innate-immune-induced pathogenesis against CoVs and the therapeutic aptitude of phageome, we propose that the prophylactic administration of phages and phage-based vaccines could be a useful strategy to control the emerging CoV infections.","['Abaidullah M', 'Peng S', 'Kamran M', 'Song X', 'Ali Sher A', 'Chen Y', 'Rehman A', 'Lin L', 'Jia R', 'Yin Z']",2021,35,3,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Abaidullah M, et al.

Reliable and rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are crucial to control and manage the outbreak. Here, a label-free square wave voltammetry-based biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples is reported. The sensor was constructed on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04 V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL","['Eissa S', 'Alhadrami HA', 'Al-Mozaini M', 'Hassan AM', 'Zourob M']",2021,188,6,Mikrochim Acta,"Eissa S, et al.

The severity of the global health burden, increasing mortality rate and the emergent economic crisis urgently demands the development of next generation vaccines. Amongst such emergent next generation vaccines are the multi-epitope subunit vaccines, which hold promise in combating deadly pathogens. In this study we have exploited immunoinformatics applications to delineate a vaccine candidate possessing multiple B and T cells epitopes by utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 non structural and structural proteins. The antigenicity potential, safety, structural stability and the production feasibility of the designed construct was evaluated computationally. Furthermore, due to the known role of human TLR-3 immune receptor in viral sensing, which facilitates host cells activation for an immune response, the vaccine construct was examined for its binding efficiency using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, which resulted in strong and stable interactions. Finally, the immune simulation studies suggested an effective immune response on vaccine administration.

How the virus evades host defense for efficient replication is not fully understood. In this report, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) impaired stress granule (SG) formation induced by viral RNA. SARS-CoV-2 NP associated with the protein kinase PKR after dsRNA stimulation. SARS-CoV-2 NP did not affect dsRNA-induced PKR oligomerization, but impaired dsRNA-induced PKR phosphorylation (a hallmark of its activation) as well as SG formation. SARS-CoV-2 NP also targeted the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 and impaired G3BP1-mediated SG formation. Deficiency of PKR or G3BP1 impaired dsRNA-triggered SG formation and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NP of SARS-CoV also targeted both PKR and G3BP1 to impair dsRNA-induced SG formation, whereas the NP of MERS-CoV targeted PKR, but not G3BP1 for the impairment. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 NP promotes viral replication by impairing formation of antiviral SGs, and reveal a conserved mechanism on evasion of host antiviral responses by highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses.","['Zheng ZQ', 'Wang SY', 'Xu ZS', 'Fu YZ', 'Wang YY']",2021,7,1,Cell Discov,"Zheng ZQ, et al.

Current research efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to propose drug-based therapeutic options. Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and from COVID-19 patient-derived samples. Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA, and TRIM25 as top candidates, and more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during viral infection that has therapeutic potential.

34029377,Vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19: a living systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID-19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7,  whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future.

The objective of the study was to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcome of MERS-CoV in Qatar. A total of 28 cases of MERS-CoV were identified, corresponding to an incidence of 1.7 per 1,000,000 population. Most patients had a history of contact with camels 15, travel to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 7 or known contact with individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection 7. Majority of patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) 17 and 9 needed renal replacement therapy. All patients were hospitalized, 14 required critical care support. Overall, total of 10 died. The immediate cause of death was multiorgan failure with acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) 9. MERS-CoV is a rare infection in the State of Qatar. There was no hospital outbreaks or healthcare worker reported infection. The infection causes severe respiratory failure and acute renal failure. Patients with AKI and on ventilator support carry higher risk of mortality.","['Ben Abid F', 'El-Maki N', 'Alsoub H', 'Al Masalmani M', 'Al-Khal A', 'Valentine Coyle P', 'Ben Hadj Kacem MA', 'AlGazwani H', 'Al-Thani M', 'Eid Al-Romaihi H', 'Al-Hajri M', 'Elmoubashar F']",2021,24,,IDCases,"Ben Abid F, et al.

34025433,Curcumin as a Potential Treatment for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that rapidly spread throughout the world leading to high mortality rates. Despite the knowledge of previous diseases caused by viruses of the same family, such as MERS and SARS-CoV, management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 is a challenge. One of the best strategies around the world to help combat the COVID-19 has been directed to drug repositioning; however, these drugs are not specific to this new virus. Additionally, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, and the way of SARS-CoV-2 modulates the different systems in the host remains unidentified, despite recent discoveries. This complex and multifactorial response requires a comprehensive therapeutic approach, enabling the integration and refinement of therapeutic responses of a given single compound that has several action potentials. In this context, natural compounds, such as Curcumin, have shown beneficial effects on the progression of inflammatory diseases due to its numerous action mechanisms: antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and cytoprotective. These and many other effects of curcumin make it a promising target in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. Hence, the purpose of this review is to specifically point out how curcumin could interfere at different times/points during the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, providing a substantial contribution of curcumin as a new adjuvant therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.","['Rattis BAC', 'Ramos SG', 'Celes MRN']",2021,12,,Front Pharmacol,"Rattis BAC, et al.

This virus poses a great threat to human society and has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population. This is following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the 21st-century. While China has achieved initial success in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and treating those infected with SARS-CoV-2, up to 14% of COVID-19 convalescents can still be detected with virus nucleic acid. Thus, there is an urgent need for more information to understand this new virus. Here we report the detailed clinical characteristics of three cases of COVID-19 convalescents that had repeated positive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test results for over three months. This may arouse concerns regarding the present quarantine protocol after convalescence and provide a reference for governments to consider when to reopen the community.","['Wang Z', 'Feng Z', 'Tang S', 'Zeng J', 'Ning H', 'Huang C', 'Zhang L']",2021,361,5,Am J Med Sci,"Wang Z, et al.

Historically, treatments for chronic viral infections with single drugs have not been successful, as exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Combination therapy for these diseases has led to improved clinical outcomes with dramatic reductions in viral load, morbidity, and mortality. Drug combinations can enhance therapeutic efficacy through additive, and ideally synergistic, effects for emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2). Although novel drug development through traditional pipelines remains a priority, in the interim, effective synergistic drug candidates could be rapidly identified by drug-repurposing screens, facilitating accelerated paths to clinical testing and potential emergency use authorizations.","['Shyr ZA', 'Cheng YS', 'Lo DC', 'Zheng W']",2021,26,10,Drug Discov Today,"Shyr ZA, et al.

The definite pathogenesis and immunological influences of SARS-CoV-2 have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we constructed a brief summary comparison of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections regarding their immunological changes. In addition, we further investigated the immunological differences between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 cases, and we searched for possible immunological predictors of the patient outcome by reviewing case series studies to date. Possible immunological predictors of a poor outcome are leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia (both CD4 and CD8 T cells), an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ), regulatory T cell cytokines (IL-10) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17). A more precise immunological map needs to be established, which may assist in diagnosing this disease and facilitate immunological precision medicine treatment.","['Li CH', 'Chiou HC', 'Lin MH', 'Kuo CH', 'Lin YC', 'Lin YC', 'Hung CH', 'Kuo CH']",2021,54,4,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Li CH, et al.

It is the main enzyme involved in generating various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication and is one of the most important proteins responsible for SARS-CoV-2 virulence. In this study, we have conducted an ensemble docking of molecules from the DrugBank database using both the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, as well as five conformations obtained after performing a cluster analysis of a 300 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This procedure elucidated the inappropriateness of the active site for non-covalent inhibitors, but it has also shown that there exists an additional, more favorable, allosteric binding site, which could be a better target for non-covalent inhibitors, as it could prevent dimerization and activation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Two such examples are radotinib and nilotinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors already in use for treatment of leukemia and which binding to the newly found allosteric binding site was also confirmed using MD simulations.

Locating 5-methylcytosine (5mC) sites in promoters is therefore a crucial step in further understanding of the relationship between promoter methylation and the regulation of mRNA gene expression. High throughput identification of DNA 5mC in wet lab is still time-consuming and labor-extensive. Thus, finding the 5mC site of genome-wide DNA promoters is still an important task. We compared the effectiveness of the most popular and strong machine learning techniques namely XGBoost, Random Forest, Deep Forest, and Deep Feedforward Neural Network in predicting the 5mC sites of genome-wide DNA promoters. A feature extraction method based on k-mers embeddings learned from a language model were also applied. Overall, the performance of all the surveyed models surpassed deep learning models of the latest studies on the same dataset employing other encoding scheme. Furthermore, the best model achieved AUC scores of 0.962 on both cross-validation and independent test data. We concluded that our approach was efficient for identifying 5mC sites of promoters with high performance.","['Nguyen TT', 'Tran TA', 'Le NQ', 'Pham DM', 'Ou YY']",2022,19,1,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,"Nguyen TT, et al.

34013969,Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are being investigated as potential therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of these interventions is required.  OBJECTIVES: Using a living systematic review approach, to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence.
SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform, and trial registries. Searches were done on 17 March 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. For safety assessments, we also included non-controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if 500 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease), quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (12 RCTs, 1 NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880 received convalescent plasma. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33 studies reporting as being completed or terminated. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and one NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participants with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placebo or standard care alone.  Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable; 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93; 2 RCTs, 630 participants; low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants; high-certainty evidence). We did not identify any subgroup differences.  We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCT assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and one NRSI, to assess the safety of convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety data only for the convalescent plasma group.  We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reduces the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; 4 RCTs, 905 participants; low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; 2 RCTs, 414 participants; low-certainty evidence).  A summary of reported events of the NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000 of 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety data only for transfused participants (6125 participants) are included in the full text. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCT reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline).  Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence).  We identified no study reporting quality of life.  Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on measures of clinical improvement. We are uncertain about the adverse effects of convalescent plasma. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes is still problematic. There are 100 ongoing studies and 33 studies reporting in a study registry as being completed or terminated. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around hyperimmune immunoglobulin therapy for people with any disease severity, and convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","['Piechotta V', 'Iannizzi C', 'Chai KL', 'Valk SJ', 'Kimber C', 'Dorando E', 'Monsef I', 'Wood EM', 'Lamikanra AA', 'Roberts DJ', 'McQuilten Z', 'So-Osman C', 'Estcourt LJ', 'Skoetz N']",2021,5,5,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Piechotta V, et al.

34011150,Development and Application of Human Coronavirus Protein Microarray for Specificity Analysis.,"Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus that causes mild to severe respiratory diseases in humans, including HKU1-CoV, 229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to identify the patients and investigate their immune responses. Protein microarray is one of the best platforms to profile the antibodies in the blood because of its fast, multiplexed, and sensitive nature. To fully understand the immune responses and biological specificities, this study developed a human coronavirus (HCoV) protein microarray and included all seven human coronaviruses and three influenza viruses. Each protein was printed in triplicate and formed 14 identical blocks per array. The HCoV protein microarray showed high reproducibility and sensitivity to the monoclonal antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid protein with detection limits of 10-200 pg. The HCoV proteins that were immobilized on the array were properly folded and functional by showing interactions with a known human receptor, e.g., ACE2. By profiling the serum IgG and IgA from 32 COVID-19 patients and 36 healthy patients, the HCoV protein microarray demonstrated 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity with two biomarkers. The results also showed the cross-reactivity of IgG and IgA in COVID-19 patients to spike proteins from various coronaviruses, including that from SARS-CoV, HKU1-CoV, and OC43-CoV. Finally, an innate immune protein named surfactant protein D showed broad affinities to spike proteins in all human coronaviruses. Overall, the HCoV protein microarray is multiplexed, sensitive, and specific, which is useful in diagnosis, immune assessment, biological development, and drug screening.","['Du PX', 'Chou YY', 'Santos HM', 'Keskin BB', 'Hsieh MH', 'Ho TS', 'Wang JY', 'Lin YL', 'Syu GD']",2021,93,21,Anal Chem,"Du PX, et al.

However, data on CNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 are still evolving. We performed a literature review of CNS inflammatory disorders associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords; ""SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication"" looking for reports of transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, myelitis, Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Disorder (MOGAD), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalitis/Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHNE/AHLE), Cytotoxic lesion of the Corpus Callosum/Mild Encephalopathy Reversible Splenium Lesion(CLOCC/MERS) and Optic neuritis published between December 01, 2019 and March 15, 2021.
RESULTS: Our literature search revealed 43 patients meeting the diagnosis of myelitis, including Transverse Myelitis, ADEM, AHNE/AHLE or CLOCC/MERS and Optic neuritis. Acute myelitis was most commonly associated with non-severe COVID-19 and all reported cases of AHNE/AHLE had severe COVID-19 infection. Based on IDSA/ATS criteria of either requiring vasopressor for septic shock or mechanical ventilation, 49% (n = 18) patients were considered to have a severe COVID infection. There were 7 (n = 19%) fatalities.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes the clinical features, neuroimaging, CSF findings and outcomes in COVID-19-associated CNS inflammatory disorders. Our observational review study reveals that although rare, myelitis, ADEM, AHNE and CLOCC can be associated with COVID-19 infection.

34008220,Structures of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution with dynamics: Impacts of parallel tempering simulation techniques and CHARMM36m and AMBER99SB force field parameters.,"A novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide appeared in 2019. Detailed scientific knowledge of the members of the Coronaviridae family, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is currently lacking. Structural studies of the MERS-CoV proteins in the current literature are extremely limited. We present here detailed characterization of the structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. Additionally, we studied the impacts of chosen force field parameters and parallel tempering simulation techniques on the predicted structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. For this purpose, we conducted extensive Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and Temperature-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using the CHARMM36m and AMBER99SB parameters for the macro domain. This study shows that the predicted secondary structure properties including their propensities depend on the chosen simulation technique and force field parameter. We perform structural clustering based on the radius of gyration and end-to-end distance of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. We also report and analyze the residue-level intrinsic disorder features, flexibility and secondary structure. Furthermore, we study the propensities of this macro domain for protein-protein interactions and for the RNA and DNA binding. Overall, results are in agreement with available nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings and present more detailed insights into the structural properties of MERS CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. All in all, we present the structural properties of the aqueous MERS-CoV macro domain using different parallel tempering simulation techniques, force field parameters and bioinformatics tools.","['Akbayrak IY', 'Caglayan SI', 'Durdagi S', 'Kurgan L', 'Uversky VN', 'Ulver B', 'Dervisoğlu H', 'Haklidir M', 'Hasekioglu O', 'Coskuner-Weber O']",2021,89,10,Proteins,"Akbayrak IY, et al.

34006825,Type-I interferon signatures in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-β production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce the susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment. Investigation of different interferon-stimulated genes and their role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may direct novel antiviral strategies.","['Chen X', 'Saccon E', 'Appelberg KS', 'Mikaeloff F', 'Rodriguez JE', 'Vinhas BS', 'Frisan T', 'Végvári Á', 'Mirazimi A', 'Neogi U', 'Gupta S']",2021,7,1,Cell Death Discov,"Chen X, et al.

34006330,COVID-19: breaking down a global health crisis.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the second pandemic of the twenty-first century, with over one-hundred million infections and over two million deaths to date. It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage.

Currently, there are no effective therapies available for corona virus infections. Since the three viruses belong to the same family and share many common features, we can theoretically design a drug that can be effective on all the three of them. In this study, using computational approach, we designed a peptide (Peptide 7) that can bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV thereby preventing the entry of the viruses into the host cell. The peptide inhibitor was designed as a consensus peptide from three different peptides that might individually bind to the RBD of the three viruses. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations using Peptide 7 has shown that it binds with higher affinity than the native receptors of the RBD and forms a stable complex thereby preventing further viral-receptor interaction and inhibiting their cellular entry. This effective binding is observed for the three RBDs, despite the Peptide 7 interactions being slightly different. Hence; this peptide inhibitor can be used as a potential candidate for the development of peptide based anti-viral therapy against Corona viruses.","['V K P', 'Rath SP', 'Abraham P']",2021,16,5,PLoS One,"V K P, et al.

33994107,Preparedness and activities of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma bank in the Veneto region (Italy): An organizational model for future emergencies.,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used in the past in various pandemics, in particular in H1N1, SARS and MERS infections. In Spring 2020, when ongoing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, the Veneto Region (V-R) has proposed setting-up an anti-SARS-CoV-2 CP (CCP) Bank, with the aim of preparing a supply of CCP immediately available in case of subsequest epidemic waves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Key-points to be developed for a quick set-up of the V-R CCP Bank have been recruitment of donors recovered from COVID-19 infection, laboratory analysis for the biological qualification of the CCP units, including titre of neutralizing antibodies and reduction of pathogens, according to National Blood Centre (CNS) Directives, adaptation of the V-R Information Technology systems and cost analysis. Some activities, including diagnostic and viral inactivation processes, have been centralized in 2 or 3 sites. Laboratory analysis upon preliminary admission of the donor included all tests required by the Italian laws and the CNS directives.
RESULTS: From April to August 2020, 3,298 people have contacted the V-R Blood Transfusion Services: of these, 1,632 have been evaluated and examined as first time donors and those found to be suitable have carried out 955 donations, from which 2,626 therapeutic fractions have been obtained, at a cost around 215,00 Euro. Since October 2020, the number of COVID-19 inpatients has had a surge with a heavy hospital overload. Moreover, the high request of CCP therapy by clinicians has been just as unexpected, showing a wide therapeutic use.
CONCLUSIONS: The organizational model here presented, which has allowed the rapid collection of a large amount of CCP, could be useful when facing new pandemic outbreaks, especially in low and middle income countries, with generally acceptable costs.","['De Silvestro G', 'Gandini G', 'Fiorin F', 'Marson P', 'Barbone E', 'Frigato A', 'Gessoni G', 'Veronesi A', 'Pacenti M', 'Castelli M', 'Rinaldi M', 'Rizzi M', 'Stefani F', 'Roveroni G']",2021,60,4,Transfus Apher Sci,"De Silvestro G, et al.

33992044,Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS) - Potential role for cytokines such Is IL-6.,"COVID-19 is a transmissible respiratory disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS or MERS. Its increased severity was noted in aged patients usually over 65 years of age. Children and young people have an asymptomatic or mild course of the disease.Unfortunately, the number of children with problems after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 recovery is increasing and their troubles resemble Kawasaki disease, although the laboratory findings seem to be different. This condition is called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), and it is a new disease seen in children directly influenced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The literature reports that PIMS typically follows 2-4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical symptoms of the affected children are extremely complex, ranging from gastrointestinal to cardiovascular problems with frequent skin and mucosal manifestations, and without intensive treatment they can be fatal. The exact causes of PIMS are recently unknown, however, it is explained as hyperactivation of immunity.In this minireview, we summarize data on the prominent role of the IL-6-IL-6R-STAT3 axis in PIMS aetiopathogenesis. Therapeutic manipulation of IL-6 or IL-6 receptor could be an approach to the treatment of children with severe PIMS.","['Lacina L', 'Brábek J', 'Fingerhutová Š', 'Zeman J', 'Smetana K']",2021,70,2,Physiol Res,"Lacina L, et al.

33983506,Neuropathies and neurological dysfunction induced by coronaviruses.,"During the recent years, viral epidemic due to coronaviruses, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 (coronavirus disese-19), has become a global problem. In addition to causing cardiovascular and respiratory lethal dysfunction, these viruses can cause neurodegeneration leading to neurological disorders. Review of the current scientific literature reveals the multiple neuropathies and neuronal dysfunction associated with these viruses. Here, we review the major findings of these studies and discuss the main neurological sequels and outcomes of coronavirus infections with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. This article analyzes and discusses the main mechanisms of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration according to the current experimental and clinical studies. Coronaviruses can damage the nerves directly through endovascular dysfunctions thereby affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections. Coronaviruses can also induce neural cell degeneration indirectly via mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Thus, coronaviruses can cause neurological disorders by inducing neurovascular dysfunction affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections, and by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While some of these mechanisms are similar to other RNA viruses, the neurotoxic mechanisms of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS-CoV viruses are unknown and need detailed clinical and experimental studies.","['Gholami M', 'Safari S', 'Ulloa L', 'Motaghinejad M']",2021,27,3,J Neurovirol,"Gholami M, et al.

33982105,The Role of Nutrition in COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity of Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease, and survival.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19.
METHODS: We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020.
RESULTS: Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.

33977892,Psychological Responses Among Korean Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Survivors and Bereaved Families.,"OBJECTIVE: In 2015, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea affected 186 patients and led to 38 bereaved families. This study aimed at investigating the nature and related factors of the psychological responses of MERS victims during the acute phase of disaster.
METHODS: The MERS Psychological Support Team under the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare provided counseling services to MERS survivors and bereaved families for 4 weeks, based on crisis intervention. In this study, we reviewed the counseling records of 109 survivors and 80 bereaved family members, and analyzed their epidemiological and MERS-related information along with psychological responses.
RESULTS: Somatic symptoms and anxiety related to social stigmatization or disease transmission were common in MERS survivors, whereas grief reactions such as sadness, and anger were frequently observed in bereaved families. Bereaved MERS survivors showed more avoidance/isolation than non-bereaved MERS survivors. Females, those with an underlying physical or psychiatric health condition, and those having experienced longer duration of hospitalization and non-healthcare workers were more at risk of suffering from psychological problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors and bereaved families of epidemics can experience various psychological distresses depending on individual characteristics and the inherent features of the epidemic. Therefore, mental health in epidemics should be approached and considered more seriously.","['Lee D', 'Lee JH', 'Jeon K', 'Lee N', 'Sim M']",2022,16,3,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,"Lee D, et al.

33977671,Detection of coronavirus in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in southern Brazil.,"The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.","['Alves RS', 'do Canto Olegário J', 'Weber MN', 'da Silva MS', 'Canova R', 'Sauthier JT', 'Baumbach LF', 'Witt AA', 'Varela APM', 'Mayer FQ', 'da Fontoura Budaszewski R', 'Canal CW']",2022,69,4,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Alves RS, et al.

33977080,"Nanomedicine for acute respiratory distress syndrome: The latest application, targeting strategy, and rational design.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the severe inflammation and destruction of the lung air-blood barrier, leading to irreversible and substantial respiratory function damage. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been encountered with a high risk of ARDS, underscoring the urgency for exploiting effective therapy. However, proper medications for ARDS are still lacking due to poor pharmacokinetics, non-specific side effects, inability to surmount pulmonary barrier, and inadequate management of heterogeneity. The increased lung permeability in the pathological environment of ARDS may contribute to nanoparticle-mediated passive targeting delivery. Nanomedicine has demonstrated unique advantages in solving the dilemma of ARDS drug therapy, which can address the shortcomings and limitations of traditional anti-inflammatory or antioxidant drug treatment. Through passive, active, or physicochemical targeting, nanocarriers can interact with lung epithelium/endothelium and inflammatory cells to reverse abnormal changes and restore homeostasis of the pulmonary environment, thereby showing good therapeutic activity and reduced toxicity. This article reviews the latest applications of nanomedicine in pre-clinical ARDS therapy, highlights the strategies for targeted treatment of lung inflammation, presents the innovative drug delivery systems, and provides inspiration for strengthening the therapeutic effect of nanomedicine-based treatment.","['Qiao Q', 'Liu X', 'Yang T', 'Cui K', 'Kong L', 'Yang C', 'Zhang Z']",2021,11,10,Acta Pharm Sin B,"Qiao Q, et al.

33973199,The COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape.,"The history of vaccine development spans centuries. At first, whole pathogens were used as vaccine agents, either inactivated or attenuated, to reduce virulence in humans. Safety and tolerability were increased by including only specific proteins as antigens and using cell culture methods, while novel vaccine strategies, like nucleic acid- or vector-based vaccines, hold high promise for the future. Vaccines have generally not been employed as the primary tools in outbreak response, but this might change since advances in medical technology in the last decades have made the concept of developing vaccines against novel pathogens a realistic strategy. Wandering the uncharted territory of a novel pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we can learn from other human Betacoronaviridae that emerged in the last decades, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We can identify the most likely target structures of immunity, establish animal models that emulate human disease and immunity as closely as possible, and learn about complex mechanisms of immune interaction such as cross-reactivity or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, significant knowledge gaps remain. What are the correlates of protection? How do we best induce immunity in vulnerable populations like the elderly? Will the immunity induced by vaccination (or by natural infection) wane over time? To date, at least 149 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development. At the time of writing, at least 17 candidates have already progressed past preclinical studies (in vitro models and in vivo animal experiments) into clinical development. This chapter will provide an overview of this rapidly developing field.","['Koch T', 'Fathi A', 'Addo MM']",2021,1318,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Koch T, et al. The COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape.

33973198,Photobiomodulation and Antiviral Photodynamic Therapy in COVID-19 Management.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shocked the world by its spread and contagiousness. There is no approved vaccine and no proven treatment for this infection. Some potential treatments that have already been associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are under investigation. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a photon-based therapy that uses light to mediate a variety of metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a branch of photodynamic therapy based on the reaction between a photosensitizing agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen, which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the viral structures such as proteins and nucleic acids. This chapter aims to discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of PBMT and aPDT in the context of the novel coronavirus. Studies indicate that PBMT and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS, but we found no direct study on SARS-CoV-2. With a combination of PBMT and aPDT, we may be able to combat COVID-19 with minimal interference with pharmaceutical agents. It might improve the efficacy of PBMT and aPDT by using monoclonal antibodies and preparing new photosensitizers at the nanoscale that target the lung tissue specifically. More animal and human studies would need to take place to reach an effective protocol. This chapter would encourage other scientists to work on this new platform.","['Fekrazad R', 'Asefi S', 'Pourhajibagher M', 'Vahdatinia F', 'Fekrazad S', 'Bahador A', 'Abrahamse H', 'Hamblin MR']",2021,1318,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Fekrazad R, et al.

33973182,"Coronavirus Diseases in Pregnant Women, the Placenta, Fetus, and Neonate.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is similar to two other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in causing life-threatening respiratory infections and systemic complications in both children and adults. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread globally, increasing numbers of pregnant women have become infected, raising concern not only for their health but also for the health of their infants. This chapter discusses the effects of coronavirus infections, e.g., MERS, SARS, and COVID 19, on pregnancy and describes the evolving knowledge of COVID 19 among pregnant women. The physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, especially changes in the immune system, are reviewed in terms of their effect on susceptibility to infectious diseases. The effects of COVID-19 on the placenta, fetus, and neonate are also reviewed, including potential clinical outcomes and issues relating to testing and diagnosis. The potential mechanisms of vertical transmission of the virus between pregnant women and their infants are analyzed, including intrauterine, intrapartum, and postpartum infections. Several recent studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues from the fetal side of the placenta, permitting the diagnosis of transplacental infection of the fetus by SARS-CoV-2. Placentas from infected mothers in which intrauterine transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred demonstrate an unusual combination of pathology findings which may represent risk factors for placental as well as fetal infection.","['Schwartz DA', 'Dhaliwal A']",2021,1318,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Schwartz DA and Dhaliwal A.

33969249,Alpha 1 Antitrypsin is an Inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2-Priming Protease TMPRSS2.,"BACKGROUND: Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry.
METHODS: We developed a cell-based assay to identify TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Inhibitory activity was established in SARS-CoV-2 viral load systems.
RESULTS: We identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 anti-trypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.","['Azouz NP', 'Klingler AM', 'Callahan V', 'Akhrymuk IV', 'Elez K', 'Raich L', 'Henry BM', 'Benoit JL', 'Benoit SW', 'Noé F', 'Kehn-Hall K', 'Rothenberg ME']",2021,6,1,Pathog Immun,"Azouz NP, et al.

Efforts of the scientific community are turning to this global crisis and should present future preventative measures. With recent trends in polymer science that use plasma to activate and enhance the functionalities of polymer surfaces by surface etching, surface grafting, coating and activation combined with recent advances in understanding polymer-virus interactions at the nanoscale, it is promising to employ advanced plasma processing for smart antiviral applications. This trend article highlights the innovative and emerging directions and approaches in plasma-based surface engineering to create antiviral polymers. After introducing the unique features of plasma processing of polymers, novel plasma strategies that can be applied to engineer polymers with antiviral properties are presented and critically evaluated. The challenges and future perspectives of exploiting the unique plasma-specific effects to engineer smart polymers with virus-capture, virus-detection, virus-repelling, and/or virus-inactivation functionalities for biomedical applications are analysed and discussed.","['Ma C', 'Nikiforov A', 'De Geyter N', 'Dai X', 'Morent R', 'Ostrikov KK']",2021,118,,Prog Polym Sci,"Ma C, et al.

Camel is supposed to be the natural reservoir for human infection while the sources for most of the primary human infection cases are still not known. We identified two conserved pyrimidine nucleotides that flank UAAU element in MERS-CoV 5'-UTR. These conserved pyrimidine nucleotides distinguish MERS-CoVs into 3 types, that is, UUAAUU, CUAAUU and CUAAUC (referred to as U----U, C----U, and C----C types, respectively). Human MERS-CoV displays a genetic drift from U----U, C----U, to C----C from 2012 to 2019. Camel virus displays a genetic drift from U----U to C----U with a time lag when compared with human virus. The discrepancy in genetic drift seems not to support the notion that camel serves as the only natural reservoir for human infection.","['Pan YQ', 'Guo F', 'Bahoussi AN', 'Shi RZ', 'Li YQ', 'Xing L']",2021,68,5,Zoonoses Public Health,"Pan YQ, et al.

The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic infection to severe complicated pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure leading to death. The estimated case-fatality rate among infected patients in Wuhan, the city where the first case appeared, was 1.4%, with 5.1 times increase in the death rate among those aged above 59 years than those aged 30-59 years. In the absence of a proven effective and licensed treatment, many agents that showed activity against previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS have been used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be 80% homologous with SARS-CoV, and some enzymes are almost 90% homologous. Antiviral drugs are urgently required to reduce case fatality-rate and hospitalizations to relieve the burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy and safety of several treatment regimens.","['Al-Iede M', 'Badran E', 'Al-Lawama M', 'Daher A', 'Al-Zayadneh E', 'Aleidi SM', 'Khawaldeh T', 'Alqutawneh B']",2021,89,2,Adv Respir Med,"Al-Iede M, et al.

33964965,"Epidemiology and evolution of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2012-2020.","BACKGROUND: The ongoing transmission of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East and its expansion to other regions are raising concerns of a potential pandemic. An in-depth analysis about both population and molecular epidemiology of this pathogen is needed.
METHODS: MERS cases reported globally as of June 2020 were collected mainly from World Health Organization official reports, supplemented by other reliable sources. Determinants for case fatality and spatial diffusion of MERS were assessed with Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed to examine the evolution and migration history of MERS-CoV.
RESULTS: A total of 2562 confirmed MERS cases with 150 case clusters were reported with a case fatality rate of 32.7% (95% CI: 30.9‒34.6%). Saudi Arabia accounted for 83.6% of the cases. Age of ≥ 65 years old, underlying conditions and ≥ 5 days delay in diagnosis were independent risk factors for death. However, a history of animal contact was associated with a higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.10-7.98) among female cases < 65 years but with a lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.51) among male cases ≥ 65 years old. Diffusion of the disease was fastest from its origin in Saudi Arabia to the east, and was primarily driven by the transportation network. The most recent sub-clade C5.1 (since 2013) was associated with non-synonymous mutations and a higher mortality rate. Phylogeographic analyses pointed to Riyadh of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates as the hubs for both local and international spread of MERS-CoV.
CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV remains primarily locally transmitted in the Middle East, with opportunistic exportation to other continents and a potential of causing transmission clusters of human cases. Animal contact is associated with a higher risk of death, but the association differs by age and sex. Transportation network is the leading driver for the spatial diffusion of the disease. These findings how this pathogen spread are helpful for targeting public health surveillance and interventions to control endemics and to prevent a potential pandemic.","['Zhang AR', 'Shi WQ', 'Liu K', 'Li XL', 'Liu MJ', 'Zhang WH', 'Zhao GP', 'Chen JJ', 'Zhang XA', 'Miao D', 'Ma W', 'Liu W', 'Yang Y', 'Fang LQ']",2021,10,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Zhang AR, et al.

This emergent group, which consists of government officials and public health specialists, directed and coordinated organizations at the center of the response networks. We found that the emergent group positively contributed to efficient information communication but had no effect on the resource network's efficiency.

33962680,An application of slow feature analysis to the genetic sequences of coronaviruses and influenza viruses.,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical approaches have been for decades used to probe the structure of DNA sequences. This has led to the development of Bioinformatics. In this exploratory work, a novel mathematical method is applied to probe the DNA structure of two related viral families: those of coronaviruses and those of influenza viruses. The coronaviruses are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The influenza viruses include H1N1-1918, H1N1-2009, H2N2-1957, and H3N2-1968.
METHODS: The mathematical method used is the slow feature analysis (SFA), a rather new but promising method to delineate complex structure in DNA sequences.
RESULTS: The analysis indicates that the DNA sequences exhibit an elaborate and convoluted structure akin to complex networks. We define a measure of complexity and show that each DNA sequence exhibits a certain degree of complexity within itself, while at the same time there exists complex inter-relationships between the sequences within a family and between the two families. From these relationships, we find evidence, especially for the coronavirus family, that increasing complexity in a sequence is associated with higher transmission rate but with lower mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The complexity measure defined here may hold a promise and could become a useful tool in the prediction of transmission and mortality rates in future new viral strains.","['Tsonis AA', 'Wang G', 'Zhang L', 'Lu W', 'Kayafas A', 'Del Rio-Tsonis K']",2021,15,1,Hum Genomics,"Tsonis AA, et al.

33961897,Epitope mapping of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with a rabbit monoclonal antibody.,"The emergency SARS-CoV-2, a member of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), is still greatly harming the health of mankind. SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which can identify SARS-CoV-2 from common human coronaviruses, are considered to extensively apply to developing rapid and reliable antigen assays. In this study we generated a rabbit MAb (RAb) detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), which has cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-1 NP, but not with NPs of MERS and common human CoVs (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1). With truncated NP fragments and synthesized peptides, the linear epitope detected by RAb was mapped in peptide N4-8, 393-407 amino acid residue (TLLPAADLDDFSKQL) of SARS-CoV-2 NP. This epitope N4-8 was highly conserved in SARSr-CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and bat CoV RaTG13 strain. However, the corresponding peptide of bat SARSr-CoV BtKY72 strain could not be recognized by RAb, which indicates amino acid D399 may be critical for N4-8 epitope detected by RAb. The present study will be conducive to developing reliable diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 and gaining insights into the function of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein.","['Tian X', 'Mo C', 'Zhou L', 'Yang Y', 'Zhou Z', 'You A', 'Fan Y', 'Liu W', 'Li X', 'Zhou R']",2021,300,,Virus Res,"Tian X, et al.

33959956,Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission.
SEARCH METHODS: An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS-I for non-randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-randomised, non-controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID-19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non-controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS, low-certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID-19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID-19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID-19 (2 observational studies on COVID-19 and 2 observational studies on SARS).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID-19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems. The update was self-initiated by the review authors.","['Nussbaumer-Streit B', 'Mayr V', 'Dobrescu AI', 'Chapman A', 'Persad E', 'Klerings I', 'Wagner G', 'Siebert U', 'Ledinger D', 'Zachariah C', 'Gartlehner G']",2020,9,9,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Nussbaumer-Streit B, et al.

33956643,Caring for patients with rare diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Rare diseases frequently attack and weaken the immune system, increasing the patient's vulnerability to develop severe conditions after viral infections, such as COVID-19. Many patients with rare diseases also suffer from mental retardation and disability. These rare disease phenotypes do not emerge in older people who are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, but present at a very young age or at birth. These factors must be taken in consideration when caring for this vulnerable patient population during a pandemic, such as COVID-19. Patients with a rare disease have to take their regular medication continuously to control their condition and frequently, the medications, directly or indirectly, affect their immune system. It is important for this patient population, if infected with COVID-19 or another severe form of infection, to adjust the treatment protocol by specialists, in consultation with their own medical team. Special awareness and educational programs, understandable for mentally retarded patients, must be developed to educate them about social distancing, curfew, sanitization, and sensitization to the disease and quarantine.

33953756,"Drug Repurposing Approach, Potential Drugs, and Novel Drug Targets for COVID-19 Treatment.","Novel coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it speedily expanded globally. Some medications which are used to treat other diseases seem to be effective in treating COVID-19 even without explicit support. The existing drugs that are summarized in this review primarily focused on therapeutic agents that possessed activity against other RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a promising field in drug discovery that identifies new therapeutic opportunities for existing drugs such as corticosteroids, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, interferons, protease inhibitors, ivermectin, melatonin, teicoplanin, and some others. A search for new drug/drug targets is underway. Thus, blocking coronavirus structural protein, targeting viral enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, and membrane fusion blocker (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD147 inhibitor) are major sites based on molecular targets for the management of COVID-19 infection. The possible impact of biologics for the management of COVID19 is promising and includes a wide variety of options such as cytokines, nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression, bioengineered and vectored antibodies, and various types of vaccines. This review demonstrates that the available data are not sufficient to suggest any treatment for the eradication of COVID-19 to be used at the clinical level. This article aims to review the roles of existing drugs and drug targets for COVID-19 treatment.","['Kifle ZD', 'Ayele AG', 'Enyew EF']",2021,2021,,J Environ Public Health,"Kifle ZD, et al.

33953325,Innate immune sensing of coronavirus and viral evasion strategies.,"The innate immune system is the first line of the host defense program against pathogens and harmful substances. Antiviral innate immune responses can be triggered by multiple cellular receptors sensing viral components. The activated innate immune system produces interferons (IFNs) and cytokines that perform antiviral functions to eliminate invading viruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a broad range of animal hosts. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple means to evade host antiviral immune responses. Successful immune evasion by coronaviruses may enable the viruses to adapt to multiple species of host organisms. Coronavirus transmission from zoonotic hosts to humans has caused serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), resulting in global health and economic crises. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host sensing of and innate immune responses against coronavirus invasion, as well as host immune evasion strategies of coronaviruses.","['Kasuga Y', 'Zhu B', 'Jang KJ', 'Yoo JS']",2021,53,5,Exp Mol Med,"Kasuga Y, et al.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of COVID-19, which spread throughout China and subsequently, across the world. As COVID-19 causes serious public health concerns across the world, investigating the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host immune responses may provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes disease in some individuals. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1 and 96-98% homology with CoVs isolated from bats. Therefore, the experience acquired in SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics may improve our understanding of the immune response and immunopathological changes in COVID-19 patients. In the present paper, we have reviewed the immune responses (including the innate and adaptive immunities) to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, so as to improve our understanding of the concept of the COVID-19 disease, which will be helpful in developing vaccines and medications for treating the COVID-19 patients.","['Vafaeinezhad A', 'Atashzar MR', 'Baharlou R']",2021,182,9,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,"Vafaeinezhad A, et al.

33950300,Human cell receptors: potential drug targets to combat COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic having a higher spread rate rather than the mortality. Identification of a potential approach or therapy against COVID-19 is still under consideration. Therefore, it is essential to have an insight into SARS-CoV-2, its interacting partner, and domains for an effective treatment. The present study is divided into three main categories, including SARS-CoV-2 prominent receptor and its expression levels, other interacting partners, and their binding domains. The first section focuses primarily on coronaviruses' general aspects (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV)) their structures, similarities, and mode of infections. The second section discusses the host receptors which includes the human targets of coronaviruses like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), CD147, CD209L, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other miscellaneous targets (type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), furin, trypsin, cathepsins, thermolysin, elastase, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, two-pore segment channel, and epithelium sodium channel C-α subunit). The human cell receptor, ACE2 plays an essential role in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway and COVID-19. Thus, this section also discusses the ACE2 expression and risk of COVID-19 infectivity in various organs and tissues such as the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, and reproductive system in the human body. Absence of ACE2 protein expression in immune cells could be used for limiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The third section covers the current available approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19.","['Raghav PK', 'Kalyanaraman K', 'Kumar D']",2021,53,6,Amino Acids,"Raghav PK, et al.

We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. We found that high serum antibody titers can persist for more than 9 months post infection. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities. Anonymous sample tracking and an integrated website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability. We anticipate this concept to serve as a prototype for reliable serological testing among larger populations.","['Matthews MM', 'Kim TG', 'Shibata S', 'Shibata N', 'Butcher C', 'Hyun J', 'Kim KY', 'Robb T', 'Jheng SS', 'Narita M', 'Mori T', 'Collins M', 'Wolf M']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Matthews MM, et al.

This virus subsequently spread to 27 countries with a total of 939 deaths and 2586 confirmed cases and now has become a serious concern globally. Camels are well known for the transmission of the virus to the human population. In this report, we have discussed the prediction, designing, and evaluation of potential siRNA targeting the ORF1ab gene for the inhibition of MERS-CoV replication. The online software, siDirect 2.0 was used to predict and design the siRNAs, their secondary structure and their target accessibility. ORF1ab gene folding was performed by RNAxs and RNAfold software. A total of twenty-one siRNAs were selected from 462 siRNAs according to their scoring and specificity. siRNAs were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy in Huh7 cell line. No significant cytotoxicity was observed for all siRNAs in Huh7 cells. The in vitro study showed the inhibition of viral replication by three siRNAs. The data generated in this study provide preliminary and encouraging information to evaluate the siRNAs separately as well as in combination against MERS-CoV replication in other cell lines. The prediction of siRNAs using online software resulted in the filtration and selection of potential siRNAs with high accuracy and strength. This computational approach resulted in three effective siRNAs that can be taken further to in vivo animal studies and can be used to develop safe and effective antiviral therapies for other prevalent disease-causing viruses.","['El-Kafrawy SA', 'Sohrab SS', 'Mirza Z', 'Hassan AM', 'Alsaqaf F', 'Azhar EI']",2021,26,9,Molecules,"El-Kafrawy SA, et al.

Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area.

33937326,Developmental Landscape of Potential Vaccine Candidates Based on Viral Vector for Prophylaxis of COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, arose at the end of 2019 as a zoonotic virus, which is the causative agent of the novel coronavirus outbreak COVID-19. Without any clear indications of abatement, the disease has become a major healthcare threat across the globe, owing to prolonged incubation period, high prevalence, and absence of existing drugs or vaccines. Development of COVID-19 vaccine is being considered as the most efficient strategy to curtail the ongoing pandemic. Following publication of genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, globally extensive research and development work has been in progress to develop a vaccine against the disease. The use of genetic engineering, recombinant technologies, and other computational tools has led to the expansion of several promising vaccine candidates. The range of technology platforms being evaluated, including virus-like particles, peptides, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), recombinant proteins, inactivated virus, live attenuated viruses, and viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating) approaches, are striking features of the vaccine development strategies. Viral vectors, the next-generation vaccine platforms, provide a convenient method for delivering vaccine antigens into the host cell to induce antigenic proteins which can be tailored to arouse an assortment of immune responses, as evident from the success of smallpox vaccine and Ervebo vaccine against Ebola virus. As per the World Health Organization, till January 22, 2021, 14 viral vector vaccine candidates are under clinical development including 10 nonreplicating and four replicating types. Moreover, another 39 candidates based on viral vector platform are under preclinical evaluation. This review will outline the current developmental landscape and discuss issues that remain critical to the success or failure of viral vector vaccine candidates against COVID-19.","['Bezbaruah R', 'Borah P', 'Kakoti BB', ""Al-Shar'I NA"", 'Chandrasekaran B', 'Jaradat DMM', 'Al-Zeer MA', 'Abu-Romman S']",2021,8,,Front Mol Biosci,"Bezbaruah R, et al.

Here, we evaluated two independent molecular assays, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 test, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 test on a field-deployable point-of-care real-time PCR instrument, Franklin three9, in combination with Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Cartridge Kit for RNA 2.0 (M1) manual extraction system for rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of SARS-COV-2 in cell culture, human, and animal clinical samples. The Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 assay, which simultaneously detects two viral targets, the orf1ab and S genes, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 were highly sensitive and detected as low as 15 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction. In addition, the two assays were specific and showed no cross-reactivity with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and other common human respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. Also, both assays were highly reproducible across different operators and instruments. When used to test animal samples, both assays equally detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in the swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. The M1 lysis buffer completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 10 min at room temperature enabling safe handling of clinical samples. Collectively, these results show that the Biomeme and Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 mobile testing platforms could reliably and promptly detect SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal clinical samples in approximately an hour and can be used in remote areas or health care settings not traditionally serviced by a microbiology laboratory.","['Onyilagha C', 'Mistry H', 'Marszal P', 'Pinette M', 'Kobasa D', 'Tailor N', 'Berhane Y', 'Nfon C', 'Pickering B', 'Mubareka S', 'Bulir D', 'Chong S', 'Kozak R', 'Ambagala A']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Onyilagha C, et al.

Thorough investigations of the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are urgently required. In the current study, we studied amplified fragments of ORF1a/b, Spike (S) gene, ORF3/4a, and ORF4b of four human MERS-CoV strains for tracking the evolution of MERS-CoV over time.
METHODS: RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, and tracheal swabs/aspirates from hospitalized patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection were analyzed for amplification of nine variable genomic fragments. Sequence comparisons were done using different bioinformatics tools available.
RESULTS: Several mutations were identified in ORF1a/b, ORF3/4a and ORF4b, with the highest mutation rates in the S gene. Five codons; 4 in ORF1a and 1 in the S gene, were found to be under selective pressure. Characteristic amino acid changes, potentially hosted and year specific were defined across the S protein and in the receptor-binding domain Phylogenetic analysis using S gene sequence revealed clustering of MERS-CoV strains into three main clades, A, B and C with subdivision of with clade B into B1 to B4.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, MERS-CoV appears to continuously evolve. It is recommended that the molecular and pathobiological characteristics of future MERS-CoV strains should be analyzed on regular basis to prevent potential future outbreaks at early phases.","['Farrag MA', 'Amer HM', 'Bhat R', 'Almajhdi FN']",2021,18,1,Virol J,"Farrag MA, et al.

In this process, the C-terminal helical repeat (HR2) region of viral membrane fusion proteins becomes transiently exposed and accessible to N-terminal helical repeat (HR1) trimer-based fusion inhibitors. Herein, we describe a mimetic of the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 trimer, N3G, as a promising therapeutic against HIV-1 infection. Surprisingly, we found that in addition to protection against HIV-1 infection, N3G was also highly effective in inhibiting infection of human β-coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2, possibly by binding the HR2 region in the spike protein of β-coronaviruses to block their hexameric structure formation. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of anti-HIV-1 HR1 peptides in inhibiting human β-coronavirus infection. Moreover, this strategy could be extended to the design of broad-spectrum antivirals based on the supercoiling structure of peptides.","['Wang C', 'Xia S', 'Wang X', 'Li Y', 'Wang H', 'Xiang R', 'Jiang Q', 'Lan Q', 'Liang R', 'Li Q', 'Huo S', 'Lu L', 'Wang Q', 'Yu F', 'Liu K', 'Jiang S']",2022,65,4,J Med Chem,"Wang C, et al.

Several occupational risk factors are challenging healthcare workers (HCWs) who are at high risk of mental health outcomes, including Burnout Syndrome (BOS). BOS is a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning BOS and coronavirus (SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks was carried out on PubMed Central/Medline, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, and Epistemonikos databases. Data relating to COVID-19 is insufficient, but in previous SARS and MERS outbreaks about one-third of HCWs manifested BOS. This prevalence rate is similar to the figure recorded in some categories of HCWs exposed to chronic occupational stress and poor work organization during non-epidemic periods. Inadequate organization and worsening working conditions during an epidemic appear to be the most likely causes of BOS. Preventive care and workplace health promotion programs could be useful for protecting healthcare workers during pandemics, as well as during regular health activities.","['Magnavita N', 'Chirico F', 'Garbarino S', 'Bragazzi NL', 'Santacroce E', 'Zaffina S']",2021,18,8,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Magnavita N, et al.

33922613,Semicovariance Coefficient Analysis of Spike Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses for Viral Evolution and Characteristics Associated with Fatality.,"Complex modeling has received significant attention in recent years and is increasingly used to explain statistical phenomena with increasing and decreasing fluctuations, such as the similarity or difference of spike protein charge patterns of coronaviruses. Different from the existing covariance or correlation coefficient methods in traditional integer dimension construction, this study proposes a simplified novel fractional dimension derivation with the exact Excel tool algorithm. It involves the fractional center moment extension to covariance, which results in a complex covariance coefficient that is better than the Pearson correlation coefficient, in the sense that the nonlinearity relationship can be further depicted. The spike protein sequences of coronaviruses were obtained from the GenBank and GISAID databases, including the coronaviruses from pangolin, bat, canine, swine (three variants), feline, tiger, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (including the strains from Wuhan, Beijing, New York, German, and the UK variant B.1.1.7) which were used as the representative examples in this study. By examining the values above and below the average/mean based on the positive and negative charge patterns of the amino acid residues of the spike proteins from coronaviruses, the proposed algorithm provides deep insights into the nonlinear evolving trends of spike proteins for understanding the viral evolution and identifying the protein characteristics associated with viral fatality. The calculation results demonstrate that the complex covariance coefficient analyzed by this algorithm is capable of distinguishing the subtle nonlinear differences in the spike protein charge patterns with reference to Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2, which the Pearson correlation coefficient may overlook. Our analysis reveals the unique convergent (positive correlative) to divergent (negative correlative) domain center positions of each virus. The convergent or conserved region may be critical to the viral stability or viability; while the divergent region is highly variable between coronaviruses, suggesting high frequency of mutations in this region. The analyses show that the conserved center region of SARS-CoV-1 spike protein is located at amino acid residues 900, but shifted to the amino acid residues 700 in MERS spike protein, and then to amino acid residues 600 in SARS-COV-2 spike protein, indicating the evolution of the coronaviruses. Interestingly, the conserved center region of the spike protein in SARS-COV-2 variant B.1.1.7 shifted back to amino acid residues 700, suggesting this variant is more virulent than the original SARS-COV-2 strain. Another important characteristic our study reveals is that the distance between the divergent mean and the maximal divergent point in each of the viruses (MERS > SARS-CoV-1 > SARS-CoV-2) is proportional to viral fatality rate. This algorithm may help to understand and analyze the evolving trends and critical characteristics of SARS-COV-2 variants, other coronaviral proteins and viruses.","['Huang JS', 'Huang JM', 'Zhang W']",2021,23,5,Entropy (Basel),"Huang JS, et al.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments. Complementation into functional Nluc was used to assess virus-cell entry. We discovered that each of the VLPs were effective at monitoring virus-cell entry, to various extents, in ways that depended on host cell susceptibility factors. Overall, we have developed and utilized a VLP system that has proven useful in identifying SARS-CoV2 assembly and entry features.","['Kumar B', 'Hawkins GM', 'Kicmal T', 'Qing E', 'Timm E', 'Gallagher T']",2021,10,4,Cells,"Kumar B, et al.

33917625,Development of a Colorimetric Tool for SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Viruses Detection Using Sialic Acid Fabricated Gold Nanoparticles.,"Sialic acid that presents on the surface of lung epithelial cells is considered as one of the main binding targets for many respiratory viruses, including influenza and the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through the viral surface protein hemagglutinin. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are extensively used in the diagnostic field owing to a phenomenon known as 'surface plasmonic resonance' in which the scattered light is absorbed by these NPs and can be detected via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Consequently, sialic acid conjugated Au NPs (SA-Au NPs) were utilized for their plasmonic effect against SARS-CoV-2, influenza B virus, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) in patients' swab samples. The SA-Au NPs system was prepared by a one-pot synthesis method, through which the NPs solution color changed from pale yellow to dark red wine color, indicting its successful preparation. In addition, the SA-Au NPs had an average particle size of 30 ± 1 nm, negative zeta potential (-30 ± 0.3 mV), and a UV absorbance of 525 nm. These NPs have proven their ability to change the color of the NPs solutions and patients' swabs that contain SARS-CoV-2, influenza B, and MERS viruses, suggesting a rapid and straightforward detection tool that would reduce the spread of these viral infections and accelerate the therapeutic intervention.","['Alfassam HA', 'Nassar MS', 'Almusaynid MM', 'Khalifah BA', 'Alshahrani AS', 'Almughem FA', 'Alshehri AA', 'Alawad MO', 'Massadeh S', 'Alaamery M', 'Aldeailej IM', 'Alamri AA', 'Binjomah AZ', 'Tawfik EA']",2021,13,4,Pharmaceutics,"Alfassam HA, et al.

33917481,Role of Structural and Non-Structural Proteins and Therapeutic Targets of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, comprising single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (+ ssRNA) of around 26 to 32 kilobases, and has been known to cause infection to a myriad of mammalian hosts, such as humans, cats, bats, civets, dogs, and camels with varied consequences in terms of death and debilitation. Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88% of sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, respectively. Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV displays 10-20 times greater affinity for its cognate host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5' end of + ssRNA genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated replication-transcription molecular events lead to the synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural and accessory proteins participating in structure formation and various molecular functions of virus, respectively. These multiple structural proteins assemble and encapsulate genomic RNA (gRNA), resulting in numerous viral progenies, which eventually exit the host cell, and spread infection to rest of the body. In this review, we primarily focus on genomic organization, structural and non-structural protein components, and potential prospective molecular targets for development of therapeutic drugs, convalescent plasm therapy, and a myriad of potential vaccines to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Yadav R', 'Chaudhary JK', 'Jain N', 'Chaudhary PK', 'Khanra S', 'Dhamija P', 'Sharma A', 'Kumar A', 'Handu S']",2021,10,4,Cells,"Yadav R, et al.

33913101,Expression map of entry receptors and infectivity factors for pan-coronaviruses in preimplantation and implantation stage human embryos.,"PURPOSE: To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to multiple coronaviruses.
METHOD: We analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets of human embryos for the known canonical and non-canonical receptors and spike protein cleavage enzymes for multiple coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63. We also analyzed the expression of host genes involved in viral replication, host proteins involved in viral endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), genes of host proteins that physically interact with proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and the host genes essential for coronavirus infectivity.
RESULTS: Of the known receptors of SARS viruses, ACE2, BSG, GOLGA7, and ZDHHC5 were expressed in different proportions in the zygote, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocysts including the trophectoderm. The MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, and hCoV-229E receptor, ANPEP, were expressed mainly from the compact morula to the blastocyst stages. Transcripts of the MERS-CoV alternate receptor LGALS1 were detected in most cells at all stages of development. TMPRSS2 transcripts were detected in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm, while transcripts of the endosomal proteases CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN were expressed in most cells at all stages of development. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast and trophectoderm cells. The embryonic cells expressed genes involved in ESCRT, viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and coronavirus infectivity. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells were enriched in genes associated with lipid metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
CONCLUSION: Preimplantation and implantation stage human embryos could be permissive to multiple hCoVs.","['Colaco S', 'Chhabria K', 'Singh D', 'Bhide A', 'Singh N', 'Singh A', 'Husein A', 'Mishra A', 'Sharma R', 'Ashary N', 'Modi D']",2021,38,7,J Assist Reprod Genet,"Colaco S, et al.

33912498,Review of COVID-19 Treatment.,"Many contagious diseases, such as plague or cholera, played a role in changing the pathway of history. In this respect, although coronavirus was not as dangerous as novel diseases such as swine flu and Ebola, the spread and the power of coronavirus infiltration caused public fear across the world. Three viruses among coronaviruses have been epidemic during the recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 or new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets transmit the coronavirus through direct and indirect contact, and it can be transmitted through the contact in the case of remaining, the infected person's secretion on the surface. Based on the conducted studies on the treatment of COVID-19 disease, there is virtually no cure or vaccine for coronavirus infections yet. Those infected with Covid 19 are quarantined to prevent the outbreak of this disease. However, the researchers carried out different studies to investigate the impact of the various drugs on this virus, which in this study, we will examine the outline of this disease and the other conducted studies.","['Sadeghi S', 'Momenzadeh M', 'Nasri P', 'Nickpour M']",2020,9,4,J Res Pharm Pract,"Sadeghi S, et al.

33912475,No Evidence for Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophage Infection and Antibody-Mediated Enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in hMDM. Although, hMDM expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, no or very low levels of transmembrane protease serine 2 were found. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.","['García-Nicolás O', ""V'kovski P"", 'Zettl F', 'Zimmer G', 'Thiel V', 'Summerfield A']",2021,11,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"García-Nicolás O, et al.

33908208,Roles of Type I and III Interferons in COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Type I and III interferon (IFN) responses act as the first line of defense against viral infection and are activated by the recognition of viruses by infected cells and innate immune cells. Dysregulation of host IFN responses has been known to be associated with severe disease progression in COVID-19 patients. However, the reported results are controversial and the roles of IFN responses in COVID-19 need to be investigated further. In the absence of a highly efficacious antiviral drug, clinical studies have evaluated recombinant type I and III IFNs, as they have been successfully used for the treatment of infections caused by two other epidemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this review, we describe the strategies by which SARS-CoV-2 evades IFN responses and the dysregulation of host IFN responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of type I and III IFNs in COVID-19.","['Choi H', 'Shin EC']",2021,62,5,Yonsei Med J,Choi H and Shin EC.

33907990,Automatic identification of sweet spots from MERs for electrodes implantation in STN-DBS.,"PURPOSE: Microelectrode recordings (MERs) are a significant clinical indicator for sweet spots identification of implanted electrodes during deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) surgery. As 1D MERs signals have the unboundedness, large-range, large-amount and time-dependent characteristics, the purpose of this study is to propose an automatic and precise identification method of sweet spots from MERs, reducing the time-consuming and labor-intensive human annotations.
METHODS: We propose an automatic identification method of sweet spots from MERs for electrodes implantation in STN-DBS. To better imitate the surgeons' observation and obtain more intuitive contextual information, we first employ the 2D Gramian angular summation field (GASF) images generated from MERs data to perform the sweet spots determination for electrodes implantation. Then, we introduce the convolutional block attention module into convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the 2D GASF images of sweet spots for electrodes implantation.
RESULTS: Experimental results illustrate that the identification result of our method is consistent with the result of doctor's decision, while our method can achieve the accuracy and precision of 96.72% and 98.97%, respectively, which outperforms state-of-the-art for intraoperative sweet spots determination.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is the first time to automatically and accurately identify sweet spots from MERs for electrodes implantation by the combination an advanced time series-to-image encoding way with CBAM-enhanced networks model. Our method can assist neurosurgeons in automatically detecting the most likely locations of sweet spots for electrodes implantation, which can provide an important indicator for target selection while it reduces the localization error of the target during STN-DBS surgery.","['Xiao L', 'Li C', 'Wang Y', 'Si W', 'Zhang D', 'Lin H', 'Cai X', 'Heng PA']",2021,16,5,Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,"Xiao L, et al.

METHODS: Utilizing Biobase, GEOquery, gplots packages in R studio, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The gene ontology (GO) of pathway enrichments employed by utilizing DAVID and KEGG enrichment analyses were studied.

Many of the robots that are being used employ ultraviolet lights mounted on a mobile base to inactivate the pathogens. However, these lights are often mounted in a fixed configuration and do not provide adequate decontamination of horizontal surfaces, which can be a major source of cross-contamination.

A human supervisor designates a surface for disinfection, the robot autonomously plans and executes an end-effector trajectory to disinfect the surface to the required certainty, and then displays the results for the human supervisor to verify. We also provide some background information on UVGI and describe how we constructed and validated mathematical models of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation propagation and accumulation.

The need for therapeutic alternatives to stop this new pandemic is urgent. Nowadays, no efficacious therapy is available, and vaccines and drugs are underdeveloped to cure or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in many countries. Some vaccines candidates have been approved; however, a number of people are still skeptical of this coronavirus vaccines. Probably because of issues related to the quantity of the vaccine and a possible long-term side effects which are still being studied.

The first case was recorded as viral pneumonia and later became a worldwide pandemic (officially declared by WHO on March 11, 2020).
MAIN BODY: SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely infectious and transferrable virus that develops severe conditions like respiratory syndrome, high blood pressure and weakens the immune system. Coronavirus falls under the Coronaviridae family and Beta coronavirus genus. Affected individuals will encounter problems starting with fever followed by severe complications like SARS, ARDS, and many others. These SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enter the host cells by the endosomal pathway, and about 16 non-structural proteins are involved in assembling the viral RNA synthesis complex. They possess a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and about four major genes are mainly associated with the development of ASRD, SARS, and other respiratory problems.
CONCLUSION: Susceptibility of these four major genes such as ACE2, IL-2, 7 and 10, TNF, and VEGF is associated with COVID-19. This highlights the identification of the above-mentioned genes that can be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted drug delivery for treating the SARS-CoV-2 neurological symptoms and reducing inflammation in the brain.","['Veerabathiran R', 'Ragunath B', 'Kaviarasan V', 'Mohammed V', 'Ahmed SSSJ']",2021,45,1,Bull Natl Res Cent,"Veerabathiran R, et al.

In addition, analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has an important role in viral diagnostics and seroprevalence estimates.
METHODS: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and 4 low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM EIA results.

Simple tandem repeats (microsatellites, STR) are extracted and investigated across all viral families from four main viral realms. An ultra-efficient and reliable software, which is recently developed by the authors and published in the above-mentioned article, is used for extracting STRs. The analysis is done for k-mer tandem repeats where k varies from one to seven. In particular the frequency of trimer STRs is shown to be low in RNA viruses compared with DNA viruses.

33898518,An Overview of Spike Surface Glycoprotein in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus.,"The novel coronavirus originated in December 2019 in Hubei, China. This contagious disease named as COVID-19 resulted in a massive expansion within 6 months by spreading to more than 213 countries. Despite the availability of antiviral drugs for the treatment of various viral infections, it was concluded by the WHO that there is no medicine to treat novel CoV, SARS-CoV-2. It has been confirmed that SARS-COV-2 is the most highly virulent human coronavirus and occupies the third position following SARS and MERS with the highest mortality rate. The genetic assembly of SARS-CoV-2 is segmented into structural and non-structural proteins, of which two-thirds of the viral genome encodes non-structural proteins and the remaining genome encodes structural proteins. The most predominant structural proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2 include spike surface glycoproteins (S), membrane proteins (M), envelope proteins (E), and nucleocapsid proteins (N). This review will focus on one of the four major structural proteins in the CoV assembly, the spike, which is involved in host cell recognition and the fusion process. The monomer disintegrates into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 domain necessitating binding of the virus to its host cell receptor and the S2 domain mediating the viral fusion. On viral infection by the host, the S protein is further cleaved by the protease enzyme to two major subdomains S1/S2. Spike is proven to be an interesting target for developing vaccines and in particular, the RBD-single chain dimer has shown initial success. The availability of small molecules and peptidic inhibitors for host cell receptors is briefly discussed. The development of new molecules and therapeutic druggable targets for SARS-CoV-2 is of global importance. Attacking the virus employing multiple targets and strategies is the best way to inhibit the virus. This article will appeal to researchers in understanding the structural and biological aspects of the S protein in the field of drug design and discovery.","['Kathiravan MK', 'Radhakrishnan S', 'Namasivayam V', 'Palaniappan S']",2021,8,,Front Mol Biosci,"Kathiravan MK, et al.

We examine hospital avoidance behaviors during the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. The outbreak provides an excellent setting for the analysis because unlike the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) situation, no mandatory lockdown was imposed during the outbreak, and the economic impact was also not large. Hence, reduced hospital visits are likely to reflect the public's intention to avoid hospitals to protect themselves from getting infected with MERS. Moreover, the outbreak did not spread to the entire country and vanished after a short period of time, allowing us to consider the affected regions as the treatment group and the other regions as the control group without much concern of confounding by other factors. The data come from a government agency, which assesses (national) health insurance claims made by hospitals, and hence cover all outpatient visits in the country. We find that people reduced outpatient visits by about 17% in response to the MERS outbreak, and the response was the most intense when new cases were reported most frequently.","['Cho H', 'Kwon J']",2021,203,,Econ Lett,Cho H and Kwon J.

All of them compare the highlighting advantages and disadvantages from an analytical point of view. The gold standard method in terms of sensitivity and specificity is the RT-PCR. The different modifications propose to make it more rapid and applicable at point of care (POC) are also presented and discussed. CT images are limited to central hospitals. However, being combined with RT-PCR is the most robust and accurate way to confirm COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests, although unable to provide reliable results on the status of the infection, are suitable for carrying out maximum screening of the population in order to know the immune capacity. More recently, antigen tests, less sensitive than RT-PCR, have been authorized to determine in a quicker way whether the patient is infected at the time of analysis and without the need of specific instruments.","['Martín J', 'Tena N', 'Asuero AG']",2021,167,,Microchem J,"Martín J, et al.

METHOD: From 68 publications (N = 87,586 participants), 808 estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies.
RESULTS: Median summary point prevalence estimates varied by disorder and population. Psychiatric morbidity (20-56%), PTSD (10-26%) and depression (9-27%) were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults (18-56%), followed by healthcare providers (11-28%) and community adults (11-20%). Prevalence estimates were often notably higher than reported for unselected samples. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates moderately varied by pandemic, study location, and mental disorder measure type.
CONCLUSION: Coronavirus pandemics are associated with multiple mental disorders in several impacted populations.

33889134,Base Composition and Host Adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2: Insight From the Codon Usage Perspective.,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading rapidly all over the world and has raised grave concern globally. The present research aims to conduct a robust base compositional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 to reveal adaptive intricacies to the human host. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed a complex interplay of various factors including compositional constraint, natural selection, length of viral coding sequences, hydropathicity, and aromaticity of the viral gene products that are operational to codon usage patterns, with compositional bias being the most crucial determinant. UpG and CpA dinucleotides were found to be highly preferred whereas, CpG dinucleotide was mostly avoided in SARS-CoV-2, a pattern consistent with the human host. Strict avoidance of the CpG dinucleotide might be attributed to a strategy for evading a human immune response. A lower degree of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host, compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and SARS-CoV, might be indicative of its milder clinical severity and progression contrasted to SARS and MERS. Similar patterns of enhanced adaptation between viral isolates from intermediate and human hosts, contrasted with those isolated from the natural bat reservoir, signifies an indispensable role of the intermediate host in transmission dynamics and spillover events of the virus to human populations. The information regarding avoided codon pairs in SARS-CoV-2, as conferred by the present analysis, promises to be useful for the design of vaccines employing codon pair deoptimization based synthetic attenuated virus engineering.","['Roy A', 'Guo F', 'Singh B', 'Gupta S', 'Paul K', 'Chen X', 'Sharma NR', 'Jaishee N', 'Irwin DM', 'Shen Y']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Roy A, et al.

33886690,The SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus spike proteins are fine-tuned towards temperature and proteases of the human airways.,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards the human respiratory tract. First, the S proteins exhibit an intrinsic temperature preference, corresponding with the temperature of the upper or lower airways. Pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) were more infectious when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C, a property shared with the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with virus preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S-driven entry was efficiently activated by not only TMPRSS2, but also the TMPRSS13 protease, thus broadening the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Both proteases proved relevant in the context of authentic virus replication. TMPRSS13 appeared an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the low pathogenic HCoV-229E virus. Activation of SARS-2-S by these surface proteases requires processing of the S1/S2 cleavage loop, in which both the furin recognition motif and extended loop length proved critical. Conversely, entry of loop deletion mutants is significantly increased in cathepsin-rich cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the D614G mutation increases SARS-CoV-2 stability, particularly at 37°C, and, enhances its use of the cathepsin L pathway. This indicates a link between S protein stability and usage of this alternative route for virus entry. Since these spike properties may promote virus spread, they potentially explain why the spike-G614 variant has replaced the early D614 variant to become globally predominant. Collectively, our findings reveal adaptive mechanisms whereby the coronavirus spike protein is adjusted to match the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology.","['Laporte M', 'Raeymaekers V', 'Van Berwaer R', 'Vandeput J', 'Marchand-Casas I', 'Thibaut HJ', 'Van Looveren D', 'Martens K', 'Hoffmann M', 'Maes P', 'Pöhlmann S', 'Naesens L', 'Stevaert A']",2021,17,4,PLoS Pathog,"Laporte M, et al.

The molecular mechanisms vary but generally lead to energetically favored circular nanopores. Here, we report an elaborate fractal rupture pattern induced by a single side-chain mutation in ultrashort (8-11-mers) helical peptides, which otherwise form transmembrane pores. In contrast to known mechanisms, this mode of membrane disruption is restricted to the upper leaflet of the bilayer where it exhibits propagating fronts of peptide-lipid interfaces that are strikingly similar to viscous instabilities in fluid flow. The two distinct disruption modes, pores and fractal patterns, are both strongly antimicrobial, but only the fractal rupture is nonhemolytic.

Our initial question was to compare SARS-CoV-2 to different viruses in the coronavirus family using BLAST program of NCBI and machine learning algorithms.
RESULTS: The result of experiments using BLAST, Apriori and Decision Tree has shown that SARS-CoV-2 had high similarity with SARS-CoV while having comparably low similarity with MERS-CoV. We decided to compare the codons of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV to see the difference. Though the viruses are very alike according to BLAST and Apriori experiments, SVM proved that they can be effectively classified using non-linear kernels. Decision Tree experiment proved several remarkable properties of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequence that cannot be found in MERS-CoV amino acid sequence. The consequential purpose of this paper is to minimize the damage on humanity from SARS-CoV-2.

However, there is evidence that highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are shed in the fecal matter of the infected individuals. These observations have raised questions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral route as well as foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Studies regarding the survival of HCoVs on inanimate surfaces demonstrate that these viruses can remain infectious for hours to days, however, there is limited data regarding the viral survival on fresh produce, which is usually consumed raw or with minimal heat processing. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the persistence of HCoV-229E, as a surrogate for highly pathogenic HCoVs, on the surface of commonly consumed fresh produce, including: apples, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Herein, we demonstrated that viral infectivity declines within a few hours post-inoculation (p.i) on apples and tomatoes, and no infectious virus was detected at 24h p.i, while the virus persists in infectious form for 72h p.i on cucumbers and lettuce. The stability of viral RNA was examined by droplet-digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR), and it was observed that there is no considerable reduction in viral RNA within 72h p.i.","['Blondin-Brosseau M', 'Harlow J', 'Doctor T', 'Nasheri N']",2021,98,,Food Microbiol,"Blondin-Brosseau M, et al.

33875001,Profiling SARS-CoV-2 mutation fingerprints that range from the viral pangenome to individual infection quasispecies.,"BACKGROUND: The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing.
METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.
RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.
CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","['Lau BT', 'Pavlichin D', 'Hooker AC', 'Almeda A', 'Shin G', 'Chen J', 'Sahoo MK', 'Huang CH', 'Pinsky BA', 'Lee HJ', 'Ji HP']",2021,13,1,Genome Med,"Lau BT, et al.

33868278,Using Domain Based Latent Personal Analysis of B Cell Clone Diversity Patterns to Identify Novel Relationships Between the B Cell Clone Populations in Different Tissues.,"The B cell population is highly diverse and very skewed. It is divided into clones (B cells with a common mother cell). It is thought that each clone represents an initial B cell receptor specificity. A few clones are very abundant, comprised of hundreds or thousands of B cells while the majority have only a few cells per clone. We suggest a novel method - domain-based latent personal analysis (LPA), a method for spectral exploration of entities in a domain, which can be used to find the spectral spread of sub repertoires within a person. LPA defines a domain-based spectral signature for each sub repertoire. LPA signatures consist of the elements, in our case - the clones, that most differentiate the sub repertoire from the person's abundance of clones. They include both positive elements, which describe overabundant clones, and negative elements that describe missing clones. The signatures can also be used to compare the sub repertoires they represent to each other. Applying LPA to compare the repertoires found in different tissues, we reiterated previous findings that showed that gut and blood tissues have separate repertoires. We further identify a third branch of clonal patterns typical of the lymphatic organs (Spleen, MLN, and bone marrow) separated from the other two categories. We developed a python version of LPA analysis that can easily be applied to compare clonal distributions - https://github.com/ScanLab-ossi/LPA. It could also be easily adapted to study other skewed sequence populations used in the analysis of B cell receptor populations, for instance, k-mers and V gene usage. These analysis types should allow for inter and intra-repertoire comparisons of diversity, which could revolutionize the way we understand repertoire changes and diversity.","['Alon U', 'Mokryn O', 'Hershberg U']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Alon U, et al.

33865974,Oral antiseptics against coronavirus: in-vitro and clinical evidence.,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, so ACE2-expressing cells can act as target cells and are susceptible to infection. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the oral cavity, so this may be a potential high-risk route for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the virus can be detected in saliva, even before COVID-19 symptoms appear, with the consequent high risk of virus transmission in asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. Reducing oral viral load could lead to a lower risk of transmission via salivary droplets or aerosols and therefore contribute to the control of the pandemic. Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence testing the in-vitro and in-vivo effects of oral antiseptics to inactivate or eradicate coronaviruses. The criteria used were those described in the PRISMA declaration for performing systematic reviews. An electronic search was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and in Web of Sciences, using the MeSH terms: 'mouthwash' OR 'oral rinse' OR 'mouth rinse' OR 'povidone iodine' OR 'hydrogen peroxide' OR 'cetylpyridinium chloride' AND 'COVID-19' OR 'SARS-CoV-2' OR 'coronavirus' OR 'SARS' OR 'MERS'. The initial search strategy identified 619 articles on two electronic databases. Seventeen articles were included assessing the virucidal efficacy of oral antiseptics against coronaviruses. In conclusion, there is sufficient in-vitro evidence to support the use of antiseptics to potentially reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, in-vivo evidence for most oral antiseptics is limited. Randomized clinical trials with a control group are needed to demonstrate its clinical efficacy.","['Mateos-Moreno MV', 'Mira A', 'Ausina-Márquez V', 'Ferrer MD']",2021,113,,J Hosp Infect,"Mateos-Moreno MV, et al.

33864870,Preparation of cellulose-based wipes treated with antimicrobial and antiviral silver nanoparticles as novel effective high-performance coronavirus fighter.,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). We succeeded in preparing disinfectant cellulose-based wipes treated with antimicrobial and antiviral silver nanoparticles to be used for prevention of contamination and transmission of several pathogenic viruses and microbes to human in critical areas such as hospitals and healthcare centers especially coronavirus. In this work, the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) prepared with four different techniques were investigated for the utilization as a disinfectant for cellulose-based wipes. These four methods are namely; 1) trisodium citrate with cotton yarn as a reducing agent, 2) preparing AgNP's using aqueous solution of PVA in the presence of glucose, 3) trisodium citrate with cotton fabric as a reducing agent, and 4) photochemical reaction of polyacrylic acid and silver nitrate solution. Polyester/viscose blended spunlace nonwoven fabrics as cellulose based fabrics were treated with the prepared silver nanoparticles to be used as surfaces disinfection wipes. The properties of the nonwoven fabrics were examined including thickness, tensile strength in dry and wet conditions in both machine direction (MD) and cross-machine direction (CMD), bursting strength, air permeability, water permeability and surface wettability. Characterization of the AgNPs was carried out in terms of UV-VIS spectroscopy, TEM, SEM, and Zeta potential analysis. The assessment of AgNPs active solutions for antimicrobial and antiviral activities was evaluated. The results obtained from the analyses of the AgNPs samples prepared with different techniques showed good uniformity and stability of the particles, as well uniform coating of the AgNPs on the fibers. Additionally, there is a significant effect of the AgNPs preparation method on their disinfectant performance that proved its effectiveness against coronavirus (MERS-CoV), S. aureus and B. subtilis as Gram-positive bacteria, E. coli and P. mirabilis as Gram-negative bacteria, A. niger and C. albicans fungi.","['Hamouda T', 'Ibrahim HM', 'Kafafy HH', 'Mashaly HM', 'Mohamed NH', 'Aly NM']",2021,181,,Int J Biol Macromol,"Hamouda T, et al.

33864026,On the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global outbreak of a coronavirus disease (herein referred to as COVID-19). Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","['Singh D', 'Yi SV']",2021,53,4,Exp Mol Med,Singh D and Yi SV.

Twenty-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants have been identified based on missense mutations found in sequence databases. Some of these mutations are predicted to decrease the stability of ORF10 in silico physicochemical and structural comparative analyses were carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid (aa) homology. Though there is a high degree of ORF10 protein similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, there are differences of these two ORF10 proteins related to their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and shift from strand to coil at aa position 26 (tyrosine).

33859192,Mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Substantial COVID-19 research investment has been allocated to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, which currently face recruitment challenges or early discontinuation. We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/ ). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I² = 0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I² = 0%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine.

Here, a novel strategy for the stable expression of multiple proteins by integrating the genes into defined transcriptional hotspots in the human genome is presented. As a proof-of-concept, it is shown that EYFP is expressed at similar levels from hotspots and that the EYFP expression increases proportionally with the copy number. It is confirmed that three different fluorescent proteins, encoded by genes integrated at different loci, can be coexpressed at high levels. Further, a stable cell line is generated, producing antigens from different human coronaviruses: MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. Antibodies raised against these antigens, which contain human N-glycosylation, show neutralizing activities against both viruses, suggesting that the coexpression system provides a quick and predictable way to produce multiple coronavirus antigens, such as the recent 2019 novel human coronavirus.","['Kim C', 'Jeong YK', 'Yu J', 'Shin HJ', 'Ku KB', 'Cha HJ', 'Han JH', 'Hong SA', 'Kim BT', 'Kim SJ', 'Woo JS', 'Bae S']",2021,5,4,Adv Biol (Weinh),"Kim C, et al.

33846704,Comparison of seven commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid point-of-care antigen tests: a single-centre laboratory evaluation study.,"BACKGROUND: Antigen point-of-care tests (AgPOCTs) can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 testing. As some AgPOCTs have become available, interest is growing in their utility and performance. Here we aimed to compare the analytical sensitivity and specificity of seven commercially available AgPOCT devices.
METHODS: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we compared AgPOCT products from seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab), the Coris BioConcept COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the nal von minden NADAL COVID-19 Ag Test, and the Roche-SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results.
FINDINGS: In 138 clinical samples with quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, the 95% limit of detection (concentration at which 95% of test results were positive) in six of seven AgPOCT products ranged between 2·07 × 10
INTERPRETATION: The sensitivity range of most AgPOCTs overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads typically observed in the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in most patients. The AgPOCTs with limit of detections that approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious might enable shortcuts in decision making in various areas of health care and public health.

33845808,Reference-free transcriptome signatures for prostate cancer prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: RNA-seq data are increasingly used to derive prognostic signatures for cancer outcome prediction. A limitation of current predictors is their reliance on reference gene annotations, which amounts to ignoring large numbers of non-canonical RNAs produced in disease tissues. A recently introduced kind of transcriptome classifier operates entirely in a reference-free manner, relying on k-mers extracted from patient RNA-seq data.
METHODS: In this paper, we set out to compare conventional and reference-free signatures in risk and relapse prediction of prostate cancer. To compare the two approaches as fairly as possible, we set up a common procedure that takes as input either a k-mer count matrix or a gene expression matrix, extracts a signature and evaluates this signature in an independent dataset.
RESULTS: We find that both gene-based and k-mer based classifiers had similarly high performances for risk prediction and a markedly lower performance for relapse prediction. Interestingly, the reference-free signatures included a set of sequences mapping to novel lncRNAs or variable regions of cancer driver genes that were not part of gene-based signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Reference-free classifiers are thus a promising strategy for the identification of novel prognostic RNA biomarkers.","['Nguyen HTN', 'Xue H', 'Firlej V', 'Ponty Y', 'Gallopin M', 'Gautheret D']",2021,21,1,BMC Cancer,"Nguyen HTN, et al.

33845740,A Therapeutic Journey of Potential Drugs Against COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) scrambles the world by infecting millions of peoples all over the globe. It has caused tremendous morbidity, mortality and greatly impacted the lives and economy worldwide as an outcome of mandatory quarantines or isolations. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Physicians and researchers throughout the world are working to understand the pathophysiology to expose the conceivable handling regimens and to determine the effective vaccines and/or therapeutic agents. Some of them re-purposed drugs for clinical trials which were primarily known to be effective against the RNA viruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. In the absence of a proven efficacy therapy, the current management use therapies based on antivirals, anti-inflammatory drugs, convalescent plasma, anti-parasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, oxygen therapy, and heparin support. What is needed at this hour, however, is a definitive drug therapy or vaccine. Different countries are rushing to find this, and various trials are already underway. We aimed to summarize the potential therapeutic strategies as treatment options for COVID-19 that could be helpful to stop further spread of SARS-CoV-2 by affecting its structural components or modulation of immune response and discuss the leading drugs/vaccines, which are considered as potential agents for controlling this pandemic.","['Ali F', 'Hussain S', 'Zhu YZ']",2022,22,14,Mini Rev Med Chem,"Ali F, et al.

33845270,Identification of novel compounds against three targets of SARS CoV-2 coronavirus by combined virtual screening and supervised machine learning.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major threat worldwide due to its fast spreading. As yet, there are no established drugs available. Speeding up drug discovery is urgently required. We applied a workflow of combined in silico methods (virtual drug screening, molecular docking and supervised machine learning algorithms) to identify novel drug candidates against COVID-19. We constructed chemical libraries consisting of FDA-approved drugs for drug repositioning and of natural compound datasets from literature mining and the ZINC database to select compounds interacting with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and 2'-o-ribose methyltransferase). Supported by the supercomputer MOGON, candidate compounds were predicted as presumable SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Interestingly, several approved drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), another enveloped (-) ssRNA virus (paritaprevir, simeprevir and velpatasvir) as well as drugs against transmissible diseases, against cancer, or other diseases were identified as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This result is supported by reports that anti-HCV compounds are also active against Middle East Respiratory Virus Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The candidate compounds identified by us may help to speed up the drug development against SARS-CoV-2.","['Kadioglu O', 'Saeed M', 'Greten HJ', 'Efferth T']",2021,133,,Comput Biol Med,"Kadioglu O, et al.

Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been employed for nucleic acid detection, but they have limited sensitivity and specificity. Here, we used a fusion of catalytically inactive SpCas9 endonuclease and VirD2 relaxase for sensitive, specific nucleic acid detection by LFA. In this assay, the target nucleic acid is amplified with biotinylated oligos. VirD2-dCas9 specifically binds the target sequence via dCas9 and covalently binds to a FAM-tagged oligonucleotide via VirD2. The biotin label and FAM tag are detected by a commercially available LFA.

33842190,In search of drugs to alleviate suppression of the host's innate immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular modeling approach.,"UNLABELLED: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel SARS-CoV-2 evade the host innate immunity, and subsequently the adaptive immune response, employing one protease called Papain-like protease (PLpro). The PLpro and the 3CL main protease are responsible for the cleavage of the polyproteins encoded by the + sense RNA genome of the virus to produce several non-structured proteins (NSPs). However, the PLpro also performs deubiquitination and deISGylation of host proteins and signaling molecules, and thus antagonize the host innate immune response, since ubiquitination and ISGylation are critical processes which invoke host's antiviral immune responses. Thus, to maintain host antiviral defense, inhibition of the PLpro is the primary therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, inhibition of the enzyme prevents replication of the virus. The present study employs molecular modeling approaches to determine potential of different approved and repurposed drugs and other compounds as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The results of the study demonstrated that drugs like Stallimycin, and known protease inhibitors including Telaprevir, Grazoprevir and Boceprevir, were highly potent in inhibiting the enzyme. In addition, several plant-derived polyphenols, including Corylifol A and Kazinol J, were found to be potent inhibitors. Based on the findings, we suggest that clinical trials be initiated with these inhibitors. So far, PLpro inhibition has been given less attention as a strategy to contain COVID-19 pandemic, and thus the present study is of high significance and has therapeutic implications in containing the pandemic.

MRI shows an ovoid lesion in the mid-splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), with signal-intensity anomaly similar to stroke but vanishing within few weeks. Although there are a lot of child MERS cases descriptions, there are just a few adult-onset reported. Our goal is to provide a better clinical and radiological description of this entity. We reported nine adult-onset cases of MERS managed in our stroke unit between 2017 and 2019. The study of our adult series suggests that epilepsy and the context of an infection are very common in MERS. Adult cases show frequent focal neurological deficits and few encephalopathies compared to children. The measurement of very low ADC values in SCC lesion is a new radiological feature of MERS that should be systematically assessed in suspected cases to differentiate this complex syndrome from SCC strokes.","['Grosset L', 'Hosseini H', 'Bapst B', 'Hodel J', 'Cleret De Langavant L', 'Faugeras F', 'Bachoud-Lévi AC', 'Seddik L']",2021,88,,Seizure,"Grosset L, et al.

Because the viral and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 share the similarities between SARS and MERS, CP treatment could be a promising treatment option to save COVID-19. With only low quality medical evidence, but massive media support and a very significant public demand for the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19, we are now faced with an ethical dilemma. Therefore, this paper uses a structured analysis that focuses on the preferred reporting items for a systematic review of ethical issues regarding the use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma must meet the ethical principles of autonomy; such as voluntary, informed consent, and confidentiality. Consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for potential donor recipients also needs to be considered in order to meet the beneficence and non-maleficence principles. The principle of justice also needs to be applied both to donors, donor recipients and health workers, such as determining the priority of donor recipients, due to the increasing demand for convalescent plasma amid the limited circumstances of patients who have recovered from Covid-19 who voluntarily donate.","['Munir MA', 'Tandiabang PA', 'Setyawati T', 'Basry A', 'Cyio AD', 'Rahman N']",2021,28,3,Transfus Clin Biol,"Munir MA, et al.

33839288,CRISPR-Cas systems for diagnosing infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a global health problem affecting billions of people. Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools. Recently devised CRISPR-technologies represent the unprecedented opportunity to reshape epidemiological surveillance and molecular diagnostics.","['Kostyusheva A', 'Brezgin S', 'Babin Y', 'Vasilyeva I', 'Glebe D', 'Kostyushev D', 'Chulanov V']",2022,203,,Methods,"Kostyusheva A, et al.

33829464,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and H1N1 vaccination: does a relationship between the two factors really exist? A retrospective analysis of a territorial cohort in Ferrara, Italy.","OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 has been compared with other strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with the flu viruses: all of them manifest themselves with respiratory symptoms and, although their genetic patterns are similar, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly reached global dimensions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus with greater spreading capacity, albeit less lethal. Compared with influenza viruses, coronaviruses have a longer incubation period and the patients with coronaviruses' syndromes develop more severe diseases requiring frequent hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The aim was to explore the relationships between seasonal influenza vaccination and coronavirus infection and to understand whether this hypothetic role by the flu vaccines modifies SARS-CoV-2 infection's outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we enrolled 952 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 448 were admitted to our two main hospitals in Ferrara territory, while the remaining 504 were isolated at home. We compared the group of patients who had been vaccinated for influenza in the previous 12 months to that of unvaccinated patients.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found for both the need for hospitalization and 30-day mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We found age to be the only independent risk factor for a worse 30-day prognosis, while gender, influenza vaccinations and age itself were independent risk factors for undergoing hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: In our groups of patients, we found a relationship between seasonal influenza vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age seems to be the main risk factor for short-term mortality in COVID-19 inpatients, while the influenza vaccination is, together with gender and age itself, a determining factor in predicting the need for hospitalization.","['Greco S', 'Bella A', 'Bonsi B', 'Fabbri N', 'Califano A', 'Morrone S', 'Chessa P', 'Pistolesi C', 'Zuliani G', 'De Motoli F', 'Manfredini R', 'De Giorgi A', 'Passaro A']",2021,25,6,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Greco S, et al.

The array is designed to measure immunoglobulin isotype and subtype levels in serum or plasma samples against each of the individual antigens printed on the array. We probed the COVAM with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) collected from 99 donors who recovered from a PCR+ confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results were analyzed using two computational approaches, a generalized linear model (glm) and random forest (RF) prediction model, to classify individual specimens as either Reactive or non-reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. A training set of 88 pre-COVID-19 specimens (PreCoV) collected in August 2019 and102 positive specimens from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 cases was used for these analyses. Results compared with an FDA emergency use authorized (EUA) SARS-CoV2 S1-based total Ig chemiluminescence immunoassay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and with a SARS-CoV-2 S1-S2 spike-based pseudovirus micro neutralization assay (SARS-CoV-2 reporter viral particle neutralization titration (RVPNT) showed high concordance between the three assays. Three CCP specimens that were negative by the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay were also negative by both COVAM and the RVPNT assay. Concordance between VITROS CoV2T and COVAM was 96%, VITROS CoV2T and RVPNT 93%, and RVPNT and COVAM 91%. The discordances were all weakly reactive samples near the cutoff threshold of the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay. The multiplex COVAM allows CCP to be grouped according to antibody reactivity patterns against 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Unsupervised K-means analysis, via the gap statistics, as well as hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three main clusters with distinct reactivity intensities and patterns. These patterns were not recapitulated by adjusting the VITROS CoV2T or RVPNT assay thresholds. Plasma classified by COVAM reactivity patterns offers potential to improve CCP therapeutic efficacy CoV2T alone. The use of a SARS-CoV-2 antigen array can qualify CCP for administration as a treatment for acute COVID-19, and interrogate vaccine immunogenicity and performance in preclinical, clinical studies, and routine vaccination to identify antibody responses predictive of protection from infection and disease.","['Assis R', 'Jain A', 'Nakajima R', 'Jasinskas A', 'Khan S', 'Davies H', 'Corash L', 'Dumont LJ', 'Kelly K', 'Simmons G', 'Stone M', 'Di Germanio C', 'Busch M', 'Felgner PL']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Assis R, et al.

The most advanced strategies have focused on modifications of technologies that were already under development for other viruses, such as SARS, MERS, and even Influenza. Classic and new technologies, such as inactivated and attenuated viruses (non-replicative and replicative), DNA and mRNA vaccines, and nanoparticles containing SARS-CoV-2 antigens, are some of the strategies currently investigated. Although there is a very high expectation for the effectiveness of the most advanced vaccine candidates, there are still no established correlates of protection. Previous experience in vaccine development for other pathogens shows that differences in vaccine formulation can result in diverse immune responses and consequently, different protective properties. Therefore the importance of continuing investigations on a broad range of strategies. Expertise in vaccine development in Brazil was refocused to the new coronavirus. Impressive collaboration between institutions will support further developments until we have available a safe, effective, and economically viable vaccine. Established competence and collaborations will allow preparedness for future challenges and can also be used to address local issues as neglected infectious diseases.","['Kanno AI', 'Barbosa MMF', 'Moraes L', 'Leite LCC']",2021,44,1 Suppl 1,Genet Mol Biol,"Kanno AI, et al.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, primarily involves the respiratory system with viral pneumonia as a predominant manifestation. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has various cardiovascular manifestations which increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases and conventional cardiovascular risk factors are predisposed for COVID-19 with worse prognosis. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury are endothelial dysfunction, diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis and increased angiotensin II levels. Hyperinflammation in the myocardium can result in acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The high level of cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides in the early course of COVID-19 reflects an acute myocardial injury. The complex association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular manifestations requires an in-depth understanding for appropriate management of these patients. Till the time a specific antiviral drug is available for COVID-19, treatment remains symptomatic.

33817671,"Outside-in induction of the IFITM3 trafficking system by infections, including SARS-CoV-2, in the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: IFITM3 is a viral restriction protein that enables sequestration of viral particles and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes. Recently, IFITM3 upregulation was found to induce gamma - secretase activity and the production of amyloid beta. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dysregulation of IFITM3-dependent pathways was present in neurons and peripheral immune cells donated by AD patients. As a secondary aim, we sought to determine whether these perturbations could be induced by viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) previously performed on publicly available transcriptomic data from tissues donated by AD patients were screened for enriched pathways containing IFITM3. Subsequently, signature containing IFITM3, derived from entorhinal cortex (EC) neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was screened for overlap with curated, publicly available, viral infection-induced gene signatures (including SARS-CoV-2).
RESULTS: GSEA determined that IFITM3 gene networks are significantly enriched both in CNS sites (entorhinal and hippocampal cortices) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) donated by AD patients. Overlap screening revealed that IFITM3 signatures are induced by several viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 (adjusted p-value <0.001; Enrichr Database).
DISCUSSION: A data-driven analysis of AD tissues revealed IFITM3 gene signatures both in the CNS and in peripheral immune cells. GSEA revealed that an IFITM3 derived gene signature extracted from EC/NFT neurons overlapped with those extracted from publicly available viral infection datasets, including SARS-CoV-2. Our results are in line with currently emerging evidence on IFITM3's role in AD, and SARS-CoV-2's potential contribution in the setting of an expanded antimicrobial protection hypothesis.","['Vavougios GD', 'Nday C', 'Pelidou SH', 'Gourgoulianis KI', 'Stamoulis G', 'Doskas T', 'Zarogiannis SG']",2021,14,,Brain Behav Immun Health,"Vavougios GD, et al.

33817623,Network bioinformatics analysis provides insight into drug repurposing for COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a health crisis worldwide. While developing novel drugs and vaccines is long, repurposing existing drugs against COVID-19 can yield treatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter clinical trials. In this study, we present a novel network-based drug repurposing platform to identify candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of the initial outbreak, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 was lacking, but based on its similarity with other viruses, we sought to identify repurposing candidates to be tested rapidly at the clinical or preclinical levels. We first analyzed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed SARS as the closest virus by genome similarity, followed by MERS and other human coronaviruses. Using text mining and database searches, we obtained 34 COVID-19-related genes to seed the construction of a molecular network where our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules, and 78 drugs to repurpose. Based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potentially repurposable drugs against COVID-19 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide). Our work shows how in silico repurposing analyses can yield testable candidates to accelerate the response to novel disease outbreaks.","['Li X', 'Yu J', 'Zhang Z', 'Ren J', 'Peluffo AE', 'Zhang W', 'Zhao Y', 'Wu J', 'Yan K', 'Cohen D', 'Wang W']",2021,10,,Med Drug Discov,"Li X, et al.

33816542,The Looming Effects of Estrogen in Covid-19: A Rocky Rollout.,"In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, an intensive number of studies have been performed to understand in a deeper way the mechanisms behind better or worse clinical outcomes. Epidemiologically, men subjects are more prone to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections than women, with a similar scenario being also stated to the previous coronavirus diseases, namely, SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus diseases (MERS-CoV) in 2012. In addition, and despite that aging is regarded as an independent risk factor for the severe form of the disease, even so, women protection is evident. In this way, it has been expected that sex hormones are the main determinant factors in gender differences, with the immunomodulatory effects of estrogen in different viral infections, chiefly in Covid-19, attracting more attention as it might explain the case-fatality rate and predisposition of men for Covid-19 severity. Here, we aim to provide a mini-review and an overview on the protective effects of estrogen in Covid-19. Different search strategies were performed including Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Pubmed, and Google Scholar database to find relative studies. Findings of the present study illustrated that women have a powerful immunomodulating effect against Covid-19 through the effect of estrogen. This study illustrates that estrogens have noteworthy anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory effects in Covid-19. Also, estrogen hormone reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through modulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. This study highlighted the potential protective effect of estrogen against Covid-19 and recommended for future clinical trial and prospective studies to elucidate and confirm this protective effect.","['Al-Kuraishy HM', 'Al-Gareeb AI', 'Faidah H', 'Al-Maiahy TJ', 'Cruz-Martins N', 'Batiha GE']",2021,8,,Front Nutr,"Al-Kuraishy HM, et al.

The list includes several incidents from the past, such as measles, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), etc. The latest edition to this is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of August 18, 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 21 million people from 180 + countries with 0.7 million deaths across the globe. Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of pathogens, their virulence, evolution, and rate of mutation, etc. To date, more than 83,000 viral genomes have been deposited in public repositories, such as GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the third most affected country by COVID-19, with 2.7 million cases and > 53,000 deaths. Gujarat is the 11th highest affected state with a 3.48% death rate compared to the national average of 1.91%. In this study, a total of 502 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat were sequenced and analyzed to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the world to understand its role in pathogenesis. Among the missense mutations present in the Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T (Ser194Leu) had an allele frequency of 47.62 and 7.25% in deceased patients from the Gujarat and global datasets, respectively. In contrast, the allele frequency of 35.16 and 3.20% was observed in recovered patients from the Gujarat and global datasets, respectively.

Compounding this problem is the post-viral lung sequela that may be expected after COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to both SARS and MERS. Although chest imaging may play a role in the diagnosis of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfection or relapse of COVID-19 will have similar imaging findings. A ""new-baseline"" imaging can be obtained from COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge or clinical recovery. This new reference can not only determine if readmissions are from relapse or reinfection of COVID-19, resolving COVID-19 or potentially a different viral infection (influenza), but also for long term sequela of COVID-19 lung infection. Strategic use of imaging before discharge may be helpful in the subset of the population at the highest risk of a secondary viral infection such as influenza.

While battling for the disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed.

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is reported to originate in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spreading rapidly around world. SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to the other coronaviruses, causing the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), both binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. ACE 2 is widely expressed in several cells including, neural tissue. COVID-19 presents with fever and respiratory symptoms, possibly leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS) but there are several published reports of acute cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, isolated involvement of cranial nerves, myositis/rabdhomyolisis as well myasthenic crisis (MC) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The ARDS described during COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with respiratory muscle failure occurring in myasthenia gravis (MG), may result in a life-threatening condition, challenging for intensivists, pulmonologists and neurologists. Infections are recognized trigger of exacerbations and crisis in MG and patients with MG probably exhibit a mortality higher than the general population during this COVID-19 pandemic.

33810391,An Overview of Current Knowledge of Deadly CoVs and Their Interface with Innate Immunity.,"Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic RNA viruses, whose infection can lead to mild or lethal respiratory tract disease. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries, infecting 8089 individuals and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries, with a mortality rate of ~34%. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and has spread to 220 countries, infecting over 100,000,000 people and causing more than 2,000,000 deaths to date. These three human coronaviruses cause diseases of varying severity. Most people develop mild, common cold-like symptoms, while some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The success of all viruses, including coronaviruses, relies on their evolved abilities to evade and modulate the host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory immune responses. However, we still do not fully understand the transmission, phylogeny, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Despite the rapid application of a range of therapies for SARS-CoV-2, such as convalescent plasma, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and type I interferon, no fully effective treatment has been determined. Remarkably, COVID-19 vaccine research and development have produced several offerings that are now been administered worldwide. Here, we summarise an up-to-date understanding of epidemiology, immunomodulation and ongoing anti-viral and immunosuppressive treatment strategies. Indeed, understanding the interplay between coronaviruses and the anti-viral immune response is crucial to identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention, which may even prove invaluable for the control of future emerging coronavirus.","['Zhang Y', 'Gargan S', 'Lu Y', 'Stevenson NJ']",2021,13,4,Viruses,"Zhang Y, et al.

In 2003, after nucleic acid genotyping, a new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). After nine years, another coronavirus emerged in the middle east and was named MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus). Finally, in December 2019, a new unknown coronavirus was isolated from a cluster of patients and was named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019). This review aims to propose a complete overview of autopsy in the three coronaviruses over the past two decades, showing its pivotal role in the management of unknown diseases. A total of 116 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 14 studies were collected concerning SARS-CoV (87 autopsy reports, from Asian and American countries), 2 studies for MERS-CoV (2 autopsy reports, from Middle-East Asian countries), and 100 studies on SARS-CoV-2 (930 autopsy reports). Analyzing the data obtained on COVID-19, based on the country criterion, a large number of post-mortem investigation were performed in European countries (580 reports), followed by American countries (251 reports). It is interesting to note that no data were found from the Oceanic countries, maybe because of the minor involvement of the outbreak. In all cases, autopsy provided much information about each unknown coronavirus. Despite advanced technologies in the diagnostic fields, to date, autopsy remains the gold standard method to understand the biological features and the pathogenesis of unknown infections, especially when awareness of a pathogen is restricted and the impact on the healthcare system is substantial.

Thus, investigation of the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics, especially by agent-based modeling, would be meaningful for devising intervention strategies for novel infectious diseases. In this study, an agent-based model on MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea in 2015 was built and analyzed. The prominent characteristic of this model was that it built the simulation environment based on the real-world contact tracing network, which can be characterized as being scale-free. In the simulations, we explored the effectiveness of three possible intervention scenarios; mass quarantine, isolation, and isolation combined with acquaintance quarantine. The differences in MERS-CoV transmission dynamics by the number of links of the index case agent were examined. The simulation results indicate that isolation combined with acquaintance quarantine is more effective than others, and they also suggest the key role of super-spreaders in MERS-CoV transmission.","['Kim Y', 'Ryu H', 'Lee S']",2021,18,7,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Kim Y, et al.

They not only cause serious human and animal deaths, but also cause serious public health problems worldwide. Currently, seven species are known to infect humans, namely SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) structure is similar to the 5'-end capping system of mRNA used by eukaryotic hosts and plays a vital role in evading host immunity response and protects the nascent viral mRNA from degradation. NSP16 is also well-conserved among related coronaviruses and requires its binding partner NSP10 to activate its enzymatic activity. With the continued threat of viral emergence highlighted by human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, mutant strains continue to appear, affecting the highly conserved NSP16: this provides a possible therapeutic approach applicable to any novel coronavirus. To this end, current information on the 2'-O-MTase activity mechanism, the differences between NSP16 and NSP10 in human coronaviruses, and the current potential prevention and treatment strategies related to NSP16 are summarized in this review.","['Chang LJ', 'Chen TH']",2021,13,4,Viruses,Chang LJ and Chen TH.

33804896,Concentrated Secretome of Adipose Stromal Cells Limits Influenza A Virus-Induced Lung Injury in Mice.,"Despite vaccination and antivirals, influenza remains a communicable disease of high burden, with limited therapeutic options available to patients that develop complications. Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of Adipose Stromal Cell (ASC) concentrated secretome (CS), generated by process adaptable to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. We demonstrate that ASC-CS limits pulmonary histopathological changes, infiltration of inflammatory cells, protein leak, water accumulation, and arterial oxygen saturation (spO2) reduction in murine model of lung infection with influenza A virus (IAV) when first administered six days post-infection. The ability to limit lung injury is sustained in ASC-CS preparations stored at -80 °C for three years. Priming of the ASC with inflammatory factors TNFα and IFNγ enhances ASC-CS ability to suppress lung injury. IAV infection is associated with dramatic increases in programmed cell death ligand (PDL1) and angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) levels. ASC-CS application significantly reduces both PDL1 and Angpt2 levels. Neutralization of PDL1 with anti-mouse PDL1 antibody starting Day6 onward effectively ablates lung PDL1, but only non-significantly reduces Angpt2 release. Most importantly, late-phase PDL1 neutralization results in negligible suppression of protein leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that suppression of PDL1 does not play a critical role in ASC-CS therapeutic effects.","['Bogatcheva NV', 'Coleman ME']",2021,10,4,Cells,Bogatcheva NV and Coleman ME.

33800363,Towards Quantitative and Standardized Serological and Neutralization Assays for COVID-19.,"Quantitative and robust serology assays are critical measurements underpinning global COVID-19 response to diagnostic, surveillance, and vaccine development. Here, we report a proof-of-concept approach for the development of quantitative, multiplexed flow cytometry-based serological and neutralization assays. The serology assays test the IgG and IgM against both the full-length spike antigens and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. Benchmarking against an RBD-specific SARS-CoV IgG reference standard, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer was quantified in the range of 37.6 µg/mL to 31.0 ng/mL. The quantitative assays are highly specific with no correlative cross-reactivity with the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses. We further demonstrated good correlation between anti-RBD antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers. The suite of serology and neutralization assays help to improve measurement confidence and are complementary and foundational for clinical and epidemiologic studies.","['Tian L', 'Elsheikh EB', 'Patrone PN', 'Kearsley AJ', 'Gaigalas AK', 'Inwood S', 'Lin-Gibson S', 'Esposito D', 'Wang L']",2021,22,5,Int J Mol Sci,"Tian L, et al.

33798507,Role of phytoconstituents in the management of COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a severe global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the most threatening transmissible disease. As a great threat to global public health, the development of treatment options has become vital, and a rush to find a cure has mobilized researchers globally from all areas.
SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review focuses on deciphering the potential of different secondary metabolites from medicinal plants as therapeutic options either as inhibitors of therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 or as blockers of viral particles entry through host cell receptors. The use of medicinal plants containing specific phytomoieties could be seen in providing a safer and long-term solution for the population with lesser side effects. Key Findings and Conclusions: Considering the high cost and time-consuming drug discovery process, therapeutic repositioning of existing drugs was explored as treatment option in COVID-19, however several molecules have been retracted as therapeutics either due to no positive outcomes or the severe side effects. These effects call for exploring the alternate treatment options which are therapeutically effective as well as safe. Keeping this in mind, phytopharmaceuticals derived from medicinal plants could be explored as important resources in the development of COVID-19 treatment, as their role in the past for treatment of viral diseases like HIV, MERS-CoV, and influenza has been well reported. Considering this fact, different phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides etc. Possessing antiviral properties against coronaviruses and possessing potential against SARS-CoV-2 have been reviewed in the present work.","['Das A', 'Pandita D', 'Jain GK', 'Agarwal P', 'Grewal AS', 'Khar RK', 'Lather V']",2021,341,,Chem Biol Interact,"Das A, et al.

33797351,The Role of Obesity in the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 Respiratory Disease and Critical Illness.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the clinical syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a global health pandemic with substantial morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 has cast a shadow on nearly every aspect of society, straining health systems and economies across the world. Although it is widely accepted that a close relationship exists between obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders on infection, we are only beginning to understand ways in which the immunological sequelae of obesity functions as a predisposing factor related to poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. As both the innate and adaptive immune systems are each primed by obesity, the alteration of key pathways results in both an immunosuppressed and hyperinflammatory state. The present review will discuss the cellular and molecular immunology of obesity in the context of its role as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, discuss the role of cytokine storm, and draw parallels to prior viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and 2009 H1N1.","['Kuperberg SJ', 'Navetta-Modrov B']",2021,65,1,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,Kuperberg SJ and Navetta-Modrov B.

In January of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic owing to its global spread. Because no studies have investigated COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this study investigated similarities and differences between demographic data during the COVID-19 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients' charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region. MERS and COVID-19 exhibited similar threats to the lives of adults and the elderly, despite lower mortality rates during the COVID-19 epidemic. Targeted prevention of and interventions against MERS should be allocated populations according to the areas where they inhabit. However, much more information regarding the dynamics and epidemiology of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia is needed.","['Mohamed RAEH', 'Abdullah Thagfan F']",2021,16,1,Libyan J Med,Mohamed RAEH and Abdullah Thagfan F.

33796130,Network Analysis and Transcriptome Profiling Identify Autophagic and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Analyzing host cells' transcriptional response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will help delineate biological processes underlying viral pathogenesis. First, analysis of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 and Calu3 revealed upregulation of antiviral interferon signaling genes in response to all three SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, or influenza A virus (IAV) infections. However, perturbations in expression of genes involved in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Next, a validation study in infected human nasopharyngeal samples also revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes. Specifically, mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, lysosome acidification, and mitochondrial fission promoting genes were concurrently downregulated in both infected cell lines and human samples. SARS-CoV-2 infection impeded autophagic flux either by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29, and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Finally, age-stratified SARS-CoV-2-positive human data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon-stimulated genes, and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling. Together, this analysis has revealed specific aspects of autophagic and mitochondrial function that are uniquely perturbed in SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells.","['Singh K', 'Chen YC', 'Hassanzadeh S', 'Han K', 'Judy JT', 'Seifuddin F', 'Tunc I', 'Sack MN', 'Pirooznia M']",2021,12,,Front Genet,"Singh K, et al.

The case of COVID-19 was reported in the Hubei province of Wuhan city in Central China at the end of December 2019 and it is suspected that the sea food market played a role in this outbreak which was closed abruptly. Subsequently, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern was declared on 30 January 2020 by the World Health Organization. Both SARS and MERS corona viruses had its reservoir in bats and were transferred to humans from palm civets and camels respectively. This virus can be transmitted through airborne droplets. Natural reservoir and intermediate host of COVID-19 is yet to be identified. This paper reviews the occurrences of viral diseases in the recent times including SARS and MERS. As an addition to this, the paper will contain a detailed examination of the COVID-19 Pandemic.","['Chathappady House NN', 'Palissery S', 'Sebastian H']",2021,14,,Microbiol Insights,"Chathappady House NN, et al.

33794150,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential.,"Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between 20 and 30 proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle, including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2'-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? Although experimentally derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over 1 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16's conformational ensemble to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models, we investigate whether Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","['Vithani N', 'Ward MD', 'Zimmerman MI', 'Novak B', 'Borowsky JH', 'Singh S', 'Bowman GR']",2021,120,14,Biophys J,"Vithani N, et al.

33791293,Coronavirus-Induced Host Cubic Membranes and Lipid-Related Antiviral Therapies: A Focus on Bioactive Plasmalogens.,"Coronaviruses have lipid envelopes required for their activity. The fact that coronavirus infection provokes the formation of cubic membranes (CM) (denoted also as convoluted membranes) in host cells has not been rationalized in the development of antiviral therapies yet. In this context, the role of bioactive plasmalogens (vinyl ether glycerophospholipids) is not completely understood. These lipid species display a propensity for non-lamellar phase formation, facilitating membrane fusion, and modulate the activity of membrane-bound proteins such as enzymes and receptors. At the organism level, plasmalogen deficiency is associated with cardiometabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. A straight link is perceived with the susceptibility of such patients to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) infection, the severity of illness, and the related difficulty in treatment. Based on correlations between the coronavirus-induced modifications of lipid metabolism in host cells, plasmalogen deficiency in the lung surfactant of COVID-19 patients, and the alterations of lipid membrane structural organization and composition including the induction of CM, we emphasize the key role of plasmalogens in the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV) entry and replication in host cells. Considering that plasmalogen-enriched lung surfactant formulations may improve the respiratory process in severe infected individuals, plasmalogens can be suggested as an anti-viral prophylactic, a lipid biomarker in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and a potential anti-viral therapeutic component of lung surfactant development for COVID-19 patients.","['Deng Y', 'Angelova A']",2021,9,,Front Cell Dev Biol,Deng Y and Angelova A.

33790900,Machine Learning Analysis of Naïve B-Cell Receptor Repertoires Stratifies Celiac Disease Patients and Controls.,"Celiac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune disorder caused by an abnormal immune response to dietary gluten proteins. The disease has high heritability. HLA is the major susceptibility factor, and the HLA effect is mediated via presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ variants to CD4+ T cells. In addition to gluten-specific CD4+ T cells the patients have antibodies to transglutaminase 2 (autoantigen) and deamidated gluten peptides. These disease-specific antibodies recognize defined epitopes and they display common usage of specific heavy and light chains across patients. Interactions between T cells and B cells are likely central in the pathogenesis, but how the repertoires of naïve T and B cells relate to the pathogenic effector cells is unexplored. To this end, we applied machine learning classification models to naïve B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires from CeD patients and healthy controls. Strikingly, we obtained a promising classification performance with an F1 score of 85%. Clusters of heavy and light chain sequences were inferred and used as features for the model, and signatures associated with the disease were then characterized. These signatures included amino acid (AA) 3-mers with distinct bio-physiochemical characteristics and enriched V and J genes. We found that CeD-associated clusters can be identified and that common motifs can be characterized from naïve BCR repertoires. The results may indicate a genetic influence by BCR encoding genes in CeD. Analysis of naïve BCRs as presented here may become an important part of assessing the risk of individuals to develop CeD. Our model demonstrates the potential of using BCR repertoires and in particular, naïve BCR repertoires, as disease susceptibility markers.","['Shemesh O', 'Polak P', 'Lundin KEA', 'Sollid LM', 'Yaari G']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Shemesh O, et al.

33790874,Emergence of Bat-Related Betacoronaviruses: Hazard and Risks.,"The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with more than 111 million reported cases and 2,500,000 deaths worldwide (mortality rate currently estimated at 2.2%), is a stark reminder that coronaviruses (CoV)-induced diseases remain a major threat to humanity. COVID-19 is only the latest case of betacoronavirus (β-CoV) epidemics/pandemics. In the last 20 years, two deadly CoV epidemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; fatality rate 9.6%) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; fatality rate 34.7%), plus the emergence of HCoV-HKU1 which causes the winter common cold (fatality rate 0.5%), were already a source of public health concern. Betacoronaviruses can also be a threat for livestock, as evidenced by the Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) epizootic in pigs. These repeated outbreaks of β-CoV-induced diseases raise the question of the dynamic of propagation of this group of viruses in wildlife and human ecosystems. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-HKU1 emerged in Asia, strongly suggesting the existence of a regional hot spot for emergence. However, there might be other regional hot spots, as seen with MERS-CoV, which emerged in the Arabian Peninsula. β-CoVs responsible for human respiratory infections are closely related to bat-borne viruses. Bats are present worldwide and their level of infection with CoVs is very high on all continents. However, there is as yet no evidence of direct bat-to-human coronavirus infection. Transmission of β-CoV to humans is considered to occur accidentally through contact with susceptible intermediate animal species. This zoonotic emergence is a complex process involving not only bats, wildlife and natural ecosystems, but also many anthropogenic and societal aspects. Here, we try to understand why only few hot spots of β-CoV emergence have been identified despite worldwide bats and bat-borne β-CoV distribution. In this work, we analyze and compare the natural and anthropogenic environments associated with the emergence of β-CoV and outline conserved features likely to create favorable conditions for a new epidemic. We suggest monitoring South and East Africa as well as South America as these regions bring together many of the conditions that could make them future hot spots.","['Frutos R', 'Serra-Cobo J', 'Pinault L', 'Lopez Roig M', 'Devaux CA']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Frutos R, et al.

As of the present, the SARS-CoV-2-borne disease is propagating in almost all countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in an unprecedented way. As the name suggests, the novel coronavirus, widely known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging human pathogen. A novel disease of relatively unknown origin, COVID-19 does not seem to be amenable to the currently available medicines since there is no specific cure for the disease. In the absence of any vaccine or effective antiviral medication, we have no tools at our disposal, but the method of quarantine, be it domestic or institutional, to hinder any further progression of this outbreak. However, there is a record of physicians in the past who practiced convalescent blood transfusion. To their awe, the method seemed to be useful. It is anticipated that these contemporary methods will outdo any other vaccination process in the time being, as blood transfusion is instead a cost-effective and time-friendly technique. Following a successful trial, this new approach of contemporary nature to a viral disease may serve as an emergency intervention to intercept infectious outbreaks and prevent an impending epidemic/pandemic. In this review, we document the most recent evidence regarding the efficiency of convalescent plasma and serum therapy on SARS, MERS, and particularly COVID-19, while discussing potential advantages and possible risks of such practice.","['Sheervalilou R', 'Shirvaliloo M', 'Sargazi S', 'Bahari S', 'Saravani R', 'Shahraki J', 'Shirvalilou S', 'Shahraki O', 'Nazarlou Z', 'Shams Z', 'Ghaznavi H']",2022,51,1,Blood Purif,"Sheervalilou R, et al.

33787851,OMAmer: tree-driven and alignment-free protein assignment to subfamilies outperforms closest sequence approaches.,"MOTIVATION: Assigning new sequences to known protein families and subfamilies is a prerequisite for many functional, comparative and evolutionary genomics analyses. Such assignment is commonly achieved by looking for the closest sequence in a reference database, using a method such as BLAST. However, ignoring the gene phylogeny can be misleading because a query sequence does not necessarily belong to the same subfamily as its closest sequence. For example, a hemoglobin which branched out prior to the hemoglobin alpha/beta duplication could be closest to a hemoglobin alpha or beta sequence, whereas it is neither. To overcome this problem, phylogeny-driven tools have emerged but rely on gene trees, whose inference is computationally expensive.
RESULTS: Here, we first show that in multiple animal and plant datasets, 18-62% of assignments by closest sequence are misassigned, typically to an over-specific subfamily. Then, we introduce OMAmer, a novel alignment-free protein subfamily assignment method, which limits over-specific subfamily assignments and is suited to phylogenomic databases with thousands of genomes. OMAmer is based on an innovative method using evolutionarily informed k-mers for alignment-free mapping to ancestral protein subfamilies. Whilst able to reject non-homologous family-level assignments, we show that OMAmer provides better and quicker subfamily-level assignments than approaches relying on the closest sequence, whether inferred exactly by Smith-Waterman or by the fast heuristic DIAMOND.

33786420,Impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 cases and mortalities in major cities of Pakistan.,"INTRODUCTION: Climate factors play an important role in the transmission of viruses, such as influenza viruses, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1. This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered-Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
METHOD: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths.
RESULT: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a -3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found.
CONCLUSION: This study signifies the effect of climate factors on COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate, but climate factors are not the only variable and several other interlinked factors enhance the spread of COVID-19. Hence, effective mitigation policies, enhancing testing capacities, and developing public attitudes toward adopting precautionary measures are important to overcome this overwhelming pandemic.","['Basray R', 'Malik A', 'Waqar W', 'Chaudhry A', 'Wasif Malik M', 'Ali Khan M', 'Ansari JA', 'Ikram A']",2021,3,1,J Biosaf Biosecur,"Basray R, et al.

33786369,Drug Repurposing of Itraconazole and Estradiol Benzoate against COVID-19 by Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Mediated Membrane Fusion.,"SARS-CoV-2 caused the emerging epidemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). To date, there are more than 82.9 million confirmed cases worldwide, there is no clinically effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conserved properties of the membrane fusion domain of the spike (S) protein across SARS-CoV-2 make it a promising target to develop pan-CoV therapeutics. Herein, two clinically approved drugs, Itraconazole (ITZ) and Estradiol benzoate (EB), are found to inhibit viral entry by targeting the six-helix (6-HB) fusion core of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Further studies shed light on the mechanism that ITZ and EB can interact with the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of the spike protein, to present anti-SARS-CoV-2 infections in vitro, indicating they are novel potential therapeutic remedies for COVID-19 treatment. Furthermore, ITZ shows broad-spectrum activity targeting 6-HB in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S protein, inspiring that ITZ have the potential for development as a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor.","['Yang C', 'Pan X', 'Huang Y', 'Cheng C', 'Xu X', 'Wu Y', 'Xu Y', 'Shang W', 'Niu X', 'Wan Y', 'Li Z', 'Zhang R', 'Liu S', 'Xiao G', 'Xu W']",2021,4,5,Adv Ther (Weinh),"Yang C, et al.

33785117,Protection From COVID-19–The Efficacy of Face Masks.,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread to nearly every country in the world. The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate.
METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account.
RESULTS: When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 μM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A metaanalysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions).
CONCLUSION: It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARSCoV- 2.","['Hemmer CJ', 'Hufert F', 'Siewert S', 'Reisinger E']",2021,118,5,Dtsch Arztebl Int,"Hemmer CJ, et al.

33782990,"Comprehensive comparative genomic and microsatellite analysis of SARS, MERS, BAT-SARS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread around the globe very rapidly. Previously, the evolution pattern and similarity among the COVID-19 causative organism severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causative organisms of other similar infections have been determined using a single type of genetic marker in different studies. Herein, the SARS-CoV-2 and related β coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV,  bat coronavirus (BAT-CoV) were comprehensively analyzed using a custom-built pipeline that employed phylogenetic approaches based on multiple types of genetic markers including the whole genome sequences, mutations in nucleotide sequences, mutations in protein sequences, and microsatellites. The whole-genome sequence-based phylogeny revealed that the strains of SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to the BAT-CoV strains. The mutational analysis showed that on average MERS-CoV and BAT-CoV genomes differed at 134.21 and 136.72 sites, respectively, whereas the SARS-CoV genome differed at 26.64 sites from the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the microsatellite analysis highlighted a relatively higher number of average microsatellites for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (106.8 and 107, respectively), and a lower number for SARS-CoV and BAT-CoV (95.8 and 98.5, respectively). Collectively, the analysis of multiple genetic markers of selected β viral genomes revealed that the newly born SARS-COV-2 is closely related to BAT-CoV, whereas, MERS-CoV is more distinct from the SARS-CoV-2 than BAT-CoV and SARS-CoV.","['Rehman HA', 'Ramzan F', 'Basharat Z', 'Shakeel M', 'Khan MUG', 'Khan IA']",2021,93,7,J Med Virol,"Rehman HA, et al.

Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed.
RESULTS: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19, irrespective of its transmissibility, produces a lower CFR compared with that of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, although COVID-19 has infected eight times more countries than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, and caused a higher number of deaths. The nation-wide lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus may be reconsidered, given the hardships for the population and their impact on the economic system.","['Sreedharan J', 'Nair SC', 'Muttappallymyalil J', 'Gopakumar A', 'Eapen NT', 'Satish KP', 'Manda V']",2022,30,11,Z Gesundh Wiss,"Sreedharan J, et al.

In order to reduce the disease spread, 16 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) again SARS-CoV-2 were generated by immunized mice with the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO). A colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip was developed with two McAbs to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can play a potential role in monitoring vaccine quality. The strip is highly specific, detecting only SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and does not show any non-specific reactions with syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other coronavirus and influenza viruses. The strip detected subunit vaccine in our laboratory with a detection limit of spike protein of 62.5 ng/mL.

Four sets of high quality filtered preprocessed reads were generated (two quality scores and two sequenced lengths) and assembled with Mira, Ray and Trinity algorithms. The sixty-four generated assemblies were refined, filtered and evaluated for their proteomic quality. Eight assemblies presented top Detonate scores but one was selected due to its compactness and biological representation, which was generated: (i) from the highest quality dataset (Q20L100), (ii) using Trinity algorithm with all k-mers (AtKa), (iii) removing redundancy by CD-HIT (RR80), and (iv) filtering out poor contigs (F), that was subsequently named Q20L100AtKaRR80F.

33766078,"Association of the host genetic factors, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild influenza in an Iranian population.","BACKGROUND: Variation in host genetic factors may result in variation in the host immune response to the infection. Some chronic diseases may also affect individuals' susceptibility to infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the host genetic factors mostly involved in inflammation, as well as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild flu in an Iranian population.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 93 patients referred to primary care centers of Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan provinces (central Iran) due to flu-like symptoms between March 2015 and December 2018. Of these, PCR test identified 49 influenza A/H1N1 and 44 flu-negative individuals. Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RPAIN, FCGR2A, MBL-2, CD55, C1QBP, IL-10, TNF-α and an unknown gene were genotyped using iPLEX GOLD SNP genotyping analysis. Hypercholesterolemia and diabetes status was determined based on the physician diagnosis. Association of the host genetic variants, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild A/H1N1 flu was assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis as implemented in Stata software (v.14). Statistical tests were considered as significant at 0.05 levels.
RESULTS: Frequency of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, as well as participants mean age was significantly higher in the flu-negative rather than the flu-positive group. Of 12 SNPs, nine did not show any significant association with mild flu in our study (rs1801274, rs1800451, rs2564978, rs361525, rs1800450, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs1800629). Possessing G vs. A allele in two SNPs (rs3786054 and rs8070740) was associated with a threefold increase in the chance of mild flu when compared to flu-negative patients (95% CI: 1.1, 22.0). Possessing C allele (vs. A) in the rs9856661 locus also increased the chance of mild flu up to 2 folds (95% CI: 1.0, 10.0).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that possessing the G allele in either rs3786054 or rs8070740 loci in C1QBP and RPAIN genes, respectively, increased the risk of H1N1 infection up to 3.3 folds, regardless of the patient's age, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Complementary functional genomic studies would shed more light on the underlying mechanism of human immunity associated with these genetic markers. The identified genetic factors may have the same role in susceptibility to similar respiratory infections with RNA viruses, like SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Future genetic association studies targeting these RNA viruses, especially COVID-19 is recommended. Studies on other ethnic groups would also shed light on possible ethnic variations in genetic susceptibility to respiratory RNA viruses.

33763851,International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review.,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements.
MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","['Burns J', 'Movsisyan A', 'Stratil JM', 'Biallas RL', 'Coenen M', 'Emmert-Fees KM', 'Geffert K', 'Hoffmann S', 'Horstick O', 'Laxy M', 'Klinger C', 'Kratzer S', 'Litwin T', 'Norris S', 'Pfadenhauer LM', 'von Philipsborn P', 'Sell K', 'Stadelmaier J', 'Verboom B', 'Voss S', 'Wabnitz K', 'Rehfuess E']",2021,3,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Burns J, et al.

33763734,Peptide substrate screening for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay.,"The novel corona (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a global pandemic, which motivates researchers to develop reliable and effective methods for screening and detection of SARS-CoV-2. Though there are several methods available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 such as RT-PCR and ELSIA, nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming and may not apply at the point of care. In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7 ± 3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal. A significant change in the fluorescence signal with patient samples indicates that this FRET-based assay might be applied for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Different studies have shown that antiviral measures including small bioactive compounds targeting multifaceted molecular communications take in COVID-19 infection. The drug development archived in this review emphasizes mainly on drugs that are effective for the Management of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and other RNA viruses. The investigation of therapeutic agents for COVID-19 includes anti-inflammatory agents, antibodies, and nucleic acid-based treatments targeting virus gene expression as well as different sorts of vaccines. Numerous patents revealed techniques of these biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may apply to COVID-19.

33758849,Comparative host interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 and human coronavirus homologs.,"Human coronaviruses have become an increasing threat to global health; three highly pathogenic strains have emerged since the early 2000s, including most recently SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.","['Almasy KM', 'Davies JP', 'Plate L']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Almasy KM, et al.

33757279,"Identification and characterization of circRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.","The life-threatening coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-1/2) have caused and will continue to cause enormous morbidity and mortality to humans. Virus-encoded noncoding RNAs are poorly understood in coronaviruses. Data mining of viral-infection-related RNA-sequencing data has resulted in the identification of 28 754, 720 and 3437 circRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. MERS-CoV exhibits much more prominent ability to encode circRNAs in all genomic regions than those of SARS-CoV-1/2. Viral circRNAs typically exhibit low expression levels. Moreover, majority of the viral circRNAs exhibit expressions only in the late stage of viral infection. Analysis of the competitive interactions of viral circRNAs, human miRNAs and mRNAs in MERS-CoV infections reveals that viral circRNAs up-regulated genes related to mRNA splicing and processing in the early stage of viral infection, and regulated genes involved in diverse functions including cancer, metabolism, autophagy, viral infection in the late stage of viral infection. Similar analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infections reveals that its viral circRNAs down-regulated genes associated with metabolic processes of cholesterol, alcohol, fatty acid and up-regulated genes associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress in the late stage of viral infection. A few genes regulated by viral circRNAs from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in several biological processes such as response to reactive oxygen and centrosome localization. This study provides the first glimpse into viral circRNAs in three deadly coronaviruses and would serve as a valuable resource for further studies of circRNAs in coronaviruses.","['Cai Z', 'Lu C', 'He J', 'Liu L', 'Zou Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhu Z', 'Ge X', 'Wu A', 'Jiang T', 'Zheng H', 'Peng Y']",2021,22,2,Brief Bioinform,"Cai Z, et al.

33754134,Effects of environmental variability on superspreading transmission events in stochastic epidemic models.,"Superspreaders (individuals with a high propensity for disease spread) have played a pivotal role in recent emerging and re-emerging diseases. In disease outbreak studies, host heterogeneity based on demographic (e.g. age, sex, vaccination status) and environmental (e.g. climate, urban/rural residence, clinics) factors are critical for the spread of infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Transmission rates can vary as demographic and environmental factors are altered naturally or due to modified behaviors in response to the implementation of public health strategies. In this work, we develop stochastic models to explore the effects of demographic and environmental variability on human-to-human disease transmission rates among superspreaders in the case of Ebola and MERS. We show that the addition of environmental variability results in reduced probability of outbreak occurrence, however the severity of outbreaks that do occur increases. These observations have implications for public health strategies that aim to control environmental variables.","['Shakiba N', 'Edholm CJ', 'Emerenini BO', 'Murillo AL', 'Peace A', 'Saucedo O', 'Wang X', 'Allen LJS']",2021,6,,Infect Dis Model,"Shakiba N, et al.

33754123,Therapeutic role of corticosteroids in COVID-19: a systematic review of registered clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 as a global pandemic. Though antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs are considered treatment options for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific antivirals are currently available for its treatment. Efficient use of drug discovery approaches including repurposing or repositioning of drugs used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is considered recently. The widespread application of corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 should be backed with careful documented pragmatic research of its use in this context.
MAIN BODY: This article aims to analyze various trials registered across the globe providing an overall picture of the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19. An extensive search was conducted on the clinical trial registries around the world to identify all the trials reporting information regarding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Our initial search returned 231 trials, out of which 60 trials were finally included in the analysis. Fifty-six studies were interventional trials, and all the trials had clearly defined primary and secondary outcomes of interest, of which only 11 trials had evaluation of respiratory rate as one of their outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Few preliminary trial findings show promising results and recommend the use of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in the severe form of the disease; however, there is insufficient data to prove its benefits over its risks. Routine use of corticosteroids should be favored only after a better insight is obtained, with the completion of these trials.","['Raju R', 'V P', 'Biatris PS', 'J SJUC']",2021,7,1,Futur J Pharm Sci,"Raju R, et al.

33751621,The next-generation coronavirus diagnostic techniques with particular emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2.,"The potential zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) are of global health concerns. Early diagnosis is the milestone in their mitigation, control, and eradication. Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false-negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine-tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high-throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces, should be given considerable attention in the future.

33750978,"A quantitative model used to compare within-host SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV dynamics provides insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2-3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","['Kim KS', 'Ejima K', 'Iwanami S', 'Fujita Y', 'Ohashi H', 'Koizumi Y', 'Asai Y', 'Nakaoka S', 'Watashi K', 'Aihara K', 'Thompson RN', 'Ke R', 'Perelson AS', 'Iwami S']",2021,19,3,PLoS Biol,"Kim KS, et al.

33750951,Demonstrating the utility of flexible sequence queries against indexed short reads with FlexTyper.,"Across the life sciences, processing next generation sequencing data commonly relies upon a computationally expensive process where reads are mapped onto a reference sequence. Prior to such processing, however, there is a vast amount of information that can be ascertained from the reads, potentially obviating the need for processing, or allowing optimized mapping approaches to be deployed. Here, we present a method termed FlexTyper which facilitates a ""reverse mapping"" approach in which high throughput sequence queries, in the form of k-mer searches, are run against indexed short-read datasets in order to extract useful information. This reverse mapping approach enables the rapid counting of target sequences of interest. We demonstrate FlexTyper's utility for recovering depth of coverage, and accurate genotyping of SNP sites across the human genome. We show that genotyping unmapped reads can correctly inform a sample's population, sex, and relatedness in a family setting. Detection of pathogen sequences within RNA-seq data was sensitive and accurate, performing comparably to existing methods, but with increased flexibility. We present two examples of ways in which this flexibility allows the analysis of genome features not well-represented in a linear reference. First, we analyze contigs from African genome sequencing studies, showing how they distribute across families from three distinct populations. Second, we show how gene-marking k-mers for the killer immune receptor locus allow allele detection in a region that is challenging for standard read mapping pipelines. The future adoption of the reverse mapping approach represented by FlexTyper will be enabled by more efficient methods for FM-index generation and biology-informed collections of reference queries. In the long-term, selection of population-specific references or weighting of edges in pan-population reference genome graphs will be possible using the FlexTyper approach.

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2' cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue differences, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater.

33743371,Combating COVID-19: The role of drug repurposing and medicinal plants.,"BACKGROUND: A novel corona virus-2 disease has spread to 213 countries and territories across the globe. The corona pandemic has claimed more than 548,934 deaths worldwide till the evening of 8th of July 2020 and the number of confirmed cases is increasing at an alarming rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find a treatment or a vaccine for COVID-19 at the earliest. The aim of this mini-review is to give an overview of identified repurposed anti-COVID-19 drugs which are currently under clinical trials.
METHODS: A thorough literature survey was done to retrieve relevant information using various web based search engines such as Google, Google scholar, and various other electronic research databases such as PubMed, Medline, MeSh etc. The findings of the recently published articles, clinical trials, COVID-19 update by World Health Organization etc., and the opinion of the authors is summarized in this brief review. The antiviral medicinal plants were identified based on their use in Chinese/Indian indigenous systems of medicine, traditional use, published scientific phytochemical studies and/or their effectiveness against upper respiratory infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
RESULTS: The disease is just over six months old and effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents are yet to be developed for COVID-19. Thus, in the absence of an effective therapy, scientific community has rationally considered the drug repurposing approach for the development of anti COVID-19 drugs. Various studies and clinical trials involving antimalarial drugs, anti-HIV drugs, anti-hepatitis drugs, anti-parasitic drug, anti-inflammatory drugs, the combination of antimalarial and macrolide antibiotic and few other molecules identified through drug repurposing are currently underway to combat COVID-19. Due emphasis is also given to develop novel corona vaccines for the prophylaxis and to identify drugs for adjunct/supportive therapy. Several medicinal plants along with their major phytochemicals exhibiting antiviral activity are identified for further exploration. It is anticipated that these natural products might also play an important role in combating COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of drug repurposing strategy to develop anti COVID-19 drugs and exploring antiviral medicinal plants as adjunct or supportive therapy appears to be a viable option. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to work in parallel on different strategies such as genetic engineering, in silico approach, herbal remedies and drug repositioning to achieve the common goal of finding a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 at the earliest.","['Khan SA', 'Al-Balushi K']",2021,14,4,J Infect Public Health,Khan SA and Al-Balushi K.

33741992,Human endogenous retrovirus-enveloped baculoviral DNA vaccines against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2.,"Here we report a recombinant baculoviral vector-based DNA vaccine system against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2). A non-replicating recombinant baculovirus expressing the human endogenous retrovirus envelope gene (AcHERV) was constructed as a DNA vaccine vector for gene delivery into human cells. For MERS-CoV vaccine construction, DNA encoding MERS-CoV S-full, S1 subunit, or receptor-binding domain (RBD) was inserted into the genome of AcHERV. For COVID19 vaccine construction, DNA encoding SARS-CoV2 S-full or S1 or a MERS-CoV NTD domain-fused SARS-CoV2 RBD was inserted into the genome of AcHERV. AcHERV-DNA vaccines induce high humoral and cell-mediated immunity in animal models. In challenge tests, twice immunized AcHERV-MERS-S1 and AcHERV-COVID19-S showed complete protection against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, respectively. Unlike AcHERV-MERS vaccines, AcHERV-COVID19-S provided the greatest protection against SARS-CoV2 challenge. These results support the feasibility of AcHERV-MERS or AcHERV-COVID19 vaccines in preventing pandemic spreads of viral infections.","['Cho H', 'Jang Y', 'Park KH', 'Choi H', 'Nowakowska A', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim M', 'Kang MH', 'Kim JH', 'Shin HY', 'Oh YK', 'Kim YB']",2021,6,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Cho H, et al.

Here, we combined antigen optimization and nanoparticle display to develop vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. We first displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on three self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. We then identified heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in S2 as the cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2GΔHR2), and displayed S2GΔHR2 on SApNPs. An antibody column specific for the RBD enabled tag-free vaccine purification. In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P). S2GΔHR2 elicited twofold higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2GΔHR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T cell immunity, thereby providing a promising vaccine candidate.","['He L', 'Lin X', 'Wang Y', 'Abraham C', 'Sou C', 'Ngo T', 'Zhang Y', 'Wilson IA', 'Zhu J']",2021,7,12,Sci Adv,"He L, et al.

33736798,A novel One-pot rapid diagnostic technology for COVID-19.,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing global pandemic associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. RT-qPCR has become the diagnostic standard for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in most countries. COVID-19 diagnosis generally relies upon RT-qPCR-mediated identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is costly, labor-extensive, and requires specialized training and equipment. Herein, we established a novel one-tube rapid diagnostic approach based upon formamide and colorimetric RT-LAMP (One-Pot RT-LAMP) that can be used to diagnose COVID-19 without the extraction of specific viral RNA. The technique could visually detect SARS-CoV-2 within 45 min with a limit of detection of 5 copies per reaction in extracted RNA, and about 7.66 virus copies per μL in viral transport medium. The One-Pot RT-LAMP test showed a high specificity without cross-reactivity with 12 viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human infectious influenza virus (H1N1/H3N2 of influenza A and B virus, ect. We validated this One-Pot RT-LAMP approach by its successful use for the analysis of 45 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples, yielding results identical to those of traditional RT-qPCR analyses, while achieving good selectivity and sensitivity relative to a commercial RT-qPCR approach. As such, this One-Pot RT-LAMP technology may be a valid means of conducting high-sensitivity, low-cost and rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification without the extraction of viral RNA.","['Li J', 'Hu X', 'Wang X', 'Yang J', 'Zhang L', 'Deng Q', 'Zhang X', 'Wang Z', 'Hou T', 'Li S']",2021,1154,,Anal Chim Acta,"Li J, et al.

33735777,Mental associations with COVID-19 and how they relate with self-reported protective behaviors: A national survey in the United States.,"RATIONALE: To understand novel diseases, patients may draw comparisons to other diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether mentally associating specific diseases with COVID-19 was related to self-reported protective behaviors early in the pandemic.
METHODS: In March 2020, a national sample of 6534 U.S. adults listed diseases that came to mind when thinking of COVID-19. They self-reported protective behaviors, demographics, and COVID-19 risk perceptions.
RESULTS: Participants associated COVID-19 with common infectious diseases like seasonal influenza (59%), common cold (11%), and pneumonia (10%), or emergent infectious diseases like pandemic influenza (28%), SARS/MERS (27%), and Ebola (14%). Seasonal influenza was most commonly mentioned, in all demographic groups. Participants mentioning seasonal influenza or common cold reported fewer protective behaviors. Those mentioning pneumonia or emergent infectious diseases reported more protective behaviors. Mentioning pneumonia, SARS/MERS, and Ebola was associated with the most protective behaviors, after accounting for other generated diseases, demographics, and risk perceptions (e.g., for avoiding crowds, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.26, 1.83; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.46; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.52, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Early in the pandemic, most participants mentally associated COVID-19 with seasonal flu, which may have undermined willingness to protect themselves. To motivate behavior change, COVID-19 risk communications may need to mention diseases that resonate with people while retaining accuracy.","['Bruine de Bruin W', 'Carman KG', 'Parker AM']",2021,275,,Soc Sci Med,"Bruine de Bruin W, et al.

A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a recent respiratory syndrome epidemic in humans. In December 2019, the sudden emergence of this new coronavirus and the subsequent severe disease it causes created a serious global health threat and hazards. This is in contrast to the two aforementioned coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (in 2002) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV (in 2012), which were much more easily contained. The World Health Organization (WHO) dubbed this contagious respiratory disease an ""epidemic outbreak"" in March 2020.

To date, six authorized vaccines have been registered. Up till now, no approved drugs and drug scientists are racing from development to clinical trials to find new drugs for COVID-19. Wild animals, such as snakes, bats, and pangolins are the main sources of coronaviruses, as determined by the sequence homology between MERS-CoV and viruses in these animals. Human infection is caused by inhalation of respiratory droplets. To date, the only available treatment protocol for COVID-19 is based on the prevalent clinical signs.

33732659,Exogenous Coronavirus Interacts With Endogenous Retrotransposon in Human Cells.,"There is an increased global outbreak of diseases caused by coronaviruses affecting respiratory tracts of birds and mammals. Recent dangerous coronaviruses are MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory illness and even failure of several organs. However, profound impact of coronavirus on host cells remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung-derived cells, and observed that infection of these coronaviruses all induced increase of retrotransposon expression with upregulation of TET genes. Upregulation of retrotransposon was also observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected human intestinal organoids. Retrotransposon upregulation may lead to increased genome instability and enhanced expression of genes with readthrough from retrotransposons. Therefore, people with higher basal level of retrotransposon such as cancer patients and aged people may have increased risk of symptomatic infection. Additionally, we show evidence supporting long-term epigenetic inheritance of retrotransposon upregulation. We also observed chimeric transcripts of retrotransposon and SARS-CoV-2 RNA for potential human genome invasion of viral fragments, with the front and the rear part of SARS-CoV-2 genome being easier to form chimeric RNA. Thus, we suggest that primers and probes for nucleic acid detection should be designed in the middle of virus genome to identify live virus with higher probability. In summary, we propose our hypothesis that coronavirus invades human cells and interacts with retrotransposon, eliciting more severe symptoms in patients with underlying diseases. In the treatment of patients with coronavirus infection, it may be necessary to pay more attention to the potential harm contributed by retrotransposon dysregulation.","['Yin Y', 'Liu XZ', 'He X', 'Zhou LQ']",2021,11,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Yin Y, et al.

COVID-19, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are all caused by members of the Coronaviridae family. As expected, emerging genetic and clinical evidence from patients with COVID-19 has indicated that the pathway of infection is similar to that of SARS and MERS. Additionally, much like SARS and MERS, chest imaging serves an important role in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with COVID-19. Although these related viruses present a similar pneumonic pathogenesis, the imaging results have distinguishable features. The current review evaluated the imaging results of patients with SARS and MERS and explored the potential similarities and differences among patients with COVID-19, SARS and MERS at early, progressive, severe and recovery stages, with the aim of improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infections by comparing the features of COVID-19 images with those of SARS and MERS. The current review assessed whether imaging results had implications for the administration of corticosteroids as treatment for COVID-19. Whether corticosteroids can inhibit inflammatory cytokine storms and reduce the mortality of patients with viral pneumonia remains controversial. However, his review may help radiologists and clinicians to identify viral pneumonia and guide appropriate COVID-19 treatment.","['Chen Y', 'Guo L', 'Jiao Y', 'Fan F', 'Liu J', 'Chen M', 'Yuan H', 'Lin L', 'Wang Y']",2021,21,4,Exp Ther Med,"Chen Y, et al.

33732251,SARS-CoV-2 Causes a Different Cytokine Response Compared to Other Cytokine Storm-Causing Respiratory Viruses in Severely Ill Patients.,"Hyper-induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, also known as a cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is one of the key aspects of the currently ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This process occurs when a large number of innate and adaptive immune cells activate and start producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. It is one of the factors contributing to the mortality observed with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) for a subgroup of patients. CRS is not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 infection; it was prevalent in most of the major human coronavirus and influenza A subtype outbreaks of the past two decades (H5N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H7N9). With a comprehensive literature search, we collected changing the cytokine levels from patients upon infection with the viral pathogens mentioned above. We analyzed published patient data to highlight the conserved and unique cytokine responses caused by these viruses. Our curation indicates that the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is different compared to other CRS-causing respiratory viruses, as SARS-CoV-2 does not always induce specific cytokines like other coronaviruses or influenza do, such as IL-2, IL-10, IL-4, or IL-5. Comparing the collated cytokine responses caused by the analyzed viruses highlights a SARS-CoV-2-specific dysregulation of the type-I interferon (IFN) response and its downstream cytokine signatures.

Structural studies show exposed sites on the spike trimer that might be targeted by antibodies with cross-species specificity. Here we isolated two human monoclonal antibodies from immunized humanized mice that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct spike proteins of betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both cross-reactive antibodies target the stem helix in the spike S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike, forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle. Both antibodies block MERS-CoV infection in cells and provide protection to mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge in prophylactic and/or therapeutic models.

33728484,"Eosinophils and COVID-19: diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccination strategies.","The unprecedented impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in global challenges to our health-care systems and our economic security. As such, there has been significant research into all aspects of the disease, including diagnostic biomarkers, associated risk factors, and strategies that might be used for its treatment and prevention. Toward this end, eosinopenia has been identified as one of many factors that might facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of severe COVID-19. However, this finding is neither definitive nor pathognomonic for COVID-19. While eosinophil-associated conditions have been misdiagnosed as COVID-19 and others are among its reported complications, patients with pre-existing eosinophil-associated disorders (e.g., asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease; interestingly, several recent studies suggest that a diagnosis of asthma may be associated with some degree of protection. Finally, although vaccine-associated aberrant inflammatory responses, including eosinophil accumulation in the respiratory tract, were observed in preclinical immunization studies targeting the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, no similar complications have been reported clinically in response to the widespread dissemination of either of the two encapsulated mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19.","['Rosenberg HF', 'Foster PS']",2021,43,3,Semin Immunopathol,"Rosenberg HF and Foster PS.

33728324,Immunoinformatics and Molecular Docking Studies Predicted Potential Multiepitope-Based Peptide Vaccine and Novel Compounds against Novel SARS-CoV-2 through Virtual Screening.,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses which have club-like spikes at the surface with a unique replication process. Coronaviruses are categorized as major pathogenic viruses causing a variety of diseases in birds and mammals including humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions). Nowadays, a new strain of coronaviruses is identified and named as SARS-CoV-2. Multiple cases of SARS-CoV-2 attacks are being reported all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 showed high death rate; however, no specific treatment is available against SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: In the current study, immunoinformatics approaches were employed to predict the antigenic epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 for the development of the coronavirus vaccine. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and B-cell epitopes were predicted for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protein. Multiple sequence alignment of three genomes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) was used to conserved binding domain analysis.
RESULTS: The docking complexes of 4 CTL epitopes with antigenic sites were analyzed followed by binding affinity and binding interaction analyses of top-ranked predicted peptides with MHC-I HLA molecule. The molecular docking (Food and Drug Regulatory Authority library) was performed, and four compounds exhibiting least binding energy were identified. The designed epitopes lead to the molecular docking against MHC-I, and interactional analyses of the selected docked complexes were investigated. In conclusion, four CTL epitopes (GTDLEGNFY, TVNVLAWLY, GSVGFNIDY, and QTFSVLACY) and four FDA-scrutinized compounds exhibited potential targets as peptide vaccines and potential biomolecules against deadly SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A multiepitope vaccine was also designed from different epitopes of coronavirus proteins joined by linkers and led by an adjuvant.
CONCLUSION: Our investigations predicted epitopes and the reported molecules that may have the potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings can be a step towards the development of a peptide-based vaccine or natural compound drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","['Waqas M', 'Haider A', 'Rehman A', 'Qasim M', 'Umar A', 'Sufyan M', 'Akram HN', 'Mir A', 'Razzaq R', 'Rasool D', 'Tahir RA', 'Sehgal SA']",2021,2021,,Biomed Res Int,"Waqas M, et al.

33727906,Determining the correlation between comorbidities and MERS-CoV mortality in Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVE: As of January 2020, there were 2,519 confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases with 866 deaths across 27 countries. Most of these cases (2,121) were reported in Saudi Arabia. Since the initial identification of MERS, few studies have investigated the role of comorbidities that could potentially lead to mortality in cases of the infectious disease. This study aimed to examine the association between comorbidities and MERS mortality in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study. We retrieved the data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 2017 and November 2019, and analysed the association between comorbidities and mortality.
RESULTS: We found 572 MERS-CoV cases reported by WHO in Saudi Arabia during the defined period. Of these, 387 (68%) had a history of chronic illness. The overall mortality rate was found to be 25%. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent comorbidity-the mortality rate in the diabetics was 32% as opposed to 12% in the non-diabetics (
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that MERS-CoV had a significant case fatality rate in patients with comorbidities. Thus, it will be beneficial if future clinical trials for MERS-CoV examine the impact of improved societal infection control measures such as social distancing and masks, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the prevalence and incidence of MERS and its clinical outcomes.","['Alotaibi MH', 'Bahammam SA']",2021,16,4,J Taibah Univ Med Sci,Alotaibi MH and Bahammam SA.

33727169,"Mutations in SARS-CoV-2; Consequences in structure, function, and pathogenicity of the virus.","The third pandemic of coronavirus infection, called COVID-19 disease, began recently in China. The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60-140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26-32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.","['Bakhshandeh B', 'Jahanafrooz Z', 'Abbasi A', 'Goli MB', 'Sadeghi M', 'Mottaqi MS', 'Zamani M']",2021,154,,Microb Pathog,"Bakhshandeh B, et al.

33726663,Exploring short k-mer profiles in cells and mobile elements from Archaea highlights the major influence of both the ecological niche and evolutionary history.,"BACKGROUND: K-mer-based methods have greatly advanced in recent years, largely driven by the realization of their biological significance and by the advent of next-generation sequencing. Their speed and their independence from the annotation process are major advantages. Their utility in the study of the mobilome has recently emerged and they seem a priori adapted to the patchy gene distribution and the lack of universal marker genes of viruses and plasmids. To provide a framework for the interpretation of results from k-mer based methods applied to archaea or their mobilome, we analyzed the 5-mer DNA profiles of close to 600 archaeal cells, viruses and plasmids. Archaea is one of the three domains of life. Archaea seem enriched in extremophiles and are associated with a high diversity of viral and plasmid families, many of which are specific to this domain. We explored the dataset structure by multivariate and statistical analyses, seeking to identify the underlying factors.
RESULTS: For cells, the 5-mer profiles were inconsistent with the phylogeny of archaea. At a finer taxonomic level, the influence of the taxonomy and the environmental constraints on 5-mer profiles was very strong. These two factors were interdependent to a significant extent, and the respective weights of their contributions varied according to the clade. A convergent adaptation was observed for the class Halobacteria, for which a strong 5-mer signature was identified. For mobile elements, coevolution with the host had a clear influence on their 5-mer profile. This enabled us to identify one previously known and one new case of recent host transfer based on the atypical composition of the mobile elements involved. Beyond the effect of coevolution, extrachromosomal elements strikingly retain the specific imprint of their own viral or plasmid taxonomic family in their 5-mer profile.
CONCLUSION: This specific imprint confirms that the evolution of extrachromosomal elements is driven by multiple parameters and is not restricted to host adaptation. In addition, we detected only recent host transfer events, suggesting the fast evolution of short k-mer profiles. This calls for caution when using k-mers for host prediction, metagenomic binning or phylogenetic reconstruction.","['Bize A', 'Midoux C', 'Mariadassou M', 'Schbath S', 'Forterre P', 'Da Cunha V']",2021,22,1,BMC Genomics,"Bize A, et al.

They caused a large number of casualties and a wider psychological crisis, which might cause severe consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.
AIMS: To reveal the law of formation of public psychological crisis in public health emergencies, and draw lessons from it. To provide ideas for effectively deal with these psychological crisis problems and fundamentally curbing the occurrence of public health emergencies.
METHOD: Through the method of literature research, 'public health incidents', 'psychological crisis', 'mental health', 'psychological intervention', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'MERS', 'EVD', and 'COVID-19' were used to search literatures in the databases such as PubMed, Springer, and Sciencedirect, and the literatures were summarized, sorted, and studied.
RESULTS: (1) The public health emergencies caused a universal psychological crisis. The main manifestations were depression, compulsion, despair, etc. The people involved mainly include patients, suspected isolated patients, medical staff, and the general public in the epidemic situation. (2) People's psychological state often experienced stress stage, shock stage, acceptance, and reorganization. Only some susceptible individuals couldn't complete effective psychological reconstruction, resulting in serious psychological disorders. Individual susceptibility is related to genetic factors, adversity, and traumatic stimuli experienced in early life.

They have many strain-dependent properties, which affect the final product. Here, we explored the use of machine learning to create systematic, high-throughput screening methods for these properties. Fast acidification of milk is such a strain-dependent property. To predict the maximum hourly acidification rate (Vmax), we trained Random Forest (RF) models on four different genomic representations: Presence/absence of gene families, counts of Pfam domains, the 8 nucleotide long subsequences of their DNA (8-mers), and the 9 nucleotide long subsequences of their DNA (9-mers). Vmax was measured at different temperatures, volumes, and in the presence or absence of yeast extract. These conditions were added as features in each RF model. The four models were trained on 257 strains, and the correlation between the measured Vmax and the predicted Vmax was evaluated with Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PC) on a separate dataset of 85 strains. The models all had high PC scores: 0.83 (gene presence/absence model), 0.84 (Pfam domain model), 0.76 (8-mer model), and 0.85 (9-mer model). The models all based their predictions on relevant genetic features and showed consensus on systems for lactose metabolism, degradation of casein, and pH stress response. Each model also predicted a set of features not found by the other models.","['Karlsen ST', 'Vesth TC', 'Oregaard G', 'Poulsen VK', 'Lund O', 'Henderson G', 'Bælum J']",2021,16,3,PLoS One,"Karlsen ST, et al.

Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available  and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.","['Anifandis G', 'Tempest HG', 'Oliva R', 'Swanson GM', 'Simopoulou M', 'Easley CA', 'Primig M', 'Messini CI', 'Turek PJ', 'Sutovsky P', 'Ory SJ', 'Krawetz SA']",2021,67,1,Syst Biol Reprod Med,"Anifandis G, et al.

33717193,Two Different Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) Risks for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies.,"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) disease severity and stages varies from asymptomatic, mild flu-like symptoms, moderate, severe, critical, and chronic disease. COVID-19 disease progression include lymphopenia, elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs, immune dysregulation, cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), etc. Development of vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus has been difficult to create due to vaccine induced enhanced disease responses in animal models. Multiple betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 expand cellular tropism by infecting some phagocytic cells (immature macrophages and dendritic cells) via antibody bound Fc receptor uptake of virus. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be involved in the clinical observation of increased severity of symptoms associated with early high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients. Infants with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 may also have ADE caused by maternally acquired SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells. ADE risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for COVID-19 and MIS-C treatments, B-cell vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy for patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to mast cells may be involved in MIS-C and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) following initial COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bound to Fc receptors on macrophages and mast cells may represent two different mechanisms for ADE in patients. These two different ADE risks have possible implications for SARS-CoV-2 B-cell vaccines for subsets of populations based on age, cross-reactive antibodies, variabilities in antibody levels over time, and pregnancy. These models place increased emphasis on the importance of developing safe SARS-CoV-2 T cell vaccines that are not dependent upon antibodies.",['Ricke DO'],2021,12,,Front Immunol,Ricke DO.

It uses predefined k-mers to retrieve only the reads of interest from the FASTQ file and calls genotypes by aligning retrieved reads locally. KATK does not use data about known polymorphisms and has NC (no call) as the default genotype. The reference or variant allele is called only if there is sufficient evidence for their presence in data. Thus it is not biased against rare variants or de-novo mutations. With simulated datasets, we achieved a false-negative rate of 0.23% (sensitivity 99.77%) and a false discovery rate of 0.19%.

33711082,A novel cell culture system modeling the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition. This powerful tool should accelerate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and its antiviral development.","['Ju X', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Li J', 'Zhang J', 'Gong M', 'Ren W', 'Li S', 'Zhong J', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang QC', 'Zhang R', 'Ding Q']",2021,17,3,PLoS Pathog,"Ju X, et al.

The virus is a member of the Coronavirus family, which includes viruses that cause common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). MERS and SARS are known by causing adverse events in pregnancy. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is a new infection agent, little is known about the risk of its infection to human embryo/fetal development. However, SARS and MERS were associated with negative outcomes, such as miscarriage, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal death. Here, we raise concerns and possibilities related the harmful potential of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to pregnancy, discussing symptoms, immunological changes during pregnancy, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate (and the risks related to it). Finally, we point out recommendations to be performed by the scientific community and health care workers in order to identify and to manage potential risks to pregnant women and their babies.","['Vianna FSL', 'Fraga LR', 'Abeche AM', 'Silva AAD', 'Sanseverino MTV', 'Schuler-Faccini L']",2021,44,1 Suppl 1,Genet Mol Biol,"Vianna FSL, et al.

In the past, other Coronaviruses have also been found to cause human infection, but not as widespread as COVID-19. Since Coronavirus sequences constantly change due to mutation and recombination, it is important to understand the pattern of changes and likely path the virus can take in the future. In this study, we have used the Shewhart control chart to identify and analyze hypervariable (hotspots) and hypovariable (coldspots) regions of the virus. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has changed in a few regions of the genome. Analysis of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS sequences suggests that over time, mutations start accumulating in different regions and most likely SARS-CoV-2 may also follow a similar path. The results suggest a possible emergence of modified viruses over some time.","['Mandal S', 'Roychowdhury T', 'Bhattacharya A']",2021,46,1,J Biosci,"Mandal S, et al.

Therefore, timely detection, treatment, isolation and prevention of spreading the pandemic infectious diseases not beyond the originated town is critical to avoid global impairment of life (e.g., Corona virus disease - 2019, COVID-19). The objective of this review article is to emphasize the recent advancements in the electrochemical diagnostics of twelve life-threatening viruses namely - COVID-19, Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza, Hepatitis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), Zika virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya, Dengue, and Rotavirus. This review describes the design, principle, underlying rationale, receptor, and mechanistic aspects of sensor systems reported for such viruses. Electrochemical sensor systems which comprised either antibody or aptamers or direct/mediated electron transfer in the recognition matrix were explicitly segregated into separate sub-sections for critical comparison. This review emphasizes the current challenges involved in translating laboratory research to real-world device applications, future prospects and commercialization aspects of electrochemical diagnostic devices for virus detection. The background and overall progress provided in this review are expected to be insightful to the researchers in sensor field and facilitate the design and fabrication of electrochemical sensors for life-threatening viruses with broader applicability to any desired pathogens.","['Goud KY', 'Reddy KK', 'Khorshed A', 'Kumar VS', 'Mishra RK', 'Oraby M', 'Ibrahim AH', 'Kim H', 'Gobi KV']",2021,180,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Goud KY, et al.

Many viral surface proteins exist as trimers that transition from a pre-fusion state when key NAb epitopes are exposed to a post-fusion form in which the potential for virus-cell fusion no longer exists. For optimal vaccine performance, these viral proteins are often engineered to enhance stability and presentation of these NAb epitopes. The method involves the structure-guided introduction of proline residues at key positions that maintain the trimer in the pre-fusion configuration. We review how this technique emerged during HIV-1 Env vaccine development and its subsequent wider application to other viral vaccines including SARS-CoV-2.","['Sanders RW', 'Moore JP']",2021,29,3,Cell Host Microbe,Sanders RW and Moore JP.

33693556,Compact and evenly distributed k-mer binning for genomic sequences.,"MOTIVATION: The processing of k-mers (subsequences of length k) is at the foundation of many sequence processing algorithms in bioinformatics, including k-mer counting for genome size estimation, genome assembly, and taxonomic classification for metagenomics. Minimizers-ordered m-mers where m < k-are often used to group k-mers into bins as a first step in such processing. However, minimizers are known to generate bins of very different sizes, which can pose challenges for distributed and parallel processing, as well as generally increase memory requirements. Furthermore, although various minimizer orderings have been proposed, their practical value for improving tool efficiency has not yet been fully explored.
RESULTS: We present Discount, a distributed k-mer counting tool based on Apache Spark, which we use to investigate the behaviour of various minimizer orderings in practice when applied to metagenomics data. Using this tool, we then introduce the universal frequency ordering, a new combination of frequency-sampled minimizers and universal k-mer hitting sets, which yields both evenly distributed binning and small bin sizes. We show that this ordering allows Discount to perform distributed k-mer counting on a large dataset in as little as 1/8 of the memory of comparable approaches, making it the most efficient out-of-core distributed k-mer counting method available.

33692906,Unification and extensive diversification of M/Orf3-related ion channel proteins in coronaviruses and other nidoviruses.,"The coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has emphasized the need for a better understanding of the evolution of virus-host interactions. ORF3a in both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are ion channels (viroporins) implicated in virion assembly and membrane budding. Using sensitive profile-based homology detection methods, we unify the SARS-CoV ORF3a family with several families of viral proteins, including ORF5 from MERS-CoVs, proteins from beta-CoVs (ORF3c), alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), most importantly, the Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs, and more distant homologs from other nidoviruses. We present computational evidence that these viral families might utilize specific conserved polar residues to constitute an aqueous pore within the membrane-spanning region. We reconstruct an evolutionary history of these families and objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins of CoVs and Toroviruses. We also show that the divergent ORF3 clade (ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF3c/ORF5 families) represents a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a hypothesis for their role in virion assembly of CoVs, ToroVs, and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly and membrane budding. We show that M and ORF3 are under different evolutionary pressures; in contrast to the slow evolution of M as core structural component, the ORF3 clade is under selection for diversification, which suggests it might act at the interface with host molecules and/or immune attack.","['Tan Y', 'Schneider T', 'Shukla PK', 'Chandrasekharan MB', 'Aravind L', 'Zhang D']",2021,7,1,Virus Evol,"Tan Y, et al.

This paper helps explain Korea's pre-existing capabilities which enabled the rapid and effective implementation of its COVID-19 control strategies. A systematic assessment across multiple domains demonstrates that South Korea's advantages in controlling its epidemic are owed tremendously to legal and organizational reforms enacted after the MERS outbreak in 2015. Successful implementation of the Korean strategy required more than just a set of actions, measures and policies. It relied on a pre-existing legal framework, financing arrangements, governance and a workforce experienced in outbreak management.","['Yoo KJ', 'Kwon S', 'Choi Y', 'Bishai DM']",2021,125,5,Health Policy,"Yoo KJ, et al.

To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants.

33688554,Identification and Development of Therapeutics for COVID-19.,"After emerging in China in late 2019, the novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide and as of early 2021, continues to significantly impact most countries. Only a small number of coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two are associated with the severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairly rapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeutic interventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immune response to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have proved beneficial to identifying approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A number of potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant COVID-19 illness were rapidly identified, leading to a large number of clinical trials investigating a variety of possible therapeutic approaches being initiated early on in the pandemic. As a result, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and many other therapeutics remain under investigation. Here, we describe a range of approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, along with their proposed mechanisms of action and the current status of clinical investigation into each candidate.

While the infection with human CoV is commonly associated with mild respiratory symptoms, the emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the potential for CoVs to cause severe respiratory and systemic disease. The devastating global health burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spawned countless studies seeking clinical correlates of disease severity and host susceptibility factors, revealing a complex network of antiviral immune circuits. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is, like SARS-CoV-2, a beta-CoV and is endemic in wild mice. Laboratory MHV strains have been extensively studied to reveal coronavirus virulence factors and elucidate host mechanisms of antiviral immunity.

33686978,Post-COVID lung fibrosis: The tsunami that will follow the earthquake.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected in excess of 50 million people worldwide and resulted in 1.2 million deaths. While the majority of those infected will not have long-term pulmonary sequelae, 5%-10% will develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The natural history of these severely affected patients is unclear at present, but using our knowledge of closely related coronavirus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), we would hypothesize that the majority will stabilize or improve over time although some patients will progress to advanced lung fibrosis or post-COVID interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD). Unlike the SARS and MERS outbreaks which affected only a few thousands, the sheer scale of the present pandemic suggests that physicians are likely to encounter large numbers of patients (potentially hundreds of thousands) with PC-ILD. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, natural history, and radiology of such patients and touch on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic clues at presentation which might help predict the future development of lung fibrosis. Finally, we discuss the responsible use of antifibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone, nintedanib, and some newer antifibrotics, still in the pipeline. The biological rationale of these drugs and the patient groups where they may have a plausible role will be discussed. We conclude by stressing the importance of careful longitudinal follow-up of multiple cohorts of post-COVID survivors with serial lung function and imaging.

The present review attempted to figure out the update on this effective vaccine and discussed the other promising vaccines.
RECENT FINDINGS: A range of investigations on the SARS-CoV-2 genomics, on its similarities with SARS-CoV-1, and with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been accomplished and the host immune dodging mechanisms by the SARS-CoV-2 have been unraveled which in turn led the scientists around the world to work rigorously on the vaccine development. Working with various vaccine platforms so far revealed the efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine as the most effective one as resulted through the clinical trials which resulted in 95% positive output.
SUMMARY: Although currently commercialized mRNA-1273 vaccine appears to be effective, still several points are to be pondered regarding the sustainability of vaccine efficacy against the rising variants of SARS-CoV-2.",['Noor R'],2021,8,3,Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,Noor R.

Previous epidemic caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 is also considered since both the coronaviruses resulted in the similar clinical complications. The outbreak caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 had a low rate of disease transmission and death cases. Modes of entry by MERS and SARS coronaviruses are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, except MERS-CoV utilize different receptor. They all belong to the lineage C of β-coronavirus. Based on the information from the previous reports, the present review is mainly focused on the mechanisms of disease progression by each of these viruses in association to their strategies to escape the host immunity. The viral entry is the first step of pathogenesis associated with attachment of viral spike protein with host receptor help releasing the viral RNA into the host cell.

33680620,The COVID-19 Sequelae: A Cross-Sectional Evaluation of Post-recovery Symptoms and the Need for Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Survivors.,"Background  As of January 19, 2021, around two million fatalities and 68 million recoveries from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. The past pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) hint toward a risk of occurrence of ""Long-COVID"" syndrome, i.e., the persistence of post-discharge symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. With the scarcity of literature addressing post-COVID-19 manifestations and little regard for the stigma associated with this disease, survivors' rehabilitation remains widely neglected. The current study aims to assess the prevalence and characteristics of post-COVID-19 manifestations and their effect on the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 recovered individuals. We have also analyzed the relationship of time since the recovery of COVID-19 and its severity with the post-discharge symptoms. The stigma affiliated with the infection of SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also been highlighted. Methodology A descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted from September 2020 to December 2020 among 158 COVID-19 recovered patients, whose information was obtained from Dow Diagnostic Laboratory, Ojha Campus, Karachi, Pakistan. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: sociodemographic data, post-COVID-19 manifestations, questions relating to the stigma, and the QoL of the recovered COVID-19 patients. We used the EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire to assess the QoL, while the modified BG Prasad Socioeconomic Classification updated for 2019 was employed to determine the socioeconomic status of the participants. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were presented in the form of frequencies and percentages. Results An overwhelming majority (94.9%) experienced at least one post-COVID-19 symptom, with fatigue (82.9%) being the most prevalent post-discharge manifestation. We observed a significant correlation of post-COVID-19 symptoms with gender, age, and time since recovery. COVID-19 severity was found to be significantly related to the five dimensions of the QoL. A significant difference in EuroQol Visual Analog Scale health score was observed between the participants with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection (p < 0.001). Besides, the associated stigma with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be more prevalent in the participants belonging to the upper class as compared to the other classes (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, we also observed a significant association of disease severity with post-COVID-19 manifestations and pre-existing comorbidities. Conclusions The long-COVID syndrome is similar to the post-discharge manifestations of the survivors of prior pandemics of SARS and MERS. Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation teams, healthcare workers, and the general population should recognize the need for systematic assessment of their recovery and further rehabilitation.","['Iqbal A', 'Iqbal K', 'Arshad Ali S', 'Azim D', 'Farid E', 'Baig MD', 'Bin Arif T', 'Raza M']",2021,13,2,Cureus,"Iqbal A, et al.

A primary concern in these outbreaks is the extent of mutations in the CoV, and the content of viral variation that can be determined only by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We aimed to develop a time efficient WGS protocol, using universal primers spanning the entire MERS-CoV genome. MERS and synthetic Neoromicia capensis bat CoV genomes were successfully amplified using our developed PCR primer set and sequenced with MinION. All experimental and analytical processes took 6 h to complete and were also applied to synthetic animal serum samples, wherein the MERS-CoV genome sequence was completely recovered. Results showed that the complete genome of MERS-CoV and related variants could be directly obtained from clinical samples within half a day. Consequently, this method will contribute to rapid MERS diagnosis, particularly in future CoV epidemics.","['Kim KW', 'Choi S', 'Shin SK', 'Lee I', 'Ku KB', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim S', 'Yi H']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Kim KW, et al.

33679384,Potential Natural Products Against Respiratory Viruses: A Perspective to Develop Anti-COVID-19 Medicines.,"The emergence of viral pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), resulted in a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Its alarmingly quick transmission to many countries across the world and a considerable percentage of morbidity and mortality made the World Health Organization recognize it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The perceived risk of infection has led many research groups to study COVID-19 from different aspects. In this literature review, the phylogenetics and taxonomy of COVID-19 coronavirus, epidemiology, and respiratory viruses similar to COVID-19 and their mode of action are documented in an approach to understand the behavior of the current virus. Moreover, we suggest targeting the receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such as ACE2 and other proteins including 3CLpro and PLpro for improving antiviral activity and immune response against COVID-19 disease. Additionally, since phytochemicals play an essential role in complementary therapies for viral infections, we summarized different bioactive natural products against the mentioned respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza A, SARS-CoV, MERS, and COVID-19.Based on current literature, 130 compounds have antiviral potential, and of these, 94 metabolites demonstrated bioactivity against coronaviruses. Interestingly, these are classified in different groups of natural products, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and others. Most of these compounds comprise flavonoid skeletons.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key player in the viral entry into cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein, and the RBD has therefore been crucial as a drug target. In this study, we used phage display to develop human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. A human synthetic Fab phage display library was panned against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2 RBD), yielding ten unique Fabs with moderate apparent affinities (","['Kim YJ', 'Lee MH', 'Lee SR', 'Chung HY', 'Kim K', 'Lee TG', 'Kim DY']",2021,22,4,Int J Mol Sci,"Kim YJ, et al.

33671334,Targeting the Complement Serine Protease MASP-2 as a Therapeutic Strategy for Coronavirus Infections.,"MASP-2, mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease 2, is a key enzyme in the lectin pathway of complement activation. Hyperactivation of this protein by human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to contribute to aberrant complement activation in patients, leading to aggravated lung injury with potentially fatal consequences. This hyperactivation is triggered in the lungs through a conserved, direct interaction between MASP-2 and coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Blocking this interaction with monoclonal antibodies and interfering directly with the catalytic activity of MASP-2, have been found to alleviate coronavirus-induced lung injury both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a virtual library of 8736 licensed drugs and clinical agents has been screened in silico according to two parallel strategies. The first strategy aims at identifying direct inhibitors of MASP-2 catalytic activity, while the second strategy focusses on finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs) of MASP-2 and coronaviral N proteins. Such agents could represent promising support treatment options to prevent lung injury and reduce mortality rates of infections caused by both present and future-emerging coronaviruses. Forty-six drug repurposing candidates were purchased and, for the ones selected as potential direct inhibitors of MASP-2, a preliminary in vitro assay was conducted to assess their interference with the lectin pathway of complement activation. Some of the tested agents displayed a dose-response inhibitory activity of the lectin pathway, potentially providing the basis for a viable support strategy to prevent the severe complications of coronavirus infections.","['Flude BM', 'Nannetti G', 'Mitchell P', 'Compton N', 'Richards C', 'Heurich M', 'Brancale A', 'Ferla S', 'Bassetto M']",2021,13,2,Viruses,"Flude BM, et al.

Bats have arisen the attention of the scientific community as reservoir of emerging viruses, given their wide geographical distribution, their biological diversity (around 1400 species, 21 different families and over 200 genera), and their peculiar ecological and physiological characteristics which seem to facilitate them in harbouring a high viral diversity. Several human activities may enable the viral spill-over from bats to humans, such as deforestation, land-use changes, increased livestock grazing or intensive production of vegetal cultures. In addition, the globalization of trade and high global human mobility allow these viruses to be disseminated in few hours in many parts of the World. In order to avoid the emergence of new pandemic threats in the future we need to substantially change our global models of social and economic development, posing the conservation of biodiversity and the preservation of natural ecosystems as a pillar for the protection of global human health.","['Calistri P', 'Decaro N', 'Lorusso A']",2021,9,2,Microorganisms,"Calistri P, et al.

33668428,Nucleoside Analogs and Nucleoside Precursors as Drugs in the Fight against SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses, members of the family Coronaviridae, that cause infections in a broad range of mammals including humans. Several CoV species lead to mild upper respiratory infections typically associated with common colds. However, three human CoV (HCoV) species: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for severe respiratory diseases at the origin of two recent epidemics (SARS and MERS), and of the current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), respectively. The easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in China, spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an urgent need for effective drugs as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to guarantee positive results rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several nucleoside-mimicking analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of viruses providing effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV infections. Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and nucleoside precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention to SARS-CoV-2. This work covers progress made in anti-CoV therapy with nucleoside derivatives and provides insight into their main mechanisms of action.","['Borbone N', 'Piccialli G', 'Roviello GN', 'Oliviero G']",2021,26,4,Molecules,"Borbone N, et al.

33666200,Efficacy and safety of steroid therapy in COVID-19: A rapid systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Although the use of steroids in the management of COVID-19 has been addressed by a few systematic review and meta-analysis, however, they also used data from ""SARS-CoV"" and ""MERS-CoV."" Again, most of these studies addressed only one severity category of patients or addressed only one efficacy endpoint (mortality). In this context, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy among all severity categories of patients with COVID-19 (mild to moderate and severe to critical category) in terms of ""mortality,"" ""requirement of mechanical ventilation,"" ""requirement of ICU"" and clinical cure parameters.
METHODS: 11 databases were screened. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or high quality (on the basis of risk of bias analysis) comparative-observational studies were included in the analysis. RevMan5.3 was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (3 RCT and 12 comparative-observational studies) were included. In the mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 population, treatment with dexamethasone showed significant protection against mortality (single study). Among severe and critically ill combined population, steroid administration was significantly associated with lowered mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.83 [0.76-0.910]), lowered requirement of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.59 [0.51-0.69]), decreased requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 0.62 [0.45-0.86]), lowered length of ICU stay (single-study) and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (two-studies). In mild to moderate population, steroid treatment was associated with a higher ""duration of hospital stay,"" while no difference was seen in other domains. In patients at risk of progression to ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" steroid administration was associated with ""reduced requirement of mechanical ventilation"" (single-study).
CONCLUSION: This study guides the use of steroid across patients with different severity categories of COVID-19. Among mechanically ventilated patients, steroid therapy may be beneficial in terms of reduced mortality. Among ""severe and critical"" patients; steroid therapy was associated with lowered mortality, decreased requirement of mechanical ventilation, and ICU. However, no benefit was observed in ""mild to moderate"" population. To conclude, among properly selected patient populations (based-upon clinical severity and biomarker status), steroid administration may prove beneficial in patients with COVID-19.","['Sarma P', 'Bhattacharyya A', 'Kaur H', 'Prajapat M', 'Prakash A', 'Kumar S', 'Bansal S', 'Kirubakaran R', 'Reddy DH', 'Muktesh G', 'Kaushal K', 'Sharma S', 'Shekhar N', 'Avti P', 'Thota P', 'Medhi B']",2020,52,6,Indian J Pharmacol,"Sarma P, et al.

The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.","['To KK', 'Sridhar S', 'Chiu KH', 'Hung DL', 'Li X', 'Hung IF', 'Tam AR', 'Chung TW', 'Chan JF', 'Zhang AJ', 'Cheng VC', 'Yuen KY']",2021,10,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,"To KK, et al.

33660020,Repositioning HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.,"AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the ß-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications.
SUBJECT AND METHOD: SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""antivirals,"" ""therapy""), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.
RESULTS: Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir.
DISCUSSION: This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide.

33656725,The Primary Outcomes and Epidemiological and Clinical Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iran.,"AIM: We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Iranian patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: In this single-center and retrospective study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 12 remained hospitalized at the end of the study and 167 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 153 (91.6%) were discharged and 14 (8.38%) died in hospital. Approximately half (50.9%) of patients suffered from a comorbidity, with diabetes or coronary heart disease being the most common in 20 patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, dyspnea, and cough. The mean durations from first symptoms to hospital admission was 8.64 ± 4.14 days, whereas the mean hospitalization time to discharge or death was 5.19 ± 2.42 and 4.35 ± 2.70 days, respectively. There was a significantly higher age in non-survivor patients compared with survivor patients. Multivariate regression showed increasing odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital death associated with respiratory rates >20 breaths/min (OR: 5.14, 95% CI: 1.19-22.15, p = 0.028) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >19 mg/dL (OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.30-15.85, p = 0.017) on admission. In addition, higher respiratory rate was associated with continuous fever (OR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.18-14.08, p = 0.026) and other clinical symptoms (OR: 3.52, 95% CI: 1.05-11.87, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: The potential risk factors including high respiratory rate and BUN levels could help to identify COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis at an early stage in the Iranian population.","['Vahedian-Azimi A', 'Ashtari S', 'Alishiri G', 'Shahriary A', 'Saberi M', 'Rahimi-Bashar F', 'Panahi Y', 'Samadinia H', 'Ferdosi M', 'Jafari I', 'Vahedi E', 'Ghazvini A', 'Nikpouraghdam M', 'Goharimoghadam K', 'Izadi M', 'Jonaidi-Jafari N', 'Shojaee S', 'Aghdaei HA', 'Pourhoseingholi MA', 'Sahebkar A']",2021,1321,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Vahedian-Azimi A, et al.

33656715,Emerging Technologies for the Treatment of COVID-19.,"The new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), turned into a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries. Due to the high rate of transmission and mortality, finding specific and effective treatment options for this infection is currently of urgent importance. Emerging technologies have created a promising platform for developing novel treatment options for various viral diseases such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we have described potential novel therapeutic options based on the structure and pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the results of previous studies on similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. Many of these approaches can be used for controlling viral infection by reducing the viral damage or by increasing the potency of the host response. Owing to their high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, siRNAs, aptamers, nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies, and different types of peptides can be used for interference with viral replication or for blocking internalization. Receptor agonists and interferon-inducing agents are also potential options to balance and enhance the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of such novel technologies is yet to be established although many well-designed clinical trials are underway to address these issues.","['Aghamollaei H', 'Sarvestani R', 'Bakherad H', 'Zare H', 'Guest PC', 'Ranjbar R', 'Sahebkar A']",2021,1321,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Aghamollaei H, et al.

These hormones can be triggered by some states, such as infections. Some illnesses that most likely have an influence on blood glucose levels include common cold or flu, COVID-19, bronchitis, or chest infections. So, it is important for diabetic patients affected by COVID-19 to eat a healthy balanced diet to maintain stable blood glucose levels and enhance their immune functions. The immune response has often been demonstrated to be attenuated by insufficient nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies. We summarize and propose potential nutritional therapeutic options available for the treatment of this novel coronavirus in diabetic patients.","['Abiri B', 'Guest PC', 'Vafa M']",2021,1321,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Abiri B, et al.

Numerous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 appears similar to the SARS-CoV as it uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to gain entry into cells. The main aims of this scoping review were to identify the primary hosts of coronaviruses, the relationship between the receptor binding domain of coronaviruses and ACE2, the organ specificity of ACE2 expression compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, and to determine if this information can be used in the development of novel treatment approaches for the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Shojaee A', 'Vahedian-Azimi A', 'Faizi F', 'Rahimi-Bashar F', 'Shahriary A', 'Galeh HEG', 'Nehrir B', 'Guest PC', 'Sahebkar A']",2021,1321,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Shojaee A, et al.

33655282,Targeting the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein through GSK-3 Inhibition.,"UNLABELLED: The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.35 - 0.74], p = 0.005). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of 
SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 is taking a major toll on personal health, healthcare systems, and the global economy. With three betacoronavirus epidemics in less than 20 years, there is an urgent need for therapies to combat new and existing coronavirus outbreaks. Our analysis of clinical data from over 300,000 patients in three major health systems demonstrates a 50% reduced risk of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium, a direct inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). We further show that GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and that GSK-3 inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. These findings suggest an antiviral strategy for COVID-19 and new coronaviruses that may arise in the future.","['Liu X', 'Verma A', 'Garcia G', 'Ramage H', 'Myers RL', 'Lucas A', 'Michaelson JJ', 'Coryell W', 'Kumar A', 'Charney AW', 'Kazanietz MG', 'Rader DJ', 'Ritchie MD', 'Berrettini WH', 'Schultz DC', 'Cherry S', 'Damoiseaux R', 'Arumugaswami V', 'Klein PS']",2021,,,medRxiv,"Liu X, et al.

Attenuated vaccines have proven their potential to induce strong and long-lasting immune responses. We have previously described that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein is a virulence factor. Based on this knowledge, a collection of mutants carrying partial deletions spanning the C-terminal domain of the E protein (rMERS-CoV-E*) has been generated using a reverse genetics system. One of these mutants, MERS-CoV-E*Δ2in, was attenuated and provided full protection in a challenge with virulent MERS-CoV after a single immunization dose. The MERS-CoV-E*Δ2in mutant was stable as it maintained its attenuation after 16 passages in cell cultures and has been selected as a promising vaccine candidate.","['Gutiérrez-Álvarez J', 'Honrubia JM', 'Fernández-Delgado R', 'Wang L', 'Castaño-Rodríguez C', 'Zúñiga S', 'Sola I', 'Enjuanes L']",2021,12,2,mBio,"Gutiérrez-Álvarez J, et al.

33652815,SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Proteins 1 and 13 Suppress Caspase-1 and the NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation.,"Viral infection-induced activation of inflammasome complexes has both positive and negative effects on the host. Proper activation of inflammasome complexes induces down-stream effector mechanisms that inhibit viral replication and promote viral clearance, whereas dysregulated activation has detrimental effects on the host. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, encode viroporins that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the severity of coronavirus disease is associated with the inflammasome activation. Although the NLRP3 inflammasome activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses, these viruses must evade inflammasome-mediated antiviral immune responses to establish primary replication. Screening of a complementary DNA (cDNA) library encoding 28 SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs) showed that two nonstructural proteins (NSPs), NSP1 and NSP13, inhibited caspase-1-mediated IL-1β activation. NSP1 amino acid residues involved in host translation shutoff and NSP13 domains responsible for helicase activity were associated with caspase-1 inhibition. In THP-1 cells, both NSP1 and NSP13 significantly reduced NLRP3-inflammasome-induced caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and NSP13 are potent antagonists of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","['Kim NE', 'Kim DK', 'Song YJ']",2021,9,3,Microorganisms,"Kim NE, et al.

33647552,Outcome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in hematology and oncology patients: A case series in Saudi Arabia.,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with a high fatality rate (34%), which is higher in the presence of co-morbidities. The aim of the current study was to assess the clinical course and the outcome in hematological or oncological malignancy cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV.
METHODS: This is a case series of hematological /oncological cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV, in a tertiary care setting in 2015. The cases were identified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) MERS-CoV case definition. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from the patients' medical charts and electronic health records.
RESULTS: In total, nine hematological or oncological cases were identified, diagnosed with MERS-CoV. The baseline malignant condition was hematological malignancy in seven patients, as well as colon cancer and osteosarcoma in one patient each. Six (67%) patients were male. The median age was 65 years (range 16-80 years). Co-morbidities included chronic kidney disease (n = 3.33%), diabetes mellitus (n = 3.33%), and hypertension (n = 2.22%). The presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (n = 6.66%), fever (n = 5.55%), cough (n = 2.22%), and diarrhea (n = 2.22%). Chest x-rays indicated bilateral infiltrates in 6 patients (66%). The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test was repeated in six patients to confirm the diagnosis. The mortality rate was 100%, and the median time to death was 26 days (range 15-77 days).
CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection in this small cohort of hematology or oncology patients has a 100% mortality rate, regardless of the status of the underlying disease. The confirmation of the diagnosis may require repeated testing. Additional studies are required to verify the findings and to elucidate the disease pathogenesis in cancer patients.","['Alaskar A', 'Shaheen NA', 'Bosaeed M', 'Rehan H', 'Rather M', 'Salama H', 'Abuelgasim KA', 'Gmati G', 'Damlaj M', 'Alahmari B', 'Alzahrani M', 'Othman A', 'Mendoza MA', 'Alhejazi A']",2021,14,3,J Infect Public Health,"Alaskar A, et al.

At the end of January 2020, 2519 laboratory confirmed cases with a case-fatality rate of 34.3% have been reported. Approximately 84% of human cases have been reported in the tropical region of Saudi Arabia. The emergence of MERS-CoV has highlighted need for a rapid and accurate assay to triage patients with a suspected infection in a timely manner because of the lack of an approved vaccine or an effective treatment for MERS-CoV to prevent and control potential outbreaks. In this study, we present two rapid and visual nucleic acid assays that target the MERS-CoV UpE and N genes as a panel that combines reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification with a closed vertical flow visualization strip (RT-RPA-VF). This test panel was designed to improve the diagnostic accuracy through dual-target screening after referencing laboratory testing guidance for MERS-CoV. The limit of detection was 1.2×101 copies/μl viral RNA for the UpE assay and 1.2 copies/μl viral RNA for the N assay, with almost consistent with the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assays. The two assays exhibited no cross-reactivity with multiple CoVs, including the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), the bat coronavirus HKU4, and the human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the panel does not require sophisticated equipment and provides rapid detection within 30 min.

33643063,"SARS-COV-2 and Ocular Surface: From Physiology to Pathology, a Route to Understand Transmission and Disease.","Coronaviruses gained public attention during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in East Asia in 2003 and spread of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Direct human-to-human contact and droplet are the main methods of transmission. Viral stability in aerosols on different surfaces supports evidence on indirect viral acquisition from fomites through the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Given the pandemic circumstances, the level of evidence in COVID-19 and ophthalmology regarding eye infection, conjunctival transmission, and viral shedding through tears is insufficient. Presently, conjunctival transmission of coronaviruses has not been confirmed and remains controversial. Considering the physiology of the lacrimal system and ocular surface, the eyes are considered an immunoprotective site, with several antiviral molecules and anti-inflammatory proteins. Nevertheless, they represent an interface with the exterior world and face daily putative aggressors. Understanding the host's ocular surface immunological and protective environment is crucial to clarify the potential of the conjunctiva as an entry route for SARS-CoV-2 and as part of this viral infection. We will discuss hypothetical ocular surface transmission mechanisms and related counterarguments addressed to both angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors found on the conjunctival and corneal epithelia and lactoferrin, lysozyme, lipocalin and secretory IgA levels in the tear film. Hopefully, we will promote better understanding of this organ in COVID-19 infection and the potential transmission route that can be helpful in setting recommendations on best practices and protective guidelines to mitigate the disease spread.","['de Freitas Santoro D', 'de Sousa LB', 'Câmara NOS', 'de Freitas D', 'de Oliveira LA']",2021,12,,Front Physiol,"de Freitas Santoro D, et al.

We herein report a 19-year-old woman with partial agenesis of the CC. She developed acute encephalopathy during Bordetella pertussis infection. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed restricted diffusion of bilateral Probst bundles. She was treated with anti-epileptics and azithromycin and recovered with no neurological sequelae.

33638807,MicroRNA Mimics or Inhibitors as Antiviral Therapeutic Approaches Against COVID-19.,"Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, present a significant threat to human health by inflicting a wide variety of health complications and even death. While conventional therapeutics often involve administering small molecules to fight viral infections, small non-coding RNA sequences, known as microRNAs (miRNAs/miR-), may present a novel antiviral strategy. We can take advantage of their ability to modulate host-virus interactions through mediating RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Investigations into miRNA and SARS-CoV-2 interactions can reveal novel therapeutic approaches against this virus. The viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were searched using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) for highly similar sequences, to identify potential binding sites for miRNAs hypothesized to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. miRNAs that target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for host cell entry, were also predicted. Several relevant miRNAs were identified, and their potential roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infections were further assessed. Current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 are limited and have not generated sufficient evidence on safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19. Therefore, by investigating the interactions between miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2, miRNA-based antiviral therapies, including miRNA mimics and inhibitors, may be developed as an alternative strategy to fight COVID-19.","['Hum C', 'Loiselle J', 'Ahmed N', 'Shaw TA', 'Toudic C', 'Pezacki JP']",2021,81,5,Drugs,"Hum C, et al.

33638618,Silver nanoparticles as a potential treatment against SARS-CoV-2: A review.,"Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are distinguished by the ability to generate epidemics or pandemics, with their corresponding diseases characterized by severe respiratory illness, such as that which occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and, today, in SARS-CoV-2, an outbreak that has struck explosively and uncontrollably beginning in December 2019 and has claimed the lives of more than 1.9 M people worldwide as of January 2021. The development of vaccines has taken one year, which is why it is necessary to investigate whether some already-existing alternatives that have been successfully developed in recent years can mitigate the pandemic's advance. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have proved effective in antiviral action. Thus, in this review, several in vitro and in vivo studies of the effect of AgNPs on viruses that cause respiratory diseases are analyzed and discussed to promote an understanding of the possible interaction of AgNPs with SARS-CoV-2. The study focuses on several in vivo toxicological studies of AgNPs and a dose extrapolation to humans to determine the chief avenue of exposure. It can be concluded that the use of AgNPs as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 could be viable, based on comparing the virus' behavior to that of similar viruses in in vivo studies, and that the suggested route of administration in terms of least degree of adverse effects is inhalation.

33637080,Testing early warning and response systems through a full-scale exercise in Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: Simulation exercises can functionally validate World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) core capacities. In 2018, the Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH) conducted a full-scale exercise (FSX) in response to cases of severe viral pneumonia with subsequent laboratory confirmation for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to evaluate the country's early warning and response capabilities for high-risk events.
METHODS: An exercise planning team designed a complex fictitious scenario beginning with one case of severe viral pneumonia presenting at the hospital level and developed all the materials required for the exercise. Actors, controllers and evaluators were trained. In August 2018, a 3-day exercise was conducted in Quang Ninh province and Hanoi city, with participation of public health partners at the community, district, province, regional and national levels. Immediate debriefings and an after-action review were conducted after all exercise activities. Participants assessed overall exercise design, conduction and usefulness.
RESULTS: FSX findings demonstrated that the event-based surveillance component of the MOH surveillance system worked optimally at different administrative levels. Detection and reporting of signals at the community and health facility levels were appropriate. Triage, verification and risk assessment were successfully implemented to identify a high-risk event and trigger timely response. The FSX identified infection control, coordination with internal and external response partners and process documentation as response challenges. Participants positively evaluated the exercise training and design.
CONCLUSIONS: This exercise documents the value of exercising surveillance capabilities as part of a real-time operational scenario before facing a true emergency. The timing of this exercise and choice of disease scenario was particularly fortuitous given the subsequent appearance of COVID-19. As a result of this exercise and subsequent improvements made by the MOH, the country may have been better able to deal with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and contain it.","['Clara A', 'Dao ATP', 'Tran Q', 'Tran PD', 'Dang TQ', 'Nguyen HT', 'Tran QD', 'Rzeszotarski P', 'Talbert K', 'Stehling-Ariza T', 'Veasey F', 'Clemens L', 'Mounts AW', 'Lofgren H', 'Balajee SA', 'Do TT']",2021,21,1,BMC Public Health,"Clara A, et al.

33635218,High-dose glucocorticoids pulse-therapy for beta-coronaviridae pneumonia: a systematic literature review and case-series of Coronavirus disease-2019.,"OBJECTIVES: The results of the RECOVERY trial identified dexamethasone as the first pharmacological therapy that reduces mortality in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse glucocorticoid therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoronaVirus (CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections and describe a case-series of COVID-19 patients treated with off-label pulse doses of methylprednisolone.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse therapy for betacoronaviridae infections as described in the protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020190183). All consecutive patients admitted to Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova di Reggio Emilia or Guastalla Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and treated with methylprednisolone 1 gram/day for at least three days were included in the case series. A retrospective review of available computed tomography (CT) scan and chest x-ray was performed independently by two radiologists blinded to clinical data, and discordances were resolved by consensus.
RESULTS: Twenty papers were included for SARS, but only two were comparative and were included in the primary endpoint analysis. Likewise, eleven papers were included for COVID-19, four of which were comparative and were considered for the primary outcome analysis. Included studies for both SARS and COVID-19 are mostly retrospective and highly heterogeneous, with lethality ranging from 0% to 100% and ICU admission rate ranging from 9% to 100%. Fourteen patients were included in our case series, 7 males and 7 females.
CONCLUSIONS: No randomised controlled trial is available yet for corticosteroids pulse-therapy defined as at least ≥500mg/day methylprednisolone in patients with emerging coronavirus pneumonia. Lethality among our cohort is high (4/14), but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the fact that in our setting pulse-steroids were used in patients not eligible for other treatments because of comorbidities or as rescue therapy. The incidence of steroid-related adverse events seems low in our cohort. The quality of the evidence on glucocorticoid pulse-therapy in SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is poor. Randomised controlled trials are greatly needed.","['Dolci G', 'Cassone G', 'Venturelli F', 'Besutti G', 'Revelli M', 'Corsini R', 'Sampaolesi F', 'Pavone P', 'Contardi G', 'Riva N', 'Marini G', 'Lazzaretti C', 'Mezzadri S', 'Milic J', 'Massari M', 'Costantini M', 'Salvarani C']",2021,39,5,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Dolci G, et al.

METHOD: We performed a systematic search on psychological problems from PubMed to 10 October 2020, and conducted a meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V.3 software.
RESULTS: The results showed a 19.4% and 26.8% pooled incidence for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, during the SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus outbreaks. However, overall prevalence of depression was somewhat higher at 27.0% during the COVID-19 period. The pooled incidence of PTSD during COVID-19 compared with SARS and MERS outbreaks, was lower, at 16.4%.

33632095,Elucidating the Drug Repurposing Spectra of COVID-19 with its Analogues SARS and MERS.,"Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has affected people globally, infecting more than 39.8 million people and claiming up to 1.11 million lives, yet there is no effective treatment strategy to cure this disease. As vaccine development is a time-consuming process, currently, efforts are being made to develop alternative plans for the timely and effective management of this disease. Drug repurposing always fascinated researchers and can be utilized as the most acceptable alternative to develop the therapeutics for COVID-19 using the pre-approved drugs. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown resemblance with distinctive enzyme targets, such as 3CLpro/Mpro, RdRp, Cathepsin L, and TMPRSS2 present in SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Therefore, the drugs that have shown efficacy in these viruses can also be used for the treatment of COVID-19. This review focuses on why repurposing could provide a better alternative in COVID- 19 treatment. The similarity in the structure and progression of infection of SARS CoV and MERS viruses offers a direction and validation to evaluate the drugs approved for SARS and MERS against COVID-19. It has been indicated that multiple therapeutic options that demonstrate efficacy against SARS CoV 2 are available to mitigate the potential emergence of COVID-19 infection.","['Mishra J', 'Prasun C', 'Sahoo PK', 'Nair MS']",2021,21,20,Mini Rev Med Chem,"Mishra J, et al.

33630927,Transcriptomic profiling and genomic mutational analysis of Human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells.,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC-5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E may favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.","['Friedman N', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Drori Y', 'Eran E', 'Kol N', 'Nayshool O', 'Mendelson E', 'Rechavi G', 'Mandelboim M']",2021,16,2,PLoS One,"Friedman N, et al.

33623543,Cochrane corner: effectiveness of quarantine in reducing the spread of COVID-19.,"INTRODUCTION: there is no effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at present, so non-pharmacological interventions like quarantine are advocated to control its spread. Quarantine refers to the restriction of the movement of asymptomatic healthy people who have had contact with cases of a communicable disease. We highlight a Cochrane rapid review, published in April 2020, on the effectiveness of quarantine in limiting the spread of COVID-19.
METHODS: the authors of the Cochrane rapid review searched multiple electronic databases for studies of any design, which assessed the effects of quarantine compared to no intervention. Eligible participants for the review included contacts of confirmed or suspected cases and people returning from countries with a declared outbreak of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The authors used the evidence from SARS and MERS studies to provide indirect evidence on COVID-19.
RESULTS: the authors included 29 observational and mathematical modelling studies and found that quarantine may lead to substantial reductions in new COVID-19 cases and deaths. The review also shows that combining school closures, travel bans and social distancing to quarantine may lead to larger reductions in cases and deaths.
CONCLUSION: the review suggests that quarantine should be part of the COVID-19 combination prevention tool kit for Africa. Therefore, in addition to other public health measures, African countries should roll out COVID-19 testing to identify, isolate and treat infected people and quarantine their contacts.","['Ryan J', 'Mazingisa AV', 'Wiysonge CS']",2020,35,Suppl 2,Pan Afr Med J,"Ryan J, et al.

This KAP survey was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices among dental practitioners regarding the use of mouthwashes and emphasize on pre-procedural utilization of mouthwashes.
METHODOLOGY: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted during 1st to 15th July 2020, among working dental practitioners across the globe. A questionnaire was formed on Kwiksurveys.com, it comprised of demographic details, it further investigated the level of knowledge and new precautionary measures adopted. A total number of 707 dental practitioners from eighteen different countries responded.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23. A ""fisher exact test"" was applied to assess the difference between the mouthwashes prescribed by various countries. Knowledge section revealed a requisite understanding regarding the disease and its transmission. Only 38.9% of the participants knew that Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) mouthwashes are more efficient in reducing coronaviruses in contrast to mouthwashes made of chlorhexidine (CHX). Whereas 33.9% knew that 0.23% of PVP-I had substantial virucidal activity against SARS-COV, MERS-CoV, influenza virus and rotavirus while 31.1% recognized that oral rinses of Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) remained successful in the oral cavity for up to 180-300 minutes.

Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052-Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoVs and the UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.","['Saunders KO', 'Lee E', 'Parks R', 'Martinez DR', 'Li D', 'Chen H', 'Edwards RJ', 'Gobeil S', 'Barr M', 'Mansouri K', 'Alam SM', 'Sutherland LL', 'Cai F', 'Sanzone AM', 'Berry M', 'Manne K', 'Kapingidza AB', 'Azoitei M', 'Tse LV', 'Scobey TD', 'Spreng RL', 'Rountree RW', 'DeMarco CT', 'Denny TN', 'Woods CW', 'Petzold EW', 'Oguin TH', 'Sempowski GD', 'Gagne M', 'Douek DC', 'Tomai MA', 'Fox CB', 'Seder R', 'Wiehe K', 'Weissman D', 'Pardi N', 'Acharya P', 'Andersen H', 'Lewis MG', 'Moore IN', 'Montefiori DC', 'Baric RS', 'Haynes BF']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Saunders KO, et al.

Although nearly two decades have passed since the emergence of pandemics such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), no effective drug against the CoV family has yet been approved, so there is a need to find newer therapeutic targets. Currently, simultaneous research across the globe is being performed to discover efficient vaccines or drugs, including both conventional therapies used to treat previous similar diseases and emerging therapies like nanomedicine. Nanomedicine has already proven its value through its application drug delivery and nanosensors in other diseases. Nanomedicine and its components can play an important role in various stages of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and research related to COVID-19. Nano-based antimicrobial technology can be integrated into personal equipment for the greater safety of healthcare workers and people. Various nanomaterials such as quantum dots can be used as biosensors to diagnose COVID-19. Nanotechnology offers benefits from the use of nanosystems, such as liposomes, polymeric and lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and micelles, for drug encapsulation, and facilitates the improvement of pharmacological drug properties. Antiviral functions for nanoparticles can target the binding, entry, replication, and budding of COVID-19. The toxicity-related inorganic nanoparticles are one of the limiting factors of its use that should be further investigated and modified.

33615041,SARS-CoV-2 spillover transmission due to recombination event.,"In late 2019, a novel Coronavirus emerged in China. Perceiving the modulating factors of cross-species virus transmission is critical to elucidate the nature of virus emergence. Using bioinformatics tools, we analyzed the mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, modeling of protein structure, and analyze the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2, as well as potential recombination events. Phylogenetic tree analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the closest evolutionary relationship with Bat-SL-CoV-2 (RaTG13) at the scale of the complete virus genome, and less similarity to Pangolin-CoV. However, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical to Pangolin-CoV at the aa level, suggesting that spillover transmission probably occurred directly from pangolins, but not bats. Further recombination analysis revealed the pathway for spillover transmission from Bat-SL-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV. Here, we provide evidence for recombination event between Bat-SL-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV that resulted in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the role of mutations should be noted as another influencing factor in the continuing evolution and resurgence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.","['Shahhosseini N', 'Wong G', 'Kobinger GP', 'Chinikar S']",2021,23,,Gene Rep,"Shahhosseini N, et al.

After the rapid spread of SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) from its origin in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of studies have been conducted to better understand the biology and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, and to aid in developing effective treatment regimens, therapeutics, and vaccines. This review focuses on the recent advancements in the rapidly evolving areas of clinical care and management of COVID-19. The emerging strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease are explored, and the development of effective vaccines is reviewed.","['Hadisi Z', 'Walsh T', 'Dabiri SMH', 'Seyfoori A', 'Hamdi D', 'Mirani B', 'Pagan E', 'Jardim A', 'Akbari M']",2021,4,3,Adv Ther (Weinh),"Hadisi Z, et al.

33614709,Therapeutic Strategies in the Management of COVID-19.,"Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), novel corona virus has caused pandemic globally, with rise in the number of cases and death of the patients. Vast majority of the countries that are dealing with rise in the active cases and death of patients suffering from novel corona viruses COVID-19 are trying to content the virus by isolating the patients and treating them with the approved antiviral that have been previously used in treating SARS, MERS, and drugs that are used to treat other viral infections. Some of these are under clinical trials. At present there are no therapeutically effective antiviral present and there are no vaccines or drugs available that are clinically approved for treating the corona virus. The current strategy is to re-purpose the available drugs or antiviral that can minimise or reduce the burden of the health care emergencies. In this article the reuse of antiviral, US-FDA approved drugs, plant based therapeutic, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-HIV drugs and the traditional medicines that are being currently used in treating the symptoms of COVID-19 patients is discussed emphasis is also given on the treatment using monoclonal antibodies. The present article provides the therapeutic strategies that will qualify as one of the best available treatment for the better management of the COVID-19 patients in order to achieve medical benefits.","['Naik RR', 'Shakya AK']",2020,7,,Front Mol Biosci,Naik RR and Shakya AK.

33613787,On the Verge of Life: Distribution of Nucleotide Sequences in Viral RNAs.,"The aim of the study is to analyze viruses using parameters obtained from distributions of nucleotide sequences in the viral RNA. Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a ""space"". Rank-frequency distributions are studied in both cases. The defined nucleotide sequences are signs comparable to a certain extent to syllables or words as seen from the nature of their rank-frequency distributions. Within the first approach, the Pólya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fifth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and contagiousness.","['Husev M', 'Rovenchak A']",2021,14,2,Biosemiotics,Husev M and Rovenchak A.

As with many infectious diseases, the immune response to coronavirus infection may act as a double-edged sword: necessary for promoting antiviral host defense, but, if not appropriately regulated, also able to incite life-threatening immunopathology. Key immunoregulatory mediators include the chemokines, a large family of leukocyte chemoattractants that coordinate leukocyte infiltration, positioning and activation in infected tissue by acting at specific G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we compare the involvement of chemokines and chemokine receptors during infection with the three epidemic coronaviruses and discuss their potential value as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic development.","['Majumdar S', 'Murphy PM']",2020,11,,Front Pharmacol,Majumdar S and Murphy PM.

Out of diverse range of heterocycle, quinoline scaffold have been proved to play an important role in broad range of biological activities. Several drug molecules bearing a quinoline molecule with useful anticancer, antibacterial activities etc have been marketed such as chloroquine, saquinavir etc. Owing to their broad spectrum biological role, various synthetic strategies such as Skraup reaction, Combes reaction etc. has been developed by the researchers all over the world. But still the synthetic methods are associated with various limitations as formation of side products, use of expensive metal catalysts. Thus, several efforts to develop an efficient and cost effective synthetic protocol are still carried out till date. Moreover, quinoline scaffold displays remarkable antiviral activity. Therefore, in this review we have made an attempt to describe recent synthetic protocols developed by various research groups along with giving a complete explanation about the role of quinoline derivatives as antiviral agent. Quinoline derivatives were found potent against various strains of viruses like zika virus, enterovirus, herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus, ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, SARS virus and MERS virus etc.","['Kaur R', 'Kumar K']",2021,215,,Eur J Med Chem,Kaur R and Kumar K.

33609650,The pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 pathogenesis: What goes wrong?,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread to more than 196 countries worldwide. The physiopathology of human SARS-CoV-2 has not been completely understood, but its pathogenesis has been linked to a disproportionate response of the immune system. Just as described for SARS and MERS, an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. It results from the release by immune and non-immune effector cells of substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and appears to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage. In addition, hyper-coagulation and thrombosis resulted from the important release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the lethality of subjects severely infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore essential to have a deep understanding of the various cytokines involved in this exacerbated immune response, and that could be targeted by potential immunological treatments. The aim of this review was to gather the current knowledge about the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNFα in SARS-CoV-2 CRS, the probable causes and clinical outcomes of this phenomenon in severe cases of COVID-19.","['Darif D', 'Hammi I', 'Kihel A', 'El Idrissi Saik I', 'Guessous F', 'Akarid K']",2021,153,,Microb Pathog,"Darif D, et al.

The Complement System is activated during viral infection, being a central protagonist of innate and acquired immunity. Here, we report some interactions between these three coronaviruses and the Complement System, highlighting the central role of C3 with the severity of these infections. Although it can be protective, its role during coronavirus infections seems to be contradictory. For example, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, Complement System can control the viral infection in asymptomatic or mild cases; however, it can also intensify local and systemic damage in some of severe COVID-19 patients, due to its potent proinflammatory effect. In this last condition, the activation of the Complement System also amplifies the cytokine storm and the pathogenicity of coronavirus infection. Experimental treatment with Complement inhibitors has been an enthusiastic field of intense investigation in search of a promising additional therapy in severe COVID-19 patients.","['Santiesteban-Lores LE', 'Amamura TA', 'da Silva TF', 'Midon LM', 'Carneiro MC', 'Isaac L', 'Bavia L']",2021,272,,Life Sci,"Santiesteban-Lores LE, et al.

33605822,The Role of the SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein Glycosylation in the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 and Immunological Responses.,"The current pandemic is caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is, in turn, induced by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that triggers an acute respiratory disease. In recent years, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic event and large-scale epidemic affecting the human population. It follows the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. This novel SARS-CoV-2 employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, like SARS-CoV, and spreads principally in the respiratory tract. The viral spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilities the attachment to the cellular receptor, entrance, and membrane fusion. The S protein is a glycoprotein and is critical to elicit an immune response. Glycosylation is a biologically significant post-translational modification in virus surface proteins. These glycans play important roles in the viral life cycle, structure, immune evasion, and cell infection. However, it is necessary to search for new information about viral behavior and immunological host's response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present review discusses the implications of the CoV-2 S protein glycosylation in the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction and the immunological response. Elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein can propel research for the development of an appropriate vaccine.","['Ramírez Hernández E', 'Hernández-Zimbrón LF', 'Martínez Zúñiga N', 'Leal-García JJ', 'Ignacio Hernández V', 'Ucharima-Corona LE', 'Pérez Campos E', 'Zenteno E']",2021,34,3,Viral Immunol,"Ramírez Hernández E, et al.

33605109,The Recombination Potential between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV from Cross-Species Spill-over Infections.,"Countries in the Middle-East (ME) are tackling two corona virus outbreaks simultaneously, Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Both viruses infect the same host (humans) and the same cell (type-II alveolar cells) causing lower respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. Molecularly, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter alveolar cells via spike proteins recognizing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and angiotensin converting enzyme-II, respectively. Intracellularly, both viruses hide in organelles to generate negative RNA strands and initiate replication using very similar mechanisms. At the transcription level, both viruses utilise identical Transcription Regulatory Sequences (TRSs), which are known recombination cross-over points during replication, to transcribe genes. Using whole genome alignments of both viruses, we identify clusters of high sequence homology at ORF1a and ORF1b. Given the high recombination rates detected in SARS-CoV-2, we speculate that in co-infections recombination is feasible via TRS and/or clusters of homologies. Accordingly, here we recommend mitigation measure and testing for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in ME countries.","['Sajini AA', 'Alkayyal AA', 'Mubaraki FA']",2021,11,2,J Epidemiol Glob Health,"Sajini AA, et al.

33602998,"Molecular features similarities between SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS and key human genes could favour the viral infections and trigger collateral effects.","In December 2019, rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel β-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide, causing thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, since then several scientists are dedicated to its study. It has been observed that many human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on the host cell machinery for the replication and co-evolution. In this work, we analysed 91 molecular features and codon usage patterns for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677,873 codon positions. Hereby, we selected the highly expressed genes from human lung tissue to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with those of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. The integrated analysis of all the features revealed that certain viral genes and overexpressed human genes have similar codon usage patterns. The main pattern was the A/T bias that together with other features could propitiate the viral infection, enhanced by a host dependant specialization of the translation machinery of only some of the overexpressed genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could be further benefited. This could be the key for a facilitated translation and viral replication conducting to different comorbidities depending on the genetic variability of population due to the host translation machinery. This is the first codon usage approach that reveals which human genes could be potentially deregulated due to the codon usage similarities between the host and the viral genes when the virus is already inside the human cells of the lung tissues. Our work leaded to the identification of additional highly expressed human genes which are not the usual suspects but might play a role in the viral infection and settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with new viral infections. To identify the genes that could be deregulated under a viral infection is important to predict the collateral effects and determine which individuals would be more susceptible based on their genetic features and comorbidities associated.","['Maldonado LL', 'Bertelli AM', 'Kamenetzky L']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Maldonado LL, et al.

Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 lineages that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated 129 RNA-seq data sets and 6928 consensus genomes to contrast the intra-host and inter-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights intra-host single nucleotide variant (iSNV) and SNP similarity, albeit with differences in C > U changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of insertions and deletions contribute to the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","['Sapoval N', 'Mahmoud M', 'Jochum MD', 'Liu Y', 'Elworth RAL', 'Wang Q', 'Albin D', 'Ogilvie HA', 'Lee MD', 'Villapol S', 'Hernandez KM', 'Maljkovic Berry I', 'Foox J', 'Beheshti A', 'Ternus K', 'Aagaard KM', 'Posada D', 'Mason CE', 'Sedlazeck FJ', 'Treangen TJ']",2021,31,4,Genome Res,"Sapoval N, et al.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics provide scientific data that is useful in better understanding and resolution of COVID-19. Similarities among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated in the light of available data. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 evolved in bats and have positive-sense RNA genomes of 27.9 kb, 30.1 kb and 29.9 kb, respectively. Molecular and serological tools used for diagnosis of SARS and MERS patients resemble COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Stability and longevity data of SARS and MERS epidemics contribute in the current pandemic precaution policies. Trials to produce vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV failed, therefore different strategies were employed for SARS-CoV2 vaccines production and during the past period antiviral agents, Convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies provide potential treatments for sever patients. The mortality rate caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reached 15% and 37%, respectively. The first declarations about mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was around 2-4% but now this rate differed globally and reached more than 13% in some countries.

While some mutations found in camel-derived MERS-CoV strains have been characterized, the majority of natural variation found across MERS-CoV isolates remains unstudied. Here we report on the environmental stability, replication kinetics and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. While most of the MERS-CoV isolates exhibited similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the camel derived isolate, C/KSA/13, exhibited reduced surface stability while another camel isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model. These results suggest that while betacoronaviruses may have similar environmental stability profiles, individual variation can influence this phenotype, underscoring the importance of continual, global viral surveillance.","['van Doremalen N', 'Letko M', 'Fischer RJ', 'Bushmaker T', 'Yinda CK', 'Schulz J', 'Seifert SN', 'Kim NJ', 'Hemida MG', 'Kayali G', 'Park WB', 'Perera RA', 'Tamin A', 'Thornburg NJ', 'Tong S', 'Queen K', 'van Kerkhove MD', 'Choi YK', 'Oh MD', 'Assiri AM', 'Peiris M', 'Gerber SI', 'Munster VJ']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"van Doremalen N, et al.

33594363,Direct activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is blocked by Simvastatin.,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","['Qian Y', 'Lei T', 'Patel PS', 'Lee CH', 'Monaghan-Nichols P', 'Xin HB', 'Qiu J', 'Fu M']",2021,,,bioRxiv,"Qian Y, et al.

33593267,Neurological Associations of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: The current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compelled us to scrutinize major outbreaks in the past two decades, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), in 2002, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), in 2012. We aimed to assess the associated neurological manifestations with SARS CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: In this systematic review, a search was carried out by key-electronic databases, controlled vocabulary, and indexing of trials to evaluate the available pertinent studies which included both medical subject headings (MeSH) and advanced electronic databases comprising PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Peer-reviewed studies published in English and Spanish were considered, which reported data on the neurological associations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were nervous signs or symptoms, symptom severity, and diagnoses.
RESULTS: Our search identified 45 relevant studies, with 21 case reports, 3 case series, 9 observational studies, 1 retrospective study, 9 retrospective reviews, and 2 prospective reviews. This systematic review revealed that most commonly reported neuronal presentations involved headache, nausea, vomiting and muscular symptoms like fibromyalgia. Anosmia and ageusia, defects in clarity or sharpness of vision (error in visual acuity), and pain may occur in parallel. Notable afflictions in the form of anxiety, anger, confusion, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and post-intensive care syndrome were observed in individuals who were kept in quarantine and those with long-stay admissions in healthcare settings. SARS CoV-2 infection may result in cognitive impairment. Patients with more severe infection exhibited uncommon manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (intracerebral haemorrhage, stroke), rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 patients experience neuronal presentations varying with the progression of the infection. Healthcare professionals should be acquainted with the divergent neurological symptoms to curb misdiagnosis and limit long-term sequelae. Health-care planners and policymakers must prepare for this eventuality, while the ongoing studies increase our knowledge base on acute and chronic neurological associations of this pathogen.",['Javed A'],2022,21,3,CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets,Javed A.

The newly emerged disease spread in almost all countries and infected 100 million persons worldwide. The infection is not limited to the respiratory system but involves various body systems and may lead to multiple organ failure. Tissue degenerative changes result from direct viral invasion, indirect consequences, or through an uncontrolled immune response. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads to the brain via hematogenous and neural routes accompanied with dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. The involvement of the central nervous system is now suspected to be among the main causes of death. The present review discusses the historical background of coronaviruses, their role in previous and ongoing pandemics, the way they escape the immune system, why they are able to spread despite all undertaken measures, in addition to the neurological manifestations, long-term consequences of the disease, and various routes of viral introduction to the CNS.","['El-Sayed A', 'Aleya L', 'Kamel M']",2021,28,30,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"El-Sayed A, et al.

33585889,Global Patterns of Recombination across Human Viruses.,"Viral recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism driving adaptation processes, such as the ability of host-switching. Understanding global patterns of recombination could help to identify underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the potential risks of rapid adaptation. Conventional approaches (e.g., those based on linkage disequilibrium) are computationally demanding or even intractable when sequence alignments include hundreds of sequences, common in viral data sets. We present a comprehensive analysis of recombination across 30 genomic alignments from viruses infecting humans. In order to scale the analysis and avoid the computational limitations of conventional approaches, we apply newly developed topological data analysis methods able to infer recombination rates for large data sets. We show that viruses, such as ZEBOV and MARV, consistently displayed low levels of recombination, whereas high levels of recombination were observed in Sarbecoviruses, HBV, HEV, Rhinovirus A, and HIV. We observe that recombination is more common in positive single-stranded RNA viruses than in negatively single-stranded RNA ones. Interestingly, the comparison across multiple viruses suggests an inverse correlation between genome length and recombination rate. Positional analyses of recombination breakpoints along viral genomes, combined with our approach, detected at least 39 nonuniform patterns of recombination (i.e., cold or hotspots) in 18 viral groups. Among these, noteworthy hotspots are found in MERS-CoV and Sarbecoviruses (at spike, Nucleocapsid and ORF8). In summary, we have developed a fast pipeline to measure recombination that, combined with other approaches, has allowed us to find both common and lineage-specific patterns of recombination among viruses with potential relevance in viral adaptation.","['Patiño-Galindo JÁ', 'Filip I', 'Rabadan R']",2021,38,6,Mol Biol Evol,"Patiño-Galindo JÁ, et al.

33583003,Relationship between betacoronaviruses and the endocrine system: a new key to understand the COVID-19 pandemic-A comprehensive review.,"BACKGROUND: A new harmful respiratory disease, called COVID-19 emerged in China in December 2019 due to the infection of a novel coronavirus, called SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 shares almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 proteins share a high degree of homology (approximately 95%) with SARS-CoV-1 proteins. Hence, the mechanisms of SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 infection are similar and occur via binding to ACE2 protein, which is widely distributed in the human body, with a predominant expression in endocrine tissues including testis, thyroid, adrenal and pituitary.
PURPOSE: On the basis of expression pattern of the ACE2 protein among different tissues, similarity between SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, we aimed at discussing, after almost one-year pandemic, about the relationships between COVID-19 infection and the endocrine system. First, we discussed the potential effect of hormones on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection; second, we examined the evidences regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the endocrine system. When data were available, a comparative discussion between SARS and COVID-19 effects was also performed.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search within Pubmed was performed. This review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statements.
RESULTS: Among 450, 100 articles were selected. Tissue and vascular damages have been shown on thyroid, adrenal, testis and pituitary glands, with multiple alterations of endocrine function.
CONCLUSION: Hormones may affect patient susceptibility to COVID-19 infection but evidences regarding therapeutic implication of these findings are still missing. SARS and COVID-19 may affect endocrine glands and their dense vascularization, impairing endocrine system function. A possible damage of endocrine system in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in both COVID-19 acute phase and recovery to identify both early and late endocrine complications that may be important for patient's prognosis and well-being after COVID-19 infection.","['Piticchio T', 'Le Moli R', 'Tumino D', 'Frasca F']",2021,44,8,J Endocrinol Invest,"Piticchio T, et al.

The problem with COVID-19 therapeutics is due to complexity of the mechanism of the pathogenesis of this virus. In this review, an extensive analysis of genome architecture and mode of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on therapeutic approaches is performed. SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a single, ~29.9 kb long RNA having significant sequence similarity to BAT-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Two-third part of SARS-Cov-2 genome comprises of ORF (ORF1ab) resulting in the formation of 2 polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, later processed into 16 smaller non-structural proteins (NSPs). The four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), a small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S protein helps in receptor binding and membrane fusion and hence plays the most important role in the transmission of CoVs. Priming of S protein is done by serine 2 transmembrane protease and thus plays a key role in virus and host cell fusion. This review highlights the possible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 to search for possible therapeutic options.","['Shamsi A', 'Mohammad T', 'Anwar S', 'Amani S', 'Khan MS', 'Husain FM', 'Rehman MT', 'Islam A', 'Hassan MI']",2021,177,,Int J Biol Macromol,"Shamsi A, et al.

In the present investigation, we sought to investigate the association between air pollution, meteorological data, and the Lombardy region COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. We considered the number of detected infected people at the regional and provincial scale from February to March 2020. Air pollution data were collected over the Lombardy region, nominally, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Meteorological data have been collected over the same region for temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this work, we evaluated the combined impact of environmental pollutants and climate conditions on the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis evidenced a positive correlation between spatial distribution of COVID-19 infection cases with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter and a negative relationship with ozone. Moreover, suspended particulate matter concentration peaks in February correlated positively with infection peaks according to the virus incubation period. The obtained results suggested that seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seemed to influence COVID-19 epidemics in Lombardy region.","['Dragone R', 'Licciardi G', 'Grasso G', 'Del Gaudio C', 'Chanussot J']",2021,18,3,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Dragone R, et al.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS coronavirus detection by PCR.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12,763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12,475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the coronavirus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors.
RESULTS: Coronavirus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunged from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent patients. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed on selecting the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model, including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased coronavirus detection rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed patients. Several meteorological factors were associated with the coronavirus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the coronavirus detection rate.","['Anastasiou OE', 'Hüsing A', 'Korth J', 'Theodoropoulos F', 'Taube C', 'Jöckel KH', 'Stang A', 'Dittmer U']",2021,10,2,Pathogens,"Anastasiou OE, et al.

Such binding affinities play a critical role in the virus-cell membrane fusion process. These biflavones are able to interact more strongly with the residues of heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) regions of S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to nefamostat, and thus, these biflavones can effectively block the formation of six-helix bundle core fusion structure (6-HB) leading to the inhibition of virus-target cell-membrane fusion.","['Mondal S', 'Karmakar A', 'Mallick T', 'Begum NA']",2021,556,,Virology,"Mondal S, et al.

33571745,Immune response scenario and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"COVID-19 pandemic has started in December 2019 in China and quickly extended to become a worldwide health and economic emergency issue. It is caused by the novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients' clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic infection or flu like symptoms to serious pneumonia which could be associated with multiple organ failure possibly leading to death. It is understood that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 includes all elements of the immune system which could altogether succeed in viral elimination and complete cure. Meanwhile, this immune response may also lead to disease progression and could be responsible for the patient's death. Many trials have been done recently to create therapies and vaccines against human coronavirus infections such as MERS or SARS, however, till now, there is some controversy about the effectiveness and safety of antiviral drugs and vaccines which have been developed to treat and prevent this disease and its management depends mainly on supportive care. The spike glycoprotein or protein S of SARS-CoV-2 is the main promoter that induces development of neutralizing antibodies; hence, many attempts of vaccines and antiviral drugs development have been designed to be directed specifically against this protein. While some of these attempts have been proved to be efficient in in vitro settings, only few of them have been proceeded to randomized animal trials and human studies which makes COVID-19 prevention an ongoing challenge. This review describes the natural immune response scenario during COVID-19 and the vaccines development trials to create efficient vaccines thus helping to build more effective approaches for prophylaxis and management.",['Mohammad MHS'],2021,94,,Int Immunopharmacol,Mohammad MHS.

Though NIC is already FDA-approved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization.","['Brunaugh AD', 'Seo H', 'Warnken Z', 'Ding L', 'Seo SH', 'Smyth HDC']",2021,16,2,PLoS One,"Brunaugh AD, et al.

The uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with increased workload and difficult medical triage decisions may lead to a further decline in physician psychological health.
METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for primary research from database inception (Medline [1946], EMBASE [1974], PsycINFO [1806]) to November 17, 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened by one of three reviewers and full-text article screening and data abstraction were conducted independently, and in duplicate, by three reviewers.
RESULTS: From 6223 unique citations, 480 articles were reviewed in full-text, with 193 studies (of 90,499 physicians) included in the final review. Studies reported on physician psychological symptoms and management during seven infectious disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], three strains of Influenza A virus [H1N1, H5N1, H7N9], Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], and COVID-19) in 57 countries. Psychological symptoms of anxiety (14.3-92.3%), stress (11.9-93.7%), depression (17-80.5%), post-traumatic stress disorder (13.2-75.2%) and burnout (14.7-76%) were commonly reported among physicians, regardless of infectious disease outbreak or country. Younger, female (vs. male), single (vs. married), early career physicians, and those providing direct care to infected patients were associated with worse psychological symptoms.
INTERPRETATION: Physicians should be aware that psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, fear and distress are common, manifest differently and self-management strategies to improve psychological well-being exist. Health systems should implement short and long-term psychological supports for physicians caring for patients with COVID-19.","['Fiest KM', 'Parsons Leigh J', 'Krewulak KD', 'Plotnikoff KM', 'Kemp LG', 'Ng-Kamstra J', 'Stelfox HT']",2021,21,1,BMC Psychiatry,"Fiest KM, et al.

In December 2019, yet again a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in Wuhan, China, was associated with a severe respiratory infection, known today as COVID-19. This new virus quickly spread throughout China and 30 additional countries. As result, the World Health Organization (WHO) elevated the status of the COVID-19 outbreak from emergency of international concern to pandemic on March 11, 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on public health and economy fueled a worldwide race to approve therapeutic and prophylactic agents, but so far, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available. In current scenario, the development of in vitro systems for viral mass production and for testing antiviral and vaccine candidates proves to be an urgent matter.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells at the ultrastructural level.
METHODS: In this study, we documented, by transmission electron microscopy and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the infection of Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from Brazilian patients.
FINDINGS: The infected cells presented cytopathic effects and SARS-CoV-2 particles were observed attached to the cell surface and inside cytoplasmic vesicles. The entry of the virus into cells occurred through the endocytic pathway or by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Assembled nucleocapsids were verified inside rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterns (RER). Viral maturation seemed to occur by budding of viral particles from the RER into smooth membrane vesicles.
MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the susceptibility of Vero-E6 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the viral pathway inside the cells were demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis.","['Barreto-Vieira DF', 'da Silva MAN', 'Garcia CC', 'Miranda MD', 'Matos ADR', 'Caetano BC', 'Resende PC', 'Motta FC', 'Siqueira MM', 'Girard-Dias W', 'Archanjo BS', 'Barth OM']",2021,116,,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Barreto-Vieira DF, et al.

MERS-CoV shedding in some dromedary camel secretions, particularly nasal swabs, were studied in more detail. However, the roles of viral shedding in saliva and ocular secretions are still required further detailed studies. We performed a longitudinal study on a farm of dromedary camel herd from 10th March until 7th April, 2019, in eastern Saudi Arabia. This is a closed management herd including a large number of colour-based breed animals and include animals of both sexes. We collected saliva and ocular swabs from 18% of the target animal population. Detection of the MERS-CoV-RNAs in these samples was conducted by the real-time PCR technique. We detected the viral RNAs in the saliva of and conjunctival swabs of some of the tested animals at 33%, 77% and 88% during the three-time points, respectively. Moreover, we also detected the viral RNAs in the conjunctival swabs at 11%, 22% and 33% at similar time intervals. Our results are suggesting the possibility of MERS-CoV shedding in the saliva and the ocular discharges of the infected dromedary camels. This explains, at least in part, the mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans. More studies are needed for a better understanding of the transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans; thus, the risk of virus spread can be mitigated.","['Hemida MG', 'Ali AM', 'Alnaeem A']",2021,68,4,Zoonoses Public Health,"Hemida MG, et al.

The early symptoms may be fever, dry cough, sour throat, and difficulty in breathing which may lead to death in severe cases. Compared to previous outbreaks like SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV2 disease (COVID-19) outbreak has been much distressing due to its high rate of infection but low infection fatality rate (IFR) with 1.4% around the world. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In the month of January 2020, the whole genome of SARS-CoV2 was sequenced which made work easy for researchers to develop diagnostic kits and to carry out drug repurposing to effectively alleviate the pandemic situation in the world. Now, it is important to understand why this virus has high rate of infectivity or is there any factor involved at the genome level which actually facilitates this virus infection globally? In this study, we have extensively analyzed the whole genomes of different coronaviruses infecting humans and animals in different geographical locations around the world. The main aim of the study is to identify the similarity and the mutational adaptation of the coronaviruses from different host and geographical locations to the SARS-CoV2 and provide a better strategy to understand the mutational rate for specific target-based drug designing. This study is focused to every annotation in a comparative manner which includes SNPs, repeat analysis with the different categorization of the short-sequence repeats and long-sequence repeats, different UTR's, transcriptional factors, and the predicted matured peptides with the specific length and positions on the genomes. The extensive analysis on SNPs revealed that Wuhan SARS-CoV2 and Indian SARS-CoV2 are having only eight SNPs. Collectively, phylogenetic analysis, repeat analysis, and the polymorphism revealed the genomic conserveness within the SARS-CoV2 and few other coronaviruses with very less mutational chances and the huge distance and mutations from the few other species.","['Tarique M', 'Ahmad S', 'Malik A', 'Ahmad I', 'Saeed M', 'Almatroudi A', 'Qadah T', 'Murad MA', 'Mashraqi M', 'Alam Q', 'Al-Saleh Y']",2021,476,5,Mol Cell Biochem,"Tarique M, et al.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for the worldwide SARS outbreak in 2003. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concerns and thousands of deaths in 2019-2020 and outlined the need for novel antivirals. The present review is devoted to the development of effective and selective nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections. To date, about half of antivirals have been created based on nucleosides. The majority of drugs based on nucleosides have been approved by FDA.

33560742,Olfactory and taste dysfunctions in COVID-19.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) can be a single and early prominent symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 infection unlike middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS. OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear.
RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed the literature on OD and TD during the COVID-19 pandemic analyzing current data on pathogenesis and clinical correlates including prevalence, recovery rates, risk factors, and predictive power. Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic.
SUMMARY: Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD. Recognizing inherent limitations of both subjective and objective OD and TD testing enables us better to manage chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, current mechanistic data suggest neurotropism of COVID-19 for olfactory neuro-epithelium and a potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Future studies are needed to explore further the neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19.","['Rouadi PW', 'Idriss SA', 'Bousquet J']",2021,21,3,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,"Rouadi PW, et al.

33555780,Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines on the Management of Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: First Update.,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to affect millions worldwide. Given the rapidly growing evidence base, we implemented a living guideline model to provide guidance on the management of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU.
METHODS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. We used the World Health Organization's definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials. When appropriate, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, then used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued nine statements (three new and six updated) related to ICU patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. For severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the panel strongly recommends using systemic corticosteroids and venous thromboprophylaxis but strongly recommends against using hydroxychloroquine. In addition, the panel suggests using dexamethasone (compared with other corticosteroids) and suggests against using convalescent plasma and therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel suggests using remdesivir in nonventilated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and suggests against starting remdesivir in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 outside clinical trials. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel did not issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning.
CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued several recommendations to guide healthcare professionals caring for adults with critical or severe coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.","['Alhazzani W', 'Evans L', 'Alshamsi F', 'Møller MH', 'Ostermann M', 'Prescott HC', 'Arabi YM', 'Loeb M', 'Ng Gong M', 'Fan E', 'Oczkowski S', 'Levy MM', 'Derde L', 'Dzierba A', 'Du B', 'Machado F', 'Wunsch H', 'Crowther M', 'Cecconi M', 'Koh Y', 'Burry L', 'Chertow DS', 'Szczeklik W', 'Belley-Cote E', 'Greco M', 'Bala M', 'Zarychanski R', 'Kesecioglu J', 'McGeer A', 'Mermel L', 'Mammen MJ', 'Nainan Myatra S', 'Arrington A', 'Kleinpell R', 'Citerio G', 'Lewis K', 'Bridges E', 'Memish ZA', 'Hammond N', 'Hayden FG', 'Alshahrani M', 'Al Duhailib Z', 'Martin GS', 'Kaplan LJ', 'Coopersmith CM', 'Antonelli M', 'Rhodes A']",2021,49,3,Crit Care Med,"Alhazzani W, et al.

33555346,The Heterogeneous Landscape and Early Evolution of Pathogen-Associated CpG Dinucleotides in SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory syndrome, which can be due to dysregulated immune signaling. We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We characterize CpG content by a CpG force that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino acid levels. The CpG force, as the CpG content, is overall low compared with other pathogenic betacoronaviruses; however, it widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable with the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable with SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the zinc finger antiviral protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias, and the pressure to lower CpG content.","['Di Gioacchino A', 'Šulc P', 'Komarova AV', 'Greenbaum BD', 'Monasson R', 'Cocco S']",2021,38,6,Mol Biol Evol,"Di Gioacchino A, et al.

33552459,Power to the protein: enhancing and combining activities using the Spy toolbox.,"Proteins span an extraordinary range of shapes, sizes and functionalities. Therefore generic approaches are needed to overcome this diversity and stream-line protein analysis or application. Here we review SpyTag technology, now used in hundreds of publications or patents, and its potential for detecting and controlling protein behaviour. SpyTag forms a spontaneous and irreversible isopeptide bond upon binding its protein partner SpyCatcher, where both parts are genetically-encoded. New variants of this pair allow reaction at a rate approaching the diffusion limit, while reversible versions allow purification of SpyTagged proteins or tuned dynamic interaction inside cells. Anchoring of SpyTag-linked proteins has been established to diverse nanoparticles or surfaces, including gold, graphene and the air/water interface. SpyTag/SpyCatcher is mechanically stable, so is widely used for investigating protein folding and force sensitivity. A toolbox of scaffolds allows SpyTag-fusions to be assembled into defined multimers, from dimers to 180-mers, or unlimited 1D, 2D or 3D networks. Icosahedral multimers are being evaluated for vaccination against malaria, HIV and cancer. For enzymes, Spy technology has increased resilience, promoted substrate channelling, and assembled hydrogels for continuous flow biocatalysis. Combinatorial increase in functionality has been achieved through modular derivatisation of antibodies, light-emitting diodes or viral vectors. In living cells, SpyTag allowed imaging of protein trafficking, retargeting of CAR-T cell killing, investigation of heart contraction, and control of nucleosome position. The simple genetic encoding and rapid irreversible reaction provide diverse opportunities to enhance protein function. We describe limitations as well as future directions.","['Keeble AH', 'Howarth M']",2020,11,28,Chem Sci,Keeble AH and Howarth M.

33552444,Current concepts in the development of therapeutics against human and animal coronavirus diseases by targeting NP.,"The coronavirus (CoV) infects a broad range of hosts including humans as well as a variety of animals. It has gained overwhelming concerns since the emergence of deadly human coronaviruses (HCoVs), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015. Very recently, special attention has been paid to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 due to its high mobility and mortality. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, despite vast research efforts, the effective pharmaceutical interventions are still not available for clinical uses. Both expanded knowledge on structure insights and the essential function of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein are key basis for the development of novel, and potentially, a broad-spectrum inhibitor against coronavirus diseases. This review aimed to delineate the current research from the perspective of biochemical and structural study in cell-based assays as well as virtual screen approaches to identify N protein antagonists targeting not only HCoVs but also animal CoVs.","['Tseng YY', 'Liao GR', 'Lien A', 'Hsu WL']",2021,19,,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Tseng YY, et al.

33551039,The Influence of Immune Immaturity on Outcome After Virus Infections.,"Maturation of the adaptive immune response is typically thought to improve outcome to virus infections. However, long-standing observations of natural infections with old viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and newer observations of emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for COVID-19 suggest that immune immaturity may be beneficial for outcome. Mechanistic studies and studies of patients with inborn errors of immunity have revealed that immune dysregulation reflecting inappropriate antibody and T-cell responses plays a crucial role in causing bystander inflammation and more severe disease. Further evidence supports a role for innate immunity in normally regulating adaptive immune responses. Thus, changes in immune responses that normally occur with age may help explain an apparent protective role of immune immaturity during virus infections.","['Shaw ER', 'Su HC']",2021,9,2,J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,Shaw ER and Su HC.

33550964,Emerging Therapeutic Approaches to COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive single-stranded RNA virus having a large genome ~30 kb. SARSCoV- 2 is zoonotic and highly contagious, causing severe pneumonia-like symptoms. The efficacy of the different potential drug and drug candidates against COVID-19 has been investigated, which are under various stages of clinical trials. The drugs effective against SARS, and Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), have been proposed to have a high potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we selected plant-based materials implicated in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19. The plant produces secondary metabolites in response to viral infection. Different classes of secondary metabolites have different mechanisms to counter virus attacks. Many nanomaterials produced by carbohydrates and lipids have been exploited for their in-vitro and in-vivo delivery of antiviral therapeutics. The vaccine has shown impressive results in producing antibodies against SARS-CoV2 and has been evaluated for safety, tolerance, and preliminary immunogenicity. Similarly, DNA/RNA-based therapy has shown high clinical significance. Various forms of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and phytonutrients help to enhance immunity and be implicated in the control of COVID-19. However, such measures should not replace social distancing, quarantine and special care.","['Singh IK', 'Kumari P', 'Mittal P', 'Kumar A', 'Singal B', 'Hasan GM', 'Aggarwal R', 'Kamal MA', 'Singh A', 'Hassan MI']",2021,27,31,Curr Pharm Des,"Singh IK, et al.

33537261,Cross-Immunization Against Respiratory Coronaviruses May Protect Children From SARS-CoV2: More Than a Simple Hypothesis?,"In January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified as responsible for a pandemic acute respiratory syndrome. The virus demonstrated a high infectious capability and not-neglectable mortality in humans. However, similarly to previous SARS and MERS, the new disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 seemed to relatively spare children and younger adults. Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon, including lower ACE2 expression in children, cross-immunization from measles/rubella/mumps and BCG-vaccination, as well as the integrity of respiratory mucosa. Herein, we hypothesize that an additional mechanism might contribute to children's relative protection from SARS-CoV-2, the cross-immunization conferred by previous exposures to other common respiratory coronaviruses. To support our hypothesis, we show a statistically significant similarity in genomic and protein sequences, including epitopes for B- and T-cell immunity, of SARS-CoV-2 and the other beta coronaviruses. Since these coronaviruses are highly diffused across pediatric populations, cross-reactive immunity might reasonably induce an at least partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 in children.","['Piccaluga PP', 'Malerba G', 'Navari M', 'Diani E', 'Concia E', 'Gibellini D']",2020,8,,Front Pediatr,"Piccaluga PP, et al.

Various coronaviruses (CoV) such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and SARS-CoV-2 can infect humans and the name was implicated due to their crown shape. SARS-CoV-2 is also called COVID-19 which was found to be a novel strain of coronavirus and is transmitted primarily through small droplets of viral particles that target the human body through the open pathways. Researchers have observed that microbes can survive for a longer duration as they get adhered to any object or surface. Nanoparticles have the capability to disable these pathogens even before they enter the body. To eradicate conventional time consuming steps like quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of COVID-19, nanoparticles mediated sensing approaches provide great advances in rapid diagnosis. Nanoparticles- based biosensors are comparatively beneficial which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. Nanotechnology can be refined and optimized to attack a wide variety of pathogens.

33534852,"Uncovering potential host proteins and pathways that may interact with eukaryotic short linear motifs in viral proteins of MERS, SARS and SARS2 coronaviruses that infect humans.","A coronavirus pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide since December 2019. Improved understanding and new strategies to cope with novel coronaviruses are urgently needed. Viruses (especially RNA viruses) encode a limited number and size (length of polypeptide chain) of viral proteins and must interact with the host cell components to control (hijack) the host cell machinery. To achieve this goal, the extensive mimicry of SLiMs in host proteins provides an effective strategy. However, little is known regarding SLiMs in coronavirus proteins and their potential targets in host cells. The objective of this study is to uncover SLiMs in coronavirus proteins that are present within host cells. These SLiMs have a high possibility of interacting with host intracellular proteins and hijacking the host cell machinery for virus replication and dissemination. In total, 1,479 SLiM hits were identified in the 16 proteins of 590 coronaviruses infecting humans. Overall, 106 host proteins were identified that may interact with SLiMs in 16 coronavirus proteins. These SLiM-interacting proteins are composed of many intracellular key regulators, such as receptors, transcription factors and kinases, and may have important contributions to virus replication, immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. A total of 209 pathways containing proteins that may interact with SLiMs in coronavirus proteins were identified. This study uncovers potential mechanisms by which coronaviruses hijack the host cell machinery. These results provide potential therapeutic targets for viral infections.","['Yang CW', 'Shi ZL']",2021,16,2,PLoS One,"Yang CW and Shi ZL.

33534822,Rational design of multi epitope-based subunit vaccine by exploring MERS-COV proteome: Reverse vaccinology and molecular docking approach.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), first identified in Saudi Arabia, was caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. Outbreaks were recorded from different regions of the world, especially South Korea and the Middle East, and were correlated with a 35% mortality rate. MERS-COV is a single-stranded, positive RNA virus that reaches the host by binding to the receptor of dipeptidyl-peptides. Because of the unavailability of the vaccine available for the protection from MERS-COV infection, the rapid case detection, isolation, infection prevention has been recommended to combat MERS-COV infection. So, vaccines for the treatment of MERS-COV infection need to be developed urgently. A possible antiviral mechanism for preventing MERS-CoV infection has been considered to be MERS-CoV vaccines that elicit unique T-cell responses. In the present study, we incorporated both molecular docking and immunoinformatic approach to introduce a multiepitope vaccine (MEP) against MERS-CoV by selecting 15 conserved epitopes from seven viral proteins such as three structural proteins (envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein) and four non-structural proteins (ORF1a, ORF8, ORF3, ORF4a). The epitopes, which were examined for non-homologous to host and antigenicity, were selected on the basis of conservation between T-cell, B-cell, and IFN-γ epitopes. The selected epitopes were then connected to the adjuvant (β-defensin) at the N-terminal through an AAY linker to increase the immunogenic potential. Structural modelling and physiochemical characteristic were applied to the vaccine construct developed. Afterwards the structure has been successfully docked with antigenic receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and in-silico cloning ensures that its expression efficiency is legitimate. Nonetheless the MEP presented needs tests to verify its safety and immunogenic profile.","['Ashfaq UA', 'Saleem S', 'Masoud MS', 'Ahmad M', 'Nahid N', 'Bhatti R', 'Almatroudi A', 'Khurshid M']",2021,16,2,PLoS One,"Ashfaq UA, et al.

Interventions to enable people to better cope with such distress should be based on the best available evidence. We therefore performed a scoping review to systematically identify and summarize the available literature of interventions that target the distress of people in the face of highly contagious disease outbreaks.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science (January 2000 to May 7, 2020), and reference lists were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the effects of psychological interventions before, during, and after outbreaks of highly contagious emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, or COVID-19 were included. Study effects were grouped (e.g. for healthcare professionals, community members, people at risk) and intervention contents at the individual and organizational level summarized. We assessed the level of evidence using a modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.
RESULTS: Of 4030 records found, 19 studies were included (two RCTs). Most interventions were delivered during-exposure and face-to-face, focused on healthcare workers and crisis personnel, and combined psychoeducation with training of coping strategies. Based on two high-quality studies, beneficial effects were reported for resilience factors (e.g. positive cognitive appraisal) and professional attitudes of healthcare workers, with mixed findings for mental health (e.g. depression). Across all studies, there was positive qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators. We identified seven ongoing studies mostly using online- and mobile-based deliveries.
CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of interventions to enable people to better cope with the distress of highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks. Besides the need for more high-quality studies, the summarized evidence may inform decision makers to plan interventions during the current pandemic and to develop pandemic preparedness plans.","['Kunzler AM', 'Stoffers-Winterling J', 'Stoll M', 'Mancini AL', 'Lehmann S', 'Blessin M', 'Gilan D', 'Helmreich I', 'Hufert F', 'Lieb K']",2021,16,2,PLoS One,"Kunzler AM, et al.

33531805,Application of Nanotechnology in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been prevalent worldwide for almost a year. In early 2000, there was an outbreak of SARS-CoV, and in early 2010, a similar dissemination of infection by MERS-CoV occurred. However, no clear explanation for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and a massive increase in the number of infections has yet been proposed. The best solution to overcome this pandemic is the development of suitable and effective vaccines and therapeutics. Fortunately, for SARS-CoV-2, the genome sequence and protein structure have been published in a short period, making research and development for prevention and treatment relatively easy. In addition, intranasal drug delivery has proven to be an effective method of administration for treating viral lung diseases. In recent years, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been applied to intranasal drug delivery to overcome various limitations that occur during mucosal administration, and advances have been made to the stage where effective drug delivery is possible. This review describes the accumulated knowledge of the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and aims to help understand the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it elucidates the achievements in developing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to date through existing approaches. Finally, the applicable nanotechnology approach is described in detail, and vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed based on nanomedicine, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, have presented the potential to become innovative alternatives for overcoming COVID-19.",['Yang D'],2021,16,,Int J Nanomedicine,Yang D.

Nowadays, coronaviruses - and specifically, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - are the principal responsible for the major epidemic outbreaks of the 21st century. The major routes of transmission for respiratory viruses - including coronaviruses - are via direct and indirect contacts. However, transmission through contaminated foods has not been extensively assessed. The present paper was aimed at reviewing scientific data on the transmission of respiratory viruses through potentially contaminated foods. While the current data seem to suggest that this route of transmission is not likely to occur, in order to increase the knowledge on this issue further investigations are still clearly necessary for a more complete prevention of the risks. Studies should include fresh produce and cooked foods. Anyway, prevention measures and good hygienic practices for both consumers and workers are mandatory when handling and cooking foods.","['González N', 'Marquès M', 'Domingo JL']",2021,195,,Environ Res,"González N, et al.

We aimed to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA shedding, and viable virus shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in various body fluids, and to compare SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral dynamics.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, 
FINDINGS: 79 studies (5340 individuals) on SARS-CoV-2, eight studies (1858 individuals) on SARS-CoV, and 11 studies (799 individuals) on MERS-CoV were included. Mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 17·0 days (95% CI 15·5-18·6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) in upper respiratory tract, 14·6 days (9·3-20·0; seven studies, 260 individuals) in lower respiratory tract, 17·2 days (14·4-20·1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) in stool, and 16·6 days (3·6-29·7; two studies, 108 individuals) in serum samples. Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304 [95% CI 0·115-0·493]; p=0·0016). No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads, which were inferred from cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the first week of illness, whereas that of SARS-CoV peaked at days 10-14 and that of MERS-CoV peaked at days 7-10.
INTERPRETATION: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2.

33521616,Disruption of CCR5 signaling to treat COVID-19-associated cytokine storm: Case series of four critically ill patients treated with leronlimab.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The number of confirmed cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 continues to escalate with over 70 million confirmed cases and over 1.6 million confirmed deaths. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulated host immune response to the virus, which is thought to lead to pathogenic immune dysregulation and end-organ damage. Presently few effective treatment options are available to treat COVID-19. Leronlimab is a humanized IgG4, kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). It has been shown that in patients with severe COVID-19 treatment with leronlimab reduces elevated plasma IL-6 and chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and normalized CD4/CD8 ratios. We administered leronlimab to 4 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care. All 4 of these patients improved clinically as measured by vasopressor support, and discontinuation of hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation. Following administration of leronlimab there was a statistically significant decrease in IL-6 observed in patient A (p=0.034) from day 0-7 and patient D (p=0.027) from day 0-14. This corresponds to restoration of the immune function as measured by CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. Although two of the patients went on to survive the other two subsequently died of surgical complications after an initial recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Agresti N', 'Lalezari JP', 'Amodeo PP', 'Mody K', 'Mosher SF', 'Seethamraju H', 'Kelly SA', 'Pourhassan NZ', 'Sudduth CD', 'Bovinet C', 'ElSharkawi AE', 'Patterson BK', 'Stephen R', 'Sacha JB', 'Wu HL', 'Gross SA', 'Dhody K']",2021,4,,J Transl Autoimmun,"Agresti N, et al.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses known as coronaviruses, including the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respectively. These coronaviruses are associated in the way that they cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract illness. This study has used an unbiased analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus to understand the shared and unique transcriptional signatures of human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 relative to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. A major goal was to discover unique cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 among these three coronaviruses. Analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by the three datasets led to a set of 17 genes, suggesting the lower expression of genes related to acute inflammatory response (TNF, IL32, IL1A, CXCL1, and CXCL3) in SARS-CoV-2. This subdued transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 may cause prolonged viral replication, leading to severe lung damage. Downstream analysis of unique DEGs of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed changes in genes related to apoptosis (NRP1, FOXO1, TP53INP1, CSF2, and NLRP1), coagulation (F3, PROS1, ITGB3, and TFPI2), and vascular function (VAV3, TYMP, TCF4, and NR2F2), which may contribute to more systemic cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 than MERS and SARS. The study has uncovered a novel set of transcriptomic signatures unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection and shared by three coronaviruses, which may guide the initial efforts in the development of prognostic or therapeutic tools for COVID-19.","['Jha PK', 'Vijay A', 'Halu A', 'Uchida S', 'Aikawa M']",2020,7,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Jha PK, et al.

33520952,Evolutionarily Conserved Long Non-coding RNA Regulates Gene Expression in Cytokine Storm During COVID-19.,"Coronavirus is a family of viruses including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-coronaviruses. Only alpha- and betacoronaviruses have been observed to infect humans. Past outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both betacoronavirus, are the result of a spillover from animals. Recently, a new strain termed SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Severe cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). One contributor to the development of ARDS is cytokine storm, an overwhelming inflammatory immune response. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are genetic regulatory elements that, among many functions, alter gene expression and cellular processes. lncRNAs identified to be pertinent in COVID-19 cytokine storm have the potential to serve as disease markers or drug targets. This project aims to computationally identify conserved lncRNAs potentially regulating gene expression in cytokine storm during COVID-19. We found 22 lncRNAs that can target 10 cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 cytokine storm, 8 of which targeted two or more cytokine storm cytokines. In particular, the lncRNA non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD), targeted five out of the ten identified cytokine storm cytokines, and is evolutionarily conserved across multiple species.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial correlations between urban characteristics, taking into account the socio-ecological aspects, and the emergence of infectious diseases. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression between the infectious disease emergence data and 14 urban characteristics, we analyzed 225 spatial units in South Korea, where there was a re-emergence of measles and a 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As results of exploratory spatial data analysis, the emerging infectious diseases had spatial dependence and showed spatial clusters. Spatial regression models showed that urban characteristic factors had different effects according to the type of infectious disease. Common factors were characteristics related to low socioeconomic status in water or food-borne diseases and manageable infectious diseases. Intermittent infections disease epidemics are related to high-quality residential environments and the response capacity of the local government.

At the time of writing this (October 14, 2020), more than 38.4 million people have become affected, and 1.0 million people have died across the world. The death rate is undoubtedly correlated with the cytokine storm and other pathological pulmonary characteristics, as a result of which the lungs cannot provide sufficient oxygen to the body's vital organs. While diversified drugs have been tested as a first line therapy, the complexity of fatal cases has not been reduced so far, and the world is looking for a treatment to combat the virus. However, to date, and despite such promise, we have received very limited information about the potential of nanomedicine to fight against COVID-19 or as an adjunct therapy in the treatment regimen. Over the past two decades, various therapeutic strategies, including direct-acting antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, a few non-specific drugs (simple to complex), have been explored to treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), influenza, and sometimes the common flu, thus, correlating and developing specific drugs centric to COVID-19 is possible. This review article focuses on the pulmonary pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens, highlighting possible nanomedicine therapeutic strategies that should be further tested immediately.","['Bonam SR', 'Kotla NG', 'Bohara RA', 'Rochev Y', 'Webster TJ', 'Bayry J']",2021,36,,Nano Today,"Bonam SR, et al.

33519324,Real-time measurement of the uncertain epidemiological appearances of COVID-19 infections.,"Virus diseases are a continued threat to human health in both community and healthcare settings. The current virus disease COVID-19 outbreak raises an unparalleled public health issue for the world at large. Wuhan is the city in China from where this virus came first and, after some time the whole world was affected by this severe disease. It is a challenge for every country's people and higher authorities to fight with this battle due to the insufficient number of resources. On-going assessment of the epidemiological features and future impacts of the COVID-19 disease is required to stay up-to-date of any changes to its spread dynamics and foresee needed resources and consequences in different aspects as social or economic ones. This paper proposes a prediction model of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19. The model is based on a deep learning algorithm with two long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. We consider the available infection cases of COVID-19 in India from January 22, 2020, till October 9, 2020, and parameterize the model. The proposed model is an inference to obtain predicted coronavirus cases and deaths for the next 30 days, taking the data of the previous 260 days of duration of the pandemic. The proposed deep learning model has been compared with other popular prediction methods (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest) showing a lower normalized RMSE. This work also compares COVID-19 with other previous diseases (SARS, MERS, h1n1, Ebola, and 2019-nCoV). Based on the mortality rate and virus spread, this study concludes that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is more dangerous than other diseases.","['Gupta M', 'Jain R', 'Taneja S', 'Chaudhary G', 'Khari M', 'Verdú E']",2021,101,,Appl Soft Comput,"Gupta M, et al.

A review.,"In recent years increased attention is focussed on microorganisms inhabiting the digestive system that provides prophylactic and therapeutic benefits to the host. After Metchnikoff exposed the secret behind Bulgarian peasants' extended longevity, a graze to incorporate the responsible microbes in functional food emerged. Then interest towards microbe-rich food went to the vegetative phase for some time, but now a renaissance to engage these wonder microbes in the healthcare sector is increasing. With a new definition, probiotics, these good microbes have been widely applied in different types of products, either as pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, or foods. Probiotics, a significant source in functional dairy products, claims diverse roles such as improving intestinal tract health, enhancing the immune system, synthesizing and enhancing the bioavailability of nutrients, reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals, and reducing the risk of certain cancers. In the recent COVID-19 issue, searches are going fast to use probiotics as vaccine carriers, dysbiosis balancer, and immunity booster. The high expectation from probiotics expanded the development of bioengineered probiotics as new-generation probiotics. From the animal model and in vitro studies, the probiotic intervention is extrapolated to innate and adaptive immunity inducer against SARS viral infections. The possibility of using it as prophylactic and therapeutic agents in COVID-19 is explored. However, its significant activity against corona virus-induced respiratory syndromes is questioned by a few researchers also. The emerging citations on the research approach and meta-analysis of probiotic intervention against the re-emerging pandemic viral attack on the respiratory and gastrointestinal domains need to be analyzed in this context.

We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China. A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation.","['Lu M', 'Wang X', 'Ye H', 'Wang H', 'Qiu S', 'Zhang H', 'Liu Y', 'Luo J', 'Feng J']",2021,254,,Biol Conserv,"Lu M, et al.

33516969,Codon usage analysis of zoonotic coronaviruses reveals lower adaptation to humans by SARS-CoV-2.,"Since 2002, the world has witnessed major outbreaks of acute respiratory illness by three zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), which differ from each other in pathogenicity. Reasons for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 than the other two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not well understood. We herein compared the codon usage patterns of the three zoonotic CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndromes and four human-specific CoVs (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1) causing mild diseases. We found that the seven viruses have different codon usages, with SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest effective number of codons (ENC) among the zoonotic CoVs. Human codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis revealed that the CAI value of SARS-CoV-2 is the lowest among the zoonotic CoVs. The ENC and CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were more similar to those of the less-pathogenic human-specific CoVs. To further investigate adaptive evolution within SARS-CoV-2, we examined codon usage patterns in 3573 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 collected over the initial 4 months of the pandemic. We showed that the ENC values and the CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were decreasing over the period. The low ENC and CAI values could be responsible for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. While mutational pressure appears to shape codon adaptation in the overall genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic CoVs, the E gene of SARS-CoV-2, which has the highest codon usage bias, appears to be under strong natural selection. Data from the study contribute to our understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","['Huang W', 'Guo Y', 'Li N', 'Feng Y', 'Xiao L']",2021,89,,Infect Genet Evol,"Huang W, et al.

33511840,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Mutated Variants via CRISPR-Cas13-Based Transcription Amplification.,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global health emergency, and its gene mutation and evolution further posed uncertainty of epidemic risk. Herein, we reported a light-up CRISPR-Cas13 transcription amplification method, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated variants. Sequence specificity was ensured by both the ligation process and Cas13a/crRNA recognition, allowing us to identify viral RNA mutation. Light-up RNA aptamer allows sensitive output of amplification signals via target-activated ribonuclease activity of CRISPR-Cas13a. The RNA virus assay has been designed to detect coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS, as well as the influenza viruses such as, H1N1, H7N9, and H9N2. It was accommodated to sense as low as 82 copies of SARS-CoV-2. Particularly, it allowed us to strictly discriminate key mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, D614G, which may induce higher epidemic and pathogenetic risk. The proposed RNA virus assays are promising for point-of-care monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and its risking variants.","['Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen J', 'Wang M', 'Zhang T', 'Luo W', 'Li Y', 'Wu Y', 'Zeng B', 'Zhang K', 'Deng R', 'Li W']",2021,93,7,Anal Chem,"Wang Y, et al.

Therefore, this study was conducted to combat major CoVs via a trivalent subunit vaccine, which was engineered by implementing sequences of spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M) protein, non-structural protein (nsp) 3, and nsp8 antigens. The CTL, HTL, MHC I, and IFN-γ epitopes were predicted via CTLPRED, IEDB, and IFN epitope servers, respectively. Also, to stimulate strong helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses, Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) was used. Also, for boosting the immune response, β-defensin 2 was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Furthermore, TAT was applied to the vaccine to facilitate the intracellular delivery. Finally, TAT, adjuvant, PADRE, and selected epitopes were appropriately assembled. Based on the predicted epitopes, a trivalent multi-epitope vaccine with a molecular weight of 74.8 kDa was constructed. Further analyses predicted the molecule to be a strong antigen, and a non-allergenic and soluble protein. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted. Additionally, analyses validated the stability of the proposed vaccine.

33504944,Elucidating the tunability of binding behavior for the MERS-CoV macro domain with NAD metabolites.,"The macro domain is an ADP-ribose (ADPR) binding module, which is considered to act as a sensor to recognize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolites, including poly ADPR (PAR) and other small molecules. The recognition of macro domains with various ligands is important for a variety of biological functions involved in NAD metabolism, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, maintenance of genomic stability, and response to viral infection. Nevertheless, how the macro domain binds to moieties with such structural obstacles using a simple cleft remains a puzzle. We systematically investigated the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) macro domain for its ligand selectivity and binding properties by structural and biophysical approaches. Of interest, NAD, which is considered not to interact with macro domains, was co-crystallized with the MERS-CoV macro domain. Further studies at physiological temperature revealed that NAD has similar binding ability with ADPR because of the accommodation of the thermal-tunable binding pocket. This study provides the biochemical and structural bases of the detailed ligand-binding mode of the MERS-CoV macro domain. In addition, our observation of enhanced binding affinity of the MERS-CoV macro domain to NAD at physiological temperature highlights the need for further study to reveal the biological functions.","['Lin MH', 'Cho CC', 'Chiu YC', 'Chien CY', 'Huang YP', 'Chang CF', 'Hsu CH']",2021,4,1,Commun Biol,"Lin MH, et al.

33504319,Patents Related to Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease since the beginning of the 21st century, representing a significant threat to public health. Together, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have caused a large number of deaths around the world. Thus, investments in research and the development of strategies aimed at diagnosing, treating, and preventing these infections are urgently needed.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the patents that address pathogenic coronaviruses in Google Patents databases in the last year (2019-2020).
METHODS: The search strategy was carried out in April 2020, based on the keywords ""SARS"", ""SARS-CoV"", ""MERS"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19. Out of the patents examined, 25 were selected for a short description in this study.
RESULTS: A total of 191 patents were analyzed, 149 of which were related to SARS-CoV, and 29 and 12 were related to MERS-CoV and SARS- CoV2, respectively. The patents addressed the issues of diagnosis, therapeutic agents, prevention and control, along with other applications.
CONCLUSION: Several promising strategies have been documented in intellectual property databases favoring the need for further studies on the pathogenesis and optimization of the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for these emerging infections.","['Dos Santos M', 'Ferreira AVF', 'da Silva JO', 'Nogueira LM', 'Machado JM', 'Francisco MFC', 'da Paz MC', 'Giunchetti RC', 'Galdino AS']",2021,15,1,Recent Pat Biotechnol,"Dos Santos M, et al.

33502002,Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review.,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","['Burns J', 'Movsisyan A', 'Stratil JM', 'Coenen M', 'Emmert-Fees KM', 'Geffert K', 'Hoffmann S', 'Horstick O', 'Laxy M', 'Pfadenhauer LM', 'von Philipsborn P', 'Sell K', 'Voss S', 'Rehfuess E']",2020,10,,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Burns J, et al.

33500147,Rare SARS-CoV-2 antibody development in cancer patients.,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and immunity will be crucial for the further course of the pandemic. Until now, it has been assumed that patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop antibodies as has been the case with other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19. Understanding the adaptive and humoral response to SARS-CoV2 will play a key role in vaccine development and gaining further knowledge on the pathogenesis.","['Hempel L', 'Molnar J', 'Robert S', 'Veloso J', 'Trepotec Z', 'Englisch S', 'Weinzierl P', 'Schick C', 'Milani V', 'Schweneker K', 'Fleischmann B', 'Scheiber J', 'Gandorfer B', 'Kleespies A', 'Hempel D', 'Riedmann K', 'Piehler A']",2021,48,2,Semin Oncol,"Hempel L, et al.

Here, we performed an analysis of the protease recognition sites and antigenic variation of the S-protein of these HCoVs. We showed tissue-specific expression pattern, functions, and a number of recognition sites of proteases in S-proteins from seven strains of HCoVs. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we found two new protease recognition sites, each of calpain-2, pepsin-A, and caspase-8, and one new protease recognition site each of caspase-6, caspase-3, and furin. Our antigenic mapping study of the S-protein of these HCoVs showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain has the most potent antigenic epitopes (highest antigenicity score with maximum numbers of epitope regions). Additionally, the other six strains of HCoVs show common antigenic epitopes (both B-cell and T-cell), with low antigenicity scores compared to SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that the molecular evolution of structural proteins of human CoV can be classified, such as (i) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, (ii) SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV and (iii) HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In conclusion, we can presume that our study might help to prepare the interventions for the possible HCoVs outbreaks in the future.","['Chakraborty C', 'Sharma AR', 'Bhattacharya M', 'Saha RP', 'Ghosh S', 'Biswas S', 'Samanta S', 'Sharma G', 'Agoramoorthy G', 'Lee SS']",2021,89,,Infect Genet Evol,"Chakraborty C, et al.

33496060,Targeting cyclooxygenase enzyme for the adjuvant COVID-19 therapy.,"Despite vigorous efforts, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a toll on the global health. The contemporary therapeutic regime focused on the viral spike proteins, viral 3CL protease enzyme, immunomodulation, inhibition of viral replication, and providing a symptomatic relief encouraged the repurposing of drugs to meet the urgency of treatment. Similarly, the representative drugs that proved beneficial to alleviate SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HIV, ZIKV, H1N1, and malarial infection in the past presented a sturdy candidature for ameliorating the COVID-19 therapeutic doctrine. However, most of the deliberations for developing effective pharmaceuticals proved inconsequential, thereby encouraging the identification of new pathways, and novel pharmaceuticals for capping the COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 contagion encompasses a burst release of the cytokines that increase the severity of the infection mainly due to heightened immunopathogenicity. The pro-inflammatory metabolites, COX-2, cPLA2, and 5-LOX enzymes involved in their generation, and the substrates that instigate the origination of the innate inflammatory response therefore play an important role in intensifying and worsening of the tissue morbidity related to the coronavirus infection. The deployment of representative drugs for inhibiting these overexpressed immunogenic pathways in the tissues invaded by coronaviruses has been a matter of debate since the inception of the pandemic. The effectiveness of NSAIDs such as Aspirin, Indomethacin, Diclofenac, and Celecoxib in COVID-19 coagulopathy, discouraging the SARS viral replication, the inflammasome deactivation, and synergistic inhibition of H5N1 viral infection with representative antiviral drugs respectively, have provided a silver lining in adjuvant COVID-19 therapy. Since the anti-inflammatory NSAIDs and COXIBs mainly function by reversing the COX-2 overexpression to modulate the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, these drugs present a robust treatment option for COVID-19 infection. This commentary succinctly highlights the various claims that support the status of immunomodulatory NSAIDs, and COXIBs in the adjuvant COVID-19 therapy.","['Prasher P', 'Sharma M', 'Gunupuru R']",2021,82,4,Drug Dev Res,"Prasher P, et al.

33495714,Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to glycans.,"The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a high number of deaths in the world. To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing glycolipids/glycoproteins. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS)-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.","['Hao W', 'Ma B', 'Li Z', 'Wang X', 'Gao X', 'Li Y', 'Qin B', 'Shang S', 'Cui S', 'Tan Z']",2021,66,12,Sci Bull (Beijing),"Hao W, et al.

33487665,COVID-19 Treatment: Drug Safety Prior to Conception and During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.,"In December 2019, a new viral respiratory infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, China. COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a similar virus to those involved in other epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 frequently affects young adults of reproductive age and that the elderly and patients with chronic disease have high mortality rates. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and breastfeeding. Most COVID-19 cases present with mild flu-like symptoms and only require treatment with symptomatic relief medications, whereas other cases with COVID-19 require treatment in an intensive care unit. There is currently no specific effective treatment for COVID-19. A large number of drugs are being used to fight infection by SARS-CoV-2. Experience with this therapeutic arsenal has been gained over the years in the treatment of other viral, autoimmune, parasitic, and bacterial diseases. Importantly, the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19 cannot expose pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to the potential teratogenic risks of these drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and understand the safety of anti-COVID-19 therapies prior to conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.","['Cavalcante MB', 'Cavalcante CTMB', 'Braga ACS', 'Andrade DA', 'Montenegro MA', 'Santos PAN', 'Motoyama PVP', 'Rocha MG', 'Dib LA', 'Araujo Júnior E']",2021,81,1,Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd,"Cavalcante MB, et al.

33487203,Risk factors and protective measures for healthcare worker infection during highly infectious viral respiratory epidemics: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for healthcare worker (HCW) infection in viral respiratory pandemics: severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1, influenza A H1N1, influenza H5N1. To improve understanding of HCW risk management amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from conception until July 2020 for studies comparing infected HCWs (cases) and noninfected HCWs (controls) and risk factors for infection. Outcomes included HCW types, infection prevention practices, and medical procedures. Pooled effect estimates with pathogen-specific stratified meta-analysis and inverse variance meta-regression analysis were completed. We used the GRADE framework to rate certainty of evidence. (PROSPERO no. CRD42020176232, 6 April 2020.).
RESULTS: In total, 54 comparative studies were included (n = 191,004 HCWs). Compared to nonfrontline HCWs, frontline HCWs were at increased infection risk (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.24-2.22), and the risk was greater for HCWs involved in endotracheal intubations (risk difference, 35.2%; 95% CI, 21.4-47.9). Use of gloves, gown, surgical mask, N95 respirator, face protection, and infection training were each strongly protective against infection. Meta-regression showed reduced infection risk in frontline HCWs working in facilities with infection designated wards (OR, -1.04; 95% CI, -1.53 to -0.33, P = .004) and performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in designated centers (OR, -1.30; 95% CI, -2.52 to -0.08; P = .037).
CONCLUSIONS: During highly infectious respiratory pandemics, widely available protective measures such as use of gloves, gowns, and face masks are strongly protective against infection and should be instituted, preferably in dedicated settings, to protect frontline HCW during waves of respiratory virus pandemics.","['Tian C', 'Lovrics O', 'Vaisman A', 'Chin KJ', 'Tomlinson G', 'Lee Y', 'Englesakis M', 'Parotto M', 'Singh M']",2022,43,5,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Tian C, et al.

33486372,Bioinformatics prediction of B and T cell epitopes within the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV2.,"BACKGROUND: The striking difference in severity of SARS CoV2 infection among global population is partly attributed to viral factors. With the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) are the most immunogenic subunits, genetic diversity and antigenicity of S and N are key players in virulence and in vaccine development.
AIM: This paper aims at identifying immunogenic targets for better vaccine development and/or immunotherapy of COVID 19 pandemic.
METHODS: 18 complete genomes of SARS CoV2 (n=14), SARS CoV (n=2) and MERS CoV (n=2) were examined. Bioinformatics of viral genetics and protein folding allowed functional tuning of NH2 Terminal Domain (NTD) of S protein and development of epitope maps for B and T cell responses.
CONCLUSION: A deletion of amino acid residues Y144 and G107 were discovered in NTD of S protein derived from Indian and French isolates resulting in altered pocket structure exclusively located in NTD and reduced affinity of NTD binding to endogenous nAbs and disrupted NTD mediated cell entry. We therefore, proposed a set of B and T cell epitopes based on Immune Epitope Database, homologous epitopes for nAbs in convalescent plasma post SARS CoV infection and functional domains of S (NTD, Receptor Binding domain and the unique polybasic Furin cleavage site at S1/S2 junction). Nevertheless, laboratory data are required to develop vaccine and immunotherapeutics.","['Dawood RM', 'El-Meguid MA', 'Salum GM', 'El-Wakeel K', 'Shemis M', 'El Awady MK']",2021,14,2,J Infect Public Health,"Dawood RM, et al.

33482181,A review of potential suggested drugs for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) treatment.,"The latest pandemic, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is associated with high prevalence and easy transmission, which is expanding globally with no conventional treatment or vaccine. The new virus revealed 79% and 50% genomic similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively. Accordingly, since the disease resists testing and adopting new therapeutics, repositioning pre-existing drugs may present a fast and attractive strategy with known safety, characteristics, and dosage used. However, they are not specific and targeted. Therefore, several drugs have been investigated for their efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19; most of them are undergoing clinical trials. This article summarizes clinical investigations of potential therapeutic drugs used as COVID-19 therapy. Subsequently, it prepares a pattern of results and therapeutic targets to help further experiment designs. We have investigated drugs as classified in the following three groups; 1) The drugs which computationally showed effectiveness (in silico) but needed further lab confirmations; 2) Emetine, Teicoplanin, and Nelfinavir have shown effectiveness in vitro; 3) The drugs currently under clinical trial.","['Tarighi P', 'Eftekhari S', 'Chizari M', 'Sabernavaei M', 'Jafari D', 'Mirzabeigi P']",2021,895,,Eur J Pharmacol,"Tarighi P, et al.

33473223,"Lessons from the host defences of bats, a unique viral reservoir.","There have been several major outbreaks of emerging viral diseases, including Hendra, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-as well as the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Notably, all of these outbreaks have been linked to suspected zoonotic transmission of bat-borne viruses. Bats-the only flying mammal-display several additional features that are unique among mammals, such as a long lifespan relative to body size, a low rate of tumorigenesis and an exceptional ability to host viruses without presenting clinical disease. Here we discuss the mechanisms that underpin the host defence system and immune tolerance of bats, and their ramifications for human health and disease. Recent studies suggest that 64 million years of adaptive evolution have shaped the host defence system of bats to balance defence and tolerance, which has resulted in a unique ability to act as an ideal reservoir host for viruses. Lessons from the effective host defence of bats would help us to better understand viral evolution and to better predict, prevent and control future viral spillovers. Studying the mechanisms of immune tolerance in bats could lead to new approaches to improving human health. We strongly believe that it is time to focus on bats in research for the benefit of both bats and humankind.","['Irving AT', 'Ahn M', 'Goh G', 'Anderson DE', 'Wang LF']",2021,589,7842,Nature,"Irving AT, et al.

33471720,Considerations for Gut Microbiota and Probiotics in Patients with Diabetes Amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review.,"OBJECTIVE: To review data implicating microbiota influences on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes.
METHODS: Primary literature review included topics: ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS,"" ""MERS,"" ""gut micro-biota,"" ""probiotics,"" ""immune system,"" ""ACE2,"" and ""metformin.""
RESULTS: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19-related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes.","['Barengolts E', 'Smith ED']",2020,26,10,Endocr Pract,Barengolts E and Smith ED.

33468689,At Least Seven Distinct Rotavirus Genotype Constellations in Bats with Evidence of Reassortment and Zoonotic Transmissions.,"Bats host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that rotavirus A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from Europe, Central America, and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA, and 11 of those were fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were identified, which included evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite various levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses.","['Simsek C', 'Corman VM', 'Everling HU', 'Lukashev AN', 'Rasche A', 'Maganga GD', 'Binger T', 'Jansen D', 'Beller L', 'Deboutte W', 'Gloza-Rausch F', 'Seebens-Hoyer A', 'Yordanov S', 'Sylverken A', 'Oppong S', 'Sarkodie YA', 'Vallo P', 'Leroy EM', 'Bourgarel M', 'Yinda KC', 'Van Ranst M', 'Drosten C', 'Drexler JF', 'Matthijnssens J']",2021,12,1,mBio,"Simsek C, et al.

33468070,Critically ill patients with diabetes and Middle East respiratory syndrome: a multi-center observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for infection with coronaviruses. This study describes the demographic, clinical data, and outcomes of critically ill patients with diabetes and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia (September 2012-January 2018). We compared the demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, presenting symptoms and signs, management and clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with MERS who had diabetes compared to those with no diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if diabetes was an independent predictor of 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 350 critically ill patients with MERS, 171 (48.9%) had diabetes. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be older, and have comorbid conditions, compared to patients with no diabetes. They were more likely to present with respiratory failure requiring intubation, vasopressors, and corticosteroids. The median time to clearance of MERS-CoV RNA was similar (23 days (Q1, Q3: 17, 36) in patients with diabetes and 21.0 days (Q1, Q3: 10, 33) in patients with no diabetes). Mortality at 90 days was higher in patients with diabetes (78.9% versus 54.7%, p < 0.0001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that diabetes was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.72).

33466241,COVID-19 Pandemic Is a Call to Search for Alternative Protein Sources as Food and Feed: A Review of Possibilities.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health challenge with substantial adverse effects on the world economy. It is beyond any doubt that it is, again, a call-to-action to minimize the risk of future zoonoses caused by emerging human pathogens. The primary response to contain zoonotic diseases is to call for more strict regulations on wildlife trade and hunting. This is because the origins of coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as other viral pathogens (e.g., Ebola, HIV) are traceable to wild animals. Although COVID-19 is not related to livestock animals, the pandemic increased general attention given to zoonotic viral infections-the risk of which can also be associated with livestock. Therefore, this paper discusses the potential transformation of industrial livestock farming and the production of animal products, particularly meat, to decrease the risks for transmission of novel human pathogens. Plant-based diets have a number of advantages, but it is unrealistic to consider them as the only solution offered to the problem. Therefore, a search for alternative protein sources in insect-based foods and cultured meat, important technologies enabling safer meat production. Although both of these strategies offer a number of potential advantages, they are also subject to the number of challenges that are discussed in this paper. Importantly, insect-based foods and cultured meat can provide additional benefits in the context of ecological footprint, an aspect important in light of predicted climate changes. Furthermore, cultured meat can be regarded as ethically superior and supports better food security. There is a need to further support the implementation and expansion of all three approaches discussed in this paper, plant-based diets, insect-based foods, and cultured meat, to decrease the epidemiological risks and ensure a sustainable future. Furthermore, cultured meat also offers a number of additional benefits in the context of environmental impact, ethical issues, and food security.","['Rzymski P', 'Kulus M', 'Jankowski M', 'Dompe C', 'Bryl R', 'Petitte JN', 'Kempisty B', 'Mozdziak P']",2021,13,1,Nutrients,"Rzymski P, et al.

While RNA recombination is required during normal CoV replication, the mechanisms and determinants of CoV recombination are not known. CoVs encode an RNA proofreading exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) that is distinct from the CoV polymerase and is responsible for high-fidelity RNA synthesis, resistance to nucleoside analogues, immune evasion, and virulence. Here, we demonstrate that CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and the model CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV), generate extensive and diverse recombination products during replication in culture. We show that the MHV nsp14-ExoN is required for native recombination, and that inactivation of ExoN results in decreased recombination frequency and altered recombination products. These results add yet another critical function to nsp14-ExoN, highlight the uniqueness of the evolved coronavirus replicase, and further emphasize nsp14-ExoN as a central, completely conserved, and vulnerable target for inhibitors and attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging zoonotic CoVs.","['Gribble J', 'Stevens LJ', 'Agostini ML', 'Anderson-Daniels J', 'Chappell JD', 'Lu X', 'Pruijssers AJ', 'Routh AL', 'Denison MR']",2021,17,1,PLoS Pathog,"Gribble J, et al.

Although unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS. In this article, we first provided an overview of COVID-19 etiology vis-à-vis other zoonotic diseases, particularly SARS and MERS. Then, we summarized the characteristics of droplets/aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and how they aid in the transmission of the virus among people. Moreover, we discussed the molecular mechanisms that enable SARS-CoV-2 to access the host and become more contagious than other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. Further, we outlined various approaches that are currently being employed to diagnose and symptomatically treat COVID-19 in the clinic.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for its pathogenesis. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Initially, it was thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, we now recognize that COVID-19 also affects several other organs, including the nervous system. Two similar human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are also known to cause disease in the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are growing rapidly, as evidenced by several reports. There are several mechanisms responsible for such manifestations in the nervous system. For instance, post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states are commonly involved. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, and muscle injury are numerous examples of COVID-19 PNS (peripheral nervous system) disease. Likewise, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, encephalopathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, endothelialitis, and venous sinus thrombosis are some instances of COVID-19 CNS disease. Due to multifactorial and complicated pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a large-scale threat to the whole nervous system. A complete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurological impairments is still lacking, but our knowledge base is rapidly expanding. Therefore, we anticipate that this comprehensive review will provide valuable insights and facilitate the work of neuroscientists in unfolding different neurological dimensions of COVID-19 and other CoV associated abnormalities.","['Jha NK', 'Ojha S', 'Jha SK', 'Dureja H', 'Singh SK', 'Shukla SD', 'Chellappan DK', 'Gupta G', 'Bhardwaj S', 'Kumar N', 'Jeyaraman M', 'Jain R', 'Muthu S', 'Kar R', 'Kumar D', 'Goswami VK', 'Ruokolainen J', 'Kesari KK', 'Singh SK', 'Dua K']",2021,71,11,J Mol Neurosci,"Jha NK, et al.

33464307,Mapping and role of T cell response in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice.,"Virus-specific T cells play essential roles in protection against multiple virus infections, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. While SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been identified in COVID-19 patients, their role in the protection of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice is not established. Here, using mice sensitized for infection with SARS-CoV-2 by transduction with an adenovirus expressing the human receptor (Ad5-hACE2), we identified SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Virus-specific T cells were polyfunctional and were able to lyse target cells in vivo. Further, type I interferon pathway was proved to be critical for generating optimal antiviral T cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell vaccination alone partially protected SARS-CoV-2-infected mice from severe disease. In addition, the results demonstrated cross-reactive T cell responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but not MERS-CoV, in mice. Understanding the role of the T cell response will guide immunopathogenesis studies of COVID-19 and vaccine design and validation.","['Zhuang Z', 'Lai X', 'Sun J', 'Chen Z', 'Zhang Z', 'Dai J', 'Liu D', 'Li Y', 'Li F', 'Wang Y', 'Zhu A', 'Wang J', 'Yang W', 'Huang J', 'Li X', 'Hu L', 'Wen L', 'Zhuo J', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen D', 'Li S', 'Huang S', 'Shi Y', 'Zheng K', 'Zhong N', 'Zhao J', 'Zhou D', 'Zhao J']",2021,218,4,J Exp Med,"Zhuang Z, et al.

33463470,An Updated Review on Betacoronavirus Viral Entry Inhibitors: Learning from Past Discoveries to Advance COVID-19 Drug Discovery.,"Even after one year of its first outbreak reported in China, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still sweeping the World, causing serious infections and claiming more fatalities. COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus (β-CoVs), which is of greatest clinical importance since it contains many other viruses that cause respiratory disease in humans, including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS. The spike (S) glycoprotein of β-CoVs is a key virulence factor in determining disease pathogenesis and host tropism, and it also mediates virus binding to the host's receptors to allow viral entry into host cells, i.e., the first step in virus lifecycle. Viral entry inhibitors are considered promising putative drugs for COVID-19. Herein, we mined the biomedical literature for viral entry inhibitors of other coronaviruses, with special emphasis on β-CoVs entry inhibitors. We also outlined the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and how it differs from other β-CoVs to better understand the structural determinants of S protein binding to its human receptor (ACE2). This review highlighted several promising viral entry inhibitors as potential treatments for COVID-19.","['Sabbah DA', 'Hajjo R', 'Bardaweel SK', 'Zhong HA']",2021,21,7,Curr Top Med Chem,"Sabbah DA, et al.

METHODS: A total of 107 patients admitted to a CTC were included as the study population, and their mental health problems including depression (patient health questionnaire-9), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder scale-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist-5) and somatic symptoms (by patient health questionnaire-15) were evaluated every week during their stay. The stigma related to COVID-19 infection was evaluated with an adjusted version of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) stigma scale.
RESULTS: During the first week of isolation, the prevalence of more-than-moderate depression was 24.3%, more-than-moderate anxiety was 14.9%, more-than-moderate somatic symptoms was 36.5% and possible PTSD was 5.6% of total population. For depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors. For PTSD, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection as well as total duration of isolation were found to be significant risk factors. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and possible PTSD remained similar across the four weeks of observations, though the prevalence of severe depression, increased after four weeks of stay. Somatic symptoms seemed to decrease during their stay.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that social mitigation of COVID-19 related stigma, as well as care of patients with pre-existing mental health problems are important mental health measures during this crisis period. It is also important that clinical guidelines and public health policies be well balanced over the protection of the public and those quarantined to minimize the negative psychosocial consequences from isolation of the patients.","['Kang E', 'Lee SY', 'Kim MS', 'Jung H', 'Kim KH', 'Kim KN', 'Park HY', 'Lee YJ', 'Cho B', 'Sohn JH']",2021,36,3,J Korean Med Sci,"Kang E, et al.

33462562,Traditional foods with their constituent's antiviral and immune system modulating properties.,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are responsible for several diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, a condition caused by today's pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A negotiated immune system is a common risk factor for all viral infections, including COVID-19. To date, no specific therapies or vaccines have been approved for coronavirus. In these circumstances, antiviral and immune boosting foods may ensure protection against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2 by reducing risk and ensuring fast healing of SARS-CoV-2 illness.
SCOPE AND APPROACH: In this review, we have conducted an online search using several search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to find out some traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species), which have antiviral and immune-boosting properties against numerous viral infections, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs) and others RNA-virus infections. Our review indicated some foods to be considered as potential immune enhancers, which may help individuals to overcome viral infections like COVID-19 by modulating immune systems and reducing respiratory problems. Furthermore, this review will provide information regarding biological properties of conventional foods and their ingredients to uphold general health.
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed some foods with antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which possess bioactive compounds that showed significant antiviral properties against different viruses, particularly RNA viruses such as CoVs. Interestingly, some antiviral and immune-boosting mechanisms were very much similar to the antiviral drug of COVID-19 homologous SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The transient nature and the devastating spreading capability of COVID-19 lead to ineffectiveness of many curative therapies. Therefore, body shielding and immune-modulating foods, which have previous scientific recognition, have been discussed in this review to discern the efficacy of these foods against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2.","['Rahman MM', 'Mosaddik A', 'Alam AK']",2021,7,1,Heliyon,"Rahman MM, et al.

The present study is mainly related to the airborne transmission of novel coronavirus through airway. Similarly, our mother planet is suffering from drastic effects of air pollution. There are sufficient probabilities or evidences proven for contagious virus transmission through polluted airborne-pathway in formed aerosol molecules. The pathways and sources of spread are detailed along with the best possible green control technologies or ideas to hinder further transmission. The combined effects of such root causes and unwanted outcomes are similar in nature leading to acute cardiac arrest of our planet. To maintain environmental sustainability, the prior future of such emerging unknown biological hazardous air emissions is to be thoroughly researched. So it is high time to deal with the future of hazardous air pollution and work on its preventive measures. The lifetime of such an airborne virus continues for several hours, thus imposing severe threat even during post-lockdown phase. The world waits eagerly for the development of successful vaccination or medication but the possible outcome is quite uncertain in terms of equivalent economy distribution and biomedical availability. Thus, risk assessments are to be carried out even during the post-vaccination period with proper environmental surveillance and monitoring. The skilled techniques of disinfection, sanitization, and other viable wayouts are to be modified with time, place, and prevailing climatic conditions, handling the pandemic efficiently.

33461573,"MERS-CoV: epidemiology, molecular dynamics, therapeutics, and future challenges.","The Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gained research attention worldwide, given the current pandemic. Nevertheless, a previous zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is still causing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and neighbour countries. The MERS-CoV has been reported from respiratory samples in more than 27 countries, and around 2500 cases have been reported with an approximate fatality rate of 35%. After its emergence in 2012 intermittent, sporadic cases, nosocomial infections and many community clusters of MERS continued to occur in many countries. Human-to-human transmission resulted in the large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. The inherent genetic variability among various clads of the MERS-CoV might have probably paved the events of cross-species transmission along with changes in the inter-species and intra-species tropism. The current review is drafted using an extensive review of literature on various databases, selecting of publications irrespective of favouring or opposing, assessing the merit of study, the abstraction of data and analysing data. The genome of MERS-CoV contains around thirty thousand nucleotides having seven predicted open reading frames. Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the four main structural proteins. The surface located spike protein (S) of betacoronaviruses has been established to be one of the significant factors in their zoonotic transmission through virus-receptor recognition mediation and subsequent initiation of viral infection. Three regions in Saudi Arabia (KSA), Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah were affected severely. The epidemic progression had been the highest in 2014 in Makkah and Riyadh and Eastern Province in 2013.

33461215,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.,"Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D × 3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19.

Currently, there are no definite approved therapies endorsed by the World Health Organization for COVID-19, focusing only on supportive care. Treatment centers around symptom management, including oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation. Immunotherapy has the potential to play a role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in particular, is a relatively new approach in the world of infectious diseases and has the benefit of overcoming challenges with serum therapy and intravenous immunoglobulins preparations. Here, we reviewed the articles published in PubMed with the purpose of summarizing the currently available evidence for the use of neutralizing antibodies as a potential treatment for coronaviruses. Studies reporting in vivo results were summarized and analyzed. Despite promising data from some studies, none of them progressed to clinical trials. It is expected that neutralizing antibodies might offer an alternative for COVID-19 treatment.

33444443,A programmable omnipotent Argonaute nuclease from mesophilic bacteria Kurthia massiliensis.,"Argonaute (Ago) proteins are conserved nucleic acid-guided proteins present in all domains of life. Eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) are key players in RNA interference pathways and function as RNA-guided RNA endonucleases at physiological temperatures. Although eAgos are considered to evolve from prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos), previously studied pAgos were unable to catalyze RNA-guided RNA cleavage at physiological temperatures. Here, we describe a distinctive pAgo from mesophilic bacteria Kurthia massiliensis (KmAgo). KmAgo utilizes DNA guides to cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA targets with high activity. KmAgo also utilizes RNA guides to cleave ssDNA and RNA targets at moderate temperatures. We show that KmAgo can use 5' phosphorylated DNA guides as small as 9-mers to cut ssDNA and RNA, like Clostridium butyricum Ago. Small DNA binding confers remarkable thermostability on KmAgo, and we can suppress the guide-independent plasmid processing activity of empty KmAgo by elevating the DNA guide loaded temperature. Moreover, KmAgo performs programmable cleavage of double-stranded DNA and highly structured RNA at 37°C. Therefore, KmAgo can be regarded as a DNA-guided programmable omnipotent nuclease for cleaving most types of nucleic acids efficiently. This study broadens our understanding of Ago proteins and could expand the pAgo-based DNA and RNA manipulation toolbox.","['Liu Y', 'Li W', 'Jiang X', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu Q', 'He R', 'Chen Q', 'Yang J', 'Wang L', 'Wang F', 'Ma L']",2021,49,3,Nucleic Acids Res,"Liu Y, et al.

The epidemiological features of the SARS, MERS, and new COVID-19 have revealed sex-dependent variations in the infection, frequency, treatment, and fatality rates of these syndromes. Females are likely less susceptible to viral infections, perhaps due to their steroid hormone levels, the impact of X-linked genes, and the sex-based immune responses. Although mostly inactive, the X chromosome makes the female's immune system more robust. The extra immune-regulatory genes of the X chromosome are associated with lower levels of viral load and decreased infection rate. Moreover, a higher titer of the antibodies and their longer blood circulation half-life are involved in a more durable immune protection in females. The activation rate of the immune cells and the production of TLR7 and IFN are more prominent in females. Although the bi-allelic expression of the immune regulatory genes can sometimes lead to autoimmune reactions, the higher titer of TLR7 in females is further associated with a stronger anti-viral immune response. Considering these sex-related differences and the similarities between the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we will discuss them in immune responses against the β-CoVs-associated syndromes. We aim to provide information on sex-based disease susceptibility and response. A better understanding of the evasion strategies of pathogens and the host immune responses can provide worthful insights into immunotherapy, and vaccine development approaches.","['Rahimi G', 'Rahimi B', 'Panahi M', 'Abkhiz S', 'Saraygord-Afshari N', 'Milani M', 'Alizadeh E']",2021,92,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Rahimi G, et al.

33437699,Povidone-Iodine Solution: A Potential Antiseptic to Minimize the Risk of COVID-19? A Narrative Review.,"OBJECTIVES: Patients are mask-free during dental attention. In addition, dentists and dental staff after working for hours need to hydrate or eat. Removing the mask makes them vulnerable to the risk of contamination. For those cases, a prophylactic decontamination protocol could be useful as an adjunct to the most recommended biosecurity protocols. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence about the use of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 and to propose a prophylactic protocol for dental attention using PVP-I during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search in Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Scielo databases was performed up to July 24, 2020, to identify relevant literature focusing on Povidone Iodine, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS-COV, MERS, antiviral mouthwashes, and oral cavity.

33435774,COVID-19 vaccine: where are we now and where should we go?,"INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently caused the pandemic with a high progressive speed and has been considered as the global public health crisis in 2020. This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter.
AREAS COVERED: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine.
EXPERT OPINION: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy.","['Soleimanpour S', 'Yaghoubi A']",2021,20,1,Expert Rev Vaccines,Soleimanpour S and Yaghoubi A.

The newly emerged strain of HCoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the recent global pandemic that has already caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people due to the lack of effective therapeutic options.
METHODS: In this study, immunoinformatics methods were used to design epitope-based polyvalent vaccines which are expected to be effective against four different pathogenic strains of HCoV i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS, and SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: The constructed vaccines consist of highly antigenic, non-allergenic, nontoxic, conserved, and non-homologous T-cell and B-cell epitopes from all the four viral strains. Therefore, they should be able to provide strong protection against all these strains. Protein-protein docking was performed to predict the best vaccine construct. Later, the MD simulation and immune simulation of the best vaccine construct also predicted satisfactory results. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to develop a mass production strategy of the vaccine.
CONCLUSION: If satisfactory results are achieved in further in vivo and in vitro studies, then the vaccines designed in this study might be effective as preventative measures against the selected HCoV strains.","['Sarkar B', 'Ullah MA', 'Araf Y', 'Islam NN', 'Zohora US']",2022,21,12,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Sarkar B, et al.

This systematic review aims to synthesize existing findings (both qualitative and quantitative) that focus on the social and cultural impacts of coronaviruses in order to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a predetermined search strategy, we searched CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science to identify existing (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods) studies pertaining to the coronavirus infections and their intersection with societies and cultures. A narrative synthesis approach was applied to summarize and interpret findings of the study. Stemming from SARS outbreak in 2003, qualitative and quantitative findings (twelve adopted quantitative methods and eight exclusively used qualitative methods) were organized under five topical domains: governance, crisis communication and public knowledge, stigma and discrimination, social compliance of preventive measures, and the social experience of health workers. The selected studies suggest that current societies are not equipped for effective coronavirus response and control.

Urbanization and industrialization are the major contributing factors to the on-going change in global climate, with increased air pollution and poor air quality. As the global climate and air quality deteriorate, air pollutants remain as a fundamental concern to public health. Air pollution has been globally acknowledged as a major influence and exacerbating factor for human morbidity and mortality influenced on various respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Patients by long - term exposure to polluted air leads to chronic lung and heart conditions are less able to fight off lung infections and likely to die. Polluted air in developed countries is causing heart and lung damage and is responsible for early deaths in a year. This is also likely the case for COVID-19. The more severe impact by COVID-19 on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes leads to the primary health damage such as respiratory infections than on others. The health damage inflicted on people by long-standing air pollution in cities is likely to increase the death rate by COVID-19.

33431849,Isolation of MERS-related coronavirus from lesser bamboo bats that uses DPP4 and infects human-DPP4-transgenic mice.,"While a number of human coronaviruses are believed to be originated from ancestral viruses in bats, it remains unclear if bat coronaviruses are ready to cause direct bat-to-human transmission. Here, we report the isolation of a MERS-related coronavirus, Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4, from lesser bamboo bats. Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 replicates efficiently in human colorectal adenocarcinoma and hepatocarcinoma cells with cytopathic effects, and can utilize human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 as the receptors for cell entry. Flow cytometry, co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays show that Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4-receptor-binding-domain can bind human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, and Tylonycteris pachypus-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4. Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 can infect human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-transgenic mice by intranasal inoculation with self-limiting disease. Positive virus and inflammatory changes were detected in lungs and brains of infected mice, associated with suppression of antiviral cytokines and activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The results suggest that MERS-related bat coronaviruses may overcome species barrier by utilizing dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and potentially emerge in humans by direct bat-to-human transmission.","['Lau SKP', 'Fan RYY', 'Zhu L', 'Li KSM', 'Wong ACP', 'Luk HKH', 'Wong EYM', 'Lam CSF', 'Lo GCS', 'Fung J', 'He Z', 'Fok FCH', 'Au-Yeung RKH', 'Zhang L', 'Kok KH', 'Yuen KY', 'Woo PCY']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Lau SKP, et al.

33430748,In Silico Prediction and Designing of Potential siRNAs to be used as Antivirals Against SARS-CoV-2.,"BACKGROUND: The unusual pneumonia outbreak that originated in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019 was found to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19.
METHODS: In this work, we have performed an in silico design and prediction of potential siRNAs based on genetic diversity and recombination patterns, targeting various genes of SARS-CoV-2 for antiviral therapeutics. We performed extensive sequence analysis to analyze the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, and to identify the possible source of virus reservoirs and recombination patterns, and the evolution of the virus as well as we designed the siRNAs which can be used as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: The sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships indicated high sequence identity and closed clusters with many types of coronavirus. In our analysis, the full-genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed the highest sequence (nucleotide) identity with SARS-bat-ZC45 (87.7%). The overall sequence identity ranged from 74.3% to 87.7% with selected SARS viruses. The recombination analysis indicated the bat SARS virus is a potential recombinant and serves as a major and minor parent. We have predicted 442 siRNAs and finally selected only 19 functional, and potential siRNAs.
CONCLUSION: The siRNAs were predicted and selected based on their greater potency and specificity. The predicted siRNAs need to be validated experimentally for their effective binding and antiviral activity.","['Sohrab SS', 'El-Kafrawy SA', 'Abbas AT', 'Bajrai LH', 'Azhar EI']",2021,27,32,Curr Pharm Des,"Sohrab SS, et al.

The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

The disease was subsequently designated as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The death toll has continued to rise with grave health and socio-economic implications for individuals, families and nations globally. Although the respiratory tract is primarily involved in this disease, kidney affectation is increasingly reported and has been shown to worsen the prognosis of the disease. Current evidence shows that kidney disease is not uncommon in patients with coronavirus infection especially in those with COVID-19 and may arise from a constellation of factors such as hypotension, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ failure, use of nephrotoxic medications as well as direct infection in some cases. Factors associated with acute kidney injury in coronavirus infected patients may include elderly age, male sex, presence of co-morbidities as well as pre-existing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease. Although, there is presently no effective treatment for COVID-19, there is room for conservative management, extracorporeal therapy and renal replacement therapy.

In this proposed system, a machine learning (ML) algorithm is used to classify the textual clinical report into four classes by using the textual data mining method. The algorithm of the ensemble ML classifier has performed feature extraction using the advanced techniques of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) which is an effective information retrieval technique from the corona dataset. Humans get infected by coronaviruses in three ways: first, mild respiratory disease which is globally pandemic, and human coronaviruses are caused by HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E; second, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and finally, higher case casualty rate defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). By using the machine learning techniques, the three-way COVID-19 stages are classified by the extraction of the feature using the data retrieval process.

33422673,Endogenous Aβ peptide promote Aβ oligomerization tendency of spiked synthetic Aβ in Alzheimer's disease plasma.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-associated dementia. Several studies have predicted that AD is caused by the production and deposition of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain, which is one of pathologic hallmarks of AD. In particular, Aβ oligomers are reportedly the most toxic and pathogenic of other peptide forms. We previously developed Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Amyloid-β (MDS-OAβ), a technique for measuring Aβ oligomerization in plasma to diagnose AD. Here, we clarified the molecular sizes of oligomers that can be detected by the MDS and investigated differences in plasma spiking with a synthetic Aβ peptide in the plasma of AD patients and individuals with non-AD neurological conditions. To determine Aβ oligomer sizes detectable by MDS, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was first performed on incubated samples of synthetic Aβ42 peptides. As a result, no MDS signals were observed for the Aβ42 monomer fractions, but strong signals were found for oligomers of 7-35-mers long. Also, an amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunoassay (AlphaLISA) was used to confirm that synthetic Aβ peptides not only recruited endogenous Aβ in plasma but also induced significantly stronger seeding in AD plasma than in healthy control plasma. In addition, the absence of the MDS signals in Aβ-depleted plasma confirmed that the increased oligomerization tendency in AD plasma is dependent on the presence of endogenous Aβ in plasma. Therefore, the MDS-OAβ measurement of oligomerization differences in plasma after incubation with spiked synthetic Aβ peptides has significant potential in AD diagnosis.","['Choi Y', 'Joh Y', 'Ryu JS', 'Kim K', 'Seo D', 'Kim S']",2021,111,,Mol Cell Neurosci,"Choi Y, et al.

33421654,Topological Analysis for Sequence Variability: Case Study on more than 2K SARS-CoV-2 sequences of COVID-19 infected 54 countries in comparison with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.,"The pandemic due to novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is a serious global concern now. More than thousand new COVID-19 infections are getting reported daily for this virus across the globe. Thus, the medical research communities are trying to find the remedy to restrict the spreading of this virus, while the vaccine development work is still under research in parallel. In such critical situation, not only the medical research community, but also the scientists in different fields like microbiology, pharmacy, bioinformatics and data science are also sharing effort to accelerate the process of vaccine development, virus prediction, forecasting the transmissible probability and reproduction cases of virus for social awareness. With the similar context, in this article, we have studied sequence variability of the virus primarily focusing on three aspects: (a) sequence variability among SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in human host, which are in the same coronavirus family, (b) sequence variability of SARS-CoV-2 in human host for 54 different countries and (c) sequence variability between coronavirus family and country specific SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human host. For this purpose, as a case study, we have performed topological analysis of 2391 global genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in association with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV using an integrated semi-alignment based computational technique. The results of the semi-alignment based technique are experimentally and statistically found similar to alignment based technique and computationally faster. Moreover, the outcome of this analysis can help to identify the nations with homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 sequences, so that same vaccine can be applied to their heterogeneous human population.","['Sarkar JP', 'Saha I', 'Seal A', 'Maity D', 'Maulik U']",2021,88,,Infect Genet Evol,"Sarkar JP, et al.

33416095,An integrative look at SARS‑CoV‑2 (Review).,"SARS‑CoV‑2 is a newly discovered member of the betacoronaviruses and the etiological agent of the disease COVID‑19. SARS‑CoV‑2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS‑CoV or MERS‑CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS‑CoV‑2, COVID‑19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS‑CoV‑2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE‑2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with COVID‑19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of COVID‑19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events. The development of novel therapies and vaccines designed to control and regulate a proper immune system response will be key to clinical management, prevention measures and effective population screening to attenuate the transmission of this novel RNA virus.","['Ortega MA', 'Fraile-Martínez O', 'García-Montero C', 'García-Gallego S', 'Sánchez-Trujillo L', 'Torres-Carranza D', 'Álvarez-Mon MÁ', 'Pekarek L', 'García-Honduvilla N', 'Bujan J', 'Álvarez-Mon M', 'Asúnsolo Á', 'De la Torre B']",2021,47,2,Int J Mol Med,"Ortega MA, et al.

The lethality and Neurological effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and recently the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been well documented though currently there is little literature regarding long term effects and the implications for neurorehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV have been linked to the infection associated inflammatory cytokine storms and induced hypercoagulopathic states that affect the entire vascular system including that of the brain. This mini-review provides an overview of the commonalities among studies published on all three types of the coronavirus related to acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The aim was to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underpinning COVID-2 and to reflect the similarities with the chronic inflammation induced symptoms of AIS that are likely to prove a further challenge for neurorehabilitation clinicians post COVID. In terms of increased incidence of COVID and AIS, it is likely that in depth knowledge of increased thrombotic risk in this population will require appropriate anticoagulation treatment, and other therapeutic interventions as well as neurorehabilitation interventions.

It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels.
RESULTS: In this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected. Response genes and proteins were then identified by differential analyses comparing gene/protein levels between infected and control samples. Finally, the H2V database was created to contain the human genes and proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: H2V provides molecular information about the human response to infection. It can be a powerful tool to discover cellular pathways and processes relevant for viral pathogenesis to identify potential drug targets.

For this reason, it has been taken into account the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which began in China at the end of December 2019, has rapidly spread around the globe, and it has led to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), declared to the 30th of January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHODS: The IDS takes advantage of an off-line database, built before the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a pivotal characteristic for working without an internet connection. The software has been tested using the epidemiological data available in different and progressive stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a comparison, the results of the tests performed using the epidemiological data from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012, are shown.
RESULTS: The overall outcomes provided by the software are comforting, as a matter of the fact that IDS has identified with a good accuracy the SARS and MERS epidemics (over 90%), while, as expected, it has not provided erroneous and equivocal readings after the elaboration COVID-19 epidemic data.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though IDS has not recognized the COVID-19 epidemic, it has not given to the end user a false result and wrong interpretation, as expected by the developers. For this reason, IDS reveals itself as useful software to identify a possible epidemic or outbreak. Thus, the intention of developers is to plan, once the software will be released, dedicated updates and upgrades of the database (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) in order to keep this tool increasingly useful and applicable to reality.","['Baldassi F', 'Cenciarelli O', 'Malizia A', 'Gaudio P']",2021,14,1,J Infect Public Health,"Baldassi F, et al.

A standard curve and the interpolation of arbitrary ELISA units per milliliter served to reduce the variability between different tests and operators. Cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses was addressed by using sera positive for MERS-CoV- and hCoV HKU1-specific antibodies. Monitoring antibody development in various samples of twenty-three and single samples of twenty-nine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients revealed seroconversion and neutralizing antibodies against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in all cases. The comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 (S1) ELISA with a commercially available assay showed a better sensitivity for the in-house ELISA.

33410826,Current advances in the detection of COVID-19 and evaluation of the humoral response.,"The new outbreak caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of 2019 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests.

Huizhou City utilized its experience with the SARS and MERS breakouts to establish a reperfusion treatment program for AIS patients.
METHOD: This is a retrospective study on 8 certified stroke hospitals in Huizhou City from January 2020 to May 2020. We analyzed the number of AIS patients with reperfusion therapy, stroke type (anterior/posterior circulation stroke), modes of transport to hospital, NIHSS score, onset to door time (ODT), door to needle time (DNT), and door to puncture time (DPT). The analysis was compared with baseline data from the same time period in 2019.
RESULT: In 2020, the number of AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy decreased (315 vs. 377), NIHSS score increased [8 (4, 15) vs. 7 [ (1, 2)], P = 0.024], ODT increased [126 (67.5, 210.0) vs. 120.0 (64.0, 179.0), P = 0.032], and DNT decreased [40 (32.5, 55) vs. 48 (36, 59), P = 0.003]. DPT did not change. Seventy percent of AIS patients indicated self-visit as their main mode of transport to the hospital. In both periods, mild stroke patients were more likely to self-visit than utilize emergency systems [2019: 152 (57.6%) vs. 20 (45.6%), P = 0.034; 2020: 123 (56.9%) vs. 5 (14.7%), P < 0.001]. The NIHSS score for self-visiting patients was lower for patients who utilized the ambulance system in both years [self-visit: 6.00 (3.00, 12.00), ambulance: 14.00 (9.00, 19.00), P < 0.001]. The volume of reperfusion patients was lower in 2020; however, the decrease was only significant (P = 0.028) in February 2020.
CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the number of AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy significantly decreased when compared to the same period in 2019. The patients' condition increased severity, ODT increased, and the DNT decreased. DPT was not significant for self-visiting and ambulance patients.

We report a pediatric patient in thyroid crisis with reversible SCC lesions.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We diagnosed a 9-year-old girl with thyroid crisis. She had presented with fever, tachycardia, and impaired consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense signals in the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum and a white matter lesion of the left hemisphere in diffusion-weighted imaging. The initial, tentative diagnosis was clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS). We initiated intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy; thereafter, her level of consciousness rapidly improved. On admission, thyroid function studies revealed elevation of free thyroxine and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone with thyroid-related autoantibodies. She was begun on thiamazole and was discharged without neurological sequelae.
CONCLUSION: Thyroid crisis is similar to acute encephalitis or encephalopathy associated with viral infection, especially with MERS, because the clinical and radiological features resemble those of thyroid crisis; therefore, thyroid diseases should be considered as a possible cause of reversible lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum.","['Matsubara K', 'Kuki I', 'Yamamoto N', 'Nagase S', 'Inoue T', 'Nukui M', 'Okazaki S', 'Yamada Y', 'Kawawaki H']",2021,43,4,Brain Dev,"Matsubara K, et al.

33407069,PCirc: random forest-based plant circRNA identification software.,"BACKGROUND: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of RNA with a closed-loop structure. Increasing numbers of circRNAs are being identified in plants and animals, and recent studies have shown that circRNAs play an important role in gene regulation. Therefore, identifying circRNAs from increasing amounts of RNA-seq data is very important. However, traditional circRNA recognition methods have limitations. In recent years, emerging machine learning techniques have provided a good approach for the identification of circRNAs in animals. However, using these features to identify plant circRNAs is infeasible because the characteristics of plant circRNA sequences are different from those of animal circRNAs. For example, plants are extremely rich in splicing signals and transposable elements, and their sequence conservation in rice, for example is far less than that in mammals. To solve these problems and better identify circRNAs in plants, it is urgent to develop circRNA recognition software using machine learning based on the characteristics of plant circRNAs.
RESULTS: In this study, we built a software program named PCirc using a machine learning method to predict plant circRNAs from RNA-seq data. First, we extracted different features, including open reading frames, numbers of k-mers, and splicing junction sequence coding, from rice circRNA and lncRNA data. Second, we trained a machine learning model by the random forest algorithm with tenfold cross-validation in the training set. Third, we evaluated our classification according to accuracy, precision, and F1 score, and all scores on the model test data were above 0.99. Fourth, we tested our model by other plant tests, and obtained good results, with accuracy scores above 0.8. Finally, we packaged the machine learning model built and the programming script used into a locally run circular RNA prediction software, Pcirc ( https://github.com/Lilab-SNNU/Pcirc ).
CONCLUSION: Based on rice circRNA and lncRNA data, a machine learning model for plant circRNA recognition was constructed in this study using random forest algorithm, and the model can also be applied to plant circRNA recognition such as Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. At the same time, after the completion of model construction, the machine learning model constructed and the programming scripts used in this study are packaged into a localized circRNA prediction software Pcirc, which is convenient for plant circRNA researchers to use.","['Yin S', 'Tian X', 'Zhang J', 'Sun P', 'Li G']",2021,22,1,BMC Bioinformatics,"Yin S, et al.

The overwhelming rate of publications means that human researchers are unable to keep abreast of the research. To ameliorate this, we present the CoronaCentral resource which uses machine learning to process the research literature on SARS-CoV-2 along with articles on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We break the literature down into useful categories and enable analysis of the contents, pace, and emphasis of research during the crisis. These categories cover therapeutics, forecasting as well as growing areas such as ""Long Covid"" and studies of inequality and misinformation. Using this data, we compare topics that appear in original research articles compared to commentaries and other article types. Finally, using Altmetric data, we identify the topics that have gained the most media attention.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight β-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting β-coronaviruses, and broadly inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with β-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-of-concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination.

High quality serology is key to avoiding medically costly diagnostic errors, as well as to assuring properly informed public health decisions. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol, from antigen production to data analyses, that helps define thresholds for IgG and IgM seropositivity with high specificities. Validation of this protocol is performed using traditionally collected serum as well as dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits. Archival (pre-2019) samples are used as negative controls, and convalescent, PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 patient samples serve as positive controls. Using this protocol, minimal cross-reactivity is observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses, and no cross reactivity is observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI. Our protocol may thus help provide standardized, population-based data on the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, immunity and infection.","['Klumpp-Thomas C', 'Kalish H', 'Drew M', 'Hunsberger S', 'Snead K', 'Fay MP', 'Mehalko J', 'Shunmugavel A', 'Wall V', 'Frank P', 'Denson JP', 'Hong M', 'Gulten G', 'Messing S', 'Hicks J', 'Michael S', 'Gillette W', 'Hall MD', 'Memoli MJ', 'Esposito D', 'Sadtler K']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Klumpp-Thomas C, et al.

33393898,COVID-19: An Update on Pathogenesis and Treatment.,"In 2019, a new virus -SARS-COV2 possibly emerged in China, which infected many people affecting mainly the respiratory system. SARS-COV2 gets transmitted by inhalation of droplets from the infected persons. Symptoms start to appear after the incubation period of the virus which ranges from 2 to 14 days. In most people, symptoms are usually mild such as fever, sore throat, cough, chest tightness and fatigue. In other people, the disease might progress into severe pneumonia leading to several fatal consequences. Treatment is usually supportive and the role of antiviral is not established yet. Home isolation for mild cases is important for the prevention of the transmission of infection. Although the rate of transmission of this virus is faster than other viruses from the family, such as MERS-CoV, it has a lower fatality rate. The main difference in the genome structure of this family, which makes it distinguishable from other viruses is its use of (+) ssRNA as genetic material, which comprise 5' cap located at one end and 3' polyadenylation tract at the other end. During infection of an exposed host cell, viral-encoded protease cleaves the polyprotein that results from translation of 5' open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, culminating in the release of multiple nonstructural proteins such as helicase (Hel), adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep). These proteins are responsible for the replication process in addition to the syntheses of the sub genomic mRNA used as transcription template strand. In this review article, we discussed the transmission pathways, genetic sequence and current treatment approach of COVID-19.","['Al Dhamen MA', 'Alhashim AF', 'Alqattan HH', 'Pottoo FH']",2021,27,32,Curr Pharm Des,"Al Dhamen MA, et al.

Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment. There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies. Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets. This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV.

DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.
RESULTS: We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future.

The first reports of patients with COVID-19 were provided to World Health Organization on December 21, 2019 and were presumably associated with seafood markets in Wuhan, China. As of October 25, 2020, more than 42 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 1.1 million deaths. Asymptomatic transmission contributes significantly to transmission, and clinical features are non-specific to the disease. Thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires specific viral RNA testing. The disease demonstrates extensive human-to-human transmissibility and has infected healthcare workers at high rates. Clinical awareness of the epidemiology and the risk factors for nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 is essential to preventing infection. Moreover, effective control measures should be further identified by comprehensive evaluation of hospital and community responses. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, presentation, transmission, risk factors, and public health measures associated with COVID-19. We also review past insights from previous coronavirus epidemics [i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)] to suggest measures to reduce transmission.","['Li H', 'Burm SW', 'Hong SH', 'Ghayda RA', 'Kronbichler A', 'Smith L', 'Koyanagi A', 'Jacob L', 'Lee KH', 'Shin JI']",2021,62,1,Yonsei Med J,"Li H, et al.

33381840,CLPred: a sequence-based protein crystallization predictor using BLSTM neural network.,"MOTIVATION: Determining the structures of proteins is a critical step to understand their biological functions. Crystallography-based X-ray diffraction technique is the main method for experimental protein structure determination. However, the underlying crystallization process, which needs multiple time-consuming and costly experimental steps, has a high attrition rate. To overcome this issue, a series of in silico methods have been developed with the primary aim of selecting the protein sequences that are promising to be crystallized. However, the predictive performance of the current methods is modest.
RESULTS: We propose a deep learning model, so-called CLPred, which uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (BLSTM) to capture the long-range interaction patterns between k-mers amino acids to predict protein crystallizability. Using sequence only information, CLPred outperforms the existing deep-learning predictors and a vast majority of sequence-based diffraction-quality crystals predictors on three independent test sets. The results highlight the effectiveness of BLSTM in capturing non-local, long-range inter-peptide interaction patterns to distinguish proteins that can result in diffraction-quality crystals from those that cannot. CLPred has been steadily improved over the previous window-based neural networks, which is able to predict crystallization propensity with high accuracy. CLPred can also be improved significantly if it incorporates additional features from pre-extracted evolutional, structural and physicochemical characteristics. The correctness of CLPred predictions is further validated by the case studies of Sox transcription factor family member proteins and Zika virus non-structural proteins.

33381814,Geometricus represents protein structures as shape-mers derived from moment invariants.,"MOTIVATION: As the number of experimentally solved protein structures rises, it becomes increasingly appealing to use structural information for predictive tasks involving proteins. Due to the large variation in protein sizes, folds and topologies, an attractive approach is to embed protein structures into fixed-length vectors, which can be used in machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting and understanding functional and physical properties. Many existing embedding approaches are alignment based, which is both time-consuming and ineffective for distantly related proteins. On the other hand, library- or model-based approaches depend on a small library of fragments or require the use of a trained model, both of which may not generalize well.
RESULTS: We present Geometricus, a novel and universally applicable approach to embedding proteins in a fixed-dimensional space. The approach is fast, accurate, and interpretable. Geometricus uses a set of 3D moment invariants to discretize fragments of protein structures into shape-mers, which are then counted to describe the full structure as a vector of counts. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in various tasks, ranging from fast structure similarity search, unsupervised clustering and structure classification across proteins from different superfamilies as well as within the same family.

33380411,How health systems approached respiratory viral pandemics over time: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Several healthcare systems facing respiratory viral infections outbreaks, like COVID-19, have not been prepared to manage them. Public health mitigation solutions ranging from isolation of infected or suspected cases to implementation of national lockdowns have proven their effectiveness for the outbreak's control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review to identify healthcare systems interventions, experiences and recommendations that have been used to manage different respiratory viral infections outbreaks in the past.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until 17 April 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. When applicable, quality assessment was conducted for the included articles. We performed a narrative synthesis of each implemented public health approaches.
RESULTS: We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health approaches implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks

The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic.
PURPOSE: Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis. STUDY DESIGN &  METHODS: An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target.
RESULT: Few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index.
CONCLUSION: Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell and blocking of host-viral interaction.","['Palit P', 'Chattopadhyay D', 'Thomas S', 'Kundu A', 'Kim HS', 'Rezaei N']",2021,85,,Phytomedicine,"Palit P, et al.

However, such models are based on meagre data and limited biological understanding. We evaluate the accuracy of various models from recent pandemics (SARS, MERS and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) as a guide to whether we can trust the early model predictions for COVID-19. We show that early models can have good predictive power for a disease's first wave, but they are less predictive of the possibility of a second wave or its strength. The models with the highest accuracy tended to include stochasticity, and models developed for a particular geographic region are often applicable in other regions. It follows that mathematical models developed early in a pandemic can be useful for long-term predictions, at least during the first wave, and they should include stochastic variations, to represent unknown characteristics inherent in the earliest stages of all pandemics.","['Costris-Vas C', 'Schwartz EJ', 'Smith R']",2020,17,6,Math Biosci Eng,"Costris-Vas C, et al.

There has been a rapid evolution of evidence, establishing an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and concurrent COVID-19. The objective of this review is to explore the current evidence for inpatient assessment and management of diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight areas requiring further exploration.
METHODS: A literature search of databases was conducted to November 2020 using variations on keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS, MERS and diabetes. Information relating to the impact of diabetes on severity of COVID-19 infection, the impact of COVID-19 infection on diabetes management and diabetes-related complications was integrated to create a narrative review.
DISCUSSION: People with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is important that people with both known and previously unrecognised diabetes and COVID-19 be promptly identified and assessed during acute illness, with close monitoring for clinical deterioration or complications. People with diabetes may require titration or alteration of their glycaemic management due to the potential for worse outcomes with hyperglycaemia and COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive discharge planning is vital to optimise ongoing glycaemic management.
CONCLUSION: Further understanding of the risk of adverse outcomes and optimisation of glycaemic management for people with diabetes during COVID-19 is required to improve outcomes. Increased glucose and ketone monitoring, substitution of insulin for some oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications and careful monitoring for complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis should be considered.","['Fleming N', 'Sacks LJ', 'Pham CT', 'Neoh SL', 'Ekinci EI']",2021,38,3,Diabet Med,"Fleming N, et al.

33376043,"Lycorine, a non-nucleoside RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, as potential treatment for emerging coronavirus infections.","BACKGROUND: Highly effective novel treatments need to be developed to suppress emerging coronavirus (CoV) infections such as COVID-19. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the viral proteins is known as an effective antiviral target. Lycorine is a phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L'Hér.) Herb. and has various pharmacological bioactivities including antiviral function.
PURPOSE: We investigated the direct-inhibiting action of lycorine on CoV's RdRp, as potential treatment for emerging CoV infections.
METHODS: We examined the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and then quantitatively measured the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV RdRp activity using a cell-based reporter assay. Finally, we performed the docking simulation with lycorine and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
RESULTS: Lycorine efficiently inhibited these CoVs with IC
CONCLUSIONS: Lycorine is a potent non-nucleoside direct-acting antiviral against emerging coronavirus infections and acts by inhibiting viral RdRp activity; therefore, lycorine may be a candidate against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","['Jin YH', 'Min JS', 'Jeon S', 'Lee J', 'Kim S', 'Park T', 'Park D', 'Jang MS', 'Park CM', 'Song JH', 'Kim HR', 'Kwon S']",2021,86,,Phytomedicine,"Jin YH, et al.

33374759,"COVID-19: A Global Challenge with Old History, Epidemiology and Progress So Far.","Humans have witnessed three deadly pandemics so far in the twenty-first century which are associated with novel coronaviruses: SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. All of these viruses, which are responsible for causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), are highly contagious in nature and/or have caused high mortalities. The recently emerged COVID-19 disease is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by another zoonotic novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to the other two coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also likely to have originated from bats, which have been serving as established reservoirs for various pathogenic coronaviruses. Although, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from bats to humans, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been confirmed widely. The disease first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe, infected 48,539,872 people, and caused 1,232,791 deaths in 215 countries, and the infection is still spreading at the time of manuscript preparation. So far, there is no definite line of treatment which has been approved or vaccine which is available. However, different types of potential vaccines and therapeutics have been evaluated and/or are under clinical trials against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize different types of acute respiratory diseases and briefly discuss earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses and compare their occurrence and pathogenicity with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Various epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 such as mode of spread, death rate, doubling time, etc., have been discussed in detail. Apart from this, different technical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic including use of masks and other socio-economic problems associated with the pandemic have also been summarized. Additionally, we have reviewed various aspects of patient management strategies including mechanism of action, available diagnostic tools, etc., and also discussed different strategies for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to deal with this viral outbreak. Overall, by the inclusion of various references, this review covers, in detail, the most important aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Khan M', 'Adil SF', 'Alkhathlan HZ', 'Tahir MN', 'Saif S', 'Khan M', 'Khan ST']",2020,26,1,Molecules,"Khan M, et al.

Building on the economic epidemiology literature, this study investigates individual behavioral responses to the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Korea using a panel of individuals in a nationally representative survey. Results show that exposure to the epidemic led to lasting impacts on smoking and drinking behaviors, indicating that emerging infectious disease outbreaks are motivations for behavioral changes and opportunities for public policy interventions. In particular, individuals in the hardest-hit regions or socially connected persons were more likely to change their risky behaviors, suggesting that intensity of exposure and social interactions are potential mechanisms.",['Ko H'],2021,41,,Econ Hum Biol,Ko H.

It has spread worldwide after an outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 15 million people globally. The disease severity and mortality increased in patients with heart-related comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease patients are more susceptible and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Early screening and management of these patients prevent or ameliorate adverse outcomes. Several treatments have been used to combat these effects, as previously seen in MERS and SARS. This review will cover the association of cardiovascular diseases with COVID 19. It showed that cardiovascular diseases are common in patients with COVID- 19. Increased attention to highlight the gaps should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.","['Hamadi A', 'Mahzari A', 'Hakami A', 'Hindawi S', 'Dobie G', 'Sayyed MI', 'Hamdi F', 'Nahari M', 'Jackson DE']",2021,21,11,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Hamadi A, et al.

33367690,Improving circRNA-disease association prediction by sequence and ontology representations with convolutional and recurrent neural networks.,"MOTIVATION: Emerging studies indicate that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the progression of human diseases. Due to its special structure which is stable, circRNAs are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for diseases. However, the experimental verification of circRNA-disease associations is expensive and limited to small-scale. Effective computational methods for predicting potential circRNA-disease associations are regarded as a matter of urgency. Although several models have been proposed, over-reliance on known associations and the absence of characteristics of biological functions make precise predictions are still challenging.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a method for predicting CircRNA-disease associations based on sequence and ontology representations, named CDASOR, with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For sequences of circRNAs, we encode them with continuous k-mers, get low-dimensional vectors of k-mers, extract their local feature vectors with 1D CNN and learn their long-term dependencies with bi-directional long short-term memory. For diseases, we serialize disease ontology into sentences containing the hierarchy of ontology, obtain low-dimensional vectors for disease ontology terms and get terms' dependencies. Furthermore, we get association patterns of circRNAs and diseases from known circRNA-disease associations with neural networks. After the above steps, we get circRNAs' and diseases' high-level representations, which are informative to improve the prediction. The experimental results show that CDASOR provides an accurate prediction. Importing the characteristics of biological functions, CDASOR achieves impressive predictions in the de novo test. In addition, 6 of the top-10 predicted results are verified by the published literature in the case studies.

33364539,Biologically active compounds from marine organisms in the strategies for combating coronaviruses.,"Despite the progress made in immunization and drug development, so far there are no prophylactic vaccines and effective therapies for many viral infections, including infections caused by coronaviruses. In this regard, the search for new antiviral substances continues to be relevant, and the enormous potential of marine resources are a stimulus for the study of marine compounds with antiviral activity in experiments and clinical trials. The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses-severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a serious threat to human health. In this review, the authors hope to bring the attention of researchers to the use of biologically active substances of marine origin as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting common cellular pathways and various stages of the life cycle of different viruses, including coronaviruses. The review has been compiled using references from major databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer and Google Scholar (up to June 2020) and keywords such as 'coronaviruses', 'marine organisms', 'biologically active substances', 'antiviral drugs', 'SARS-CoV', 'MERS-CoV', 'SARS-CoV-2', '3CLpro', 'TMPRSS2', 'ACE2'. After obtaining all reports from the databases, the papers were carefully analysed in order to find data related to the topic of this review (98 references). Biologically active substances of marine origin, such as flavonoids, phlorotannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, lectins, polysaccharides, lipids and others substances, can affect coronaviruses at the stages of penetration and entry of the viral particle into the cell, replication of the viral nucleic acid and release of the virion from the cell; they also can act on the host's cellular targets. These natural compounds could be a vital resource in the fight against coronaviruses.","['Zaporozhets TS', 'Besednova NN']",2020,6,4,AIMS Microbiol,Zaporozhets TS and Besednova NN.

Italy has been one of the most affected countries, and it had to deal with an already weak economic condition and cuts to public health services due to budgetary requirements from the last decade-something that made the situation even more dramatic. Deaths have exceeded 600.000 worldwide. During the emergency, regulatory measures were taken to counter the situation. This study highlights the main anti-COVID-19 government measures to support doctors and healthcare professionals, and it analyzes how to respond to the many requests complaining about neglectful healthcare professionals during the spread of the infection. For all those healthcare workers who died on duty, a compensation plan is assumed through a solidarity fund. The same solution cannot be granted to all patients, given the difficulty in assessing the responsibility of the doctor not only during an emergency but with insufficient instruments to cope with it as well.","['Ricci G', 'Pallotta G', 'Sirignano A', 'Amenta F', 'Nittari G']",2020,8,,Front Public Health,"Ricci G, et al.

33364201,Cathepsin L in COVID-19: From Pharmacological Evidences to Genetics.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics is a challenge without precedent for the modern science. Acute Respiratory Discomfort Syndrome (ARDS) is the most common immunopathological event in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. Fast lung deterioration results of cytokine storm determined by a robust immunological response leading to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the possible role of host genetics in the etiology and spreading of the disease.","['Gomes CP', 'Fernandes DE', 'Casimiro F', 'da Mata GF', 'Passos MT', 'Varela P', 'Mastroianni-Kirsztajn G', 'Pesquero JB']",2020,10,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Gomes CP, et al.

DESIGN: A living, systematic review.
DATABASE: We conducted searches in the centralized repository L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. Today it is maintained through regular searches in 39 databases.
METHODS: We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of macrolides as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomized trials evaluating macrolides in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 were searched in case we found no direct evidence from randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Measures included all-cause mortality; the need for invasive mechanical ventilation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, length of hospital stay, respiratory failure, serious adverse events, time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativity. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.
RESULTS: The search in the L·OVE platform retrieved 424 references. We considered 260 as potentially eligible and were reviewed in full texts. We included one randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in hospitalized patients with COVID 19. The estimates for all outcomes evaluated resulted in insufficient power to draw conclusions. The quality of the evidence for the main outcomes was low to very low.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrolides in the management of patients with COVID 19 showed no beneficial effects compared to standard of care. The evidence for all outcomes is inconclusive. Larger trials are needed to determine the effects of macrolides on pulmonary and other outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

33357102,Naturally Occurring Animal Coronaviruses as Models for Studying Highly Pathogenic Human Coronaviral Disease.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a large group of positive stranded RNA viruses that infect a diverse host range including birds and mammals. Infection with CoVs typically presents as mild to severe respiratory or enteric disease, but CoVs have the potential to cause significant morbidity or mortality in highly susceptible age groups. CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans. Similar to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have been devastating to commercial animal production over the past century, including infectious bronchitis virus in poultry and bovine CoV, as well as the emergence and reemergence of multiple CoVs in swine including transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. These naturally occurring animal CoV infections provide important examples for understanding CoV disease as many animal CoVs have complex pathogenesis similar to SARS-CoV-2 and can shed light on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We provide an overview and update regarding selected existing animal CoVs and their primary host species, diseases caused by CoVs, how CoVs jump species, whether these CoVs pose an outbreak risk or risk to humans, and how we can mitigate these risks.","['Kenney SP', 'Wang Q', 'Vlasova A', 'Jung K', 'Saif L']",2021,58,3,Vet Pathol,"Kenney SP, et al.

Repurposing drugs with minimum side effects are one approach to quickly respond in attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 encodes several RNA processing enzymes that are unusual and unique for single-stranded RNA viruses, including Nsp15, a hexameric endoribonuclease that discriminatory cleaves immediately 3' of uridines. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is reported to be homologous to that of the Nsp15 endoribonucleases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it exhibits differences that may contribute to the greater virulence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to identify drugs that targeted SARS-COV-2 Nsp15 using a molecular docking-based virtual screening of a library containing 10,000 approved and experimental drugs. The molecular docking results revealed 19 medications that demonstrated a good ability to inhibit Nsp15. Among all the candidated 19 drugs only five FDA approved drugs were used for further investigation by molecular dynamics simulation, the stability of Nsp15-ligand system was evaluated by calculating the RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration and hydrogen bond profile. Furthermore, MM-PBSA method was employed to validate the binding affinity. According to the obtained results of MD, the complex of Olaparib was showed more stability and lower binding free energy than the control inhibitor during MD simulation time. Finally, we suggest that Olaparib is a potential drug for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight into the host immune response to viral RNA.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It belongs to the family coronaviriadae and the order Nidovirales. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA enveloped virus that includes spike proteins projecting from the envelope. The spike (S) protein interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a role in the viral entry into the cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is zoonotic; the wet animal market where live animals are sold is expected to be the source of infection. It is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Transmission of the virus among humans is confirmed by direct contact, droplet infection, fecal-oral, and blood transmission. The symptoms of COVID 19 include fever, dry cough, headache, and difficulty in breathing. COVID 19 complications, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ injury, secondary infection, and shock, are common in immunocompromised and elderly patients. Up till now, there is no established treatment for COVID-19, and supportive measures including mechanical ventilation and the use of nonspecific anti-viral therapies such as Remdesevir, Liponavir, and chloroquine, are currently applied in severe cases.

33354517,Human Health and Ocean Pollution.,"BACKGROUND: Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.
GOALS: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.
METHODS: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.
ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.
ECOSYSTEM FINDINGS: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the 
HUMAN HEALTH FINDINGS: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants 
CONCLUSIONS: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.
RECOMMENDATIONS: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.","['Landrigan PJ', 'Stegeman JJ', 'Fleming LE', 'Allemand D', 'Anderson DM', 'Backer LC', 'Brucker-Davis F', 'Chevalier N', 'Corra L', 'Czerucka D', 'Bottein MD', 'Demeneix B', 'Depledge M', 'Deheyn DD', 'Dorman CJ', 'Fénichel P', 'Fisher S', 'Gaill F', 'Galgani F', 'Gaze WH', 'Giuliano L', 'Grandjean P', 'Hahn ME', 'Hamdoun A', 'Hess P', 'Judson B', 'Laborde A', 'McGlade J', 'Mu J', 'Mustapha A', 'Neira M', 'Noble RT', 'Pedrotti ML', 'Reddy C', 'Rocklöv J', 'Scharler UM', 'Shanmugam H', 'Taghian G', 'van de Water JAJM', 'Vezzulli L', 'Weihe P', 'Zeka A', 'Raps H', 'Rampal P']",2020,86,1,Ann Glob Health,"Landrigan PJ, et al.

All three hCoVs are members of the Betacoronavirus genus in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae and share many similarities in virology and epidemiology. However, the pattern and scale of Covid-19 global spread is similar to 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (H1N1pdm09), rather than SARS or MERS. Covid-19 exhibits high viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract at an early stage of infection, and has a high proportion of transmission competent individuals that are pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, characteristics seen in H1N1pdm09 but not in SARS or MERS. These two traits of Covid-19 and H1N1pdm09 result in reduced efficiency in identification of transmission sources by symptomatic screening and play important roles in their ability to spread unchecked to cause pandemics. To overcome these attributes of Covid-19 in community transmission, identifying the transmission source by testing for virus shedding and interrupting chains of transmission by social distancing and public masking are required.","['Wu Z', 'Harrich D', 'Li Z', 'Hu D', 'Li D']",2021,31,2,Rev Med Virol,"Wu Z, et al.

Performing fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, we measured chain-length dependence of dilute aqueous polyelectrolyte adsorption, at full surface coverage, onto an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte overtop spherical silica nanoparticles (10-3 g L-1). Preferential adsorption was determined by comparing the characteristic fluorescence intensities of the two fluorophore-labeled and narrowly disperse polyacrylic acid samples (NMA-PAA450k and Dan-PAA2k) of 450k- and 2k-molecular weight (6250- and 28-mers), respectively. To compare and validate experimental results, a lattice model was developed for computing the probabilities of the different arrangements of two polymer chain lengths of polyacrylic acid on the surface of the silica nanosphere. We then determined which numbers of long and short adsorbed chains corresponded to the most configurations in our model. Both spectroscopic experiment results and the combinatorial model demonstrated that there is an entropic preference for complete adsorption of the longer 450k polyacrylic acid chain vs. 2k. This study provides insights on entropy driven chain-length dependence of polyelectrolyte adsorption onto spherical nanoparticle surfaces for directing and optimizing their layer-by-layer self-assembly in organic films.","['Koumarianos S', 'Kaiyum R', 'Barrett CJ', 'Madras N', 'Mermut O']",2021,23,1,Phys Chem Chem Phys,"Koumarianos S, et al.

33339696,Diagnosis of COVID-19 for controlling the pandemic: A review of the state-of-the-art.,"To date, health organizations and countries around the world are struggling to completely control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scientists and researchers are developing tests for the rapid detection of individuals who may carry the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while striving to find a suitable vaccine to immunize healthy individuals. As there are clinically reported cases of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis plays an important role in the control and further prevention of this disease. Herein, we present recent technologies and techniques that have been implemented for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We summarize the methods created by different research institutes as well as the commercial devices and kits developed by companies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The description of the existing methods is followed by highlighting their advantages and challenges. Finally, we propose some promising techniques that could potentially be applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and tracing the asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 rapidly and accurately in the early stages of infection, based on reviewing the research studies on the detection of similar infectious viruses, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.","['Taleghani N', 'Taghipour F']",2021,174,,Biosens Bioelectron,Taleghani N and Taghipour F.

33338863,Convalescent plasma may be a possible treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally. Therapeutic options including antivirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, and vaccines are still under study. Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of literatures reported the application of CP. However, there is controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. This systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Key, Wanfang Database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were used to search for the proper keywords such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, plasma, serum, immunoglobulins, blood transfusion, convalescent, novel coronavirus, immune and the related words for publications published until 15.10.2020. Other available resources were also used to identify relevant articles. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 45 articles were included in the final review. First, meta-analysis results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically significant differences between CP transfusion and the control group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.19, I
CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.","['Wang Y', 'Huo P', 'Dai R', 'Lv X', 'Yuan S', 'Zhang Y', 'Guo Y', 'Li R', 'Yu Q', 'Zhu K']",2021,91,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Wang Y, et al.

33335873,Salient Conclusive Remarks on Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of Pediatric COVID-19: Narrative Review.,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), constituted significant public health concerns and impacted the human populations with massive economic and social burdens worldwide. The disease is known to infect people of all ages, including children, adults, and the elderly. Although several reports about pediatric COVID-19 were seen in the literature, we believe that the epidemiology and pathology of the infection described in these reports are not conclusive. Therefore, in this scientific communication, a narrative review study was performed to shed some light on the characteristic epidemiological features and clinical phenotypes of pediatric COVID-19. In this report, we had compiled and presented the different epidemiological features of the disease related to the age of infection, virus acquisition, explanations of the low infectivity rates, and consequences of infections. The discriminatory clinical manifestations of the disease in children were also addressed and discussed in this review. The search included the data published from the date of the start of the pandemic in December 2019 up to October 2020. Our literature search revealed that children of all ages, including neonates, had been infected by the virus. Despite the fact that pediatric COVID-19 is less common to occur, as compared to the disease in adults, the infected children usually manifest the disease symptomatology in benign form. Asymptomatic and symptomatic adult patients are the primary source of the virus to the children. Intrauterine transmission of the virus and breastfeeding infections to the neonates were hypothesized in some studies but ruled out since they were not confirmed. Intensive review and discussion warranting the low infection rates and benign conditions of COVID-19 in children were also made in this study. As documented in many studies, the infectivity, morbidity, and mortality rates of the disease among the children populations are much lower than those in adults. They also seem to be lower than those observed during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics. The described clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 in children do not differ much from those of adults, and complications of the disease seem to be associated with comorbidities.","['Ali AS', 'Al-Hakami AM', 'Shati AA', 'Asseri AA', 'Al-Qahatani SM']",2020,8,,Front Pediatr,"Ali AS, et al.

We compared the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as influenza A strains H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV at the level of the viral genome. RNAseq analyses demonstrate that human lung epithelial cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are distinct. Extensive Gene Expression Omnibus literature screening and drug predictive analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 infection response pathways are closely related to those of SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus infections. We validated SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes as disease-associated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in lung disease patient data. We also analysed COVID-19 patient peripheral blood samples, which identified signalling pathway concordance between the primary lung cell and blood cell infection responses.","['Moni MA', 'Quinn JMW', 'Sinmaz N', 'Summers MA']",2021,22,2,Brief Bioinform,"Moni MA, et al.

Cytokine storm syndromes of viral origin seem to have a common pathogenesis of the imbalanced immune response with the exaggerated inflammatory reaction combined with the reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells. Immunomodulatory therapy is gaining interest in COVID-19, but this strategy has received less attention in other respiratory viral infections than it deserved. In this review we suggest that based on the similarities of the immune dysfunction in the severe cases of different respiratory viral infections, some lessons from the immunomodulatory therapy of COVID-19 (particularly regarding the choice of an immunomodulatory drug, the selection of patients and optimal time window for this kind of therapy) could be applied for some cases of severe influenza infection and probably for some future outbreaks of novel severe respiratory viral infections.","['Ryabkova VA', 'Churilov LP', 'Shoenfeld Y']",2021,223,,Clin Immunol,"Ryabkova VA, et al.

33331849,Rapid screening and detection of inter-type viral recombinants using phylo-k-mers.,"MOTIVATION: Novel recombinant viruses may have important medical and evolutionary significance, as they sometimes display new traits not present in the parental strains. This is particularly concerning when the new viruses combine fragments coming from phylogenetically distinct viral types. Here, we consider the task of screening large collections of sequences for such novel recombinants. A number of methods already exist for this task. However, these methods rely on complex models and heavy computations that are not always practical for a quick scan of a large number of sequences.
RESULTS: We have developed SHERPAS, a new program to detect novel recombinants and provide a first estimate of their parental composition. Our approach is based on the precomputation of a large database of 'phylogenetically-informed k-mers', an idea recently introduced in the context of phylogenetic placement in metagenomics. Our experiments show that SHERPAS is hundreds to thousands of times faster than existing software, and enables the analysis of thousands of whole genomes, or long-sequencing reads, within minutes or seconds, and with limited loss of accuracy.

33330873,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential.,"UNLABELLED: Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2'-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16's conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Coronaviruses are a major threat to human health. These viruses employ molecular machines, called proteins, to infect host cells and replicate. Characterizing the structure and dynamics of these proteins could provide a basis for designing small molecule antivirals. In this work, we use computer simulations to understand the moving parts of an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, understand how a binding partner turns it on and off, and identify a novel pocket that antivirals could target to shut this protein off. The pocket is also present in other coronaviruses but not in the related human protein, so it could be a valuable target for pan-coronavirus antivirals.","['Vithani N', 'Ward MD', 'Zimmerman MI', 'Novak B', 'Borowsky JH', 'Singh S', 'Bowman GR']",2020,,,bioRxiv,"Vithani N, et al.

33327932,Using earth mover's distance for viral outbreak investigations.,"BACKGROUND: RNA viruses mutate at extremely high rates, forming an intra-host viral population of closely related variants, which allows them to evade the host's immune system and makes them particularly dangerous. Viral outbreaks pose a significant threat for public health, and, in order to deal with it, it is critical to infer transmission clusters, i.e., decide whether two viral samples belong to the same outbreak. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can significantly help in tackling outbreak-related problems. While NGS data is first obtained as short reads, existing methods rely on assembled sequences. This requires reconstruction of the entire viral population, which is complicated, error-prone and time-consuming.
RESULTS: The experimental validation using sequencing data from HCV outbreaks shows that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify genetic relatedness between viral populations, infer transmission direction, transmission clusters and outbreak sources, as well as decide whether the source is present in the sequenced outbreak sample and identify it.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduced algorithm allows to cluster genetically related samples, infer transmission directions and predict sources of outbreaks. Validation on experimental data demonstrated that algorithm is able to reconstruct various transmission characteristics. Advantage of the method is the ability to bypass cumbersome read assembly, thus eliminating the chance to introduce new errors, and saving processing time by allowing to use raw NGS reads.","['Melnyk A', 'Knyazev S', 'Vannberg F', 'Bunimovich L', 'Skums P', 'Zelikovsky A']",2020,21,Suppl 5,BMC Genomics,"Melnyk A, et al.

33324374,Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Intensive Early Stage Responses of Host Cells to SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is therefore important and timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production, followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection. Taken together, our findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","['Sun J', 'Ye F', 'Wu A', 'Yang R', 'Pan M', 'Sheng J', 'Zhu W', 'Mao L', 'Wang M', 'Xia Z', 'Huang B', 'Tan W', 'Jiang T']",2020,11,,Front Microbiol,"Sun J, et al.

DESIGN: Scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 24 of April 2020) and PubMed (2020 to 17 of September 2020).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: A search using the search terms: [(cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol or vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 or vitamin D or 25OHD) and (SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus or COVID or betacoronavirus or MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV or respiratory infection or acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS)]m.p. was conducted on the 24/04/2020 (Search A) and 17/09/2020 (Search B).
RESULTS: 91 studies were identified as being concerned with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and vitamin D, and 25 publications specifically explored the role of vitamin D deficiency in the development and progression of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related ARDS. Search ""A"" identified three main themes of indirect evidence supporting such an association. Consistent epidemiological evidence exists linking low vitamin D levels to increased risk and severity of respiratory tract infections. We also report on plausible biological processes supporting such an association; and present weaker evidence supporting the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk and severity of ARIs. Uncertainty remains about what constitutes an appropriate dosing regimen in relation to reducing risk/severity of ARI/ARDS. More recent evidence (Search B) provided new insights into some direct links between vitamin D and COVID-19; with a number of cohort and ecological studies supporting an association with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency. The exact efficacy of the vitamin D supplementation for prevention of, or as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 remains to be determined; but a number of randomized control trials (RCTs) currently underway are actively investigating these potential benefits.
CONCLUSION: Our rapid review of literature supports the need for observational studies with COVID-19 infected populations to measure and assess vitamin D levels in relation to risk/severity and outcomes; alongside RCTs designed to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation both in preventive and therapeutic contexts. The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation.","['Santaolalla A', 'Beckmann K', 'Kibaru J', 'Josephs D', 'Van Hemelrijck M', 'Irshad S']",2020,11,,Front Physiol,"Santaolalla A, et al.

Among them, macrophages play a central role in antiviral responses, tissue repair, and fibrosis. Macrophages can be reprogrammed by environmental cues, thus changing their phenotype during an antiviral immune response as the viral infection progresses. While M1-like macrophages are essential for the initial inflammatory responses, M2-like macrophages are critical for tissue repair after pathogen clearance. Numerous reports have evaluated the detrimental effects that coronaviruses, e.g., HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have on the antiviral immune response and macrophage functions. In this review, we have addressed the breadth of macrophage phenotypes during the antiviral response and provided an overview of macrophage-coronavirus interactions. We also discussed therapeutic approaches to target macrophage-induced complications, currently under evaluation in clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

This study aimed to identify the risk and protective factors for mental health outcomes in health care workers during coronavirus epidemics.
METHODS: A rapid systematic review was performed in three databases (March 24, 2020) and a current COVID-19 resource (May 28, 2020). Following study selection, study characteristics and effect measures were tabulated, and data were synthesized by using vote counting. Meta-analysis was not possible because of high variation in risk factors, outcomes and effect measures. Risk of bias of each study was assessed and the certainty of evidence was appraised according to the GRADE methodology.
RESULTS: Out of 2605 references, 33 observational studies were selected and the identified risk and protective factors were categorized in ten thematic categories. Most of these studies (n = 23) were performed during the SARS outbreak, seven during the current COVID-19 pandemic and three during the MERS outbreak. The level of disease exposure and health fear were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. There was evidence that clear communication and support from the organization, social support and personal sense of control are protective factors. The evidence was of very low certainty, because of risk of bias and imprecision.
CONCLUSION: Safeguarding mental health of health care workers during infectious disease outbreaks should not be treated as a separate mental health intervention strategy, but could benefit from a protective approach. This study suggests that embedding mental health support in a safe and efficient working environment which promotes collegial social support and personal sense of control could help to maximize resilience of health care workers. Low quality cross-sectional studies currently provide the best possible evidence, and further research is warranted to confirm causality.","['De Brier N', 'Stroobants S', 'Vandekerckhove P', 'De Buck E']",2020,15,12,PLoS One,"De Brier N, et al.

33318594,Development of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation for the detection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.,"The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, and its dissemination globally has caused an unprecedented strain on public health. Animal models are urgently being developed for SARS-CoV-2 to aid rational design of vaccines and therapeutics. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation techniques that facilitate reliable and reproducible detection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral products in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens would be of great utility. A selection of commercial antibodies generated against SARS-CoV spike protein and nucleoprotein, double stranded RNA, and RNA probe for spike genes were evaluated for the ability to detect FFPE infected cells. We also tested both heat- and enzymatic-mediated virus antigen retrieval methods to determine the optimal virus antigen recovery as well as identifying alternative retrieval methods to enable flexibility of IHC methods. In addition to using native virus infected cells as positive control material, the evaluation of non-infected cells expressing coronavirus (SARS, MERS) spike as a biosecure alternative to assays involving live virus was undertaken. Optimized protocols were successfully applied to experimental animal-derived tissues. The diverse techniques for virus detection and control material generation demonstrated in this study can be applied to investigations of coronavirus pathogenesis and therapeutic research in animal models.","['Lean FZX', 'Lamers MM', 'Smith SP', 'Shipley R', 'Schipper D', 'Temperton N', 'Haagmans BL', 'Banyard AC', 'Bewley KR', 'Carroll MW', 'Brookes SM', 'Brown I', 'Nuñez A']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Lean FZX, et al.

33316899,Bat-Borne Coronaviruses in Jordan and Saudi Arabia: A Threat to Public Health?,"Emerging infectious diseases are of great concern to public health, as highlighted by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Such diseases are of particular danger during mass gathering and mass influx events, as large crowds of people in close proximity to each other creates optimal opportunities for disease transmission. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that have witnessed mass gatherings due to the arrival of Syrian refugees and the annual Hajj season. The mass migration of people not only brings exotic diseases to these regions but also brings new diseases back to their own countries, e.g., the outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Many emerging pathogens originate in bats, and more than 30 bat species have been identified in these two countries. Some of those bat species are known to carry viruses that cause deadly diseases in other parts of the world, such as the rabies virus and coronaviruses. However, little is known about bats and the pathogens they carry in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Here, the importance of enhanced surveillance of bat-borne infections in Jordan and Saudi Arabia is emphasized, promoting the awareness of bat-borne diseases among the general public and building up infrastructure and capability to fill the gaps in public health preparedness to prevent future pandemics.","['Al-Eitan LN', 'Tarkhan AH', 'Alghamdi MA', 'Marston DA', 'Wu G', 'McElhinney LM', 'Brown IH', 'Fooks AR']",2020,12,12,Viruses,"Al-Eitan LN, et al.

In the last twenty years, we have witnessed several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and most recently Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). There were tremendous efforts endeavoured globally by scientists to combat these viral diseases and now for SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and dexamethasone are adopted for use against COVID-19 and currently clinical studies are underway to test their safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19 patients. As per World Health Organization reports, so far more than 16 million people are affected by COVID-19 with a recovery of close to 10 million and deaths at 600,000 globally. SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported to cause extensive pulmonary damages in affected people. Given the large number of recoveries, it is important to follow-up the recovered patients for apparent lung function abnormalities. In this review, we discuss our understanding about the development of long-term pulmonary abnormalities such as lung fibrosis observed in patients recovered from coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and probable epigenetic therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of similar pulmonary abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients. In this regard, we address the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors therapy to manage pulmonary fibrosis and their underlying molecular mechanisms in managing the pathologic processes in COVID-19 recovered patients.","['P KM', 'Sivashanmugam K', 'Kandasamy M', 'Subbiah R', 'Ravikumar V']",2021,266,,Life Sci,"P KM, et al.

33315687,Rewriting the playbook: infection prevention practices to mitigate nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Given the limited evidence and experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this novel pathogen has challenged the field of infection prevention. Despite uncertainty, infection prevention principles and experience with similar diseases have helped guide how to best protect providers and patients against disease acquisition.
RECENT FINDINGS: Guidance to date has relied on data from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to guide practices on patient isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Although a face mask and eye protection are likely adequate for most clinical scenarios, published guidelines for PPE can be confusing and conflicting. Consensus for what constitutes a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is lacking, but most agree providers performing procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation would likely benefit from the use of an N95 respirator and eye protection.
SUMMARY: Needed research to elucidate the predominant SARS-CoV-2 mode of transmission is not likely to be completed in the immediate future. Recommendations for PPE to mitigate procedure-associated risk remain controversial. Nonetheless, implementation of existing measures based on basic infection prevention principles is likely to prevent transmission significantly.","['Scaggs Huang F', 'Schaffzin JK']",2021,33,1,Curr Opin Pediatr,Scaggs Huang F and Schaffzin JK.

33313272,Current therapeutic options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) therapy: a systematic review protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, first manifested in December 2019, and spread rapidly worldwide. Facing this lethal disease, there is an urgent need to develop potent therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically and symptomatically resembles SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Numerous agents have been utilised during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics, which may show some benefit against SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CBM Disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and the China Science and Technology Journal Database will be searched. Manual searches will be conducted by searching pre-printing websites, clinical trial registers, and screening the reference lists of inclusive studies. The screening of all citations and the selection of inclusive articles will be conducted by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled cohort studies reporting antiviral therapies, including ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 will be included. The primary outcomes will be mortality, incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and utilisation of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission. The secondary outcomes will be improvement in symptoms and chest radiography results, virus clearance, changes in blood test results, and serum tests. The quality of the retrieved RCTs and observational studies will be appraised according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. If feasible, we will perform a fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis.
DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will summarise all the available evidence for the efficacy and safety of current therapeutic options in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The findings of this study may inform subsequent antiviral interventions for patients with COVID-19.

DATA SOURCES: Published literature obtained through PubMed database searches and reports from national and international public health agencies.
STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies relevant to the basic science, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, with a focus on patients with asthma, allergy, and primary immunodeficiency.
RESULTS: Although SARS and MERS each caused less than a thousand deaths, COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic with nearly 1 million deaths. Diagnosing COVID-19 relies on nucleic acid amplification tests, and infection has broad clinical manifestations that can affect almost every organ system. Asthma and atopy do not seem to predispose patients to COVID-19 infection, but their effects on COVID-19 clinical outcomes remain mixed and inconclusive. It is recommended that effective therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids and biologic therapy, be continued to maintain disease control. There are no reports of COVID-19 among patients with primary innate and T-cell deficiencies. The presentation of COVID-19 among patients with primary antibody deficiencies is variable, with some experiencing mild clinical courses, whereas others experiencing a fatal disease. The landscape of treatment for COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, with both antivirals and immunomodulators demonstrating efficacy.

Up to now, the development of vaccine is still in the stage of clinical research, and there is no clinically approved specific antiviral drug for human coronavirus infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key molecules involved in response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide references for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We conducted in-depth and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of human proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2, including functional enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, screening of hub genes, and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic targets. In addition, we used the gene-drug database to search for inhibitors of related biological targets.
RESULTS: Several significant pathways, such as PKA, centrosome and transcriptional regulation, may greatly contribute to the development and progression of COVID-2019 disease. Taken together 15 drugs and 18 herb ingredients were screened as potential drugs for viral treatment. Specially, the trans-resveratrol can significantly reduce the expression of N protein of MERS-CoV and inhibit MERS-CoV. In addition, trans-resveratrol, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and BX795 all show good anti multiple virus effects.
CONCLUSION: Some drugs selected through our methods have been proven to have antiviral effects in previous studies.

The infectious disease caused by the virus that affected the entire world was named as the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The knowledge regarding the wide clinico-biological aspects of the COVID-19 continues to evolve very rapidly, given the growing data from all over the world. During this complicated process, healthcare professionals have benefited from each other’s experiences in combatting against the COVID-19 syndrome. COVID-19 related studies have been performed by a wide variety of research groups in Turkey as well as the rest of the world. The aim of this paper is to outline Turkish COVID-19 research indexed in the LitCovid system. LitCovid is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific data about the SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19’s first case was detected in Turkey, on March 11th, 2020. Six months after the first case was observed, the total number of COVID-19 patients was reported to be as 286,455, and the total number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 was 6895. The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Numerous drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir, azithromycin, and chloroquine have been suggested for the management of COVID-19 although the exact treatment is yet to be determined.","['Çiftçiler R', 'Haznedaroğlu İC', 'Tufan A', 'Öztürk MA']",2021,51,3,Turk J Med Sci,"Çiftçiler R, et al.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of 29 October 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths.
DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infected patients usually present with severe viral pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV, the virus enters respiratory tract cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2. The structural proteins play an essential role in budding the virus particles released from different host cells. To date, an approved vaccine or treatment option of a preventive character to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 is still not available.

Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (""corona"") and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. This review highlights aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis that may be amenable to host-directed antiviral targeting.","['Santopolo S', 'Riccio A', 'Santoro MG']",2021,538,,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Santopolo S, et al.

The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses.","['Hatmal MM', 'Alshaer W', 'Al-Hatamleh MAI', 'Hatmal M', 'Smadi O', 'Taha MO', 'Oweida AJ', 'Boer JC', 'Mohamud R', 'Plebanski M']",2020,9,12,Cells,"Hatmal MM, et al.

33301248,[Endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19].,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize an experience of endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomies in patients with COVID-19.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 31 endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomies in patients with COVID-19 for the period from April 17 to June 10, 2020 (11 women and 19 men). Mean age of patients was 66.7 years (range 48-87). Tracheostomy was performed using Ciaglia (22) and Griggs (9) techniques. All procedures were carried out at the intensive care unit in elective fashion.
RESULTS: Tracheostomy was performed in 19.8% of ICU patients or 36.9% of all patients on mechanical ventilation within 6.5±2.5 days [min 3, max 11]. There were 22 survivors with tracheostomy (70.9%) that is comparable with survival of patients without mechanical ventilation (79.7%) and slightly higher than in patients on ventilation without tracheostomy (65.4%). No complications during the procedure were noted.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopy-assisted dilatational tracheostomy is preferred for prolonged mechanical ventilation, including patients with COVID-19.

33299613,Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum Secondary to COVID-19 Disease Unrelated to Mechanical Ventilation.,"In the recent worldwide coronavirus 2019 pandemic, a notable rise in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax complications has been witnessed in numerous mechanically ventilated patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Most cases have reported these complications as barotrauma from mechanical ventilation with COVID-19 disease. We aim to report three polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients who developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax unrelated to mechanical ventilation. We originally analyzed 800 patients with COVID-19 disease at Orlando Regional Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, of which 12 patients developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in their hospital course. Interestingly, three patients developed pneumomediastinum on chest imaging prior to intubation. We present these three patients, one female and two males, ages of 42, 64, and 65, respectively, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease through nasopharyngeal sampling tests with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are potential complications of COVID-19 disease in the lungs unrelated to mechanical ventilation. This is similar to previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) diseases. Further investigation is needed to define the causality of pneumomediastinum in nonintubated COVID-19 patients to define the incidence of disease.","['Tucker L', 'Patel S', 'Vatsis C', 'Poma A', 'Ammar A', 'Nasser W', 'Mukkera S', 'Vo M', 'Khan R', 'Carlan S']",2020,2020,,Case Rep Crit Care,"Tucker L, et al.

33297909,"The Role of Interleukin-6 in the Pathogenesis, Prognosis and Treatment of Severe COVID-19.","A newly identified virus appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 presents similarities with two previous coronavirus pandemics, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARSCoV, concerning phylogenetic origin, structural composition, and clinical symptoms, thus, leading to common pathogenic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to declare the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 by comparing its effect on SARS-CoV and MERS cases. Increased levels of IL-6 comprise the key for the stimulation of cytokine storm and the progression of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cases. Especially, in COVID-19 patients, the overactivation of NF-kΒ, which is caused by the binding of coronavirus spike protein S to alveolar epithelial cells, up-regulates IL-6 and promotes its systematic circulation, causing alveolar damage and extrapulmonary injury. Additionally, IL-6 can be used to evaluate respiratory failure and identify asymptomatic patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-6 signaling, comprises a remedial option against COVID-19. TCZ improves oxygenation, reduces fever, and decreases levels of IL-6. IL-6 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 and may be used as a therapeutic target against COVID-19. However, further research is needed concerning the relation of IL-6 in COVID-19 cases, and more clinical trials are required to declare TCZ as a treatment option.","['Giannakodimos I', 'Gkountana GV', 'Lykouras D', 'Karkoulias K', 'Tsakas S']",2021,28,26,Curr Med Chem,"Giannakodimos I, et al.

Administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. CP can also be used for production a specific immunoglobulin. Experience from previous epidemic infections, caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, shows that CP contains neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which are probably the main source of its therapeutic potential. However, other immune mechanisms cannot be ruled out, such as antibody-induced cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 spread during the first half of year 2020 in many countries worldwide and relatively common is also in the Czech Republic, where, at the end of August 2020, about 100 patients were treated with CP. The production and use of CP is governed by the national multidisciplinary guidelines from April 2020 and the recommended therapeutic dose are 2 TU RP (400-450 mL), resp. 4-6 mL/kg.

33294487,Association of climatic factors with COVID-19 in Pakistan.,"INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors such as wind, temperature, humidity, and sun exposure are known to affect influenza and viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions. COVID-19 is a new pandemic with very little information available about its transmission and association with environmental factors. The goal of this paper is to explore the association of environmental factors on daily incidence rate, mortality rate, and recoveries of COVID-19.
METHODS: The environmental data for humidity, temperature, wind, and sun exposure were recorded from metrological websites and COVID-19 data such as the daily incidence rate, death rate, and daily recovery were extracted from the government's official website available to the general public. The analysis for each outcome was adjusted for factors such as lock down status, nationwide events, and the number of daily tests performed. Analysis was completed with negative binominal regression log link using generalised linear modelling.
RESULTS: Daily temperature, sun exposure, wind, and humidity were not significantly associated with daily incidence rate. Temperature and nationwide social gatherings, although non-significant, showed trends towards a higher chance of incidence. An increase in the number of daily testing was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 incidences (effect size ranged from 2.17-9.96). No factors were significantly associated with daily death rates. Except for the province of Balochistan, a lower daily temperature was associated with a significantly higher daily recovery rate.
DISCUSSION: Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and daily sun exposure were not consistently associated with COVID-19 incidence, death rates, or recovery. More policing about precautionary measures and ensuring diagnostic testing and accuracy are needed.","['Rehman Y', 'Rehman N']",2020,7,4,AIMS Public Health,Rehman Y and Rehman N.

33294307,Are losartan and imatinib effective against SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? A pathophysiologic-based in silico study.,"Proposing a theory about the pathophysiology of cytokine storm in COVID19, we were to find the potential drugs to treat this disease and to find any effect of these drugs on the virus infectivity through an in silico study. COVID-19-induced ARDS is linked to a cytokine storm phenomenon not explainable solely by the virus infectivity. Knowing that ACE2, the hydrolyzing enzyme of AngII and SARS-CoV2 receptor, downregulates when the virus enters the host cells, we hypothesize that hyperacute AngII upregulation is the eliciting factor of this ARDS. We were to validate this theory through reviewing previous studies to figure out the role of overzealous activation of AT1R in ARDS. According to this theory losartan may attenuate ARDS in this disease. Imatinib, has previously been elucidated to be promising in modulating lung inflammatory reactions and virus infectivity in SARS and MERS. We did an in silico study to uncover any probable other unconsidered inhibitory effects of losartan and imatinib against SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis. Reviewing the literature, we could find that over-activation of AT1R could explain precisely the mechanism of cytokine storm in COVID19. Our in silico study revealed that losartan and imatinib could probably: (1) decline SARS-CoV2 affinity to ACE2. (2) inhibit the main protease and furin, (3) disturb papain-like protease and p38MAPK functions. Our reviewing on renin-angiotensin system showed that overzealous activation of AT1R by hyper-acute excess of AngII due to acute downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV2 explains precisely the mechanism of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Besides, based on our in silico study we concluded that losartan and imatinib are promising in COVID19.","['Nejat R', 'Sadr AS']",2021,9,1,In Silico Pharmacol,Nejat R and Sadr AS.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus's cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure. Also, various types of vaccines are developed in record time to address the urgency of efficient SARS-CoV-2 prevention. Currently, 58 vaccines are evaluated in clinical trials, including 11 in phase III, and 3 of them reported efficacy above 90 %.

Using phylogenetics and ""high order genomic structures"" including trimer spectrums, codon usage and dinucleotide suppression, we observed distinct clustering of all human coronaviruses that formed phylogenetic clades with their closest animal relatives, indicating they have encompassed long evolutionary histories within specific ecological niches before jumping species barrier to infect humans. The close relationships between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 imply similar evolutionary origin. However, a lower Effective Codon Number (ENC) pattern and CpG dinucleotide suppression in SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may imply a better host fitness, and thus their success in sustaining a pandemic.

To date there is emerging evidence to provide effectiveness and compliance to intervention measures on COVID-19 due to rapid spread of the disease. We synthesized evidence of community interventions and innovative practices to mitigate COVID-19 as well as previous respiratory outbreak infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. In the study, we systematically searched the literature on community interventions to mitigate COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H1N1 Influenza and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in PubMed, Google Scholar, World Health Organization (WHO), MEDRXIV and Google from their inception until May 30, 2020 for up-to-date published and grey resources. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicates. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183064). Of 41,138 papers found, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria in various settings in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). One of the papers from LMICs originated from Africa (Madagascar) with the rest from Asia 9 (China 5, Bangladesh 2, Thailand 2); South America 5 (Mexico 3, Peru 2) and Europe 2 (Serbia and Romania). Following five studies on the use of face masks, the risk of contracting SARS and Influenza was reduced OR 0.78 and 95% CI = 0.36-1.67. Equally, six studies on hand hygiene practices reported a reduced risk of contracting SARS and Influenza OR 0.95 and 95% CI = 0.83-1.08. Further two studies that looked at combined use of face masks and hand hygiene interventions showed the effectiveness in controlling the transmission of influenza OR 0.94 and 95% CI = 0.58-1.54. Nine studies on social distancing intervention demonstrated the importance of physical distance through closure of learning institutions on the transmission dynamics of disease. The evidence confirms the use of face masks, good hand hygiene and social distancing as community interventions are effective to control the spread of SARS and influenza in LMICs. However, the effectiveness of community interventions in LMICs should be informed by adherence of the mitigation measures and contextual factors taking into account the best practices. The study has shown gaps in adherence/compliance of the interventions, hence a need for robust intervention studies to better inform the evidence on compliance of the interventions.

The transmission method of the infection is primarily through droplets of various sizes. The SARS-CoV2 virus leads to a severe respiratory illness which in the first place causes the simulation of the acute respiratory syndrome. In order to diagnose of COVID-19 efficiently, samples with infection probability need to be examined through histopathological methods. Survival chances of the infected can remarkably increase if the virus is diagnosed timely by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. One of the destructive effects of COVID-19 is the formation of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lungs which might be regarded to be equivalent to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).

It changed in the last two decades as three global outbreaks by coronaviruses led to significant mortality and morbidity. SARS CoV-1 led to the first epidemic of the twenty first century due to coronavirus. SARS COV-1 infection had a broad array of symptoms with respiratory and gastrointestinal as most frequent. The last known case was reported in 2004. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) led to the second outbreak in 2012, and case fatality was much higher than SARS. MERS-CoV has a wide array of clinical presentations from mild, moderate to severe, and some patients end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The third and recent outbreak by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019, which lead to a global pandemic. Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection can be asymptomatic or have a range of symptoms with fever, cough, and shortness of breath being most common. Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a diagnostic test of choice for SARS CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2 infections.

33282586,Coronavirus-Associated Coagulopathy: Lessons From SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV for the Current SARS-CoV2 Pandemic.,"To date, several studies have suggested a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)-mediated hypercoagulability in the forms of pulmonary embolism, stroke, gangrene, ""COVID toes,"" as well as other acute thrombotic complications, warranting the use of systemic anticoagulation. Currently, there are no definitive recommendations as to the timing and dosing of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this manuscript, we report a case of SARS-CoV2-mediated hypercoagulability and review the literature pertaining to the incidence and pathophysiology of coronavirus-mediated coagulopathies. A 64-year-old female, with a medical history of hypothyroidism and remote tobacco abuse, presented to the ED with fever and nonproductive cough. She had multiple negative SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal PCR tests during her hospital stay, but chest imaging and elevated inflammatory markers were suggestive of SARS-CoV2 infection. Computed tomography showed a left upper lobe pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain, and an enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, for which she was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Despite the medical management of her pulmonary embolism and conservative management of her SARS-CoV2, her clinical condition worsened requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. After seven days, she was successfully extubated and was transferred to the medical service where her clinical course remained stable and subsequently discharged home on apixaban. In patients with SARS-CoV1-, SARS-CoV2-, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-mediated hypercoagulability, the risk of thrombosis appears to be multifactorial - direct viral cytopathological effects, a pro-inflammatory state, cytokine storm, hypoxia-inducible thrombosis, and endothelial inflammation culminating in the formation of intra-alveolar or systemic fibrin clots. While initial guidelines have been developed to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate chemoprophylaxis as well as therapeutic anticoagulation, a consensus statement remains lacking. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenesis and treatment of coronavirus-induced thrombosis.","['Singh S', 'Zuwasti U', 'Haas C']",2020,12,11,Cureus,"Singh S, et al.

This study investigated the effects of meteorological factors on daily new cases of COVID-19 in 127 countries, as of August 31 2020. The log-linear generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the effect of meteorological variables on daily new cases of COVID-19. Our findings revealed that temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed are nonlinearly correlated with daily new cases, and they may be negatively correlated with the daily new cases of COVID-19 over 127 countries when temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were below 20°C, 70% and 7 m/s respectively. Temperature(>20°C) was positively correlated with daily new cases. Wind speed (when>7 m/s) and relative humidity (>70%) was not statistically associated with transmission of COVID-19. The results of this research will be a useful supplement to help healthcare policymakers in the Belt and Road countries, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop strategies to combat COVID-19.","['Yuan J', 'Wu Y', 'Jing W', 'Liu J', 'Du M', 'Wang Y', 'Liu M']",2021,193,,Environ Res,"Yuan J, et al.

33276356,[The Challenges of Vaccine Development Against Betacoronaviruses: Antibody Dependent Enhancement and Sendai Virus as a Possible Vaccine Vector].,"To design an effective and safe vaccine against betacoronaviruses, it is necessary to elicit a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses as well as to minimize the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection. The mucosal immunity and the production of IgA antibodies accompanying its development reduces the likelihood of developing an antibody-dependent infection enhancement, which is usually associated only with immunopathological IgG antibodies.","['Zaichuk TA', 'Nechipurenko YD', 'Adzhubey AA', 'Onikienko SB', 'Chereshnev VA', 'Zainutdinov SS', 'Kochneva GV', 'Netesov SV', 'Matveeva OV']",2020,54,6,Mol Biol (Mosk),"Zaichuk TA, et al.

None of them is specific for the virulence glycoproteins and complete sequence-structural features of these virulence factors across the betacoronavirus family including SARS-CoV-2 strains are lacking. Against this backdrop, we present DBCOVP (http://covp.immt.res.in/), the first manually-curated, web-based resource to provide extensive information on the complete repertoire of structural virulent glycoproteins from coronavirus genomes belonging to betacoronavirus genera. The database provides various sequence-structural properties in which users can browse and analyze information in different ways. Furthermore, many conserved T-cell and B-cell epitopes predicted for each protein are present that may perform a significant role in eliciting the humoral and cellular immune response. The tertiary structure of the epitopes together with the docked epitope-HLA binding-complex is made available to facilitate further analysis. DBCOVP presents an easy-to-use interface with in-built tools for similarity search, cross-genome comparison, phylogenetic, and multiple sequence alignment.

The SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) but has reduced fatality. At present, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused about 1.16 million deaths with more than 43.4 million confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in a serious threat to public health globally with yet uncertain impact. The disease is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with an infected person. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days. COVID-19 is accompanied by various symptoms, including cough and fatigue. In most people, the disease is mild, but in some other people, such as in the elderly and people with chronic diseases, it may progress from pneumonia to a multi-organ dysfunction. Many people are reported asymptomatic. The virus genome is sequenced, but new variants are reported. Numerous biochemical aspects of its structure and function are revealed. To date, no clinically approved vaccines and/or specific therapeutic drugs are available to prevent or treat COVID-19. However, there are reported intensive researches on the SARS-CoV-2 to potentially identify vaccines and/or drug targets, which may help to overcome the disease.

Research related to the earlier coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks (like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) shows the neurotropic nature of CoV and the plethora of neuropsychiatric effects that it can cause. Though the current health priorities in managing COVID-19 remain restricted to containment and targeting pulmonary symptoms, the potential acute and long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of the infection can increase morbidity and worsen the quality of life. Emerging evidence shows neural spread of the novel coronavirus. Delirium, encephalopathy, olfactory disturbances, acute behavioral changes, headache and cerebrovascular accidents are its common neuropsychiatric complications. These are directly related to increase in peripheral immunological markers, severity of infection and case fatality rate.

In humans, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic and is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. All viruses described to date entirely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of the host cells to produce proteins required for their replication and spread. As such, virus often need to control the cellular translational apparatus to avoid the first line of the cellular defense intended to limit the viral propagation. Thus, coronaviruses have developed remarkable strategies to hijack the host translational machinery in order to favor viral protein production. In this review, we will describe some of these strategies and will highlight the role of viral proteins and RNAs in this process.","['de Breyne S', 'Vindry C', 'Guillin O', 'Condé L', 'Mure F', 'Gruffat H', 'Chavatte L', 'Ohlmann T']",2020,48,22,Nucleic Acids Res,"de Breyne S, et al.

Solution CD and melting data showed that the CG-rich, near-palindromic REPs from various bacterial species exhibit dynamic temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent equilibria, including architectures compatible with not only hairpins, which are expected to be biologically relevant, but also antiparallel duplexes and bimolecular tetraplexes. Three 18-mer oligonucleotides named Hpar-18 (PDB entry 6rou), Chom-18 (PDB entry 6ros) and its brominated variant Chom-18Br (PDB entry 6ror) crystallized as isomorphic right-handed A-like duplexes. The low-resolution crystal structures were solved with the help of experimental phases for Chom-18Br. The center of the duplexes is formed by two successive T-T noncanonical base pairs (mismatches). They do not deform the double-helical geometry. The presence of T-T mismatches prompted an analysis of the geometries of these and other noncanonical pairs in other DNA crystals in terms of their fit to the experimental electron densities (RSCC) and their geometric fit to the NtC (dinucleotide conformational) classes (https://dnatco.datmos.org/). Throughout this work, knowledge of the NtC classes was used to refine and validate the crystal structures, and to analyze the mismatches.","['Kolenko P', 'Svoboda J', 'Černý J', 'Charnavets T', 'Schneider B']",2020,76,Pt 12,Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,"Kolenko P, et al.

33262798,Real Clinical Practice and Therapeutic Management Following COVID-19 Crisis in two Hospitals in Iran: A Statistical and Conceptual View.,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak quickly has spread and became a pandemic. However, no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is available for the treatment of these patients. The present study was done to retrospectively assess the treatment strategies (e.g., pharmaceutical care services) for COVID-19 patients in selected hospitals and highlight the importance of such services in the management of a pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a series of COVID-19 patients (978 patients; 658 males [66.9%] and 324 females [33.1%]) admitted to the selected hospitals in Tehran from 20 February to 19 March 2020 were retrieved retrospectively from the Health Information System (HIS) of the hospitals. The statistical tests were used for analyzing the effect and correlation of the variables (drugs) with the average length of stay (ALOS) in the hospital.
RESULTS: Diverse medication classes and old drugs with or without strong evidence of therapeutic effects against the novel coronavirus, some previously tried as a treatment for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were mostly used for the treatment of patients in the hospitals. Many medications (broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals) or combination therapies are used without evidence of their therapeutic effects during pandemics.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, guidelines should be provided for the off-label use of these drugs by policymakers and stakeholders during a pandemic emergency due to high demands. Also, monitoring of the HIS data can play an important role in improving public health response to emerging diseases.","['Najafi A', 'Ghanei M', 'Janbabaei G', 'Velayati AA', 'Saadat SH', 'Jamaati H', 'Tabarsi P', 'Dastan F', 'Ram M', 'Darabi E', 'Fathi S', 'Gholami Fesharaki M', 'Ghazale AH', 'Saloo S']",2020,19,2,Tanaffos,"Najafi A, et al.

The modular nature of gene networks was used in this study to detect functionally enriched modules in samples obtained from COPD patients. We analyzed modules extracted from COPD samples and identified crucial genes associated with the disease COVID-19. We also extracted modules from a COVID-19 dataset and analyzed a suspected set of genes that may be associated with this deadly disease. We used information available for two other viruses that cause SARS and MERS because their physiology is similar to that of the COVID-19 virus. We report several crucial genes associated with COVID-19: RPA2, POLD4, MAPK8, IRF7, JUN, NFKB1, NFKBIA, CD40LG, FASLG, ICAM1, LIFR, STAT2 and CCR1. Most of these genes are related to the immune system and respiratory organs, which emphasizes the fact that COPD weakens this system and makes patients more susceptible to developing severe COVID-19.","['Sharma P', 'Pandey AK', 'Bhattacharyya DK']",2021,128,,Comput Biol Med,"Sharma P, et al.

Knowledge of the host transcriptional response against this virus and how the pathways are activated or suppressed compared to other human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that caused outbreaks previously can help in the identification of potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses. Based on these findings, a drug repurposing analysis was performed to identify potential drug candidates for combating COVID-19.","['Krishnamoorthy P', 'Raj AS', 'Roy S', 'Kumar NS', 'Kumar H']",2021,128,,Comput Biol Med,"Krishnamoorthy P, et al.

33259809,The Short- and Long-Range RNA-RNA Interactome of SARS-CoV-2.,"The Coronaviridae is a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells and engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction, the FSE-arch, that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA structure-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","['Ziv O', 'Price J', 'Shalamova L', 'Kamenova T', 'Goodfellow I', 'Weber F', 'Miska EA']",2020,80,6,Mol Cell,"Ziv O, et al.

33258903,The zoonotic potential of bat-borne coronaviruses.,"Seven zoonoses - human infections of animal origin - have emerged from the Coronaviridae family in the past century, including three viruses responsible for significant human mortality (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) in the past twenty years alone. These three viruses, in addition to two older CoV zoonoses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) are believed to be originally derived from wild bat reservoir species. We review the molecular biology of the bat-derived Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera, highlighting features that contribute to their potential for cross-species emergence, including the use of well-conserved mammalian host cell machinery for cell entry and a unique capacity for adaptation to novel host environments after host switching. The adaptive capacity of coronaviruses largely results from their large genomes, which reduce the risk of deleterious mutational errors and facilitate range-expanding recombination events by offering heightened redundancy in essential genetic material. Large CoV genomes are made possible by the unique proofreading capacity encoded for their RNA-dependent polymerase. We find that bat-borne SARS-related coronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, the source clade for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, present a particularly poignant pandemic threat, due to the extraordinary viral genetic diversity represented among several sympatric species of their horseshoe bat hosts. To date, Sarbecovirus surveillance has been almost entirely restricted to China. More vigorous field research efforts tracking the circulation of Sarbecoviruses specifically and Betacoronaviruses more generally is needed across a broader global range if we are to avoid future repeats of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Ravelomanantsoa NAF', 'Guth S', 'Andrianiaina A', 'Andry S', 'Gentles A', 'Ranaivoson HC', 'Brook CE']",2020,4,4,Emerg Top Life Sci,"Ravelomanantsoa NAF, et al.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey to describe the camel herd profile and determine the factors associated with MERS-CoV seropositivity in Northern Kenya. We enrolled 29 camel-owning households and administered questionnaires to collect herd and household data. Serum samples collected from 493 randomly selected camels were tested for anti-MERS-CoV antibodies using a microneutralisation assay, and regression analysis used to correlate herd and household characteristics with camel seropositivity. Households reared camels (median = 23 camels and IQR 16-56), and at least one other livestock species in two distinct herds; a home herd kept near homesteads, and a range/fora herd that resided far from the homestead. The overall MERS-CoV IgG seropositivity was 76.3%, with no statistically significant difference between home and fora herds. Significant predictors for seropositivity (P ⩽ 0.05) included camels 6-10 years old (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.2), herds with ⩾25 camels (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4) and camels from Gabra community (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2).

Developing novel therapeutics and a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 requires an understanding of the similarities and differences between the various human coronaviruses with regards to their phylogenic relationships, transmission, and management. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that humans were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and the virus rapidly spread from the outbreak epicenter in Wuhan, China to various parts of the world. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have now been identified in particular regions. It is apparent that MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 present with several common symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea in mild cases, but can also progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Understanding the molecular steps leading to SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells and the viral replication cycle can illuminate crucial targets for testing several potential therapeutics. Genomic and structural details of SARS-CoV-2 and previous attempts to generate vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS have provided vaccine targets to manage future outbreaks more effectively.

Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases). We propose here a mixed pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacochemical hypothesis to explain these findings. A number of psychotropic drugs exhibit activities against coronaviruses (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)) and have been put forward as potentially anti-SARS-CoV-2. These treatments include numerous mee-too drugs (chemically and pharmacologically linked to those which have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy) which are frequently prescribed in psychiatric settings. Taken alone or in polypharmacy, these drugs could have a prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, explaining the unexpectedly low proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Associated factors such as nicotine can also be considered in the context of a broad chemoprophylactic hypothesis in patients with psychiatric disorders taking different psychoactive substances.","['Javelot H', 'Petrignet J', 'Addiego F', 'Briet J', 'Solis M', 'El-Hage W', 'Hingray C', 'Weiner L']",2020,144,,Med Hypotheses,"Javelot H, et al.

However, given that poor mental health is common in acute medical staff, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of work involving high exposure to infected patients.
METHODS: We report a rapid review, meta-analysis, and living meta-analysis of studies using validated measures from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
RESULTS: A random effects meta-analysis found that high-exposure work is not associated with an increased prevalence of above cut-off scoring (anxiety: RR = 1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.93, Total N = 12,473; PTSD symptoms: RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.78, Total N = 6604; depression: RR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.57-3.95, Total N = 12,224). For continuous scoring, high-exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low-exposure work (anxiety: SMD = 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.31, Total N = 6493; PTSD symptoms: SMD = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01-0.40, Total N = 5122; depression: SMD = 0.13, 95% CI -0.04-0.31, Total N = 4022). There was no evidence of publication bias.
CONCLUSION: Although epidemic and pandemic response work may add only a small additional burden, improving mental health through service management and provision of mental health services should be a priority given that baseline rates of poor mental health are already very high.

Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Rohani P', 'Ahmadi Badi S', 'Moshiri A', 'Siadat SD']",2020,13,4,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,"Rohani P, et al.

33243541,The role of respiratory droplet physicochemistry in limiting and promoting the airborne transmission of human coronaviruses: A critical review.,"Whether virulent human pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) are effectively transmitted by aerosols remains contentious. Transmission modes of the novel coronavirus have become a hot topic of research with the importance of airborne transmission controversial due to the many factors that can influence virus transmission. Airborne transmission is an accepted potential route for the spread of some viral infections (measles, chickenpox); however, aerosol features and infectious inoculum vary from one respiratory virus to another. Infectious virus-laden aerosols can be produced by natural human respiratory activities, and their features are vital determinants for virus carriage and transmission. Physicochemical characteristics of infectious respiratory aerosols can influence the efficiency of virus transmission by droplets. This critical review identifies studies reporting instances of infected patients producing airborne human pathogenic coronaviruses, and evidence for the role of physical/chemical characteristics of human-generated droplets in altering embedded viruses' viability. We also review studies evaluating these viruses in the air, field studies and available evidence about seasonality patterns. Ultimately the literature suggests that a proportion of virulent human coronaviruses can plausibly be transmitted via the air, even though this might vary in different conditions. Evidence exists for respirable-sized airborne droplet nuclei containing viral RNA, although this does not necessarily imply that the virus is transmittable, capable of replicating in a recipient host, or that inoculum is sufficient to initiate infection. However, evidence suggests that coronaviruses can survive in simulated droplet nuclei for a significant time (>24 h). Nevertheless, laboratory nebulized virus-laden aerosols might not accurately model the complexity of human carrier aerosols in studying airborne viral transport. In summary, there is disagreement on whether wild coronaviruses can be transmitted via an airborne path and display seasonal patterns. Further studies are therefore required to provide supporting evidence for the role of airborne transmission and assumed mechanisms underlying seasonality.","['Niazi S', 'Groth R', 'Spann K', 'Johnson GR']",2021,276,,Environ Pollut,"Niazi S, et al.

33242646,Structural and functional insights into non-structural proteins of coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are causing a number of human and animal diseases because of their zoonotic nature such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses can infect respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous systems of human, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many wild animals. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging respiratory virus and is causing CoVID-19 with high morbidity and considerable mortality. All CoVs belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, characterised by club-like spikes on their surfaces and large RNA genome with a distinctive replication strategy. Coronavirus have the largest RNA genomes (~26-32 kilobases) and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. Non-structural proteins (nsp) 7-16 are cleaved from two large replicase polyproteins and guide the replication and processing of coronavirus RNA. Coronavirus replicase has more or less universal activities, such as RNA polymerase (nsp 12) and helicase (nsp 13), as well as a variety of unusual or even special mRNA capping (nsp 14, nsp 16) and fidelity regulation (nsp 14) domains. Besides that, several smaller subunits (nsp 7- nsp 10) serve as essential cofactors for these enzymes and contribute to the emerging ""nsp interactome."" In spite of the significant progress in studying coronaviruses structural and functional properties, there is an urgent need to understand the coronaviruses evolutionary success that will be helpful to develop enhanced control strategies. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure, function, and interactions of coronaviruses RNA synthesizing machinery and their replication strategies.","['Rohaim MA', 'El Naggar RF', 'Clayton E', 'Munir M']",2021,150,,Microb Pathog,"Rohaim MA, et al.

33240278,Adjuvants for Coronavirus Vaccines.,"Vaccine development utilizing various platforms is one of the strategies that has been proposed to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Adjuvants are critical components of both subunit and certain inactivated vaccines because they induce specific immune responses that are more robust and long-lasting. A review of the history of coronavirus vaccine development demonstrates that only a few adjuvants, including aluminum salts, emulsions, and TLR agonists, have been formulated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and currently the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in experimental and pre-clinical studies. However, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the effects of the adjuvants tested in coronavirus vaccines. This paper presents an overview of adjuvants that have been formulated in reported coronavirus vaccine studies, which should assist with the design and selection of adjuvants with optimal efficacy and safety profiles for COVID-19 vaccines.","['Liang Z', 'Zhu H', 'Wang X', 'Jing B', 'Li Z', 'Xia X', 'Sun H', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang W', 'Shi L', 'Zeng H', 'Sun B']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Liang Z, et al.

These demonstrate scale invariant self-similarity patterns and long-range correlations (LRCs) indicating fractal organization. Phylogenetic hierarchies change when SOD1 orthologs are grouped according to fractal measures, indicating that statistical topographies can be used to study gene evolution. Sliding window k-mer analysis show that majority of k-mers across all SOD1 orthologs are unique, with very few duplications. Orthologs from simpler species contribute minimally (< 1% of k-mers) to more complex species. Both simple and complex random processes fail to produce significant matching k-mer sequences for SOD1 orthologs. Point mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis do not impact the fractal organization of human SOD1. Hence, SOD1 did not evolve by a patchwork of repetitive sequences modified by point mutations.

Because it is a novel virus, considerable efforts and extensive studies are needed to fully understand its characteristics. Its symptoms and severity range from mild to critical, depending on several factors, such as host susceptibility to the virus and their immune system, with the most common symptoms being fever, fatigue, sore throat and runny nose. There is no clear treatment available yet, though several options are being explored, with research for vaccines being at the forefront. Traditional Chinese Medicine may also be used as a treatment option. Since this virus is similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS viruses, considerable insight can be gained from previous studies.

33232783,Putative roles of vitamin D in modulating immune response and immunopathology associated with COVID-19.,"The first incidence of COVID-19 was reported in the Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in late December 2019. Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19.","['Kumar R', 'Rathi H', 'Haq A', 'Wimalawansa SJ', 'Sharma A']",2021,292,,Virus Res,"Kumar R, et al.

33231780,SARS-CoV-2: a new dimension to our understanding of coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses have marked their significant emergence since the twenty-first century with the outbreaks of three out of the seven existing human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These viruses have not only acquired large-scale transmission during their specified outbreak period, but cases of MERS-CoV still remain active, although there is only limited transmission. While, on the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a rising threat to global public health. The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects-all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus' differing deadly pattern.","['Araf Y', 'Faruqui NA', 'Anwar S', 'Hosen MJ']",2021,24,1,Int Microbiol,"Araf Y, et al.

33225251,COVID-19 and stroke: A review.,"COVID-19 patients have presented with a wide range of neurological disorders, among which stroke is the most devastating. We have reviewed current studies, case series, and case reports with a focus on COVID-19 patients complicated with stroke, and presented the current understanding of stroke in this patient population. As evidenced by increased D-dimer, fibrinogen, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces coagulopathy, disrupts endothelial function, and promotes hypercoagulative state. Collectively, it predisposes patients to cerebrovascular events. Additionally, due to the unprecedented strain on the healthcare system, stroke care has been inevitably compromised. The underlying mechanism between COVID-19 and stroke warrants further study, so does the development of an effective therapeutic or preventive intervention.","['Qi X', 'Keith KA', 'Huang JH']",2021,2,2,Brain Hemorrhages,"Qi X, et al.

Within 2.5 months (by March 18, 2020) over 191,127 COVID-19 patients have been identified in 161 countries. By then, over 700 pediatric patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 in China, with only about 58 diagnosed elsewhere. By now, there are thousands of children and adolescents infected. Chinese pediatricians would like to share their experience on how these patients were managed in China and the key recommendations that had guided them in meeting the evolving challenges. A group of experts were summoned by the Chinese Pediatric Society and Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics to extract informative data from a survey on confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in China. Consensus on diagnosis, management, and prevention of pediatric COVID-19 were drawn up based on the analysis of such data plus insights gained from the past SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks. Relevant cumulating experiences from physicians managing adult patients, expedited reports on clinical and scientific COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 data, and the National Health Committee guidelines on COVID-19 management were integrated into this proposal.","['Fang F', 'Chen Y', 'Zhao D', 'Liu T', 'Huang Y', 'Qiu L', 'Hao Y', 'Hu X', 'Yin W', 'Liu Z', 'Jin R', 'Ning Q', 'Cheung PT', 'Liu C', 'Shu S', 'Wang T', 'Luo X', 'Chinese Pediatric Society and the Editorial Committee of the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics']",2020,8,,Front Pediatr,"Fang F, et al.

33224599,Cardiovascular risk and complications associated with COVID-19.,"In December 2019, an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia cases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) first occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease, later named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), was caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency. COVID-19 is now a global pandemic impacting more than 43,438,043 patients with 1,158,596 deaths globally as of August 26th, 2020. COVID-19 is highly contagious and has caused more deaths than SARS in 2002-2003 or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-2013 combined and represents an unprecedented human affliction not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918. COVID-19 has been associated with several cardiac complications, including hypercoagulability, acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at the highest risk for myocardial injury and mortality among infected patients. The mechanism by which COVID-infected patients develop cardiac complications remains unclear, though it may be mediated by increased ACE-2 gene expression. Despite initial concerns, there is no evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy increases risk for myocardial injury among those infected with COVID-19. In the current report, we summarize the peer-reviewed and preprint literature on cardiovascular risks and complications associated with COVID-19, as well as provide insights into its pathogenesis and management.","['Krittanawong C', 'Kumar A', 'Hahn J', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang HJ', 'Sun T', 'Bozkurt B', 'Ballantyne CM', 'Virani SS', 'Halperin JL', 'Jneid H']",2020,10,4,Am J Cardiovasc Dis,"Krittanawong C, et al.

Each year, the number of viruses causing infections in humans increases, triggering epidemics and pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pointing to bats as the natural host, in 2019, a genome highly identical to a bat coronavirus (COVID-19) spread all over the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially confirmed it as a pandemic. The virus mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, and is characterized by symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue. Antivirals and vaccines have provided improvements in some cases, but the discovery of a new and diverse variety of viruses with outbreaks has posed a challenge in timely treatments for medical scientists. Currently, few specific antiviral strategies are being used, and many of the effective antiviral drugs and reported active molecules are under vital exploration. In this review, with the details of viral diseases, we summarize the current attempts in drug development, epidemiology, and the latest treatments and scientific advancements to combat the COVID-19 epidemic.

33219467,[Anxiety in times of COVID-19 and other health crises].,"BACKGROUND: Epidemics and pandemics and the measures taken to contain their spread are accompanied by numerous stressors, which can lead in particular to severe anxiety.
OBJECTIVE: This article describes the components and determinants of these anxiety symptoms, potential resilience and risk factors and appropriate recommendations for action.
METHODS: The article presents an overview of research results regarding COVID-19 and previous epidemics and pandemics (e.g., HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and swine flu). Furthermore, official recommendations for action are presented.
RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms frequently occur in epidemics and pandemics, especially in the early phase and usually decrease in the further course. Although other aspects of different infectious diseases vary, the associated fears are similar and include e.g. the fear of health-related, social and economic consequences. Resilience and risk factors in various epidemics and pandemics are comparable. Self-efficacy expectation, tolerance of uncertainty, normalization, routines, safety and social support usually have a protective effect. In contrast, excessive media consumption, female gender, work in a medical context, suppression, pre-existing diseases, unhealthy behavior and closer exposure to the virus are often accompanied by more severe anxiety.
CONCLUSION: Fears should be observed and addressed in order to reduce pathological processes, especially in vulnerable groups. It is advisable to promote resilience factors and to counteract risk factors with preventive and therapeutic measures. For this purpose, the development and empirical testing of specific interventions as well as further longitudinal studies are needed.","['Bendau A', 'Petzold MB', 'Wyka S', 'Pyrkosch L', 'Plag J', 'Ströhle A']",2021,92,5,Nervenarzt,"Bendau A, et al.

33218025,A Novel Purification Procedure for Active Recombinant Human DPP4 and the Inability of DPP4 to Bind SARS-CoV-2.,"Proteases catalyse irreversible posttranslational modifications that often alter a biological function of the substrate. The protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes therapy primarily because it inactivates glucagon-like protein-1. DPP4 also has roles in steatosis, insulin resistance, cancers and inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In addition, DPP4 binds to the spike protein of the MERS virus, causing it to be the human cell surface receptor for that virus. DPP4 has been identified as a potential binding target of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, so this question requires experimental investigation. Understanding protein structure and function requires reliable protocols for production and purification. We developed such strategies for baculovirus generated soluble recombinant human DPP4 (residues 29-766) produced in insect cells. Purification used differential ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, dye affinity chromatography in series with immobilised metal affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. The binding affinities of DPP4 to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were measured using surface plasmon resonance and ELISA. This optimised DPP4 purification procedure yielded 1 to 1.8 mg of pure fully active soluble DPP4 protein per litre of insect cell culture with specific activity >30 U/mg, indicative of high purity. No specific binding between DPP4 and CoV-2 spike protein was detected by surface plasmon resonance or ELISA. In summary, a procedure for high purity high yield soluble human DPP4 was achieved and used to show that, unlike MERS, SARS-CoV-2 does not bind human DPP4.","['Xi CR', 'Di Fazio A', 'Nadvi NA', 'Patel K', 'Xiang MSW', 'Zhang HE', 'Deshpande C', 'Low JKK', 'Wang XT', 'Chen Y', 'McMillan CLD', 'Isaacs A', 'Osborne B', 'Vieira de Ribeiro AJ', 'McCaughan GW', 'Mackay JP', 'Church WB', 'Gorrell MD']",2020,25,22,Molecules,"Xi CR, et al.

33215987,Coping with the Challenges of COVID-19 Using the Sociotype Framework: A Rehearsal for the Next Pandemic.,"The world, as a global village, is currently taking part in a real-time public health, medical, socio-cultural, and economic experiment on how best to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Depending on the time from the outbreak, strategies have ranged from minimal intervention to mitigation by quarantine for high-risk groups (elderly with chronic illnesses) to containment and lockdown. Adherence to such restrictions have depended on the individual and national psyche and culture. One can understand and forgive governments for being over-cautious, but not for being ill-prepared. It seems that Singapore after SARS (2003) and South Korea after MERS (2015) learnt from their experiences and have fared relatively well with minimal disruption to daily routines. Coping with the challenge of COVID-19 is an urgent global task. We use the Sociotype ecological framework to analyze different coping responses at three levels: Context (government and leadership, social context, health services, and media); Relationships; and the Individual. We describe the many negative outcomes (e.g. mortality [obviously], unemployment, economic damage, food insecurity, threat to democracy, claustrophobia) and the positive ones (e.g. new, remote teaching, working, and medical routines; social bonding and solidarity; redefining existential values and priorities) of this surreal situation, which is still evolving. We highlight the importance of humor in stress reduction. Regular and reliable communication to the public has to be improved, acknowledging incomplete data, and learning to deal with fake news, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. Excess mortality is the preferred statistic to follow and compare outcomes. When the health risks are over, the economic recovery responses will vary according to the financial state of countries. If world order is to be reshaped, then a massive economic aid plan should be launched by the rich countries-akin to the Marshall plan after the Second World War. It should be led preferably by the USA and China. The results of the tradeoffs between health and economic lockdowns will only become apparent in the months to come. The experiences and lessons learned from this emergency should be used as a rehearsal for the next epi-/pandemic, which will surely take place in the foreseeable future.","['Peng W', 'Berry EM']",2021,12,1,Rambam Maimonides Med J,Peng W and Berry EM.

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses, is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification makes SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the United States; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus' genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we provide methods and resources of producing, purifying, fluorescently and APEX2-labeling of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs for the evaluation of mechanisms of viral budding and entry as well as assessment of drug inhibitors under BSL-2 conditions.

The emergence of recent COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019 has resulted in considerable research efforts to design antiviral drugs and other therapeutics against coronaviruses. In this context, it is crucial to understand the biophysical and structural features of the major proteins that are involved in virus-host interactions. In the current study, we have compared spike proteins from three strains of coronaviruses NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, known to bind human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in terms of sequence/structure conservation, hydrophobic cluster formation and importance of binding site residues. The study reveals that the severity of coronavirus strains correlates positively with the interaction area, surrounding hydrophobicity and interaction energy and inversely correlate with the flexibility of the binding interface. Also, we identify the conserved residues in the binding interface of spike proteins in all three strains. The systematic point mutations show that these conserved residues in the respective strains are evolutionarily favored at their respective positions. The similarities and differences in the spike proteins of the three viruses indicated in this study may help researchers to deeply understand the structural behavior, binding site properties and etiology of ACE2 binding, accelerating the screening of potential lead molecules and the development/repurposing of therapeutic drugs.","['Rawat P', 'Jemimah S', 'Ponnuswamy PK', 'Gromiha MM']",2021,89,4,Proteins,"Rawat P, et al.

33208827,Development of CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as a subunit vaccine against COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide health emergency which calls for an unprecedented race for vaccines and treatment. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, S-2P. To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized mice against pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018 and alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","['Kuo TY', 'Lin MY', 'Coffman RL', 'Campbell JD', 'Traquina P', 'Lin YJ', 'Liu LT', 'Cheng J', 'Wu YC', 'Wu CC', 'Tang WH', 'Huang CG', 'Tsao KC', 'Chen C']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Kuo TY, et al.

33206792,Promising Nanostructured Materials against Enveloped Virus.,"The development of self-disinfectant devices is highly needed to prevent and control infections, mainly caused by virus. In the past years, coronaviruses have been a threat to humanity, causing severe epidemics of respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and presently the SARS-CoV2 is causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have demonstrated that surface contamination play a significant role in the spreading of viruses. These studies demonstrated that the production of highly reactive species by copper alloys contributes to rapid elimination of viruses. Nanostructured materials such as semiconductors TiO2, Co3O4 CuO, NiO, and TiO2, and silver nanoparticles can decrease the virus viability on the surfaces when associated with polymers and textiles, especially in conditions of light exposure. In addition, graphene oxide is rising as a promising material for inactivation of viruses due to its capacity of destroying the viral envelope and capsid. The virucidal property of these materials can be enhanced by increasing their functionalization with photosensitizers. The present mini-review brings subsidies for the development of new advanced self-disinfectant materials that can be used in the manufacture of gloves, masks, and a variety of other devices.","['Toledo GG', 'Toledo VH', 'Lanfredi AJC', 'Escote M', 'Champi A', 'Silva MCCD', 'Nantes-Cardoso IL']",2020,92,4,An Acad Bras Cienc,"Toledo GG, et al.

Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The aims of this systematic review are to systematically identify and collate 24 studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and to provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Of clinical trials, 100% showed no significant difference in the probability of viral transmission or clearance in prophylaxis or therapy, respectively, compared to the control group. Among observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy, 58% concurred with the finding of no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes. Three-fifths of clinical trials and half of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects, 44% found a greater incidence of QTc prolongation and/or arrhythmias, 44% found no evidence of a significant difference, and 11% mixed results.

Accurate and immediate diagnosis of infectious agents and symptoms is a key to control the outbreak of these diseases. Rapid advances in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology offers great advantages like high accuracy, high throughput and rapid measurements in biomedical research and disease diagnosis. These features as well as low cost, low power and scalability of CMOS technology can pave the way for the development of powerful devices such as point-of-care (PoC) systems, lab-on-chip (LoC) platforms and symptom screening devices for accurate and timely diagnosis of infectious diseases. This paper is an overview of different CMOS-based devices such as optical, electrochemical, magnetic and mechanical sensors developed by researchers to mitigate the problems associated with these diseases.","['Forouhi S', 'Ghafar-Zadeh E']",2020,11,11,Micromachines (Basel),Forouhi S and Ghafar-Zadeh E.

33202150,The Potential of Glycyrrhizinate in the Management of COVID-19: A Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Glycyrrhizin Preparations in the Treatment of SARS and MERS.,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 highlighted the fact that no specific medications providing effective treatment have been identified and approved. We explored the possibilities for COVID-19 by systematically reviewing evidence on the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhizin preparations for SARS and MERS. Electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2020 for eligible studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhizin preparations for SARS and MERS. A quantitative analysis or descriptive analysis was applied. Five retrospective cohort studies were included, and NOS scores ranged from 5-7 points. The clinical symptoms of dry cough, chest distress and dyspnoea improved quickly, and elevated serum levels of aminotransferase decreased after compound glycyrrhizin treatment. The SARS-CoV antibody appeared earlier in the treated group than in the control group ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]d). Compared to that with conventional medications, the average period from peak to 50% improvement of lesions, in terms of X-ray manifestations, was shorter with compound glycyrrhizin treatment ([Formula: see text]2.1[Formula: see text]d), and treatment reduced the dosage ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]mg/d) and duration of the corticosteroids used, without other serious adverse reactions. Based on the available evidence regarding glycyrrhizin preparations for treating SARS and MERS, we infer that compound glycyrrhizin could be an optional therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those complicated with liver damage. Further research using well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is warranted to determine the dosage and duration of use of compound glycyrrhizin and to monitor its specific adverse effects.","['Li H', 'Hu Y', 'Tang H', 'Li S', 'Ding H', 'Zhai S', 'Zhao R']",2020,48,7,Am J Chin Med,"Li H, et al.

33200132,Unification of the M/ORF3-related proteins points to a diversified role for ion conductance in pathogenesis of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses.,"UNLABELLED: The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a better understanding of the evolution of virus-host conflicts. ORF3a in both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are ion channels (viroporins) and involved in virion assembly and membrane budding. Using sensitive profile-based homology detection methods, we unify the SARS-CoV ORF3a family with several families of viral proteins, including ORF5 from MERS-CoVs, proteins from beta-CoVs (ORF3c), alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), most importantly, the Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs, and more distant homologs from other nidoviruses. By sequence analysis and structural modeling, we show that these viral families utilize specific conserved polar residues to constitute an ion-conducting pore in the membrane. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of these families, objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins of CoVs and Toroviruses. We show that the divergent ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF5 families represent a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a model for their role in virion assembly of CoVs, ToroVs and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly, membrane fusion and budding. We show that the M and ORF3 are under differential evolutionary pressures; in contrast to the slow evolution of M as core structural component, the CoV-ORF3 clade is under selection for diversification, which indicates it is likely at the interface with host molecules and/or immune attack.
IMPORTANCE: Coronaviruses (CoVs) have become a major threat to human welfare as the causative agents of several severe infectious diseases, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerging human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread, severity of these diseases, as well as the potential re-emergence of other CoV-associated diseases have imposed a strong need for a thorough understanding of function and evolution of these CoVs. By utilizing robust domain-centric computational strategies, we have established homologous relationships between many divergent families of CoV proteins, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, MERS-CoV ORF5, proteins from both beta-CoVs (ORF3c) and alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), the typical CoV Matrix proteins, and many distant homologs from other nidoviruses. We present evidence that they are active ion channel proteins, and the Cov-specific ORF3 clade proteins are under selection for rapid diversification, suggesting they might have been involved in interfering host molecules and/or immune attack.","['Tan Y', 'Schneider T', 'Shukla PK', 'Chandrasekharan MB', 'Aravind L', 'Zhang D']",2020,,,bioRxiv,"Tan Y, et al.

33199968,Current COVID-19 vaccine candidates: Implications in the Saudi population.,"AIM: The purpose of this review is to discuss the current status of local and international efforts undergoing clinical trials aiming at developing a Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, and to highlight the anticipated challenges of this vaccine globally and in Saudi Arabia.
PRESENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 vaccine development efforts started in early January 2020 when Chinese scientists shared the Coronavirus genomic sequence in public domain. Approximately 321 research groups initiated the search for a vaccine, out of which 41 have reached phase I/II trails and 11 reached phase-III clinical trials, including approved vaccines for early to limited use. Out of these projects are two labs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still in early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several vaccine attempts are being tested from traditional, attenuated virus methods, to new nucleic acid-based designs. However, no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials and reached public domain.In spite of the challenges faced during previous vaccine trials, researchers have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 is structurally similar to the (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Both SARS strains show identical affinity towards the type-II alveolar pneumocytes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor binding domains and therefore, similar pathogenicity. The race to develop the vaccine is predominantly for individuals at high risk of developing the infection, i.e. population groups who are most susceptible to experiencing fatal symptoms of the coronavirus. These include patients with comorbidities, above the age of 60 years and people at risk of contracting large viral loads, such as healthcare providers caring for critical admissions in in-patient wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Room settings.
SUMMARY: Many different vaccine strategies are under development throughout different stages of the research timeline; however, it is estimated that none will show favorable results before end of 2020. For any immunization or interventional prevention/therapy system to reach the public and patients at high risk, it needs to undergo multiple phase trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this scoping review we aim to map the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and provide recommendations related to gaps in research, applicability and expected challenges for implementation of nationwide vaccination in Saudi Arabia.","['Raja AT', 'Alshamsan A', 'Al-Jedai A']",2020,28,12,Saudi Pharm J,"Raja AT, et al.

33199941,Food products as potential carriers of SARS-CoV-2.,"At present, humanity is confronting with a novel life-threatening challenge from the COVID-19 pandemic infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. To date, the various transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 have not been completely determined. Food products might be carriers for SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic not only can spread through the respiratory tract like SARS and MERS but also the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of several patients, shows the possibility of their fecal-oral route spread. Besides, people with gastric problems, including gastric intestinal metaplasia and atrophic gastritis, may be susceptible to this kind of COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 due to whether carry-through or carry-over contaminations. Considering carry-over, SARS-CoV-2 spread from personnel to food products or food surfaces is feasible. Beyond that, some shreds of evidence showed that pigs and rabbits can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral transmission through meat products may be conceivable, indicating carry-through contamination. As the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 is high and its stability in different environments, especially food processing surfaces, is also remarkable, it may enter foods in whether industrialized processing or the traditional one. Therefore, established precautious acts is suggested to be applied in food processing units. The present review elucidates the risk of various staple food products, including meat and meat products, dairy products, bread, fruits, vegetables, and ready-to-eat foods as potential carriers for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","['Yekta R', 'Vahid-Dastjerdi L', 'Norouzbeigi S', 'Mortazavian AM']",2021,123,,Food Control,"Yekta R, et al.

33199671,Expression Analyses of MicroRNAs in Hamster Lung Tissues Infected by SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an infectious disease with multiple severe symptoms, such as fever over 37.5°C, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. In our research, microRNAs (miRNAs) binding to the genome sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 were identified by bioinformatic tools. Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-1-3p) were found to commonly bind to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also identified miRNAs that bind to receptor proteins, such as ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2, which are important for understanding the infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. The expression patterns of those miRNAs were examined in hamster lung samples infected by SARS-CoV-2. Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p, and hsa-miR-422a) showed differential expression patterns in lung tissues before and after infection. Especially, hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-195-5p showed a large difference in expression, indicating that they may potentially be diagnostic biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Kim WR', 'Park EG', 'Kang KW', 'Lee SM', 'Kim B', 'Kim HS']",2020,43,11,Mol Cells,"Kim WR, et al.

33197370,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Seropositive Bactrian Camels, Mongolia.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic disease that was first identified in humans in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV causes acute and severe respiratory disease in humans. The mortality rate of MERS in humans is ∼35% and >800 deaths have been reported globally as of August 2020. Dromedary camels are a natural host of the virus and the source of zoonotic human infection. In experimental studies, Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection similar to dromedary camels; however, neither the virus, viral RNA, nor virus-specific antibodies were detected in Bactrian camel field samples so far. The aim of our study was to survey Mongolian camels for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. A total of 180 camel sera, collected in 2016 and 2017, were involved in this survey: 17 of 180 sera were seropositive with an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed at the State Central Veterinary Laboratory in Mongolia. These 17 positive sera plus 53 additional negative sera were sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID/NIH, and tested for the presence of antibodies with a similar ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a virus neutralization test (VNT). In these additional tests, a total of 21 of 70 sera were positive with ELISA and 10 sera were positive with IFA; however, none was positive in the VNT. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the ELISA/IFA-positive antibodies are (1) non-neutralizing antibodies or (2) directed against a MERS-CoV-like virus circulating in Bactrian camels in Mongolia.","['Bold D', 'van Doremalen N', 'Myagmarsuren O', 'Zayat B', 'Munster VJ', 'Richt JA']",2021,21,2,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Bold D, et al.

Herein we discuss the mechanisms of antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV2 and treatment strategies for the CSS. Antivirals that have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2, or the closely related SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, are compared on the enzymatic level and by potency in cells. For treatment of the CSS, we discuss medications that reduce the effects or expression of cytokines involved in the CSS with an emphasis on those that reduce IL-6 because of its central role in the development of the CSS. We show that some of the medications covered influence the activity or expression of enzymes involved in epigenetic processes and specifically those that add or remove modifications to histones or DNA. Where available, the latest clinical data showing the efficacy of the medications is presented. With respect to their mechanisms, we explain why some medications are successful, why others have failed, and why some untested medications may yet prove useful.","['Luo W', 'Ige OO', 'Beacon TH', 'Su RC', 'Huang S', 'Davie JR', 'Lakowski TM']",2021,64,4,Genome,"Luo W, et al.

33195565,Phytogenic Products and Phytochemicals as a Candidate Strategy to Improve Tolerance to Coronavirus.,"Coronaviruses are the causative agents of many infectious diseases in human and animals. These included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infectious bronchitis (IBV) in poultry, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. These results had considerable death burdens and negative influences on social-economic life. Since the appearance of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous investigations have been carried out by researchers to find active compounds, mainly from plants, as natural sources, that could inhibit or stop the proliferation of the causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The most common symptoms caused by infections with COVID-19 can include cough, fever, and sore throat. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of active antiviral compounds for treating different strains of coronavirus. Herbal medicine is a class of medication that originates from nature and is aimed at decreasing the use of preservatives, excipients, or other additives and, consequently, lesser side effects. The rapid spread of COVID-19 infection besides the lack of knowledge about any treatments and the growing concern of the public from the virus directed us toward writing this review article in an aim to provide alternatives to the allopathic medicine use. There is a wealth of chemical diversity in the naturally existing compounds, including their antiviral activities, which may encourage their utilization as therapeutics against viral infections, including coronaviruses. The majority of publications on the herbal remedies of coronavirus, MERS, or SARS focused primarily on the use of polar compounds. These substances displayed encouraging inhibitory influences on coronavirus in humans. These include psoralidin, scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, caffeic acid, quercetin, myricetin, saikosaponin B2, griffithsin (lectins), and isobavachalcone. Some other agents like lycorine may be useful, if the antiviral activity is obtained by concentrations below the toxic plasma levels.

33195400,COVID-19: Targeting Proteases in Viral Invasion and Host Immune Response.,"An acute respiratory disorder (COVID-19) that accelerated across the globe has been found to be caused by a novel strain of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2). The absence of a specific antiviral drug or vaccination has promoted the development of immediate therapeutic responses against SARS-CoV-2. As increased levels of plasma chemokines and, cytokines and an uncontrolled influx of inflammatory cells were observed in lethal cases, it was concluded that the severity of the infection corresponded with the imbalanced host immunity against the virus. Tracing back the knowledge acquired from SERS and MERS infections, clinical evidence suggested similar host immune reactions and host ACE2 receptor-derived invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies revealed the integral role of proteases (TMPRSS2, cathepsins, plasmin, etc.) in viral entry and the immune system. This review aims to provide a brief review on the latest research progress in identifying the potential role of proteases in SARS-CoV-2 viral spread and infection and combines it with already known information on the role of different proteases in providing an immune response. It further proposes a multidisciplinary clinical approach to target proteases specifically, through a combinatorial administration of protease inhibitors. This predictive review may help in providing a perspective to gain deeper insights of the proteolytic web involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral invasion and host immune response.","['Seth S', 'Batra J', 'Srinivasan S']",2020,7,,Front Mol Biosci,"Seth S, et al.

Methods with rapid and accurate detection are essential to control the sources of infection, to prevent the spread of the disease and to assist decision-making by public health managers. Currently, there is a wide variety of tests available with different detection methodologies, levels of specificity and sensitivity, detection time, and with an extensive range of prices. This review therefore aimed to conduct a patent search in relation to tests for the detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The greatest number of patents identified in the search were registered between 2003 and 2011, being mainly deposited by China, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. Most of the patents used the existing RT-PCR, ELISA, and isothermal amplification methods to develop simple, sensitive, precise, easy to use, low-cost tests that reduced false-negative or false-positive results. The findings of this patent search show that an increasing number of materials and diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are being produced to identify infected individuals and combat the growth of the current pandemic; however, there is still a question in relation to the reliability of the results of these tests.","['Nascimento Junior JAC', 'Santos AM', 'Oliveira AMS', 'Guimarães AG', 'Quintans-Júnior LJ', 'Coutinho HDM', 'Martins N', 'Borges LP', 'Serafini MR']",2020,8,,Front Public Health,"Nascimento Junior JAC, et al.

When such a virus emerges, there is often insufficient specific information available on mechanisms of virus dissemination from animal-to-human or from person-to-person, on the level or route of infection transmissibility or of viral release in body secretions/excretions, and on the survival of virus in aerosols or on surfaces. The effectiveness of available virucidal agents and hygiene practices as interventions for disrupting the spread of infection and the associated diseases may not be clear for the emerging virus. In the present review, we suggest that approaches for infection prevention and control (IPAC) for SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging/re-emerging viruses can be invoked based on pre-existing data on microbicidal and hygiene effectiveness for related and unrelated enveloped viruses.","['Ijaz MK', 'Sattar SA', 'Rubino JR', 'Nims RW', 'Gerba CP']",2020,8,,PeerJ,"Ijaz MK, et al.

33192692,A Systematic Review and Provisional Metanalysis on Psychopathologic Burden on Health Care Workers of Coronavirus Outbreaks.,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shows several similarities with previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence of the psychopathologic burden on health care workers (HCWs) of the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks to get lessons for managing the current burden of COVID-19 outbreak.
METHOD: According to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement, the study quantified the effects of frontline work on mental health of HCWs. Major databases - Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science - were searched for observational and case-control studies evaluating mental health indexes reported by front-line work. This study computed the percentage of sample that reported clinically significant levels of psychiatric symptoms. Cohen's 
FINDINGS: Fifteen studies have been selected for a total of 7,393 HCWs. From 9.6% to 51% of HCWs reported symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and from 20% to 75% reported psychiatric symptoms, with a prevalence of anxiety and depression. From one to the three years after outbreak, from 2% to 19% reported PTSD symptoms and from 5% to 90% psychiatric symptoms. Interestingly, HWCs who were directly involved in pandemic emergency showed significantly higher depressive and anxious symptoms (
CONCLUSION: Health care professionals in general and most of all frontline workers showed an association with a likely risk of developing psychiatric disorders following outbreaks and for at least three years later. Mental health interventions for professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented. Further studies are warranted to investigate long-term consequences carefully, and to look for mediating and buffering factors as well. The role of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in delivering adequate interventions is critically important.","['Galli F', 'Pozzi G', 'Ruggiero F', 'Mameli F', 'Cavicchioli M', 'Barbieri S', 'Canevini MP', 'Priori A', 'Pravettoni G', 'Sani G', 'Ferrucci R']",2020,11,,Front Psychiatry,"Galli F, et al.

33192523,Role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Management of Viral Pneumonia.,"Viral pneumonia is one kind of acute respiratory tract infection caused by the virus. There have been many outbreaks of viral pneumonia with high contagiousness and mortality both in China and abroad, such as the great influenza in 1918, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, the Influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These outbreaks and/or pandemic have significant impact on human life, social behaviors, and economic development. Moreover, no specific drug has been developed for these viruses. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in the treatment of viral pneumonia during these outbreaks especially in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 because studies suggest that TCM formulations may target several aspects of the disease and may have lesser side effects than manufactured pharmaceuticals. In recent years, a lot of clinicians and researchers have made a series of in-depth explorations and investigations on the treatment of viral pneumonia with TCM, which have understood TCM therapeutic mechanisms more specifically and clearly. But critical analysis of this research in addition to further studies are needed to assess the potential of TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia.","['Xi S', 'Li Y', 'Yue L', 'Gong Y', 'Qian L', 'Liang T', 'Ye Y']",2020,11,,Front Pharmacol,"Xi S, et al.

33189832,The key role of Warburg effect in SARS-CoV-2 replication and associated inflammatory response.,"Current mortality due to the Covid-19 pandemic (approximately 1.2 million by November 2020) demonstrates the lack of an effective treatment. As replication of many viruses - including MERS-CoV - is supported by enhanced aerobic glycolysis, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells (especially airway cells) is reliant upon altered glucose metabolism. This metabolism is similar to the Warburg effect well studied in cancer. Counteracting two main pathways (PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling) sustaining aerobic glycolysis inhibits MERS-CoV replication and thus, very likely that of SARS-CoV-2, which shares many similarities with MERS-CoV. The Warburg effect appears to be involved in several steps of COVID-19 infection. Once induced by hypoxia, the Warburg effect becomes active in lung endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of atherosclerosis, thereby promoting vasoconstriction and micro thrombosis. Aerobic glycolysis also supports activation of pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and M1 macrophages. As the anti-inflammatory response and reparative process is performed by M2 macrophages reliant on oxidative metabolism, we speculated that the switch to oxidative metabolism in M2 macrophages would not occur at the appropriate time due to an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cascade. Aging, mitochondrial senescence and enzyme dysfunction, AMPK downregulation and p53 inactivation could all play a role in this key biochemical event. Understanding the role of the Warburg effect in COVID-19 can be essential to developing molecules reducing infectivity, arresting endothelial cells activation and the pro-inflammatory cascade.","['Icard P', 'Lincet H', 'Wu Z', 'Coquerel A', 'Forgez P', 'Alifano M', 'Fournel L']",2021,180,,Biochimie,"Icard P, et al.

The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with an uncertain fatality rate has imposed extreme challenges on global health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, after the disease caused by the new coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries. To date, various therapeutic approaches have been proposed and are being implemented to combat this pandemic, but unfortunately, no sovereign remedy has been established yet. Protease enzymes are important targets to develop therapies for the treatment of infections caused by SARS coronaviruses.

33178109,Revisiting the Immune Balance Theory: A Neurological Insight Into the Epidemic of COVID-19 and Its Alike.,"As the pandemic of COVID-19 is raging around the world, the mysteriousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus is being revealed by the concerted endeavors of scientists. Although fever and pneumonia are typical symptoms, COVID-19 patients exhibit multiple neurological complications. In this interim review, we will summarize the neurological manifestations and their potential causes in COVID-19. Similar to the other two fatal respiratory coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also shows to be neuroinvasive that may spread from the periphery to brain, probably by the retrograde axonal transport. The invaded viruses may directly disrupt the complex neural circuits, and raise a chronic activation of immune responses. In another hand, multiple organ failure in severe COVID-19 is caused by the systemic acute immune responses, and unsurprisingly caused the brain inflammation and led to encephalitis. However, in the central nervous system (CNS), the activation of resident immune cells including microglia and astrocytes may lead to chronic immune imbalance, which underlies the potential long-term effects in synaptic changes and neuropsychiatric impairments. The neuroinvasive biology also provides a possible link with the Braak staging of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Although with considerable advances, the neurotropic potential and chronic neurological effects caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections merit further investigations.","['Wu J', 'Tang Y']",2020,11,,Front Neurol,Wu J and Tang Y.

33177902,Comparison of COVID-19 and MERS Risk Communication in Korea: A Case Study of TV Public Service Advertisements.,"PURPOSE: In recent years, the world has been under threat of novel infectious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Governmental risk communication plays a key role in overcoming the public health crises caused by the emergence of these infectious diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the focus of Korean public service advertisements (PSAs) in response to the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks, along with the differences between them.
METHODS: A total of five MERS and 17 COVID-19 TV PSAs were analyzed using Lasswell's Sender, Message, Channel, Receiver, and Effect model and the responses of the Korean government were compared between the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks.
RESULTS: During the MERS outbreak, the Korean government failed to gain the public's trust through its PSAs. Despite its best efforts, it provided opaque and selective information on the crisis. Conversely, in the case of COVID-19, the Korean government has successfully worked to strengthen community awareness by supporting and encouraging the public.
CONCLUSION: Despite the Korean government's improved communication in the COVID-19 crisis, there has been an insufficient response to the needs of vulnerable groups that could be placed in at-risk situations as a result of domestic violence or mental health problems during outbreaks of novel infectious diseases that require aggressive management.","['Park D', 'Ha J']",2020,13,,Risk Manag Healthc Policy,Park D and Ha J.

Recent studies have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human feces. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given catchment population, as wastewater contains viruses from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The current study reports the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Slovenia. Two sizes of centrifugal filters were tested: 30 kDa and 10 kDA AMICON® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters, where 10 kDA resulted in a higher concentration factor and higher recovery efficiency.

33174948,Online learning and COVID-19: a meta-synthesis analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a quick shift from presential to e-learning processes. Unlike planned e-learning programs, medical schools have had to quickly deliver the entire medical curriculum using remote strategies. This study aimed to perform a meta-synthesis of previous pandemic situations and describe the experience of the São Paulo University School of Medicine. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, EMBASE, Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC, using the following keywords: (""SARS"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"" OR ""middle east respiratory syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV"" OR ""Mers"" OR ""Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV*"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""Coronavirus Infections"" OR ""coronavirus*"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""online education"" OR ""Education, Distance"" OR ""e-learning"" OR ""course online"" OR ""flipped classroom"") AND (""lockdown"" OR ""social distance"" OR ""quarantine""). The endpoints were the online platforms used for online learning, the model of class, recorded versus online interaction, duration of online lectures, and students' and teachers' perceptions of online learning. We retrieved 38 records; only seven articles studied online education methods related to the pandemic and social distancing rules. The most frequently used online platform was Zoom®. The studies examined both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. There was no evidence regarding duration and students' and teachers' attitude. This study suggests that the online learning shift was feasible; however, because of the nature of the education shift (pandemic), future studies must further analyze the educational structure.","['Camargo CP', 'Tempski PZ', 'Busnardo FF', 'Martins MA', 'Gemperli R']",2020,75,,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Camargo CP, et al.

DESIGN: A narrative review was performed.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted on both Chinese and English electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO. Articles published from 1 December 2019 -1 April 2020 were included in this review.
REVIEW METHODS: Studies reporting on the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 using TCM regardless of study designs were included. In addition, grey literatures, including media reports on Chinese government websites or official media websites and treatment guidelines were searched for TCM treatment and prevention on COVID-19.
RESULTS: Limited research has been published on the use of TCM for COVID-19. We qualitatively described and synthesized the published research and current clinical practice on the use of TCM for COVID-19, and focused on the following areas: TCM treatment used in SARS, MERS, H1N1; TCM treatment plan for COVID-19; TCM in Prevention and Treatment at Early Stage of COVID-19; TCM emotional therapy; and personalized TCM treatment plan.
CONCLUSION: The combination of western medicine and TCM in treatment, and treatment based on the local condition, isolation, personal protective measures are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Relevant laboratory research and clinical evaluation should be continued to collect scientific evidences on the efficacy of TCM.
IMPACT: TCM has been used in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in China, and the clinical evidences indicated that TCM regulates immunity and exerts anti-viral effect simultaneously. This review provides practical recommendation for the policymakers in the selection process of the treatment and preventive measures for the global pandemic of COVID-19.","['Wu XV', 'Dong Y', 'Chi Y', 'Yu M', 'Wang W']",2021,77,4,J Adv Nurs,"Wu XV, et al.

Human coronavirus (HCoV) strains (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63) usually cause mild upper respiratory diseases and are believed to be harmless. However, other HCoVs, associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19, have been identified as important pathogens due to their potent infectivity and lethality worldwide. Moreover, currently, no effective antiviral drugs treatments are available so far. In this review, we summarize the biological characters of HCoVs, their association with human diseases, and current therapeutic options for the three severe HCoVs.

33169095,Hajj and Umrah Mass Gatherings and COVID-19 Infection.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We discuss the risk of COVID-19 in religious mass gathering events including Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages.
RECENT FINDINGS: The risk of transmission of respiratory viruses including COVID-19 is particularly high due to the overcrowding conditions at the Hajj and Umrah. The profile of the Hajj pilgrims who tend to be older and with multiple comorbidities corresponds to that of individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. In order to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak with potential spreading to many countries through returning pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended the Umrah, and access to the 2020 Hajj was very limited.
SUMMARY: A clear relation between early suspension of religious mass gatherings and lower occurrence of COVID-19 transmission in countries that took such measures promptly was noticed. There are lessons to national and international health organizations for other mass gatherings in the context of the pandemic.","['Hoang VT', 'Gautret P', 'Memish ZA', 'Al-Tawfiq JA']",2020,7,4,Curr Trop Med Rep,"Hoang VT, et al.

33165486,Colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) as a visual diagnostic platform for the detection of the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19, caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection. The disease has now reached the level of a global pandemic and as a result a more rapid and simple detection method is imperative to curb the spread of the virus. We aimed to develop a visual diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 based on colorimetric RT-LAMP with levels of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of commercial qRT-PCR assays. In this work, the primers were designed to target a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp). The assay was characterized for its sensitivity and specificity, and validated with clinical specimens collected in Thailand. The developed colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could amplify the target gene and enabled visual interpretation in 60 min at 65 °C. No cross-reactivity with six other common human respiratory viruses (influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human metapneumovirus) and five other human coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, 229E and NL63) was observed. The limit of detection was 25 copies per reaction when evaluated with contrived specimens. However, the detection rate at this concentration fell to 95.8% when the incubation time was reduced from 60 to 30 min. The diagnostic performance of the developed RT-LAMP assay was evaluated in 2120 clinical specimens and compared with the commercial qRT-PCR. The results revealed high sensitivity and specificity of 95.74% and 99.95%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was determined to be 99.86%. In summary, our results indicate that the developed colorimetric RT-LAMP provides a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, implying its beneficial use as a diagnostic platform for COVID-19 screening.","['Nawattanapaiboon K', 'Pasomsub E', 'Prombun P', 'Wongbunmak A', 'Jenjitwanich A', 'Mahasupachai P', 'Vetcho P', 'Chayrach C', 'Manatjaroenlap N', 'Samphaongern C', 'Watthanachockchai T', 'Leedorkmai P', 'Manopwisedjaroen S', 'Akkarawongsapat R', 'Thitithanyanont A', 'Phanchana M', 'Panbangred W', 'Chauvatcharin S', 'Srikhirin T']",2021,146,2,Analyst,"Nawattanapaiboon K, et al.

33162891,Vulnerabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus to Proteotoxicity-Opportunity for Repurposed Chemotherapy of COVID-19 Infection.,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has produced an urgent requirement and search for improved treatments while effective vaccines are developed. A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated toward modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pK","['Al-Motawa MS', 'Abbas H', 'Wijten P', 'de la Fuente A', 'Xue M', 'Rabbani N', 'Thornalley PJ']",2020,11,,Front Pharmacol,"Al-Motawa MS, et al.

Avian influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the plague can all lead to severe pulmonary complications with a high mortality. In addition, there is a risk of nosocomial spread and therefore patients must always be isolated. Melioidosis, blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis are primarily often misclassified as community-acquired pneumonia due to typical causative organisms. A detailed anamnesis focussing on exposure in endemic areas is key to the diagnosis. Paragonimiasis is often manifested a few weeks after consumption of raw seafood and pronounced eosinophilia is typical. Relevant aspects of the epidemiology, clinical course, treatment and, if applicable, prevention are presented as cases of these diseases can occur at any time in Germany.","['Pfäfflin F', 'Stegemann MS']",2020,17,6,Pneumologe (Berl),Pfäfflin F and Stegemann MS.

Antibodies are generated in response to a vaccine but little use as immunotherapy to combat virus infections. A new generation of broadly cross-reactive and highly potent antibodies has led to a unique chance for them to be used as a medical intervention. Neutralizing antibodies (monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies) are desirable for pharmaceutical products because of their ability to target specific epitopes with their variable domains by precise neutralization mechanisms. The isolation of neutralizing antiviral antibodies has been achieved by Phage displayed antibody libraries, transgenic mice, B cell approaches, and hybridoma technology. Antibody engineering technologies have led to efficacy improvements, to further boost antibody in vivo activities.

33160938,Computational drug re-purposing targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as an effective strategy to neutralize COVID-19.,"COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proficient bioavailability coupled with no predicted in silico toxicity rendered them as prospective alternatives for designing and development of novel combinatorial therapy formulations for improving existing treatment regimes to combat COVID-19.","['Toor HG', 'Banerjee DI', 'Lipsa Rath S', 'Darji SA']",2021,890,,Eur J Pharmacol,"Toor HG, et al.

33158944,The SARS-CoV-2 Conserved Macrodomain Is a Mono-ADP-Ribosylhydrolase.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-related CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Mac1 domains exhibit similar structural folds, and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with affinities in the low micromolar range. Importantly, using ADP-ribose-detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate than the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.","['Alhammad YMO', 'Kashipathy MM', 'Roy A', 'Gagné JP', 'McDonald P', 'Gao P', 'Nonfoux L', 'Battaile KP', 'Johnson DK', 'Holmstrom ED', 'Poirier GG', 'Lovell S', 'Fehr AR']",2021,95,3,J Virol,"Alhammad YMO, et al.

With the rapid and sustained growth of the publications on COVID-19 research, we will perform a living systematic review (LSR) to provide comprehensive and continuously updated data to explore the prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: We will perform a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature to identify relevant studies. We will include peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies published in English and Chinese. Two reviewers will independently assess the methodological quality of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal tool and perform data extraction. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity, the prevalence estimates with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be calculated by using random-effects model to minimize the effect of between-study heterogeneity separately. The literature searches will be updated every 3 months. We will perform meta-analysis if any new eligible studies or data are obtained. We will resubmit an updated review when there were relevant changes in the results, i.e., when outcomes became statistically significant (or not statistically significant anymore) or when heterogeneity became substantial (or not substantial anymore).
DISCUSSION: This LSR will provide an in-depth and up-to-date summary of whether the common neuropsychiatric conditions observed in patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also prevalent in a different stage of COVID-19 patients.

33155902,Current Landscape of Natural Products against Coronaviruses: Perspectives in COVID-19 Treatment and Anti-viral Mechanism.,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, and the infection by SARS-CoV-2, termed as COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and this outbreak became a pandemic in February of 2020. Till now, there is no effective drug or vaccine against this virus that can make a complete cure; however, a number of drugs are in trials.
OBJECTIVES: In this review, we have focused on an alternative therapeutic approach using natural products utilizing the host anti-viral responses for resolving COVID-19 pathogenesis.
METHODS: We have searched databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for articles related to natural products and viral diseases, with a specific focus on coronaviruses, as well as other RNA viruses and recent updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, and collected articles and reviewed them comprehensively.
RESULTS: Scientific studies clarified the viral pathogenesis that involved viral entrance into host cells and anti-viral response inside the cells, which can be effectively targeted by numerous natural compounds from different sources. Many of these compounds can potentially target viral genomic material or protein machinery. Natural products that were found effective against other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (which emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively), might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to their structural similarities.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency thus, urgent drug development is necessary. Natural products can be the biggest source of drugs, as they have been found to be effective in other coronaviruses previously; however, time is required to establish the clinical success of these drugs for clinical applications.","['Shawon J', 'Akter Z', 'Hossen MM', 'Akter Y', 'Sayeed A', 'Junaid M', 'Afrose SS', 'Khan MA']",2020,26,41,Curr Pharm Des,"Shawon J, et al.

The virus causes the disease not only in people but also in companion and wild animals. People with diabetes are at risk of the disease. As yet we do not know why the virus has been highly successful in causing the pandemic within 3 months of its first report. The structural proteins of SARS include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S).
METHODS: The structure and function of the most abundant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, is not fully understood. Using 
RESULTS: The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. 
CONCLUSIONS: The advantage and role of the M protein having a sugar transporter-like structure is not clearly understood. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with S, E, and N protein. The S protein of the virus is glycosylated. It could be hypothesized that the sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein influences glycosylation of the S protein. Endocytosis is critical for the internalization and maturation of RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Sucrose is involved in endosome and lysosome maturation and may also induce autophagy, pathways that help in the entry of the virus. Overall, it could be hypothesized that the SemiSWEET sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein may be involved in multiple functions that may aid in the rapid proliferation, replication, and immune evasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Biological experiments would validate the presence and function of the SemiSWEET sugar transporter.",['Thomas S'],2020,5,1,Pathog Immun,Thomas S.

33152203,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing: The technological initiative to strengthen early warning systems for public health emergencies in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health problem on a scale unprecedented in the last 100 years, as has been the response focused on the rapid genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in virtually all regions of the planet. This pandemic emerged during the era of genomic epidemiology, a science fueled by continued advances in next-generation sequencing. Since its recent appearance, genomic epidemiology included the precise identification of new lineages or species of pathogens and the reconstruction of their genetic variability in real time, evidenced in past outbreaks of influenza H1N1, MERS, and SARS. However, the global and uncontrolled scale of this pandemic created a scenario where genomic epidemiology was put into practice en masse, from the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 to the registration of new lineages and their active surveillance throughout the world. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of genomic data on circulating pathogens in several Latin America and the Caribbean countries was scarce or nil. With the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, this scenario changed significantly, although the amount of available information remains scarce and, in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained mainly by research groups in genomic epidemiology rather than the product of a public health surveillance policy or program. This indicates the need to establish public health policies aimed at implementing genomic epidemiology as a tool to strengthen surveillance and early warning systems against threats to public health in the region.","['Álvarez-Díaz DA', 'Laiton-Donato K', 'Franco-Muñoz C', 'Mercado-Reyes M']",2020,40,Supl. 2,Biomedica,"Álvarez-Díaz DA, et al.

33151990,Rituximab-specific DNA aptamers are able to selectively recognize heat-treated antibodies.,"The monoclonal anti-CD20 IgG1 antibody rituximab is used as a first-line treatment for B cell lymphoma. Like all therapeutic antibodies, it is a complex protein for which both safety and efficacy heavily depend on the integrity of its three-dimensional structure. Aptamers, short oligonucleotides with a distinct fold, can be used to detect minor modifications or structural variations of a molecule or protein. To detect antibody molecules in a fold state occurring prior to protein precipitation, we generated DNA aptamers that were selected for extensively heat-treated rituximab. Using the magnetic bead-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), we obtained six DNA aptamer sequences (40-mers) specific for 80°C heat-treated rituximab. In silico fold prediction and circular dichroism analysis revealed a G-quadruplex structure for one aptamer, while all others exhibited a B-DNA helix. Binding affinities ranging from 8.8-86.7 nM were determined by an enzyme-linked apta-sorbent assay (ELASA). Aptamers additionally detected structural changes in rituximab treated for 5 min at 70°C, although with lower binding activity. Notably, none of the aptamers recognized rituximab in its native state nor did they detect the antibody after it was exposed to lower temperatures or different physical stressors. Aptamers also reacted with the therapeutic antibody adalimumab incubated at 80°C suggesting similar aptamer binding motifs located on extensively heat-treated IgG1 antibodies. Within this work, we obtained the first aptamer panel, which is specific for an antibody fold state specifically present prior to protein aggregation. This study demonstrates the potential of aptamer selection for specific stress-based protein variants, which has potential impact for quality control of biopharmaceuticals.","['Kohlberger M', 'Wildner S', 'Regl C', 'Huber CG', 'Gadermaier G']",2020,15,11,PLoS One,"Kohlberger M, et al.

33149733,The Inflammasome in Times of COVID-19.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the genus Betacoronavirus and the Coronaviridiae family responsible for infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and more recently, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CoV infections present mainly as respiratory infections that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, CoVs, such as COVID-19, also present as a hyperactivation of the inflammatory response that results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and its downstream molecule IL-6. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in the activation of caspase-1 that leads to the activation of IL-1β in a variety of diseases and infections such as CoV infection and in different tissues such as lungs, brain, intestines and kidneys, all of which have been shown to be affected in COVID-19 patients. Here we review the literature regarding the mechanism of inflammasome activation by CoV infection, the role of the inflammasome in ARDS, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) as well as the potential mechanism by which the inflammasome may contribute to the damaging effects of inflammation in the cardiac, renal, digestive, and nervous systems in COVID-19 patients.","['de Rivero Vaccari JC', 'Dietrich WD', 'Keane RW', 'de Rivero Vaccari JP']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"de Rivero Vaccari JC, et al.

33148354,The Association of Dexmedetomidine with Firing Properties in Pallidal Neurons.,"BACKGROUND: Microelectrode recordings (MERs) are used during deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS) to optimize patient outcomes and provide a unique method of collecting data regarding neurological conditions. However, MERs can be affected by anesthetics such as dexmedetomidine. Little is known about the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the globus pallidus interna (GPi), a common target for DBS. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that DEX is associated with alterations in GPi MERs.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing MERs from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia who underwent insertion of DBS of the GPi under DEX sedation with those who went through the same procedure without DEX (No DEX).
RESULTS: Firing rates for GPi neurons in the DEX group were lower (57.44 ± 2.04; mean ± SEM, n = 163 cells) than the No DEX group (69.53 ± 2.06, n = 112 cells, P < 0.0001). Overall, DEX was associated with a greater proportion of GPi cells classified as firing in bursty pattern compared to our No DEX group. (29.41%, n = 153 vs 14.81%, n = 108, P = 0.008). This effect was present for both PD and dystonia patients who underwent the procedure. High doses of DEX were associated with lower firing rates than low doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DEX is associated with a decrease in GPi firing rates and are associated with an increase in burstiness. Furthermore, these effects are similar between dystonia and PD patients. Lastly, the effects of DEX may differ between high doses and low doses.","['Gasim M', 'Kalia SK', 'Hodaie M', 'Lozano AM', 'Venkatraghavan L', 'Hutchison WD']",2021,48,4,Can J Neurol Sci,"Gasim M, et al.

33147460,Interferon Regulatory Factors IRF1 and IRF7 Directly Regulate Gene Expression in Bats in Response to Viral Infection.,"Bat cells and tissue have elevated basal expression levels of antiviral genes commonly associated with interferon alpha (IFNα) signaling. Here, we show Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1), 3, and 7 levels are elevated in most bat tissues and that, basally, IRFs contribute to the expression of type I IFN ligands and high expression of interferon regulated genes (IRGs). CRISPR knockout (KO) of IRF 1/3/7 in cells reveals distinct subsets of genes affected by each IRF in an IFN-ligand signaling-dependent and largely independent manner. As the master regulators of innate immunity, the IRFs control the kinetics and maintenance of the IRG response and play essential roles in response to influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Melaka virus/Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 Melaka (PRV3M), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. With its differential expression in bats compared to that in humans, this highlights a critical role for basal IRF expression in viral responses and potentially immune cell development in bats with relevance for IRF function in human biology.","['Irving AT', 'Zhang Q', 'Kong PS', 'Luko K', 'Rozario P', 'Wen M', 'Zhu F', 'Zhou P', 'Ng JHJ', 'Sobota RM', 'Wang LF']",2020,33,5,Cell Rep,"Irving AT, et al.

The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3,509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently colocated with TRS-B sites than expected.","['Yang Y', 'Yan W', 'Hall AB', 'Jiang X']",2021,38,4,Mol Biol Evol,"Yang Y, et al.

METHODS: We searched 3 electronic databases up or observational studies reporting differences between men and women in the SARS-CoV-2 disease characteristics stated. We identified and included 47 studies, reporting data for 21,454 patients mainly from China.
RESULTS: The unadjusted mortality rates of men were higher than those of women, with a mortality OR 0.51 [0.42, 0.61] (p<0.001) for women.

Due to the lack of medical countermeasures, effective and safe vaccines against MERS-CoV infection are urgently required. Although different types of candidate vaccines have been developed, their immunogenicity is limited, and the dose and administration route need optimization to achieve optimal protection. We here investigated the potential use of human β-defensin 2 (HBD 2) as an adjuvant to enhance the protection provided by MERS-CoV vaccination. We found that immunization of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice with spike protein receptor-binding domain (S RBD) conjugated with HBD 2 (S RBD-HBD 2) induced potent antigen (Ag)-specific adaptive immune responses and protected against MERS-CoV infection. In addition, immunization with S RBD-HBD 2 alleviated progressive pulmonary fibrosis in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice and suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling activation upon viral infection. Compared to intramuscular administration, intranasal administration of S RBD-HBD 2 induced more potent mucosal IgA responses and was more effective for protecting against intranasal MERS-CoV infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HBD 2 potentiates Ag-specific immune responses against viral Ag and can be used as an adjuvant enhancing the immunogenicity of subunit vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV.","['Kim J', 'Yang YL', 'Jeong Y', 'Jang YS']",2020,8,4,Vaccines (Basel),"Kim J, et al.

More than 423349 deaths had occurred globally and is still increasing every day. The whole world is under a health emergency, and people are advised to stay at their homes to avoid the spread of person-to-person infection, and advised to maintain social distancing. The advancement in clinical diagnosis techniques like Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), immunological, microscopy, and geographic information system (GIS) mapping technology helped in tacking the rapid diagnosis and tracking viral infection in a short period. In the same way, artificial intelligence (AI), combinatorial chemistry, and deep learning approaches help to find novel therapeutics in less time and wide applicability in biomedical research. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has started the clinical trials of investigation COVID-19 vaccine.

The WHO declared on January 31 that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a public health emergency. SARS-Cov-2 is a member of highly pathogenic coronavirus group that also consists of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although respiratory tract lesions were regarded as main manifestation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, gastrointestinal lesions were also reported. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also observed. Common gastrointestinal symptoms of patients mainly included diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal lesions could be used as basis for early diagnosis of patients, and at the same time, controlling gastrointestinal lesions better facilitated to cut off the route of fecal-oral transmission. Hence, this review summarizes the characteristics and mechanism of gastrointestinal lesions caused by three highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it is expected to gain experience from gastrointestinal lesions caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections in order to be able to better relieve SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

Similarly, some environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) have been shown to be associated with transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but global data on their association with COVID-19 are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between climatic factors and COVID-19.
METHODS: We used multilevel mixed-effects (two-level random-intercepts) negative binomial regression models to examine the association between 7- and 14-day-lagged temperature, humidity (relative and absolute), wind speed and UV index and COVID-19 cases, adjusting for Gross Domestic Products, Global Health Security Index, cloud cover (%), precipitation (mm), sea-level air-pressure (mb), and daytime length. The effects estimates are reported as adjusted rate ratio (aRR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Data from 206 countries/regions (until April 20, 2020) with ≥100 reported cases showed no association between COVID-19 cases and 7-day-lagged temperature, relative humidity, UV index, and wind speed, after adjusting for potential confounders, but a positive association with 14-day-lagged temperature and a negative association with 14-day-lagged wind speed.

These alternative therapies are effective when they are started at the initial stage of the infection.

It is imperative to focus on the available antimicrobial and adjunct therapies during the current emergency state and overcome the challenges associated with the absence of robust controlled studies. There is no established set of drugs to manage SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, closely following patients' conditions and responding with the dosage guidelines of available drugs may significantly impact our ability to slow down the infection.

Since its appearance, MERS-CoV has been reported in 27 countries and most of these cases were in Saudi Arabia. So far, dromedaries are considered to be the intermediate host and the only known source of human infection. This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and the infection rate of MERS-CoV in slaughtered food-camels in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 171 nasal swabs along with 161 serum samples were collected during the winter; from January to April 2019. Nasal swabs were examined by Rapid test and RT-PCR to detect MERS-CoV RNA, while serum samples were tested primarily using S1-based ELISA Kit to detect MERS-CoV (IgG) antibodies and subsequently by MERS pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) neutralization assay for confirmation. Genetic diversity of the positive isolates was determined based on the amplification and sequencing of the spike gene. Our results showed high prevalence (38.6%) of MERS-CoV infection in slaughtered camels and high seropositivity (70.8%) during the time of the study. These data indicate previous and ongoing MERS-CoV infection in camels. Phylogenic analysis revealed relatively low genetic variability among our isolated samples. When these isolates were aligned against published spike sequences of MERS-CoV, deposited in global databases, there was sequence similarity of 94%. High seroprevalence and high genetic stability of MERS-CoV in camels indicating that camels pose a public health threat.

This produces the perception of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or umami stimuli, depending on the chemical nature of the tastant. Taste impairments (dysgeusia) are alterations of this normal gustatory functioning that may result in complete taste losses (ageusia), partial reductions (hypogeusia), or over-acuteness of the sense of taste (hypergeusia). Taste impairments are not life-threatening conditions, but they can cause sufficient discomfort and lead to appetite loss and changes in eating habits, with possible effects on health. Determinants of such alterations are multiple and consist of both genetic and environmental factors, including aging, exposure to chemicals, drugs, trauma, high alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, poor oral health, malnutrition, and viral upper respiratory infections including influenza.

33119059,KIMI: Knockoff Inference for Motif Identification from molecular sequences with controlled false discovery rate.,"MOTIVATION: The rapid development of sequencing technologies has enabled us to generate a large number of metagenomic reads from genetic materials in microbial communities, making it possible to gain deep insights into understanding the differences between the genetic materials of different groups of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, plasmids, etc. Computational methods based on k-mer frequencies have been shown to be highly effective for classifying metagenomic sequencing reads into different groups. However, such methods usually use all the k-mers as features for prediction without selecting relevant k-mers for the different groups of sequences, i.e. unique nucleotide patterns containing biological significance.
RESULTS: To select k-mers for distinguishing different groups of sequences with guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control, we develop KIMI, a general framework based on model-X Knockoffs regarded as the state-of-the-art statistical method for FDR control, for sequence motif discovery with arbitrary target FDR level, such that reproducibility can be theoretically guaranteed. KIMI is shown through simulation studies to be effective in simultaneously controlling FDR and yielding high power, outperforming the broadly used Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and the q-value method for FDR control. To illustrate the usefulness of KIMI in analyzing real datasets, we take the viral motif discovery problem as an example and implement KIMI on a real dataset consisting of viral and bacterial contigs. We show that the accuracy of predicting viral and bacterial contigs can be increased by training the prediction model only on relevant k-mers selected by KIMI.

Decades of studies have led to the discovery of a broad set of carbohydrate and protein receptors for many animal and human coronaviruses. As the main determinant of coronavirus entry, the spike protein binds to these receptors and mediates membrane fusion. Prone to mutations and recombination, spike evolution has been studied extensively. The interactions between spike proteins and their receptors are often complex and despite many advances in the field, there remains many unresolved questions concerning coronavirus tropism modification and cross-species transmission, potentially leading to delays in outbreak responses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to address these outstanding issues in order to better anticipate new outbreaks.

33116550,The Double Burden of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Polypharmacy on Geriatric Population - Public Health Implications.,"COVID-19 pandemic is inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and eventual death. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality in the elderly population with pre-existing medical conditions. This group is particularly vulnerable to infections due to a declined immune system, comorbidities, geriatric syndrome, and potentially inappropriate polypharmacy. These conditions make the elderly population more susceptible to the harmful effects of medications and the deleterious consequences of infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Chronic diseases among elderlies, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, present a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. To comply with the clinical guidelines, the practitioner may prescribe a complex medication regimen that adds up to the burden of pre-existing treatment, potentially inducing adverse drug reactions and leading to harmful side-effects. Consequently, the geriatric population is at increased risk of falls, frailty, and dependence that enhances their susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, particularly interstitial pneumonia. The major challenge resides in the detection of infection that may present as atypical manifestations in this age group. Healthy aging can be possible with adequate preventive measures and appropriate medication regimen and follow-up. Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations of WHO, CDC, and other national/regional/international agencies can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better training programs are needed to enhance the skill of health care professionals and patient's caregivers. This review explains the public health implications associated with polypharmacy on the geriatric population with pre-existing co-morbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Rahman S', 'Singh K', 'Dhingra S', 'Charan J', 'Sharma P', 'Islam S', 'Jahan D', 'Iskandar K', 'Samad N', 'Haque M']",2020,16,,Ther Clin Risk Manag,"Rahman S, et al.

33116397,Glycopeptides as Potential Interventions for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease that primarily attacks the human pulmonary system, is caused by a viral strain called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak emerged from Wuhan, China, and later spread throughout the world. Until the first week of May 2020, over 3.7 million cases had been reported worldwide and more than 258,000 had died due to the disease. So far, off label use of various drugs has been tried in many clinical settings, however, at present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronaviruses. Therefore, repurposing of the available drugs may be promising to control emerging infections of SARS-COV2; however, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Glycopeptides, which are active against gram-positive bacteria, have demonstrated significant activity against viral infections including SARS-COV and MERS-COV and have a high resemblance of sequence homology with SARS-COV2. Recent in vitro studies have also shown promising activities of aglycon derivative of glycopeptides and teicoplanin against SARS-COV2. Hydrophobic aglycon derivatives and teicoplanin, with minimal toxicity to human cell lines, inhibit entry and replication of SARS-COV2. These drugs block proteolysis of polyprotein a/b with replicase and transcription domains. Teicoplanin use was associated with complete viral clearance in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms. This review attempts to describe the activity, elucidate the possible mechanisms and potential clinical applications of existing glycopeptides against corona viruses, specifically SARS-COV2.","['Demsie DG', 'Gebre AK', 'Yimer EM', 'Alema NM', 'Araya EM', 'Bantie AT', 'Allene MD', 'Gebremedhin H', 'Yehualaw A', 'Tafere C', 'Tadese HT', 'Amare B', 'Weldekidan E', 'Gebrie D']",2020,14,,Biologics,"Demsie DG, et al.

33113270,Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease.,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Patient comprehension is a critical part of meeting medical ethics standards of informed consent in study designs. The aim of the study was to determine if sufficient literature exists to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus.
METHODS USED TO CONDUCT THE STUDY: Published literature was reviewed to identify preclinical and clinical evidence that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus. Clinical trial protocols for COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed to determine if risks were properly disclosed.
RESULTS OF THE STUDY: COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.
CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE STUDY AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The specific and significant COVID-19 risk of ADE should have been and should be prominently and independently disclosed to research subjects currently in vaccine trials, as well as those being recruited for the trials and future patients after vaccine approval, in order to meet the medical ethics standard of patient comprehension for informed consent.","['Cardozo T', 'Veazey R']",2021,75,3,Int J Clin Pract,Cardozo T and Veazey R.

33112126,Targeting Crucial Host Factors of SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide since its first incidence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the total fatality to surpass other viral diseases, reaching more than 1 million globally as of October 6, 2020. The rate at which the disease is spreading calls for a therapy that is useful for treating a large population. Multiple intersecting viral and host factor targets involved in the life cycle of the virus are being explored. Because of the frequent mutations, many coronaviruses gain zoonotic potential, which is dependent on the presence of cell receptors and proteases, and therefore the targeting of the viral proteins has some drawbacks, as strain-specific drug resistance can occur. Moreover, the limited number of proteins in a virus makes the number of available targets small. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common mechanisms of entry and replication, there are substantial differences in viral proteins such as the spike (S) protein. In contrast, targeting cellular factors may result in a broader range of therapies, reducing the chances of developing drug resistance. In this Review, we discuss the role of primary host factors such as the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cellular proteases of S protein priming, post-translational modifiers, kinases, inflammatory cells, and their pharmacological intervention in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.","['Tharappel AM', 'Samrat SK', 'Li Z', 'Li H']",2020,6,11,ACS Infect Dis,"Tharappel AM, et al.

33112124,"Coronavirus diseases and pregnancy: COVID-19,SARS, and MERS.","Around the end of December 2019, a new beta-coronavirus from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China began to spread rapidly. The new virus, called SARS-CoV-2, which could be transmitted through respiratory droplets, had a range of mild to severe symptoms, from simple cold in some cases to death in others. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 by WHO and has so far killed more people than SARS and MERS. Following the widespread global outbreak of COVID-19, with more than 132758 confirmed cases and 4955 deaths worldwide, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease in January 2020. Earlier studies on viral pneumonia epidemics has shown that pregnant women are at greater risk than others. During pregnancy, the pregnant woman is more prone to infectious diseases. Research on both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are pathologically similar to SARS-CoV-2, has shown that being infected with these viruses during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal death, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation and, preterm delivery. With the exponential increase in cases of COVID-19 throughout the world, there is a need to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the health of pregnant women, through extrapolation of earlier studies that have been conducted on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. There is an urgent need to understand the chance of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus and the possibility of the virus crossing the placental barrier. Additionally, since some viral diseases and antiviral drugs may have a negative impact on the mother and fetus, in which case, pregnant women need special attention for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","['Fathi M', 'Vakili K', 'Deravi N', 'Yaghoobpoor S', 'Ahsan E', 'Mokhtari M', 'Moshfeghi M', 'Vaezjalali M']",2020,74,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Fathi M, et al.

There have been several studies about the clinical features and imaging features, but very few reports have been published about pathologic findings in lung tissue, which was partly because of the lack of tissue diagnosis secondary to suddenness of the outbreak. Overall, less than 30 reports have been published in the literature about histologic findings of lung in these viruses, so far. In this report, we will review the published reports about the histopathologic findings of lung tissue in the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with 2 other coronaviruses that have caused outbreaks, ie, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.","['Geramizadeh B', 'Marzban M']",2020,13,,Clin Pathol,Geramizadeh B and Marzban M.

The immune system plays a great role in response to any foreign organisms be it bacteria or viruses. Virus-based pandemics like SARS, MERS, COVID-19 have time and again been surfacing leading to mortality and morbidity worldwide. These pandemics have also resurfaced the role of public health and its modes which have been fading in the presence of lucrative hi-tech medical industry. Although Chinese system of medicine has been explored, there is still more to be done in exploring solutions from time tested Indian systems of medicine like Ayurved and Yog. Its time to rethink and explore ways to harness our immune system and look for evidence-based solutions providing the best of both medical systems to the patients, i.e., modern medicine as well as Ayurved and Yog. The present review is a narrative review wherein studies were searched from databases like PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and web pages. Given a paucity of studies hereby we explored existing pieces of evidence, thereby concluding that more randomized controlled trials need to be done for assessing the role of Ayurved, Yog, and other Indian systems of medicine to enrich the armamentarium in the fight against such viruses in future.

The awareness of the scientific and public community is enormous. But what about the sense of all these undertakings and what can be learned about the future for a better understanding? These questions were answered with established bibliometric analyses of the time until the avalanche of publications unfolded.
METHODS: Chronological, geographical aspects of publication output on coronavirus were also evaluated under the influence of epidemiological and socio-economic parameters.
RESULTS: The trend in publication and citation numbers shows the strong influence of the past pandemics SARS and MERS with an untypical decline afterward. Research is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary over time. The USA and China, as the countries with the highest number of publications, are being displaced by other countries in the consideration of socio-economic and epidemiological aspects, which shows the effect of regional interest in corona research. A significant correlation was found between the number of SARS cases per country and related publications, while no correlation was found for MERS cases and articles.

33108836,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Transmission: Blood Viremia and Aerosol Generation from Spinal Surgery. Is There an Increased Risk to the Surgical Team?,"As a respiratory pathogen, the novel coronavirus is commonly associated with aerosol-generating procedures. However, it is currently unclear whether spinal surgical procedures pose an additional risk of viral transmission to the surgical team. We reviewed the available evidence to ascertain the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) blood viremia and the virus' blood transmissibility, as well as evidence of blood-aerosol generation and operating room contamination from spinal surgical procedures. There is established evidence of COVID-19 blood viremia, a viral pathogenic cycle via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and similar blood transmission risk data from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)/MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) era. Spinal surgical practices demonstrate significant blood-aerosol generation from the operative wound due to the use of common surgical instruments, such as electrocautery, as well as high-speed and high-impact devices. Based on the evidence, there is an established additional risk of viral transmission faced by surgical teams from blood-aerosols generated from the operative wound of COVID-19- infected patients via the inhalation of virus-laden aerosols and the subsequent initiation of the viral pathogenic cycle through binding with pulmonary ACE-2 receptors. Recognizing this additional risk amidst the ongoing pandemic serves as a caution to front-line surgical personnel to strictly adhere to personal protective equipment usage in operating rooms, to modify surgical techniques to reduce the hazard of surgical aerosol generation and COVID-19 viral exposure, and to consider it as an integral aspect of planning and adapting to the ""new normal"" operating practices.","['Shah S', 'Gadiya A', 'Patel MS', 'Shafafy M']",2020,14,5,Asian Spine J,"Shah S, et al.

It causes severe respiratory syndromes which is one of the leading causes of death. Evidence shows that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has close similarities with other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. So, SARS-CoV-2 might use the similar mechanisms of these viruses to attack the host cells. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with various factors, one of the major reasons is immune dysregulation or immune suppression. Immunity plays a significant role in maintaining the body in a healthy condition. In order to induce a timely immune response against the invaded pathogens, both innate and adaptive immunity must be in an active state. During the viral infection, there will be an excessive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm and also, the antiviral agents in the body gets inhibited or inactivated through viral mechanisms. Thus, this might be the reason for the transition from mild symptoms to more severe medical conditions which leads to an immediate need for the invention of a new medicine.This review aims to show the host-viral interaction along with immune response, antiviral mechanism and effectiveness of oral low dose cytokines against the virus as a therapeutic approach.","['M R', 'S S', 'Jose SP', 'Rajan S', 'Thomas S', 'Jagmag T', 'Tilwani J']",2021,43,1,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,"M R, et al.

33104267,"Neutralizing and binding activities against SARS-CoV-1/2, MERS-CoV, and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 by normal human intravenous immunoglobulin derived from healthy donors in Japan.","BACKGROUND: There are several types of coronaviruses that infect humans and cause disease. The latest is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging global threat with no current effective treatment. Normal intravenous immunoglobulin (N-IVIG) has been administered to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to control severe inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, the neutralizing activity of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether N-IVIG manufactured before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contained IgG antibodies against the circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cross-react with the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been reported in Japan.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The neutralizing and binding activities of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV 229E, and HCoV OC43 were evaluated. Nine N-IVIG lots manufactured between 2000 and 2018, derived from donors in Japan, were tested. Binding activity was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: None of the N-IVIG lots tested displayed neutralizing or binding activity against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2. However, they displayed substantial neutralizing and binding activity against HCoV OC43 and weak neutralizing and substantial binding activity against HCoV 229E.
CONCLUSION: N-IVIG derived from healthy donors in Japan before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had no direct effect against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are warranted to determine the effects of N-IVIG manufactured after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic against SARS-CoV-2.","['Kubota-Koketsu R', 'Terada Y', 'Yunoki M', 'Sasaki T', 'Nakayama EE', 'Kamitani W', 'Shioda T']",2021,61,2,Transfusion,"Kubota-Koketsu R, et al.

33102545,"COVID-19 in Human, Animal, and Environment: A Review.","The medical authority in China, especially in Wuhan city, reported on December 2019 a large number of highly fatal, rapidly spreading viral pneumonia caused by an unknown coronavirus. The common history of all the patients was their visiting a Wuhan's whole food store, where live animals and seafood are sold. Irrespective of the efforts of the Chinese authorities, the virus spread rapidly all over the world by travelers, provoking widespread attention by the media and panic. Many previous coronavirus epidemics had been recorded, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recently newly discovered epidemic is named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is caused by SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this virus is antigenically related to the SARS virus (SARS-CoV), which had been detected in 2002, depending on clinical, serological, and molecular findings. There is rapid competition among the researchers to discover the source of the virus, understand the mechanism of the disease development, establish treatment strategies, and determine the factors affecting the incidence of infection and severity of the disease, and focus on the production of a vaccine. Coronaviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome viruses; its genome length varies from 26 to 32 kb. Coronavirus causes mild to severe respiratory disorders. In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown causes were found in Wuhan city, which is located in the Hubei province in China. Chinese health authorities investigated the problem and found that a new virus caused such infection and, using next-generation sequencing, found the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It has been transferred from humans to humans and animals to humans (zoonotic). Coronaviruses cause multiple respiratory problems, varying from common cold to severe infections such as SARS. General symptoms of infection include fatigue, cough, and breathing problems such as shortness of breath, as described by World Health Organization. Serious cases may result in pneumonia, renal failure, and even death. We address current information about the new SARS Coronavirus-2 as well as the COVID-19 disease caused by it in this review.","['Swelum AA', 'Shafi ME', 'Albaqami NM', 'El-Saadony MT', 'Elsify A', 'Abdo M', 'Taha AE', 'Abdel-Moneim AE', 'Al-Gabri NA', 'Almaiman AA', 'Saleh Al-Wajeeh A', 'Tufarelli V', 'Staffa VN', 'Abd El-Hack ME']",2020,7,,Front Vet Sci,"Swelum AA, et al.

This has been also true for the past SARS and MERS, and current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus epidemics. Clinical data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a severe course of COVID-19 more frequently in diabetic than non-diabetic patients. Here we overview the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with this phenomenon. We focus on alterations in the immune cells, especially monocytes and macrophages, involved in innate immune response and inflammatory processes, which differ in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We also describe the DM-related changes in the monocyte/macrophages functions, how they could lead to the severe outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and importantly, if and how they could initiate DM in DM-susceptible patients.","['Kloc M', 'Ghobrial RM', 'Lewicki S', 'Kubiak JZ']",2020,19,2,J Diabetes Metab Disord,"Kloc M, et al.

A 30-year-old previously healthy male diagnosed 11 days earlier with COVID-19 presented with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. The patient was found to have an acute left carotid thrombus with embolic multifocal infarcts throughout the left cerebral hemisphere. He was treated acutely with intravenous heparin however developed gastrointestinal bleeding, prompting discontinuation of anticoagulation. Follow up CT angiography 12 days following his stroke demonstrated complete resolution of the thrombus. Since discharge, the patient has been managed with antiplatelet therapy alone with complete neurologic recovery. Large vessel strokes amongst young patients have been a growing concern during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The use of acute therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation is based on risk assessment. Albeit, the utility of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients remains undetermined.  Prevention of stroke recurrence is a clinical priority for providers treating large vessel stroke patients. More research is required to establish the effectiveness of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","['George J', 'Kirkland Z', 'Lattanzio N', 'Coleman J', 'Stone D']",2020,12,9,Cureus,"George J, et al.

Our understanding of its pathophysiology and potential management was initially extrapolated from previous epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic in more than 80% of patients and requires no additional management; however, the remaining patients progress to pneumonia and hypoxemia with ranging severity, including a smaller group that requires intensive care unit admission. To date, there are no approved treatments for SARS-CoV-2, and current management is focused on supplemental oxygen and supportive care. The antiviral medication remdesivir recently received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe disease. Multiple clinical trials evaluating different treatment modalities such as antivirals, immunomodulators, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies, among others, are still ongoing. We believe that patients present with clinical phenotypes that correlate with the spectrum of disease. Each phenotype may benefit from one or multiple interventions.

One such strategy includes utilizing the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks regarding existing antivirals. Indicating a potential for success, one of the drugs, remdesivir, under repurposing studies, has shown positive results in initial clinical studies. Therefore, in the current work, the authors have attempted to utilize the remdesivir-RdRp complex - RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) being the putative target for remdesivir - to screen a library of the already reported RdRp inhibitor database. Further clustering on the basis of structural features and scoring refinement was performed to filter out false positive hits. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to validate the identification of hits as RdRp inhibitors against novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The results yielded two putative hits which can inhibit RdRp with better potency than remdesivir, subject to further biological evaluation.","['Singh PK', 'Pathania S', 'Rawal RK']",2020,31,11,SAR QSAR Environ Res,"Singh PK, et al.

During pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is noticed that the central nervous system involvement represented a truly significant moment in the history of some COVID-19 patients; indeed, clinical and radiological features published in literature regarding COVID-19 disease are consistent with a neurological involvement. It is also known that histopathological data related to SARS-CoV2 infection have been published with considerable delay, which was even greater for neuropathological information. Moreover, many published data are incomplete, and often the lesions described are not directly related to the action of the virus. In this review, we collected the available radiological and neuropathological information, in order to delineate a more complete picture of the relationship between SARS-Cov2 and brain, focusing our attention on the two most important neuroinvasion routes for the virus. We also highlighted what we consider methodological mistakes both in the autopsy procedures and brain study in COVID-19 deaths. We emphasize the need for a complete study of all the organs in case of autopsy.

Increased mass testing and surveillance are crucial for controlling the disease spread, obtaining better pandemic statistics, and developing realistic epidemiological models. Despite the advantages of nucleic acid- and antigen-based tests such as accuracy, specificity, and non-invasive approaches of sample collection, they can only detect active infections. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are produced by the host immune system within a few days after infection and persist in the blood for at least several weeks after infection resolution. Antibody-based tests have provided a substitute and effective method of ultra-rapid detection for multiple contagious disease outbreaks in the past, including viral diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Thus, although not highly suitable for early diagnosis, antibody-based methods can be utilized to detect past infections hidden in the population, including asymptomatic ones. In an active community spread scenario of a disease that can provide a bigger window for mass detections and a practical approach for continuous surveillance. These factors encouraged researchers to investigate means of improving antibody-based rapid tests and employ them as reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific, and economic tools for COVID-19 mass testing and surveillance. The development and integration of such immunoglobulin-based tests can transform the pandemic diagnosis by moving the same out of the clinics and laboratories into community testing sites and homes. This review discusses the principle, technology, and strategies being used in antibody-based testing at present. It also underlines the immense prospect of immunoglobulin-based testing and the efficacy of repeated planned deployment in pandemic management and post-pandemic sustainable screenings globally.","['Augustine R', 'Das S', 'Hasan A', 'S A', 'Abdul Salam S', 'Augustine P', 'Dalvi YB', 'Varghese R', 'Primavera R', 'Yassine HM', 'Thakor AS', 'Kevadiya BD']",2020,9,10,J Clin Med,"Augustine R, et al.

This agent is presumably involved in RNA chain termination during influenza virus replication, although the molecular interactions underlying its potential impact on the coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remain unclear. We performed in silico studies to elucidate detailed molecular interactions between favipiravir and the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). As a result, no interactions between favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (F-RTP), the active form of favipiravir, and the active sites of RdRps (PB1 proteins) from influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus were found, yet the agent bound to the tunnel of the replication genome of PB1 protein leading to the inhibition of replicated RNA passage. In contrast, F-RTP bound to the active sites of coronavirus RdRp in the presence of the agent and RdRp. Further, the agent bound to the replicated RNA terminus in the presence of agent, magnesium ions, nucleotide triphosphate, and RdRp proteins. These results suggest that favipiravir exhibits distinct mechanisms of action against influenza virus and various coronaviruses.","['Sada M', 'Saraya T', 'Ishii H', 'Okayama K', 'Hayashi Y', 'Tsugawa T', 'Nishina A', 'Murakami K', 'Kuroda M', 'Ryo A', 'Kimura H']",2020,8,10,Microorganisms,"Sada M, et al.

33089477,Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of proportions.,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses mainly affect the respiratory system; however, there are reports of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV causing neurological manifestations. We aimed at discussing the various neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to estimate the prevalence of each of them.
METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WHO database, and ClinicalTrials.gov . Relevant MeSH terms for COVID-19 and neurological manifestations were used. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports were included in the study. To estimate the overall proportion of each neurological manifestations, the study employed meta-analysis of proportions using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of each neurological manifestations are, smell disturbances (35.8%; 95% CI 21.4-50.2), taste disturbances (38.5%; 95%CI 24.0-53.0), myalgia (19.3%; 95% CI 15.1-23.6), headache (14.7%; 95% CI 10.4-18.9), dizziness (6.1%; 95% CI 3.1-9.2), and syncope (1.8%; 95% CI 0.9-4.6). Pooled prevalence of acute cerebrovascular disease was (2.3%; 95%CI 1.0-3.6), of which majority were ischaemic stroke (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9-3.3), followed by haemorrhagic stroke (0.4%; 95% CI 0.2-0.6), and cerebral venous thrombosis (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1-0.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and from the large number of cases reported from all over the world daily, the prevalence of neurological features might increase again.

METHOD: An extensive search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Central databases until the end of March 2020, using keywords related to corticosteroids, COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The main outcome was considered to be the mortality rate, length of stay, virus clearance time, symptom improvement, and lung function improvement. The findings are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
RESULTS: Fifteen paper compromising 5 studies on COVID-19, 8 studies on SARS-CoV and 2 studies on MERS-CoV were included. One study was clinical trial and the rest were cohort. The analyses showed that corticosteroids were not reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 (OR=1.08; 95% CI: 0.34 to 3.50) and SARS-CoV (OR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.3) patients, while they were associated with higher mortality rate of patients with MERS-CoV (OR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.41 to 4.50). Moreover, it appears that corticosteroids administration would not be effective in shortening viral clearance time, length of hospitalization, and duration of relief symptoms following viral severe acute respiratory infections.
CONCLUSION: There is no evidences that corticosteroids are safe and effective on the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 disease is suspected.

GAGs are heterogeneous, conformationally complex, and polydisperse, containing up to 200 monosaccharide units. These complexities make studying GAG conformation a challenge for existing experimental and computational methods. We previously described an algorithm we developed that applies conformational parameters (i.e., all bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nonsulfated chondroitin GAG 20-mers to construct 3-D atomic-resolution models of nonsulfated chondroitin GAGs of arbitrary length. In the current study, we applied our algorithm to other GAGs, including hyaluronan and nonsulfated forms of dermatan, keratan, and heparan and expanded our database of MD-generated GAG conformations. Here, we show that individual glycosidic linkages and monosaccharide rings in 10- and 20-mers of hyaluronan and nonsulfated dermatan, keratan, and heparan behave randomly and independently in MD simulation and, therefore, using a database of MD-generated 20-mer conformations, that our algorithm can construct conformational ensembles of 10- and 20-mers of various GAG types that accurately represent the backbone flexibility seen in MD simulations.

Building on its legacy of managing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), China has played a key role in the scientific community by revealing the viral transmission routes and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and developing novel therapeutic interventions and vaccines. Despite these rapid scientific and technological advances, uncertainties remain in tracing the original sources of infection, determining the routes of transmission and pathogenesis, and addressing the lack of targeted clinical management of COVID-19.

33076827,RepAHR: an improved approach for de novo repeat identification by assembly of the high-frequency reads.,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive sequences account for a large proportion of eukaryotes genomes. Identification of repetitive sequences plays a significant role in many applications, such as structural variation detection and genome assembly. Many existing de novo repeat identification pipelines or tools make use of assembly of the high-frequency k-mers to obtain repeats. However, a certain degree of sequence coverage is required for assemblers to get the desired assemblies. On the other hand, assemblers cut the reads into shorter k-mers for assembly, which may destroy the structure of the repetitive regions. For the above reasons, it is difficult to obtain complete and accurate repetitive regions in the genome by using existing tools.
RESULTS: In this study, we present a new method called RepAHR for de novo repeat identification by assembly of the high-frequency reads. Firstly, RepAHR scans next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to find the high-frequency k-mers. Secondly, RepAHR filters the high-frequency reads from whole NGS reads according to certain rules based on the high-frequency k-mer. Finally, the high-frequency reads are assembled to generate repeats by using SPAdes, which is considered as an outstanding genome assembler with NGS sequences.
CONLUSIONS: We test RepAHR on five data sets, and the experimental results show that RepAHR outperforms RepARK and REPdenovo for detecting repeats in terms of N50, reference alignment ratio, coverage ratio of reference, mask ratio of Repbase and some other metrics.","['Liao X', 'Gao X', 'Zhang X', 'Wu FX', 'Wang J']",2020,21,1,BMC Bioinformatics,"Liao X, et al.

33076027,Jamming and percolation of linear k-mers on honeycomb lattices.,"Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been performed to study the jamming and percolation behavior of elongated objects deposited on two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. The depositing particle is modeled as a linear array of length k (so-called k-mer), maximizing the distance between first and last monomers in the chain. The separation between k-mer units is equal to the lattice constant. Hence, k sites are occupied by a k-mer when adsorbed onto the surface. The adsorption process starts with an initial configuration, where all lattice sites are empty. Then, the sites are occupied following a random sequential adsorption mechanism. The process finishes when the jamming state is reached and no more objects can be deposited due to the absence of empty site clusters of appropriate size and shape. Jamming coverage θ_{j,k} and percolation threshold θ_{c,k} were determined for a wide range of values of k (2≤k≤128). The obtained results shows that (i) θ_{j,k} is a decreasing function with increasing k, being θ_{j,k→∞}=0.6007(6) the limit value for infinitely long k-mers; and (ii) θ_{c,k} has a strong dependence on k. It decreases in the range 2≤k<48, goes through a minimum around k=48, and increases smoothly from k=48 up to the largest studied value of k=128. Finally, the precise determination of the critical exponents ν, β, and γ indicates that the model belongs to the same universality class as 2D standard percolation regardless of the value of k considered.","['Iglesias Panuska GA', 'Centres PM', 'Ramirez-Pastor AJ']",2020,102,3-1,Phys Rev E,"Iglesias Panuska GA, et al.

A great deal of enthusiasm has been generated for the use of these drugs, which are by no means curative but clearly have a favorable impact on lung function decline over time. Amidst a flurry of newly developed and repurposed drugs to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its accompanying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), few have emerged as effective. Historically, survivors of severe viral pneumonia and related acute lung injury with ARDS often have near full recovery of lung function. While the pathological findings of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 can be diverse, current reports have shown significant lung fibrosis predominantly in autopsy studies. There is growing enthusiasm to study anti-fibrotic therapy for inevitable lung fibrosis, and clinical trials are underway using currently FDA-approved anti-fibrotic therapies. Given the relatively favorable outcomes of survivors of virus-mediated ARDS and the low prevalence of clinically meaningful lung fibrosis in survivors, this perspective examines if there is a rationale for testing these repurposed antifibrotic agents in COVID-19-associated lung disease.","['Chaudhary S', 'Natt B', 'Bime C', 'Knox KS', 'Glassberg MK']",2020,7,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Chaudhary S, et al.

33072461,Role of Mass Media and Public Health Communications in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In Dec 2019, a novel pathogen emerged, and within weeks, led to the emergence of the biggest global health crises seen to date. The virus called 'SARS-CoV-2', causes coronavirus disease which was named 'COVID-19' by the World Health Organization (WHO). The speedy spread of this infection globally became a source of public worry and several unknowns regarding this new pathogen created a state of panic. Mass media became the major source of information about the novel coronavirus. Much like the previous pandemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), and MERS (2012), the media significantly contributed to the COVID-19 infodemics. In this review, we analyze the role of mass media and public health communications from December 31, 2019 to July 15, 2020, and make scientific inferences. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights multiple social, cultural, and economic issues arising from the media's arguable role. The racial prejudices linked to the origin of the virus prevented collaborations among scientists to find a solution. Media coverage of coronavirus news during geographical lockdowns, extended quarantines, and financial and social hardships induced fear and caused psychological stress. Domestic and elderly abuse upsurged. The unscientific cures and unverified medicines endorsed by the politicians and fake doctors proved harmful. The media played a worldwide role in coronavirus disease tracking and updates through live updates dashboard. The media allowed for timely interventions by the Center For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), enabling a rapid and widespread reach of public health communications. We saw an upward trend for the promotion of health and hygiene practices worldwide by adaption of safe health practices such as increased hand washing, use of face coverings, and social distancing. Media reinforced illness-preventing guidelines daily, and people were encouraged to use telehealth to meet their healthcare needs. Mass media has an imperative role in today's world and it can provide a unified platform for all public health communications, comprehensive healthcare education guidelines, and robust social distancing strategies while still maintaining social connections. It can enable equal access to healthcare, end discrimination, and social stigmatization. The role of media and public health communications must be understood and explored further as they will be an essential tool for combating COVID-19 and future outbreaks.","['Anwar A', 'Malik M', 'Raees V', 'Anwar A']",2020,12,9,Cureus,"Anwar A, et al.

Information about the SARS-CoV2 virus is evolving rapidly. At this time there are no interventions proven to be effective for cases infected with SARS-CoV2. Current knowledge about the clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 infection is reviewed and combined with knowledge about the immunopathogenic mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) to formulate theories and suggest possible therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV2 immunopathogenic mechanisms vary from immunosuppression that initially enables viral escape to a hyperinflammatory immune response. Ultimately therapeutic intervention will be phase dependent.","['Jacques FH', 'Apedaile E']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,Jacques FH and Apedaile E.

33072032,Small Non-coding RNAs: Do They Encode Answers for Controlling SARS-CoV-2 in the Future?,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, which has hit the world since December 2019. It has spread to about 216 countries worldwide, affecting more than 21.7 million people so far. Although clinical trials of a number of promising antiviral drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 are underway, it is hard to predict how successful these drug- or vaccine-based therapeutics are eventually going to be in combating COVID-19 because most of such therapeutic strategies have failed against human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) responsible for similar pandemics in the past. In that context, we would like to bring to scientific attention another group of endogenous regulatory molecules, the small non-coding RNAs, especially the microRNAs, which are found to regulate critical cellular pathways in a number of disease conditions, including RNA viral infections. This review will focus on understanding the effect of altered microRNA expression during coronavirus-mediated infections and how it may provide clues for further exploring the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, with a view of developing RNAi-based therapeutics and biomarkers against COVID-19.","['Bhattacharyya P', 'Biswas SC']",2020,11,,Front Microbiol,Bhattacharyya P and Biswas SC.

33072018,Translation-Associated Mutational U-Pressure in the First ORF of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses.,"Within 4 months of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, more than 250 nucleotide mutations have been detected in ORF1ab of the virus isolated from infected persons from different parts of the globe. These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of non-synonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerate sites toward uracil residues is seen in ORF1ab of all the studied coronaviruses: both in the ORF1a and in the ORF1b translated thanks to the programmed ribosomal frameshifting that has an efficiency of 14 - 45% in different species. A more substantial mutational U-pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b perhaps because ORF1a is translated more frequently than ORF1b. Mutational U-pressure is there even in ORFs that are not translated from genomic RNA plus strands, but the bias is weaker than in ORF1ab. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U-pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring during the RNA plus strand replication and also translation, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the mutational U-pressure that becomes stronger during translation of viral RNA plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analog development for treating COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","['Khrustalev VV', 'Giri R', 'Khrustaleva TA', 'Kapuganti SK', 'Stojarov AN', 'Poboinev VV']",2020,11,,Front Microbiol,"Khrustalev VV, et al.

33071145,Airborne spread of infectious SARS-CoV-2: Moving forward using lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.,"BACKGROUND: Although an increasing body of data reports the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air, this does not correlate to the presence of infectious viruses, thus not evaluating the risk for airborne COVID-19. Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus to assess the stability and viability of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on air samples.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The initial search identified 27 articles. Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, 11 articles were considered relevant. Temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 25 °C and relative humidity ranging from 40% to 50% were reported to have a protective effect on viral viability for airborne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As no data is yet available on the conditions influencing viability for airborne SARS-CoV-2, and given the genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one could extrapolate that the same conditions would apply. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed.
CONCLUSION: Higher temperatures and high relative humidity can have a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viability in the environment, as reported in previous studies to this date. However, these studies are experimental, and do not support the fact that the virus has efficiently spread in the tropical regions of the globe, with other transmission routes such as the contact and droplet ones probably being responsible for the majority of cases reported in these regions, along with other factors such as human mobility patterns and contact rates. Further studies are needed to investigate the extent of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as this would have important implications for public health and infection-control policies.","['da Silva PG', 'Nascimento MSJ', 'Soares RRG', 'Sousa SIV', 'Mesquita JR']",2021,764,,Sci Total Environ,"da Silva PG, et al.

Mild encephalopathy with reversible splenium lesion (MERS) is a syndrome that has been associated with viral infections, but not previously with COVID-19. In this report, we describe the case of a 69 year-old man who presented with fever and encephalopathy in the setting of a diffusion-restricting splenium lesion, initially mimicking an ischemic stroke. A comprehensive infectious workup revealed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies, and a pro-inflammatory laboratory profile characteristic of COVID-19 infection. His symptoms resolved and the brain MRI findings completely normalized on repeat imaging, consistent with MERS. This case suggests that MERS may manifest as an autoimmune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be considered in a patient with evidence of recent COVID-19 infection and the characteristic MERS clinico-radiological syndrome.","['Kakadia B', 'Ahmed J', 'Siegal T', 'Jovin TG', 'Thon JM']",2020,79,,J Clin Neurosci,"Kakadia B, et al.

A general review.,"The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease, a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Its main transmission pathway is through large respiratory droplets, as well as direct and indirect contact. Copper in different formats has been used in research and clinical settings to reduce the risk of bacterial and viral contamination. Therefore, this review aims to search for evidence about the biocidal properties of copper over the Coronaviridae family. A literature review was performed using PubMed and Ovid servers without date or language restrictions. The search was carried out on March 7, 2020, using the following search terms: [Copper] Coronavirus OR CoV OR SARS OR MERS OR Influenza. Copper destroys the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, influenza, and other respiratory viruses, having high potential disinfection in hospitals, communities, and households. Copper can eliminate pathogenic organisms such as coronavirus bacterial strains, influenza virus, HIV, and fungi after a short period of exposure. Copper seems to be an effective and low-cost complementary strategy to help reduce the transmission of several infectious diseases by limiting nosocomial infectious transmission. Copper oxide or nanocompounds may be used as filters, face masks, clothing, and hospital common surfaces to reduce viruses and bacterial incubation.","['Cortes AA', 'Zuñiga JM']",2020,98,4,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,Cortes AA and Zuñiga JM.

33068113,Interpreting k-mer-based signatures for antibiotic resistance prediction.,"BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed the development of several k-mer-based approaches aiming to predict phenotypic traits of bacteria on the basis of their whole-genome sequences. While often convincing in terms of predictive performance, the underlying models are in general not straightforward to interpret, the interplay between the actual genetic determinant and its translation as k-mers being generally hard to decipher.
RESULTS: We propose a simple and computationally efficient strategy allowing one to cope with the high correlation inherent to k-mer-based representations in supervised machine learning models, leading to concise and easily interpretable signatures. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach on the task of predicting the antibiotic resistance profile of a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from its genome, where our method leads to signatures defined as weighted linear combinations of genetic elements that can easily be identified as genuine antibiotic resistance determinants, with state-of-the-art predictive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: By enhancing the interpretability of genomic k-mer-based antibiotic resistance prediction models, our approach improves their clinical utility and hence will facilitate their adoption in routine diagnostics by clinicians and microbiologists. While antibiotic resistance was the motivating application, the method is generic and can be transposed to any other bacterial trait.

33065092,Pharmacological insight into potential therapeutic agents for the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.,"Coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, or spherical viruses, which have a size ranging from 80 to 120 nm. These viruses act on receptors that cause the triggering of fusion. Coronaviruses were first described after cultivation from patients with common colds by Tyrell and Bynoe in 1966. There are various subtypes of coronavirus, 7 out of these can cause infection in human beings. The Alpha subtype is responsible for mild infection showing symptoms or infection without any prevailing symptoms. On the other hand, the beta subtype is responsible for very serious diseases leading to fatality. The lineage of this novel SARS-CoV-2 falls under the beta lineage of the beta coronavirus which has been observed to have a relation to the MERS and SARS coronavirus. In the Huanan market selling seafood, the transition of this novel virus in humans from animals has occurred. It has the potential to be the cause of widespread fatality amongst the people of the globe. On August 16, 2020, the World Health Organisation had reported 2,1294,845 cases which are confirmed to date out of which 413,372 deaths have occurred. Currently, no targeted antiviral vaccines or drugs to fight against COVID-19 infection have been approved for use in humans. This pandemic is fast emerging and drug repurposing is the only ray of hope which can ensure quick availability. Vaccine development is progressing each day with various platforms such as DNA, Live Attenuated Virus, Non-Replicating Viral Vector, Protein Subunit, and RNA, being utilized for the development. COVID-19 attacks the immune system of the host & this can result in a cytokine storm. As a result, various herbal agents both acting as antivirals and immunomodulatory can also be used.

33062267,Convalescent plasma appears efficacious and safe in COVID-19.,"A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology associated with pyrexia and acute respiratory distress was identified in Southern China. Links between the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases and the region's seafood market were noted with the possibility of a new zoonosis and SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the responsible agent. Currently, there are no effective prophylactic or therapeutic options to deal with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) or any other human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a classic adaptive immunotherapy which has been in use for more a century to prevent and treat infections including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 pandemic. Moreover, the World Health Organization regarded CP transfusion as the most promising therapy to treat MERS-CoV. This review was undertaken to demonstrate the potential of CP in the treatment of the pandemic COVID-19 disease. A total of eight studies conducted on CP therapy in patients with COVID-19 were reviewed wherein 25,028 patients above 18 years of age were involved. The vast majority of patients reported favorable outcomes when treated with CP with <1% serious adverse events. Despite its promising beneficial effects in patients severely ill with COVID-19, CP therapy requires further evaluation in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as a lack of satisfactory efficacy data from this area certainly enhances the hesitancy with regard to employing this treatment. In the present circumstances of unsatisfactory pharmacological therapy and the urgent need for a successful curative remedy, considering the use of CP therapy is reasonable provided RCTs confirm its safety, efficacy, and tolerability.","['Khulood D', 'Adil MS', 'Sultana R', 'Nimra']",2020,7,,Ther Adv Infect Dis,"Khulood D, et al.

Their role in traditional medicine, such as the use of a wide range of remedial herbs (thyme, oregano, rosemary, sage, mint, basil), has been well and long known for treating common respiratory problems and cold infections. This review reports on the most highlighted polyphenolic compounds present in up to date literature and their specific antiviral perceptive properties that might enhance the body immunity facing COVID-19, and other viral infectious diseases. In fact, several studies and clinical trials increasingly proved the role of polyphenols in controlling numerous human pathogens including SARS and MERS, which are quite similar to COVID-19 through the enhancement of host immune response against viral infections by different biological mechanisms.

33052573,Neurological manifestations and comorbidity associated with COVID-19: an overview.,"First in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), second in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now the third in the December 2019, emergence of tremendously pathogenic and large-scale epidemic novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has brought the worst conditions into the human inhabitants of the twenty-first century. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the resembling receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly feasts through the respiratory tract. The ACE2 receptor appearances have been also detected upon glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Consequently, cells expressing ACE2, apart from lung and cardiovascular tissue, neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 systemic infection as well as its central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities. Investigation of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 is a step towards better understanding the SARS-CoV-2 infections, inhibiting the additional spread and treating patients affected by this pandemic. In this concern, more clinical examinations for CNS involvement of SARS-CoV-2 are warranted. In this article, we have reviewed the neurological characteristic features of COVID-19 patients, latent neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the comorbidity associated with CNS disorders, and neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19. Therefore, in the perspective of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and healthcare workers should be aware of a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 along with their signs and symptoms for initial diagnosis and isolation of the patients.","['Kumar M', 'Thakur AK']",2020,41,12,Neurol Sci,Kumar M and Thakur AK.

33052338,Alpha 1 Antitrypsin is an Inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2-Priming Protease TMPRSS2.,"UNLABELLED: Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. The main cellular location where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable, therefore hampering the development of targeted treatments. Herein, we identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease-inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS-CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.
SUMMARY: Delivery of extracellular serine protease inhibitors (serpins) such as A1AT has the capacity to reduce SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by binding and inhibiting extracellular proteases on the host cells, thus, inhibiting the first step in SARS-CoV-2 cell cycle (i.e. cell entry).","['Azouz NP', 'Klingler AM', 'Callahan V', 'Akhrymuk IV', 'Elez K', 'Raich L', 'Henry BM', 'Benoit JL', 'Benoit SW', 'Noé F', 'Kehn-Hall K', 'Rothenberg ME']",2020,,,bioRxiv,"Azouz NP, et al.

33051368,From People to Panthera: Natural SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Tigers and Lions at the Bronx Zoo.,"Despite numerous barriers to transmission, zoonoses are the major cause of emerging infectious diseases in humans. Among these, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebolaviruses have killed thousands; the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has killed millions. Zoonoses and human-to-animal cross-species transmission are driven by human actions and have important management, conservation, and public health implications. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which presumably originated from an animal reservoir, has killed more than half a million people around the world and cases continue to rise. In March 2020, New York City was a global epicenter for SARS-CoV-2 infections. During this time, four tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo, NY, developed mild, abnormal respiratory signs. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions and/or feces from all seven animals, live virus in three, and colocalized viral RNA with cellular damage in one. We produced nine whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the animals and keepers and identified different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in the tigers and lions. Epidemiologic and genomic data indicated human-to-tiger transmission.

To date, there are limited studies that systematically compare differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also validate that enhancer activity is largely independent of orientation, at least for our library and designs. Finally, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers and 678-mers and observe sizable differences. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.","['Klein JC', 'Agarwal V', 'Inoue F', 'Keith A', 'Martin B', 'Kircher M', 'Ahituv N', 'Shendure J']",2020,17,11,Nat Methods,"Klein JC, et al.

33046117,Transient blindness associated with mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS): a case report and review of literature.,"BACKGROUND: Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is a clinical-radiological syndrome that can be related to infectious and non-infectious conditions. The most prominent neurological symptoms are disturbance of consciousness, abnormal speech, delirious behavior, seizures, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, facial nerve paralysis and headache. Here we report the case of a child with MERS presenting with the unusual symptom of bilateral transient blindness.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old female patient, with a history of fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and cough lasted for a few days, experienced 3 episodes of transient bilateral loss of vision with difficulty in walking. Her physical examination showed absence of focal neurological and meningeal irritation signs, although responsiveness was slightly impaired. The ophthalmologic evaluation, including a fundus oculi examination, was negative. The electroencephalogram showed slow activity in the temporo-occipital regions, more evident in the right hemisphere. A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed normal glycorrhachia, cell counts, protein levels and IgG index. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a signal alteration in the splenium of the corpus callosum, without contrast enhancement. This finding was suggestive of a reversible cytotoxic lesion. Empiric antiviral treatment with acyclovir and intravenous dexamethasone was initiated. Polymerase chain reaction search for neurotropic viral nucleic acid sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid was negative, while a low number of HHV-6 DNA copies was detected in the blood. Electroencephalograms were repeated in the following days, showing a progressive normalization of the pattern. The child was discharged without symptoms after 10 days of treatment with oral corticosteroids. After 40 days, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a complete normalization of the signal alteration in the splenium of the corpus callosum.
CONCLUSION: Transient blindness was reported as an initial symptom of MERS in a few children. To date, there is no evidence of effective treatment methods. Nonetheless, MERS diagnosis provides pediatricians with valuable prognostic information in order to reassure patients and their families about the good outcome of this disease.","['Tuscano A', 'Zoppo M', 'Canavese C', 'Cogoni M', 'Scolfaro C']",2020,46,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Tuscano A, et al.

33044747,Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.  OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 19 August 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2.0 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, mortality (time to event), improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs).
MAIN RESULTS: This is the second living update of our review. We included 19 studies (2 RCTs, 8 controlled NRSIs, 9 non-controlled NRSIs) with 38,160 participants, of whom 36,081 received convalescent plasma. Two completed RCTs are awaiting assessment (published after 19 August 2020). We identified a further 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are randomised (3 reported in a study registry as already being completed, but without results). We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We did not include data from controlled NRSIs in data synthesis because of critical risk of bias. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to study limitations and results including both potential benefits and harms.  Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19  We included results from two RCTs (both stopped early) with 189 participants, of whom 95 received convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence).  We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases mortality (time to event) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.25; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may result in little to no difference in improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. need for respiratory support) at seven days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may increase improvement of clinical symptoms at up to 15 days (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.11; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence), and at up to 30 days (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43; 2 studies, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence).  No studies reported on quality of life.  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs, eight controlled NRSIs and nine non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of safety data and duration of follow-up was variable. The controlled studies reported on AEs and SAEs only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. Some, but not all, studies included death as a SAE.  The studies did not report the grade of AEs. Fourteen studies (566 participants) reported on AEs of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these AEs were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe AEs (very low-certainty evidence).  17 studies (35,944 participants) assessed SAEs for 20,622 of its participants. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (20,000 participants), which reported on SAEs within the first four hours and within an additional seven days after transfusion. There were 63 deaths, 12 were possibly and one was probably related to transfusion. There were 146 SAEs within four hours and 1136 SAEs within seven days post-transfusion. These were predominantly allergic or respiratory, thrombotic or thromboembolic and cardiac events. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy results in a clinically relevant increased risk of SAEs (low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There was limited information regarding grade 3 and 4 AEs to determine the effect of convalescent plasma therapy on clinically relevant SAEs. In the absence of a control group, we are unable to assess the relative safety of convalescent plasma therapy.  While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies is problematic. The early termination of the first two RCTs investigating convalescent plasma, and the lack of data from 20 studies that have completed or were due to complete at the time of this update illustrate these challenges. Well-designed studies should be prioritised. Moreover, studies should report outcomes in the same way, and should consider the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms.  There are 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are RCTs (three already completed). This is the second living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically.

MeCas12a is also highly specific, and is able to distinguish between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) differing by a single nucleotide. MeCas12a can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples and distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA in simulated samples, thus offering an attractive alternative to other methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases including COVID-19 and MERS.","['Ma P', 'Meng Q', 'Sun B', 'Zhao B', 'Dang L', 'Zhong M', 'Liu S', 'Xu H', 'Mei H', 'Liu J', 'Chi T', 'Yang G', 'Liu M', 'Huang X', 'Wang X']",2020,7,20,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Ma P, et al.

33041173,Glycyrrhizic acid exerts inhibitory activity against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus causes a disease with high infectivity and pathogenicity, especially SARS in 2003, MERS in 2012, and COVID-2019 currently. The spike proteins of these coronaviruses are critical for host cell entry by receptors. Thus, searching for broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus candidates, such as spike protein inhibitors, is vital and desirable due to the mutations in the spike protein. In this study, a combination of computer-aided drug design and biological verification was used to discover active monomers from traditional Chinese medicine. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and NanoBit assays were used to verify the predicated compounds with their binding activities to spike proteins and inhibitory activities on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 interaction, respectively. Furthermore, an MTT assay was used to evaluate the cell toxicities of active compounds. As a result, glycyrrhizic acid (ZZY-44) was found to be the most efficient and nontoxic broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus molecule in vitro, especially, the significant effect on SARS-CoV-2, which provided a theoretical basis for the study of the pharmacodynamic material basis of traditional Chinese medicine against SARS-CoV-2 and offered a lead compound for further structural modification in order to obtain more effective candidate drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","['Yu S', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu J', 'Yao G', 'Zhang P', 'Wang M', 'Zhao Y', 'Lin G', 'Chen H', 'Chen L', 'Zhang J']",2021,85,,Phytomedicine,"Yu S, et al.

33039544,Anti-inflammatory drugs and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: Current knowledge and potential effects on early SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and is genetically related to the 2003 SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronaviruses. Recent studies have reported that similar to SARS-CoV, this strain expresses a spike protein (S) with a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an enzyme expressed mostly in the endothelium, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and lungs - to facilitate viral entry and intracellular replication. Incidentally, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to physiologic control of both ACE and ACE2 expression, and is an essential system utilized by SARS-CoV-2, albeit with varying schools of thought on how it can affect viral entry. In this paper, we will review current knowledge on the RAAS and how it can be affected by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroid use at the organ and cellular levels. We will then discuss the relevance of these interactions on organ-specific ACE2 expression, and provide scientific insights on how this mechanism can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phases of disease. From the standpoint of other known viruses, we will then aim to discuss the potential uses or restrictions of these drugs in viral infection, and provide an update on relevant studies about COVID-19.","['Cabbab ILN', 'Manalo RVM']",2021,291,,Virus Res,Cabbab ILN and Manalo RVM.

33036570,Implications of COVID-19 in high burden countries for HIV/TB: A systematic review of evidence.,"BACKGROUND: The triple burden of COVID-19, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus is one of the major global health challenges of the twenty-first century. In high burden HIV/TB countries, the spread of COVID-19 among people living with HIV is a well-founded concern. A thorough understanding of HIV/TB and COVID-19 pandemics is important as the three diseases interact. This may clarify HIV/TB/COVID-19 as a newly related field. However, several gaps remain in the knowledge of the burden of COVID-19 on patients with TB and HIV. This study was conducted to review different studies on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or COVID-19 associated with HIV/TB co-infection or only TB, to understand the interactions between HIV, TB and COVID-19 and its implications on the burden of the COVID-19 among HIV/TB co-infected or TB patients, screening algorithm and clinical management.
METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of potentially eligible studies published in English in the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, PubMed, Medrxiv, Google scholar and Clinical Trials Registry databases. We included case studies, case series and observational studies published between January, 2002 and July, 2020 in which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 co-infected to HIV/TB or TB in adults. We screened titles, abstracts and full articles for eligibility. Descriptive and meta-analysis were done and results have been presented in graphs and tables.
RESULTS: After removing 95 duplicates, 58 out of 437 articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 14 studies were included for descriptive analysis and seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the descriptive analysis, the meta-analysis showed strong evidence that current TB exposure was high-risk COVID-19 group (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06-2.65, P = 0.03). The pooled of COVID-19/TB severity rate increased from OR 4.50 (95% CI 1.12-18.10, P = 0.03), the recovery rate was high among COVID-19 compared to COVID-19/TB irrespective of HIV status (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.83-2.74, P < 0.001) and the mortality was reduced among non-TB group (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In summary, TB was a risk factor for COVID-19 both in terms of severity and mortality irrespective of HIV status. Structured diagnostic algorithms and clinical management are suggested to improve COVID-19/HIV/TB or COVID-19/TB co-infections outcomes.","['Tamuzi JL', 'Ayele BT', 'Shumba CS', 'Adetokunboh OO', 'Uwimana-Nicol J', 'Haile ZT', 'Inugu J', 'Nyasulu PS']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Tamuzi JL, et al.

33035643,Emergence and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to target host cells and potential therapeutics.,"The emergence of a new coronavirus, in around late December 2019 which had first been reported in Wuhan, China has now developed into a massive threat to global public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease caused by the virus as COVID-19 and the virus which is the culprit was renamed from the initial novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. The person-to-person transmission of this virus is ongoing despite drastic public health mitigation measures such as social distancing and movement restrictions implemented in most countries. Understanding the source of such an infectious pathogen is crucial to develop a means of avoiding transmission and further to develop therapeutic drugs and vaccines. To identify the etiological source of a novel human pathogen is a dynamic process that needs comprehensive and extensive scientific validations, such as observed in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases. In this context, this review is devoted to understanding the taxonomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Herein, we discuss the emergence and molecular mechanisms of both viral infections. Nevertheless, no vaccine or therapeutic drug is yet to be approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, although it is highly likely that new effective medications that target the virus specifically will take years to establish. Therefore, this review reflects the latest repurpose of existing antiviral therapeutic drug choices available to combat SARS-CoV-2.","['Saleemi MA', 'Ahmad B', 'Benchoula K', 'Vohra MS', 'Mea HJ', 'Chong PP', 'Palanisamy NK', 'Wong EH']",2020,85,,Infect Genet Evol,"Saleemi MA, et al.

33035474,T-cell responses to MERS coronavirus infection in people with occupational exposure to dromedary camels in Nigeria: an observational cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remains of global public health concern. Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. Over 70% of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected dromedaries are found in Africa but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa. We aimed to understand whether individuals with exposure to dromedaries in Africa had been infected by MERS-CoV.
METHODS: Workers slaughtering dromedaries in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, were compared with abattoir workers without direct dromedary contact, non-abattoir workers from Kano, and controls from Guangzhou, China. Exposure to dromedaries was ascertained using a questionnaire. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses.
FINDINGS: None of the participants from Nigeria or Guangdong were MERS-CoV seropositive. 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries, but none of 20 abattoir workers without exposure (p=0·0042), ten non-abattoir workers or 24 controls from Guangzhou (p=0·0002) had evidence of MERS-CoV-specific CD4
INTERPRETATION: Zoonotic infection of dromedary-exposed individuals is taking place in Nigeria and suggests that the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa is underestimated. MERS-CoV could therefore adapt to human transmission in Africa rather than the Arabian Peninsula, where attention is currently focused.

33035337,DockCoV2: a drug database against SARS-CoV-2.,"The current state of the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. To fight the novel coronavirus, one of the best-known ways is to block enzymes essential for virus replication. Currently, we know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus encodes about 29 proteins such as spike protein, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Papain-like protease (PLpro), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry and transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming. Thus in order to speed up the discovery of potential drugs, we develop DockCoV2, a drug database for SARS-CoV-2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting the binding affinity of FDA-approved and Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) drugs with the seven proteins mentioned above. This database contains a total of 3,109 drugs. DockCoV2 is easy to use and search against, is well cross-linked to external databases, and provides the state-of-the-art prediction results in one site. Users can download their drug-protein docking data of interest and examine additional drug-related information on DockCoV2. Furthermore, DockCoV2 provides experimental information to help users understand which drugs have already been reported to be effective against MERS or SARS-CoV.

33031558,Finding long tandem repeats in long noisy reads.,"MOTIVATION: Long tandem repeat expansions of more than 1000 nt have been suggested to be associated with diseases, but remain largely unexplored in individual human genomes because read lengths have been too short. However, new long-read sequencing technologies can produce single reads of 10 000 nt or more that can span such repeat expansions, although these long reads have high error rates, of 10-20%, which complicates the detection of repetitive elements. Moreover, most traditional algorithms for finding tandem repeats are designed to find short tandem repeats (<1000 nt) and cannot effectively handle the high error rate of long reads in a reasonable amount of time.
RESULTS: Here, we report an efficient algorithm for solving this problem that takes advantage of the length of the repeat. Namely, a long tandem repeat has hundreds or thousands of approximate copies of the repeated unit, so despite the error rate, many short k-mers will be error-free in many copies of the unit. We exploited this characteristic to develop a method for first estimating regions that could contain a tandem repeat, by analyzing the k-mer frequency distributions of fixed-size windows across the target read, followed by an algorithm that assembles the k-mers of a putative region into the consensus repeat unit by greedily traversing a de Bruijn graph. Experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm largely outperformed Tandem Repeats Finder, a widely used program for finding tandem repeats, in terms of sensitivity.

The aim of this report is to describe the results of treating COVID-19 positive patients with nitazoxanide in three clinical settings: pregnancy/puerperium, hospitalized patients in an Internal Medicine Service and in an ambulatory setting.
METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective follow-up and report of COVID-19 cases in three different situations, pregnant women, hospitalized patients receiving medical attention in an Internal Medicine Service and ambulatory patients residing in Toluca City, and Mexico City.
RESULTS: The experience with a first group of 20 women, pregnant (17) or in immediate puerperium (3) was successful in 18 cases with two unfortunate deaths. The five cases treated in an Internal Medicine service showed a positive outcome with two patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Of the remaining 16 patients treated in an ambulatory setting, all got cured. Nitazoxanide seems to be useful against SARS-CoV-2, not only in an early intervention but also in critical condition as well as in pregnancy without undesired effects for the babies. As an adjunctive therapy budesonide was used that seems to contribute to the clinical improvement.

33029768,An Assessment on Impact of COVID-19 Infection in a Gender Specific Manner.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first time reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and thereafter quickly spread across the globe. Till September 19, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 216 countries and territories. Severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 cause extreme increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that may lead to multi-organ damage and respiratory failure. Currently, no specific treatment and authorized vaccines are available for its treatment. Renin angiotensin system holds a promising role in human physiological system specifically in regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Renin angiotensin system by utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for its cellular entry. This interaction hampers the protective action of ACE2 in the cells and causes injuries to organs due to persistent angiotensin II (Ang-II) level. Patients with certain comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are under the high risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Moreover, evidence obtained from several reports also suggests higher susceptibility of male patients for COVID-19 mortality and other acute viral infections compared to females. Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemiological data also indicate a gender-based preference in disease consequences. The current review addresses the possible mechanisms responsible for higher COVID-19 mortality among male patients. The major underlying aspects that was looked into includes smoking, genetic factors, and the impact of reproductive hormones on immune systems and inflammatory responses. Detailed investigations of this gender disparity could provide insight into the development of patient tailored therapeutic approach which would be helpful in improving the poor outcomes of COVID-19.

33028370,Energy transmission in mechanically ventilated children: a translational study.,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent delivery of tidal mechanical energy (ME) inflicts ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) when stress and strain exceed the limits of tissue tolerance. Mechanical power (MP) is the mathematical description of the ME delivered to the respiratory system over time. It is unknown how ME relates to underlying lung pathology and outcome in mechanically ventilated children. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ME per breath with tidal volume (Vt) normalized to bodyweight correlates with underlying lung pathology and to study the effect of resistance on the ME dissipated to the lung.
METHODS: We analyzed routinely collected demographic, physiological, and laboratory data from deeply sedated and/or paralyzed children < 18 years with and without lung injury. Patients were stratified into respiratory system mechanic subgroups according to the Pediatric Mechanical Ventilation Consensus Conference (PEMVECC) definition. The association between MP, ME, lung pathology, and duration of mechanical ventilation as a primary outcome measure was analyzed adjusting for confounding variables and effect modifiers. The effect of endotracheal tube diameter (ETT) and airway resistance on energy dissipation to the lung was analyzed in a bench model with different lung compliance settings.
RESULTS: Data of 312 patients with a median age of 7.8 (1.7-44.2) months was analyzed. Age (p <  0.001), RR p <  0.001), and Vt <  0.001) were independently associated with MPrs. ME but not MP correlated significantly (p <  0.001) better with lung pathology. Competing risk regression analysis adjusting for PRISM III 24 h score and PEMVECC stratification showed that ME on day 1 or day 2 of MV but not MP was independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. About 33% of all energy generated by the ventilator was transferred to the lung and highly dependent on lung compliance and airway resistance but not on endotracheal tube size (ETT) during pressure control (PC) ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: ME better related to underlying lung pathology and patient outcome than MP. The delivery of generated energy to the lung was not dependent on ETT size during PC ventilation. Further studies are needed to identify injurious MErs thresholds in ventilated children.","['Kneyber MCJ', 'Ilia S', 'Koopman AA', 'van Schelven P', 'van Dijk J', 'Burgerhof JGM', 'Markhorst DG', 'Blokpoel RGT']",2020,24,1,Crit Care,"Kneyber MCJ, et al.

Among the different devices, the conical nanopores obtained by the track-etched technique on a polymer film are stable and easy to functionalize. However, these advantages are hampered by their high aspect ratio that avoids the discrimination of similar samples. Using machine learning, we demonstrate an improved resolution so that it can identify short single- and double-stranded DNA (10- and 40-mers). We have characterized each current blockade event by the relative intensity, dwell time, surface area and both the right and left slope. We show an overlap of the relative current blockade amplitudes and dwell time distributions that prevents their identification. We define the different parameters that characterize the events as features and the type of DNA sample as the target. By applying support-vector machines to discriminate each sample, we show accuracy between 50% and 72% by using two features that distinctly classify the data points. Finally, we achieved an increased accuracy (up to 82%) when five features were implemented.","['Meyer N', 'Janot JM', 'Lepoitevin M', 'Smietana M', 'Vasseur JJ', 'Torrent J', 'Balme S']",2020,10,10,Biosensors (Basel),"Meyer N, et al.

There are no Food and Drug Administration specific therapies approved so far; however, numerous drugs based on varying levels of evidence, in vitro studies and compassionate drug trials are being established as therapeutic agents, especially drugs approved for previous emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov). Numerous active clinical trials for COVID-19 with more than 150 drugs and products are under study. Needless to say, many dermatological drugs are being employed to mitigate this pandemic threat. We aim to review drugs with potential against SARS-Cov-2 widely used in dermatology practice. Additionally, rampant and overzealous use of these drugs as well as introduction of new molecules might lead to emergence of adverse effects associated with these agents. Dermatologists must be on lookout for any cutaneous adverse effects of these drugs.

33026741,Interferon Beta-1b and Lopinavir-Ritonavir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Whether combined treatment with recombinant interferon beta-1b and lopinavir-ritonavir reduces mortality among patients hospitalized with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, adaptive, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients at nine sites in Saudi Arabia. Hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed MERS were randomly assigned to receive recombinant interferon beta-1b plus lopinavir-ritonavir (intervention) or placebo for 14 days. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality, with a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.025. Prespecified subgroup analyses and safety analyses were conducted. Because of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019, the data and safety monitoring board requested an unplanned interim analysis and subsequently recommended the termination of enrollment and the reporting of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were enrolled; 43 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 52 to the placebo group. A total of 12 patients (28%) in the intervention group and 23 (44%) in the placebo group died by day 90. The analysis of the primary outcome, with accounting for the adaptive design, yielded a risk difference of -19 percentage points (upper boundary of the 97.5% confidence interval [CI], -3; one-sided P = 0.024). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, treatment within 7 days after symptom onset led to lower 90-day mortality than use of placebo (relative risk, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.75), whereas later treatment did not. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (9%) in the intervention group and in 10 (19%) in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of recombinant interferon beta-1b and lopinavir-ritonavir led to lower mortality than placebo among patients who had been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed MERS. The effect was greatest when treatment was started within 7 days after symptom onset.

33026601,Use of Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Against Viral Infections.,"Ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI) was used with success in the 1930s and 1940s for a variety of diseases. Despite the success, the lack of understanding of the detailed mechanisms of actions, and the achievements of antibiotics, phased off the use of UBI from the 1950s. The emergence of novel viral infections, from HIV/AIDS to Ebola, from SARS and MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, bring back the attention to this therapeutical opportunity. UBI has a complex virucidal activity, mostly acting on the immune system response. It has effects on lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells), macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipids. The Knott technique was applied for bacterial infections such as tuberculosis to viral infections such as hepatitis or influenza. The more complex extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is also being applied to hematological cancers such as T-cell lymphomas. Further studies of UBI may help to create a useful device that may find applications for novel viruses that are resistant to known antivirals or vaccines, or also bacteria that are resistant to known antibiotics.","['Boretti A', 'Banik B', 'Castelletto S']",2021,60,2,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,"Boretti A, et al.

The first ever cases were detected during the 2019-2020 pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause a common cold or more serious diseases such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndromes (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). They can cause respiratory, lung and gastrointestinal infections with a mild to severe course, sometimes causing the death of the infected person. This new strain has no previous identifiers and its epidemic potential is strongly associated with the absence of immune response/reactivity and immunological memory in the world population, which has never been in contact with this strain before. Most at risk are the elderly, people with pre-existing diseases and/or immunodepressed, dialyzed and transplanted patients, pregnant women, people with debilitating chronic diseases. They are advised to avoid contacts with other people, unless strictly necessary, and to stay away from crowded places, also observing scrupulously the recommendations of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. In this article we detail the recommendations that must be followed by the nursing care staff when dealing with chronic kidney disease patients in dialysis or with kidney transplant patients. We delve into the procedures that are absolutely essential in this context: social distancing of at least one meter, use of PPI, proper dressing and undressing procedures, frequent hand washing and use of gloves, and finally the increase of dedicated and appropriately trained health personnel on ward.","['Apuzzo L', 'Canzi M', 'Zito MP', 'Galli M', 'Dente C', 'Scarpo E', 'Stefanizzi G', 'Del Pin M', 'Fabbri C']",2020,37,5,G Ital Nefrol,"Apuzzo L, et al.

Other than these PCR based methods, some improved methods also exist such as microarray-based techniques, Real time-quantitative PCR, CRISPR-Cas13 based tools but almost all of the available methods have advantages and disadvantages. There are many limitations associated with this method and hence there is a need for a fast, more sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool which can detect a greater number of samples in less time.

While a select agent designation has not been made for SARS-CoV-2, closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses are classified as Risk Group 3 select agents, which restricts use of the live viruses to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification make SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form viruslike particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we report 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and the human reference proteome. We benchmark this observation against other viral-human 8-mer/9-mer peptide identity, which suggests generally similar extents of molecular mimicry for SARS-CoV-2 and many other human viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel human peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 have not been observed in any previous coronavirus strains (HCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS). Furthermore, four of the human 8-mer/9-mer peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis that shows the targeted genes significantly expressed in human lungs and arteries; tissues implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are found to be shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases in functional hotspots, with potential implications for nucleic acid unwinding upon initial infection. This study presents the first scan of human peptide mimicry by SARS-CoV-2, and via its benchmarking against human-viral mimicry more broadly, presents a computational framework for follow-up studies to assay how evolutionary tinkering may relate to zoonosis and herd immunity.","['Venkatakrishnan AJ', 'Kayal N', 'Anand P', 'Badley AD', 'Church GM', 'Soundararajan V']",2020,6,1,Cell Death Discov,"Venkatakrishnan AJ, et al.

Till date, SARS-CoV-2 infection is still spreading, representing a major threat to public health, where several control measures are being practiced in order to culminate its spread. The research and development of new drugs require a lot of funding in addition to being a slow and costly process. As a result, new techniques have been proposed to streamline this process. The repositioning or repurposing of drugs represents an attractive strategy, presenting a promising way to introduce new drugs. Currently, numerous reused drugs are already available in the market and are in practice. In this review, it was observed that the antiviral drugs Entricitabine and Tenofovir display potential therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. Therefore, in silico analyses were considered a potential tool for predicting the effectiveness of drugs, mainly as an effective approach to encourage a complementary in vitro and in vivo antiviral evaluation.","['Rocha YM', 'de Moura GA', 'de Oliveira JR', 'de Figueiredo Nicolete LD', 'Nicolete R']",2021,28,22,Curr Med Chem,"Rocha YM, et al.

At this time, there is no valid vaccine and no proven drug treatment for COVID-19 patients. Current treatments are focused on Oxygenation, Cytokine Storm management, anti-inflammatory effects, and antiviral therapy. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is based on the reaction between a photo-sensitive agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the virus' structures. Recent studies show that nanotechnology can improve aPDT's outcome. The aim of this study was to find out the potential therapeutic effects of Nano antiviral photodynamic therapy on COVID-19.

The aim of this review was to enlighten and summarize the cumulative knowledge regarding the relationship between Coronavirus outbreaks and pregnancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was commenced in order to analyze the maternofetal effects of Coronavirus outbreaks.
RESULTS: Fever and cough are the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 which mostly affects pregnant women in their 3rd trimester with a maternal mortality rate of  0-77%  and fetal and neonatal mortality rates of 1.2%. Fetal demise is common in critically ill pregnant. Pregnancy seems as a worsening factor for SARS and MERS epidemics and both infections affect prominently 3rd trimester pregnancies, although abortion (57%) is a significant risk for cases of early pregnancy. Clinical course of COVID-19, SARS and MERS may be rapid and worse in pregnant women than non-pregnant individuals. Cesarean section is the choice of delivery in most reported women due to mostly obstetrical reasons, although vaginal delivery seems not a worsening factor for the disease.

33015306,One Health in the context of coronavirus outbreaks: A systematic literature review.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens global health thereby causing unprecedented social, economic, and political disruptions. One way to prevent such a pandemic is through interventions at the human-animal-environment interface by using an integrated One Health (OH) approach. This systematic literature review documented the three coronavirus outbreaks, i.e. SARS, MERS, COVID-19, to evaluate the evolution of the OH approach, including the identification of key OH actions taken for prevention, response, and control. The OH understandings identified were categorized into three distinct patterns: institutional coordination and collaboration, OH in action/implementation, and extended OH (i.e. a clear involvement of the environmental domain). Across all studies, OH was most often framed as OH in action/implementation and least often in its extended meaning. Utilizing OH as institutional coordination and collaboration and the extended OH both increased over time. OH actions were classified into twelve sub-groups and further categorized as classical OH actions (i.e. at the human-animal interface), classical OH actions with outcomes to the environment, and extended OH actions. The majority of studies focused on human-animal interaction, giving less attention to the natural and built environment. Different understandings of the OH approach in practice and several practical limitations might hinder current efforts to achieve the operationalization of OH by combining institutional coordination and collaboration with specific OH actions. The actions identified here are a valuable starting point for evaluating the stage of OH development in different settings. This study showed that by moving beyond the classical OH approach and its actions towards a more extended understanding, OH can unfold its entire capacity thereby improving preparedness and mitigating the impacts of the next outbreak.","['Schmiege D', 'Perez Arredondo AM', 'Ntajal J', 'Minetto Gellert Paris J', 'Savi MK', 'Patel K', 'Yasobant S', 'Falkenberg T']",2020,10,,One Health,"Schmiege D, et al.

33013930,Neurological Damage by Coronaviruses: A Catastrophe in the Queue!,"Neurological disorders caused by neuroviral infections are an obvious pathogenic manifestation. However, non-neurotropic viruses or peripheral viral infections pose a considerable challenge as their neuropathological manifestations do not emerge because of primary infection. Their secondary or bystander pathologies develop much later, like a syndrome, during and after the recovery of patients from the primary disease. Massive inflammation caused by peripheral viral infections can trigger multiple neurological anomalies. These neurological damages may range from a general cognitive and motor dysfunction up to a wide spectrum of CNS anomalies, such as Acute Necrotizing Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Encephalitis, Meningitis, anxiety, and other audio-visual disabilities. Peripheral viruses like Measles virus, Enteroviruses, Influenza viruses (HIN1 series), SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 are reported to cause various neurological manifestations in patients and are proven to be neuropathogenic even in cellular and animal model systems. This review presents a comprehensive picture of CNS susceptibilities toward these peripheral viral infections and explains some common underlying themes of their neuropathology in the human brain.","['Mishra R', 'Banerjea AC']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,Mishra R and Banerjea AC.

33013898,Viral Emerging Diseases: Challenges in Developing Vaccination Strategies.,"In the last decades, a number of infectious viruses have emerged from wildlife or re-emerged, generating serious threats to the global health and to the economy worldwide. Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens.","['Trovato M', 'Sartorius R', ""D'Apice L"", 'Manco R', 'De Berardinis P']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Trovato M, et al.

33013745,Evaluation of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Highly Pathogenic Coronaviruses: A Detailed Protocol for a Rapid Evaluation of Neutralizing Antibodies Using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Pseudovirus-Based Assay.,"Emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a serious ongoing threat to the public health worldwide. The spike (S) proteins of CoVs are surface glycoproteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells via attachment to their respective cellular receptors. The S protein is believed to be a major immunogenic component of CoVs and a target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and most candidate vaccines. Development of a safe and convenient assay is thus urgently needed to determine the prevalence of CoVs nAbs in the population, to study immune response in infected individuals, and to aid in vaccines and viral entry inhibitor evaluation. While live virus-based neutralization assays are used as gold standard serological methods to detect and measure nAbs, handling of highly pathogenic live CoVs requires strict bio-containment conditions in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories. On the other hand, use of replication-incompetent pseudoviruses bearing CoVs S proteins could represent a safe and useful method to detect nAbs in serum samples under biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) conditions. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of a safe and convenient assay to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudoviruses to evaluate and measure nAbs against highly pathogenic CoVs. The protocol covers methods to produce VSV pseudovirus bearing the S protein of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pseudovirus titration, and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Such assay could be adapted by different laboratories and researchers working on highly pathogenic CoVs without the need to handle live viruses in the BSL-3 environment.","['Almahboub SA', 'Algaissi A', 'Alfaleh MA', 'ElAssouli MZ', 'Hashem AM']",2020,11,,Front Microbiol,"Almahboub SA, et al.

Nanoparticle based vaccines have proven prodigious prophylaxis of various infectious and non-infectious diseases of human and animal concern. Nano-vaccines outnumber the conventional vaccines by virtue of plasticity in physio-chemical properties and ease of administration. The efficacy of nano-based vaccines may be attributed to the improved antigen stability, minimum immuno-toxicity, sustained release, enhanced immunogenicity and the flexibility of physical features of nanoparticles. Based on these, the nano-based vaccines have potential to evoke both cellular and humoral immune responses. Targeted and highly specific immunological pathways required for solid and long lasting immunity may be achieved with specially engineered nano-vaccines. This review presents an insight into the prevention of infectious diseases (of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin) and non-infectious diseases (cancer, auto-immune diseases) using nano-vaccinology. Additionally, key challenges to the effective utilization of nano-vaccines from bench to clinical settings have been highlighted as research domains for future.","['Zaheer T', 'Pal K', 'Zaheer I']",2021,100,,Process Biochem,"Zaheer T, et al.

The genome of the SARS-CoV-2, isolated from a cluster-patient with a typical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan, had 89% nucleotide identitical with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. It enters the respiratory tract through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors on alveoli. It may induce lung injury through direct cytopathic effect, involving effector T cells or causing sepsis and inducing cytokine storm. With a similar mechanism, it can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). The overall incidence of AKI is 5.1%, and AKI is an independent risk factor for mortality. The hazard ratio of death increases with the increasing severity of AKI.

33011640,Clinically Mild Encephalopathy With a Reversible Splenial Lesion Type 2 Caused by Human Herpesvirus 6 Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Clinically mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is the second commonest cause of encephalopathy. Several pathogens have been detected in patients with MERS type 2, such as influenza A and B, but little is known about the proportion of cases of MERS type 2 with this pathogenesis. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) is the second commonest pathogen causing acute encephalopathy. However, HHV6 has not been previously reported in patients with MERS type 2.
PATIENT DESCRIPTION: In this report, we describe a five-year-old boy with MERS type 2 caused by HHV6 infection. The present case was diagnosed with MERS type 2 caused by HHV6 infection based on the characteristic clinical course, the results of the virus testing, and imaging findings.
DISCUSSION: This is the first description of MERS type 2 caused by HHV6 infection. Although there is a report of MERS type 1 caused by HHV6 infection, there are no detailed reports in the literature about MERS type 2 associated with HHV6 infection. Thus the clinical findings associated with MERS type 2 caused by HHV6 infection are poorly understood. This report indicates that HHV6 can cause MERS type 2.","['Sano F', 'Fukao T', 'Tamaru K', 'Kanemura H', 'Inukai T', 'Aihara M']",2020,113,,Pediatr Neurol,"Sano F, et al.

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most critical step to treat infection. The diagnostic tools are generally molecular methods, serology and viral culture. Recently CRISPR-based method has been investigated to diagnose and treat coronavirus infection. The emergence of 2019-nCoV during the influenza season, has led to the extensive use of antibiotics and neuraminidase enzyme inhibitors, taken orally and intravenously. Currently, antiviral inhibitors of SARS and MERS spike proteins, neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and EK1 peptide are the available therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In addition, Chloroquine, which was previously used for malarial and autoimmune disease, has shown efficacy in the 2019-nCoV infection treatment. In severe hypoxaemia, a combination of antibiotics, α-interferon, lopinavir and mechanical ventilation can effectively mitigate the symptoms. Comprehensive knowledge on the innate and adaptive immune responses, will make it possible to propose potent antiviral drugs with their effective therapeutic measures for the prevention of viral infection. This therapeutic strategy will help patients worldwide to protect themselves against severe and fatal viral infections, that potentially can evolve and develop drug resistance, and to reduce mortality rates.","['Seyed Hosseini E', 'Riahi Kashani N', 'Nikzad H', 'Azadbakht J', 'Hassani Bafrani H', 'Haddad Kashani H']",2020,551,,Virology,"Seyed Hosseini E, et al.

33003377,Targeting the SphK-S1P-SIPR Pathway as a Potential Therapeutic Approach for COVID-19.,"The world is currently experiencing the worst health pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918-the COVID-19 pandemic-caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic is the world's third wake-up call this century. In 2003 and 2012, the world experienced two major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing major respiratory tract infections. At present, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for COVID-19. The severe COVID-19 symptoms of hyperinflammation, catastrophic damage to the vascular endothelium, thrombotic complications, septic shock, brain damage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and acute neurological and psychiatric complications are unprecedented. Many COVID-19 deaths result from the aftermath of hyperinflammatory complications, also referred to as the ""cytokine storm syndrome"", endotheliitus and blood clotting, all with the potential to cause multiorgan dysfunction. The sphingolipid rheostat plays integral roles in viral replication, activation/modulation of the immune response, and importantly in maintaining vasculature integrity, with sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) and its cognate receptors (SIPRs: G-protein-coupled receptors) being key factors in vascular protection against endotheliitus. Hence, modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), S1P, and the S1P receptor pathway may provide significant beneficial effects towards counteracting the life-threatening, acute, and chronic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review provides a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease, prospective vaccines, and current treatments. We then discuss the evidence supporting the targeting of SphK/S1P and S1P receptors in the repertoire of COVID-19 therapies to control viral replication and alleviate the known and emerging acute and chronic symptoms of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a highly infectious pathogen that is genetically similar to SARS-CoV. Similar to other recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients typically present with fever, dry cough, fatigue, and lower respiratory system dysfunction, including high rates of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, a rapidly accumulating set of clinical studies revealed atypical symptoms of COVID-19 that involve neurological signs, including headaches, anosmia, nausea, dysgeusia, damage to respiratory centers, and cerebral infarction. These unexpected findings may provide important clues regarding the pathological sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

32998572,An initiative to evaluate the safety of maternal bonding in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, the world faced three epidemics caused by novel coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that started in late 2019. Despite a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies, other aspects, such as mode of delivery, vertical transmission, and maternal bonding, remain controversial. The question we faced upon the decision to separate the neonates of SARS-CoV-2 positive mother is whether we follow the principle of ""do no harm""?
METHODS: This is a quality improvement project that analyzed all cases of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies that delivered at a major health care system from March 1, 2020 to June, 1 2020. The article was prepared following Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) 2.0 guidelines. Data were prospectively collected and entered into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Maternal bonding was defined by events such as rooming-in, skin to skin contact (STSC), and breastfeeding. Descriptive analysis was performed using the same software platform.
INTERVENTION: We compared neonatal transmission rates between those neonates who experienced bonding versus those who were separated.
RESULTS: A total of 1989 women were screened for SARS-CoV-2, from which 86 tested positive. Out of 31 analyzed pregnancies, five women (16%) were admitted to ICU and required mechanical ventilation. From the remaining 26 (84%), 17 (65%) opted for rooming-in, 12 (46%) for STSC, and 16 (61%) fed the infants with breastmilk (11 direct breastfeedings and five pumped the breast milk). All neonatal tests for SARS-CoV-2 returned negative.
CONCLUSION: Our results have illustrated that maternal bonding appears safe in neonates born to mothers that are SARS-CoV-2 positive.","['Cojocaru L', 'Crimmins S', 'Sundararajan S', 'Goetzinger K', 'Elsamadicy E', 'Lankford A', 'Turan OM', 'Turan S']",2022,35,18,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"Cojocaru L, et al.

32998438,Development and Optimization of In-house ELISA for Detection of Human IgG Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 Full Length Spike Protein.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a threat to human health. Despite this, many affected countries are now in the process of gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions that were initially implemented in response to the pandemic. The success of the so-called ""exit strategy"" requires continued surveillance of virus circulation in the community and evaluation of the prevalence of protective immunity among population. Serology tests are valuable tools for these purposes. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) recombinant protein was utilized to develop and optimize an indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) that enables a reliable detection of virus-specific IgG antibody in human sera. Importantly, the performance of this assay was evaluated utilizing micro-neutralization (MN) assay as a reference test. Our developed ELISA offers 100% sensitivity, 98.4% specificity, 98.8% agreement, and high overall accuracy. Moreover, the optical density (OD) values of positive samples significantly correlated with their MN titers. The assay specifically detects human IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2, but not those to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1). The availability of this in-house ELISA protocol would be valuable for various diagnostic and epidemiological applications.","['Alandijany TA', 'El-Kafrawy SA', 'Tolah AM', 'Sohrab SS', 'Faizo AA', 'Hassan AM', 'Alsubhi TL', 'Othman NA', 'Azhar EI']",2020,9,10,Pathogens,"Alandijany TA, et al.

32995797,SARS-CoV-2 induces double-stranded RNA-mediated innate immune responses in respiratory epithelial derived cells and cardiomyocytes.,"UNLABELLED: Coronaviruses are adept at evading host antiviral pathways induced by viral double-stranded RNA, including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR). While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung, and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, while PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549 
SIGNIFICANCE: SARS-CoV-2 emergence in late 2019 led to the COVID-19 pandemic that has had devastating effects on human health and the economy. Early innate immune responses are essential for protection against virus invasion. While inadequate innate immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19 diseases, understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host antiviral pathways is minimal. We have characterized the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infections in relevant respiratory tract derived cells and cardiomyocytes and found that SARS-CoV-2 activates two antiviral pathways, oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR), while inducing minimal levels of interferon. This in contrast to MERS-CoV which inhibits all three pathways. Activation of these pathways may contribute to the distinctive pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","['Li Y', 'Renner DM', 'Comar CE', 'Whelan JN', 'Reyes HM', 'Cardenas-Diaz FL', 'Truitt R', 'Tan LH', 'Dong B', 'Alysandratos KD', 'Huang J', 'Palmer JN', 'Adappa ND', 'Kohanski MA', 'Kotton DN', 'Silverman RH', 'Yang W', 'Morrisey E', 'Cohen NA', 'Weiss SR']",2020,,,bioRxiv,"Li Y, et al.

Here, we combined antigen optimization and nanoparticle display to develop vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. We first displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on three self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. We then identified heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in S2 as the cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2GΔHR2), and displayed S2GΔHR2 on SApNPs. An antibody column specific for the RBD enabled tag-free vaccine purification. In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P). S2GΔHR2 elicited two-fold-higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2GΔHR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers.

COVID-19 is likely to have a complex pathophysiological interplay with the post-transplant patients; one affecting the clinical course and outcome of the other. In the absence of validated data from trials, there is strong dependence on experience based on previous similar epidemics (SARS/MERS), and from consensus based on expert opinions. Despite the fact that our knowledge is rapidly evolving with time, there still is relatively limited objective data on the effect of COVID-19 on the human body. Numerous questions remain unanswered, one of which involves the management of immunosuppression in the post-transplant recipient during this contagion. The core tenet of which continues to be that of establishing an equipoise between infection and rejection.

32993538,Perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia with regard to Covid-19 pandemic and potential associated predictors.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) face considerable mental and physical stress caring for patients with Covid-19. They are at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting this virus. This study aims to assess perception and attitude of HCWs in Saudi Arabia with regard to Covid-19, and to identify potential associated predictors.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, HCWs at three tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia were surveyed via email with an anonymous link, by a concern scale about Covid-19 pandemic during 15-30 April, 2020. Concerns of disease severity, governmental efforts to contain it and disease outcomes were assessed using 32 concern statements in five distinct domains. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of high concern scores.
RESULTS: A total of 844 HCW responded to the survey. Their average age was 40.4 ± 9.5 years, 40.3% were nurses, 58.2% had direct patient contact, and 77.3% were living with others. The majority of participants (72.1%) had overall concern scores of 55 or less out of a maximum score of 96 points, with an overall mean score of 48.5 ± 12.8 reflecting moderate level of concern. Three-fourth of respondents felt at risk of contracting Covid-19 infection at work, 69.1% felt threatened if a colleague contracted Covid-19, 69.9% felt obliged to care for patients infected with Covid-19 while 27.7% did not feel safe at work using the standard precautions available. Nearly all HCWs believed that the government should isolate patients with Covid-19 in specialized hospitals (92.9%), agreed with travel restriction to and/or from areas affected by Covid-19 (94.7%) and felt safe the government implemented curfew and movement restriction periods (93.6%). Predictors of high concern scores were; HCWs of Saudi nationality (p < 0.001), younger age (p = 0.003), undergraduate education (p = 0.044), living with others (p = 0.003) working in the western region (p = 0.003) and direct contact with patients (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high concern among HCWs about Covid-19 and identifies the predictors of those with highest concern levels. To minimize the potential negative impact of those concerns on the performance of HCWs during pandemics, measures are necessary to enhance their protection and to minimize the psychological effect of the perceived risk of infection.","['Abolfotouh MA', 'Almutairi AF', 'BaniMustafa AA', 'Hussein MA']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Abolfotouh MA, et al.

Considering that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are substantial for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the feasibility of preventing the major epidemic has been questioned. Using a two-type branching process model, the present study assesses the feasibility of containing COVID-19 by computing the probability of a major epidemic. We show that if there is a substantial number of asymptomatic transmissions, cutting chains of transmission by means of contact tracing and case isolation would be very challenging without additional interventions, and in particular, untraced cases contribute to lowering the feasibility of containment. Even if isolation of symptomatic cases is conducted swiftly after symptom onset, only secondary transmissions after the symptom onset can be prevented.","['Kinoshita R', 'Anzai A', 'Jung SM', 'Linton NM', 'Miyama T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Hayashi K', 'Suzuki A', 'Yang Y', 'Akhmetzhanov AR', 'Nishiura H']",2020,9,10,J Clin Med,"Kinoshita R, et al.

Here, the emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain, isolated from Shanghai, China, broadly infects porcine, human and chicken cells in vitro. Previously studies by our group and others have confirmed that PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein performs an important role in antagonizing retinoic acid-induced gene I-like receptor (RLR) activation. However, the mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine type I IFN production remains unclear, especially the downstream of porcine RLR signaling pathway. In the present study, porcine IRF7 (poIRF7) was identified as the interaction protein of PDCoV N protein through LC-MS/MS. The poIRF7 (268-487aa) was the key region of binding PDCoV N protein. Although IRF7 is a conserved functional protein in species, the PDCoV N protein has been confirmed to interact with only poIRF7 and significantly decrease poIRF7-induced type I IFN production, but not human or chicken IRF7. Furthermore, PDCoV N protein can promote poIRF7 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which directly increased the K6, K11, and K29-linked polyubiquitination of poIRF7. Lysine 359 of poIRF7 was a key site in PDCoV N protein inducing poIRF7 degradation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism that PDCoV N protein could species-specifically interact with poIRF7 and then promote its degradation to suppress porcine type I IFN production. The novel findings provide a new insight into PDCoV and other zoonotic coronavirus evading the innate immune response of different species.","['Ji L', 'Wang N', 'Ma J', 'Cheng Y', 'Wang H', 'Sun J', 'Yan Y']",2020,250,,Vet Microbiol,"Ji L, et al.

32988034,High-frequency and tidal period observations of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters by AHI/Himawari-8.,"Driven by tidal forcing and terrestrial inputs, suspended particulate matter (SPM) in shallow coastal waters usually shows high-frequency dynamics. Although specific geostationary satellite ocean color sensors such as the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) can observe SPM hourly eight times in a day from morning to afternoon, it cannot cover the whole semi-diurnal tidal period (∼12 h), and an hourly frequency may be insufficient to witness rapid changes in SPM in highly dynamic coastal waters.

Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. It was also reported to promote SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells. In addition, Resveratrol was demonstrated to be a stimulator of fetal hemoglobin and a potent antioxidant, by trapping reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to bat-SARS-like coronavirus, but was more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic tree of the complete viral genome showed that the virus clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus. The results of the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses did not identify any potential genomic recombination events. Therefore, it seems that the SARS-CoV-2 might be originally hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts of currently unknown wild animal(s). Finally, based on the wide spread of SARS-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future studies should focus more on surveillance of coronaviruses, and measures against the domestication and consumption of wild animals should be implemented.

The effective antiviral activities of natural products have been proved in different studies. In this review, regarding the effective herbal treatments on other coronavirus infections, promising natural products for COVID-19 treatment are suggested. An extensive search in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ISI, and Scopus was done with search words include coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS, MERS, natural product, herb, plant, and extract. The consumption of herbal medicine such as Allium sativum, Camellia sinensis, Zingiber officinale, Nigella sativa, Echinacea spp. Hypericum perforatum, and Glycyrrhiza glabra, Scutellaria baicalensis can improve the immune response. It seems that different types of terpenoids have promising effects in viral replication inhibition and could be introduced for future studies.

Seven coronaviruses have been discovered in humans that can cause mild to lethal respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are the low-risk members of this family and the reason for some common colds. Besides, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, which is also known as 2019-nCoV, are the more dangerous viruses. Due to the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus and its related disease, COVID-19, a reliable, simple, fast, and low-cost detection method is necessary for patient diagnosis and tracking worldwide.

32983181,Experimental Models for the Study of Central Nervous System Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,"INTRODUCTION: The response to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus epidemic requires increased research efforts to expand our knowledge of the disease. Questions related to infection rates and mechanisms, the possibility of reinfection, and potential therapeutic approaches require us not only to use the experimental models previously employed for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses but also to generate new models to respond to urgent questions.
DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the different experimental models used in the study of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 both in different cell lines that have enabled identification of the virus' action mechanisms and in animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and primates) inoculated with the virus. Specifically, we reviewed models used to assess the presence and effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS, including neural cell lines, animal models such as mouse hepatitis virus CoV (especially the 59 strain), and the use of brain organoids.
CONCLUSION: Given the clear need to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its potential effects on the CNS, we must endeavor to obtain new information with cellular or animal models, with an appropriate resemblance between models and human patients.","['Sanclemente-Alaman I', 'Moreno-Jiménez L', 'Benito-Martín MS', 'Canales-Aguirre A', 'Matías-Guiu JA', 'Matías-Guiu J', 'Gómez-Pinedo U']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Sanclemente-Alaman I, et al.

32983025,Toward Understanding Molecular Bases for Biological Diversification of Human Coronaviruses: Present Status and Future Perspectives.,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are of zoonotic origins, and seven distinct HCoVs are currently known to infect humans. While the four seasonal HCoVs appear to be mildly pathogenic and circulate among human populations, the other three designated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe diseases in some cases. The newly identified SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus of COVID-19 that can be deadly, is now spreading worldwide much more efficiently than the other two pathogenic viruses. Despite evident differences in these properties, all HCoVs commonly have an exceptionally large genomic RNA with a rather peculiar gene organization and have the potential to readily alter their biological properties. CoVs are characterized by their biological diversifications, high recombination, and efficient adaptive evolution. We are particularly concerned about the high replication and transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to the emergence of more transmissible and/or pathogenic viruses than ever before. Furthermore, novel variant viruses may appear at any time from the CoV pools actively circulating or persistently being maintained in the animal reservoirs, and from the CoVs in infected human individuals. In this review, we describe knowns of the CoVs and then mention their unknowns to clarify the major issues to be addressed. Genome organizations and sequences of numerous CoVs have been determined, and the viruses are presently classified into separate phylogenetic groups.

32982743,Immunosuppressive Drugs and COVID-19: A Review.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive drugs are advantageous or detrimental in patients with COVID-19. Immunosuppressive drugs could be harmful in the initial phase of COVID-19. In this phase, the host immune response is necessary to inhibit viral replication. However, immunosuppressive drugs might have a beneficial effect in the later, more severe phase of COVID-19. In this phase, an overshoot of the host immune response (the ""cytokine storm"") can cause ARDS, multiorgan failure and mortality.
AIM: To summarize the available evidence on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on infection with SARS-CoV-2. The effects of immunosuppressive drugs on similar pandemic coronaviruses may resemble the effects on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we also included studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020181137). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies with a control group and case-control studies concerning humans ≥ 18 years old. We also included

However, scientific knowledge and therapeutic treatment options for this new coronavirus remain limited. Although previous outbreaks of human coronaviruses (CoVs) such as SARS and MERS stimulated research, there are, to date, no antiviral therapeutics available that specifically target these kinds of viruses. Natural compounds with a great diversity of chemical structures may provide an alternative approach for the discovery of new antivirals. In fact, numerous flavonoids were found to have antiviral effects against SARS-and MERS-CoV by mainly inhibiting the enzymes 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). In this review, we specifically focused on the search for flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds, which are proven to be effective against human CoVs. We therefore summarized and analyzed the latest progress in research to identify flavonoids for antiviral therapy and proposed strategies for future work on medicinal plants against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We discovered quercetin, herbacetin, and isobavachalcone as the most promising flavonoids with anti-CoV potential.","['Solnier J', 'Fladerer JP']",2021,20,4,Phytochem Rev,Solnier J and Fladerer JP.

32982062,anti-HCoV: A web resource to collect natural compounds against human coronaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV2, was revealed to be the cause of COVID19, the pandemic disease that already provoked more than 555.324 deaths in the world (July 10, 2020). No vaccine treatment has been defined against SARS-CoV2 or other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including those causing epidemic infections, neither appropriate strategies for prevention and care are yet officially suggested.
SCOPE AND APPROACH: We reviewed scientific literature on natural compounds that were defined as potentially effective against human coronaviruses. Our desk research identified non-chemically modified natural compounds that were shown (in vitro) and/or predicted (in silico) to act against one or more phases of human coronaviruses cell cycle.We selected all available information, merged and annotated the data to define a comprehensive list of natural compounds, describing their chemical classification, the source, the action, the specific target in the viral infection. Our aim was to collect possible compounds for prevention and care against human coronaviruses.
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The definition of appropriate interventions against viral diseases need a comprehensive view on the infection dynamics and on necessary treatments.

32982017,Learning from past pandemic governance: Early response and Public-Private Partnerships in testing of COVID-19 in South Korea.,"How can political elites learn from the past to enhance sustainability of their leadership in a pandemic situation? In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of policy implementation that combines collaboration from public and private sectors (""Public-Private Partnership,"" or PPP) to efficiently deal with urgent crises such as COVID-19. We explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1) that at a later time period (Time 2) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships. Specifically, we examine the case of South Korea, a country in which a prior case of MERS in 2015 (Time 1) had established new policies for pandemic governance. In 2020, such policies were activated by the incumbent leadership in order to contain COVID-19 (Time 2). In particular, for swift and effective management of the pandemic, the South Korean government utilized partnerships with the private sector to exponentially increase the amount of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We apply Policy Feedback Theory to demonstrate the political effects of failed policy precedents and how the political outcomes again shape new policies in a dynamic and cyclical manner. Empirically, we conduct a content analysis of South Korea's pharmaceutical sector in government procurement and exports of test-kits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that as the pandemic situation progressed, South Korea's leader, who had been in danger of plummeting support to the extent that impeachment was discussed as a viable option, drastically shifted public opinion to achieve a landslide victory in general elections in April 2020. Our findings suggest that democratic governments, aware of precedents and wary of their fate in elections, are pressured to perform well in crisis management, and thus turn to rapidly mobilizing public and private means for survival. Such means are evidenced by the case of emergency use authorization (EUA) process for test-kits, in which ""leapfrogging players"" - up-and-coming innovators - that contribute to turning a pandemic crisis into an opportunity for sustainable leadership and for themselves.","['Park J', 'Chung E']",2021,137,,World Dev,Park J and Chung E.

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts at an unprecedented scale. In less than 5 months, more than 12,000 research items and in less than seven months, more than 30,000 items were indexed, while it is projected that the number could exceed 80,000 by the end of 2020, should the current trend continues. With the health crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major coronavirus diseases, i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Interesting recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct cohorts of studies: (i) studies linked to public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies on chemical constitution of the virus; and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with category (i) seem to have been relatively earliest to emerge, they have overall received relatively smaller number of citations compared to publications the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been disseminated across a broader variety of journals and across a more diverse range of subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak as well as the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MERS. Considering the speed at which the Covid-19-related literature is accumulating, an interesting dimension that warrants further exploration could be to assess if the quality and rigour of these publications have been affected.","['Haghani M', 'Bliemer MCJ']",2020,125,3,Scientometrics,"Haghani M and Bliemer MCJ.

32979938,Evasion of Type I Interferon by SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and host immune response determine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but studies evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here, we use unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation, and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds importin Karyopherin α 2 (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We identify two sets of viral proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 suppress IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a SARS-CoV-2 replicon replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2 evasion of IFN-I response and its potential impact on viral transmission and pathogenesis.","['Xia H', 'Cao Z', 'Xie X', 'Zhang X', 'Chen JY', 'Wang H', 'Menachery VD', 'Rajsbaum R', 'Shi PY']",2020,33,1,Cell Rep,"Xia H, et al.

The academic literature indicates that climatic features, specifically temperature and absolute humidity, are very important factors affecting infectious pulmonary disease epidemics - such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); however, the influence of climatic parameters on COVID-19 remains extremely controversial. The goal of this study is to individuate relationships between several climate parameters (temperature, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, solar radiation, evaporation, and wind direction and intensity), local morphological parameters, and new daily positive swabs for COVID-19, which represents the only parameter that can be statistically used to quantify the pandemic. The daily deaths parameter was not considered, because it is not reliable, due to frequent administrative errors. Daily data on meteorological conditions and new cases of COVID-19 were collected for the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy) from 1 March, 2020 to 20 April, 2020. This region exhibited the largest rate of official deaths in the world, with a value of approximately 1700 per million on 30 June 2020. Moreover, the apparent lethality was approximately 17% in this area, mainly due to the considerable housing density and the extensive presence of industrial and craft areas. Both the Mann-Kendall test and multivariate statistical analysis showed that none of the considered climatic variables exhibited statistically significant relationships with the epidemiological evolution of COVID-19, at least during spring months in temperate subcontinental climate areas, with the exception of solar radiation, which was directly related and showed an otherwise low explained variability of approximately 20%. Furthermore, the average temperatures of two highly representative meteorological stations of Molise and Lucania (Southern Italy), the most weakly affected by the pandemic, were approximately 1.5 °C lower than those in Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), again confirming that a significant relationship between the increase in temperature and decrease in virulence from COVID-19 is not evident, at least in Italy.","['Fazzini M', 'Baresi C', 'Bisci C', 'Bna C', 'Cecili A', 'Giuliacci A', 'Illuminati S', 'Pregliasco F', 'Miccadei E']",2020,17,19,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Fazzini M, et al.

32974558,Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) protein vesicular stomatitis virus pseudoparticle neutralization assays offer a reliable alternative to the conventional neutralization assay in human seroepidemiological studies.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic coronavirus that was identified in 2012. MERS-CoV infection in humans can result in an acute, severe respiratory disease and in some cases multi-organ failure; the global mortality rate is approximately 35 %. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies in infected patients. The MERS-CoV microneutralization test (MNt) is the gold standard method for demonstrating prior infection. However, this method requires the use of live MERS-CoV in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. The present work describes the generation and validation of S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype particles (VSV-MERS-CoV-S) in which the VSV glycoprotein G gene has been replaced by the luciferase reporter gene, followed by the establishment of a pseudoparticle-based neutralization test to detect MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies under BSL-2 conditions. Using a panel of human sera from confirmed MERS-CoV patients, the VSV-MERS-CoV particle neutralization assay produced results that were highly comparable to those of the microneutralization test using live MERS-CoV. The results suggest that the VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudotype neutralization assay offers a highly specific, sensitive and safer alternative method to detect MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in human sera.","['Lester S', 'Harcourt J', 'Whitt M', 'Al-Abdely HM', 'Midgley CM', 'Alkhamis AM', 'Aziz Jokhdar HA', 'Assiri AM', 'Tamin A', 'Thornburg N']",2019,1,9,Access Microbiol,"Lester S, et al.

It affected 8,096 humans with a death rate of 11% affecting 21 countries. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein of this virus gets attached with the ACE2 receptors present on human cells. MERS CoV was first reported in 2012 in Middle East, originated from bat and transmitted to humans through camels. MERS CoV has a fatality rate of 35% and last case reported was in 2017 making a total of 1,879 cases worldwide. DPP4 expressed on human cells is the main attaching site for RBD in S protein of MERS CoV. Folding of RBD plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Virus causing COVID-19 was named as SARS CoV-2 due its homology with SARS CoV that emerged in 2003. It has become a pandemic affecting nearly 200 countries in just 3 months' time with a death rate of 2-3% currently. The new virus is fast spreading, but it utilizes the same RBD and ACE2 receptors along with furin present in human cells.

32973779,The 2020 Pandemic: Current SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development.,"Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome infecting animals and humans. Coronaviruses have been described more than 70 years ago and contain many species. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are lethal species caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Currently, a novel strain of HCoVs, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province of China, and has since spread worldwide causing an outbreak in more than 200 countries. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in late January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract causing flu-like symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death. Today, Covid-19 cases almost reaching 9 million, with more than 450 thousand deaths. There is an urgent demand for developing a vaccine since no effective therapies or vaccines have been approved to this day to prevent or minimize the spread of the infection. In this review, we summarized the furthest vaccines in the clinical pipeline.","['Alturki SO', 'Alturki SO', 'Connors J', 'Cusimano G', 'Kutzler MA', 'Izmirly AM', 'Haddad EK']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Alturki SO, et al.

32973527,Harnessing Memory NK Cell to Protect Against COVID-19.,"The worldwide struggle against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a public health crisis continues to sweep across the globe. Up to now, effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 is not available. Therefore, throughout virus infections, a thorough clarification of the virus-host immune system interactions will be most probably helpful to encounter these challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 primarily suppresses the innate immune system, enabling its stable propagation during the early stage of infection. Consequently, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been increasing during infection progression associated with severe lung pathology. It is imperative to consider hyper inflammation in vaccine designing, as vaccine-induced immune responses must have a protective role against infection without leading to immunopathology. Among the front-line responders to viral infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells have immense therapeutic potential, forming a bridge between innate and adaptive responses. A subset of NK cells exhibits putatively increased effector functions against viruses following pathogen-specific and immunization. Memory NK cells have higher cytotoxicity and effector activity, compared with the conventional NK cells. As a pioneering strategy, prompt accumulation and long-term maintenance of these memory NK cells could be an efficacious viral treatment. According to the high prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the world, it remains to be determined whether HCMV adaptive NK cells could play a protective role against this new emerging virus. In addition, the new adaptive-like KIR+NKG2C+ NK cell subset (the adaptive-like lung tissue residue [tr]NK cell) in the context of the respiratory infection at this site could specifically exhibit the expansion upon COVID-19. Another aspect of NK cells we should note, utilizing modified NK cells such as allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells as a state-of-the-art strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. In this line, we speculate introducing NKG2C into chimeric antigen receptors in NK cells might be a potential approach in future viral immunotherapy for emerging viruses. In this contribution, we will briefly discuss the current status and future perspective of NK cells, which provide to successfully exploit NK cell-mediated antiviral activity that may offer important new tools in COVID-19 treatment.","['Soleimanian S', 'Yaghobi R']",2020,11,,Front Pharmacol,Soleimanian S and Yaghobi R.

32969125,Azithromycin in viral infections.,"Azithromycin (AZM) is a synthetic macrolide antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacterial and mycobacterial infections. Due to an additional range of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, it has been given to patients with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is now being investigated as a potential candidate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 having been identified as a candidate therapeutic for this virus by both in vitro and in silico drug screens. To date there are no randomised trial data on its use in any novel coronavirus infection, although a large number of trials are currently in progress. In this review, we summarise data from in vitro, murine and human clinical studies on the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of macrolides, particularly AZM. AZM reduces in vitro replication of several classes of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza A, Zika virus, Ebola, enteroviruses and coronaviruses, via several mechanisms. AZM enhances expression of anti-viral pattern recognition receptors and induction of anti-viral type I and III interferon responses. Of relevance to severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by an over-exuberant innate inflammatory response, AZM also has anti-inflammatory properties including suppression of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF and GM-CSF. AZM inhibits T cells by inhibiting calcineurin signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin activity and NFκB activation. AZM particularly targets granulocytes where it concentrates markedly in lysosomes, particularly affecting accumulation, adhesion, degranulation and apoptosis of neutrophils. Given its proven safety, affordability and global availability, tempered by significant concerns about antimicrobial stewardship, there is an urgent mandate to perform well-designed and conducted randomised clinical trials.","['Oliver ME', 'Hinks TSC']",2021,31,2,Rev Med Virol,Oliver ME and Hinks TSC.

32967955,Cross-Protection against MERS-CoV by Prime-Boost Vaccination Using Viral Spike DNA and Protein.,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory illness and has a high mortality of ∼34%. However, since its discovery in 2012, an effective vaccine has not been developed for it. To develop a vaccine against multiple strains of MERS-CoV, we targeted spike glycoprotein (S) using prime-boost vaccination with DNA and insect cell-expressed recombinant proteins for the receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1, S2, SΔTM, or SΔER. Our S subunits were generated using an S sequence derived from the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain. We examined humoral and cellular immune responses of various combinations with DNA plasmids and recombinant proteins in mice. Mouse sera immunized with SΔER DNA priming/SΔTM protein boosting showed cross-neutralization against 15 variants of S-pseudovirions and the wild-type KOR/KNIH/002 strain. In addition, these immunizations provided full protection against the KOR/KNIH/002 strain challenge in human DPP4 knock-in mice. These findings suggest that vaccination with the S subunits derived from one viral strain can provide cross-protection against variant MERS-CoV strains with mutations in S. DNA priming/protein boosting increased gamma interferon production, while protein-alone immunization did not. The RBD subunit alone was insufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the importance of structural conformation. In conclusion, heterologous DNA priming with protein boosting is an effective way to induce both neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses for MERS-CoV vaccine development. This study suggests a strategy for selecting a suitable platform for developing vaccines against MERS-CoV or other emerging coronaviruses.","['Choi JA', 'Goo J', 'Yang E', 'Jung DI', 'Lee S', 'Rho S', 'Jeong Y', 'Park YS', 'Park H', 'Moon YH', 'Park U', 'Seo SH', 'Lee H', 'Lee JM', 'Cho NH', 'Song M', 'Kim JO']",2020,94,24,J Virol,"Choi JA, et al.

The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism.

32966040,Targeting Polyamines Inhibits Coronavirus Infection by Reducing Cellular Attachment and Entry.,"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations. Since then, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and still actively infects humans. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the resulting disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19) have rapidly and catastrophically spread and highlighted significant limitations to our ability to control and treat infection. Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral ","['Firpo MR', 'Mastrodomenico V', 'Hawkins GM', 'Prot M', 'Levillayer L', 'Gallagher T', 'Simon-Loriere E', 'Mounce BC']",2021,7,6,ACS Infect Dis,"Firpo MR, et al.

32965011,An association between exposure to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and mortality rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to find an association between exposure of a population to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and mortality rate due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across different countries worldwide.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To find the relationship between exposure to MERS-CoV and mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, we collected and analyzed data of three possible factors that may have resulted in an exposure of a population to MERS-CoV: (1) the number of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases reported among 16 countries since 2012; (2) data of MERS-CoV seroprevalence in camels across 23 countries, as working with camels increase risk of exposure to MERS-CoV; (3) data of travel history of people from 51 countries to Saudi Arabia was collected on the assumption that travel to a country where MERS is endemic, such as, Saudi Arabia, could also lead to exposure to MERS-CoV.
RESULTS: We found a significantly lower number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths per million (deaths/M) of a population in countries that are likely to be exposed to MERS-CoV than otherwise (t-stat=3.686, p<0.01). In addition, the number of COVID-19 deaths/M of a population was significantly lower in countries that reported a higher seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in camels than otherwise (t-stat=4.5077, p<0.01). Regression analysis showed that increased travelling history to Saudi Arabia is likely to be associated with a lower mortality rate due to COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence that a population that was at an increased risk of exposure to MERS-CoV had a significantly lower mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, which might be due to cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in that population because of an earlier exposure to MERS-CoV.","['Naeem U', 'Naeem A', 'Naeem MA', 'Naeem K', 'Mujtaba B', 'Mujtaba A', 'Khurshid A']",2020,24,17,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Naeem U, et al.

32964796,Coronavirus interactions with the cellular autophagy machinery.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most recent example of an emergent coronavirus that poses a significant threat to human health. Virus-host interactions play a major role in the viral life cycle and disease pathogenesis, and cellular pathways such as macroautophagy/autophagy prove to be either detrimental or beneficial to viral replication and maturation. Here, we describe the literature over the past twenty years describing autophagy-coronavirus interactions. There is evidence that many coronaviruses induce autophagy, although some of these viruses halt the progression of the pathway prior to autophagic degradation. In contrast, other coronaviruses usurp components of the autophagy pathway in a non-canonical fashion. Cataloging these virus-host interactions is crucial for understanding disease pathogenesis, especially with the global challenge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. With the recognition of autophagy inhibitors, including the controversial drug chloroquine, as possible treatments for COVID-19, understanding how autophagy affects the virus will be critical going forward.

32964627,Immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: A rapid review.,"In this review, we systematically searched and summarized the evidence on the immune response and reinfection rate following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also retrieved studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to assess the long-term duration of antibody responses. A protocol based on Cochrane rapid review methodology was adhered to and databases were searched from 1/1/2000 until 26/5/2020. Of 4744 citations retrieved, 102 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventy-four studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV-2. While the rate and timing of IgM and IgG seroconversion were inconsistent across studies, most seroconverted for IgG within 2 weeks and 100% (N = 62) within 4 weeks. IgG was still detected at the end of follow-up (49-65 days) in all patients (N = 24). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 92%-100% of patients (up to 53 days). It is not clear if reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is possible, with studies more suggestive of intermittent detection of residual RNA. Twenty-five studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV. In general, SARS-CoV-specific IgG was maintained for 1-2 years post-infection and declined thereafter, although one study detected IgG up to 12 years post-infection. Neutralizing antibodies were detected up to 17 years in another study. Three studies on MERS-CoV reported that IgG may be detected up to 2 years. In conclusion, limited early data suggest that most patients seroconvert for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG within 2 weeks. While the long-term duration of antibody responses is unknown, evidence from SARS-CoV studies suggest SARS-CoV-specific IgG is sustained for 1-2 years and declines thereafter.","['O Murchu E', 'Byrne P', 'Walsh KA', 'Carty PG', 'Connolly M', 'De Gascun C', 'Jordan K', 'Keoghan M', ""O'Brien KK"", ""O'Neill M"", 'Smith SM', 'Teljeur C', 'Ryan M', 'Harrington P']",2021,31,2,Rev Med Virol,"O Murchu E, et al.

32963923,In Vitro Virucidal Effect of Intranasally Delivered Chlorpheniramine Maleate Compound Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.,"Background The initial global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic, which is responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and behaves similarly to influenza with a high intranasal viral load. The genome sequence of COVID-19 opened the opportunity for multiple in vitro and clinical trials, but we still do not have a clear path to treatment. Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is a safe and effective antihistamine with potent antiviral activity against various strains of influenza A/B, thus suggesting that CPM has broad antiviral activity. We tested the virucidal potential of CPM in a nasal spray composition currently in development as an anti-allergy medication. Methods The virucidal activity of CPM was tested using viral stock of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain in Vero 76 infected cells.
