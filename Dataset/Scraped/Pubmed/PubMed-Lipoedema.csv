37867193,Racial differences in healthcare expenditures for prevalent multimorbidity combinations in the USA: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to model total charges for the most prevalent multimorbidity combinations in the USA and assess model accuracy across Asian/Pacific Islander, African American, Biracial, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Native American populations.
METHODS: We used Cerner HealthFacts data from 2016 to 2017 to model the cost of previously identified prevalent multimorbidity combinations among 38 major diagnostic categories for cohorts stratified by age (45-64 and 65 +). Examples of prevalent multimorbidity combinations include lipedema with hypertension or hypertension with diabetes. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) with gamma distribution and log link function to total charges for all cohorts and assessed model accuracy using residual analysis. In addition to 38 major diagnostic categories, our adjusted model incorporated demographic, BMI, hospital, and census division information.
RESULTS: The mean ages were 55 (45-64 cohort, N = 333,094) and 75 (65 + cohort, N = 327,260), respectively. We found actual total charges to be highest for African Americans (means $78,544 [45-64], $176,274 [65 +]) and lowest for Hispanics (means $29,597 [45-64], $66,911 [65 +]). African American race was strongly predictive of higher costs (p < 0.05 [45-64]; p < 0.05 [65 +]). Each total charge model had a good fit. With African American as the index race, only Asian/Pacific Islander and Biracial were non-significant in the 45-64 cohort and Biracial in the 65 + cohort. Mean residuals were lowest for Hispanics in both cohorts, highest in African Americans for the 45-64 cohort, and highest in Caucasians for the 65 + cohort. Model accuracy varied substantially by race when multimorbidity grouping was considered. For example, costs were markedly overestimated for 65 + Caucasians with multimorbidity combinations that included heart disease (e.g., hypertension + heart disease and lipidemia + hypertension + heart disease). Additionally, model residuals varied by age/obesity status. For instance, model estimates for Hispanic patients were highly underestimated for most multimorbidity combinations in the 65 + with obesity cohort compared with other age/obesity status groupings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding demonstrates the need for more robust models to ensure the healthcare system can better serve all populations. Future cost modeling efforts will likely benefit from factoring in multimorbidity type stratified by race/ethnicity and age/obesity status.","['Alshakhs M', 'Goedecke PJ', 'Bailey JE', 'Madlock-Brown C']",2023,21,1,BMC Med,"Alshakhs M, et al.

37844030,National survey of patient symptoms and therapies among 707 women with a lipedema phenotype in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: National survey data exploring the patient experience with lipedema are lacking.
METHODS: We conducted national surveys from 2016 to 2022 of women with lipedema as well as female controls. Surveys collected information on symptomatology, pain, and therapies. We performed logistic regression comparing symptoms among those with lipedema versus controls adjusting for age and BMI.
RESULTS: A total of 707 women with lipedema and 216 controls completed the surveys. Those with lipedema had a mean age of 48.6 years and mean BMI of 40.9 kg/m
CONCLUSION: In a large, national, symptom survey, women with lipedema reported excess pain, swelling, and fat in the legs along with numerous symptoms beyond those classically described. Symptom responses to common therapies remain understudied.","['Aday AW', 'Donahue PM', 'Garza M', 'Crain VN', 'Patel NJ', 'Beasley JA', 'Herbst KL', 'Beckman JA', 'Taylor SL', 'Pridmore M', 'Chen SC', 'Donahue MJ', 'Crescenzi R']",2023,,,Vasc Med,"Aday AW, et al.

37811191,Management of Lipedema Beyond Liposuction: A Case Study.,"Lipedema is a pathologic accumulation of adipose tissue in the subcutaneous layer of the extremities. This connective tissue disorder, which predominately affects females, is often misdiagnosed despite an incidence of ∼11%. Misdiagnosis often leads to delays in appropriate treatment, further increasing the morbidity of the condition. The authors report their facilities' experience in treating a patient with lipedema, requiring multiple surgical interventions involving liposuction and skin debulking to achieve desired aesthetic outcomes. The patient presented to the plastic surgery clinic with severe lipedema of the bilateral lower extremities. She previously underwent a panniculectomy and bilateral lower extremity liposuction without achieving the desired aesthetic results. Prior conservative management and liposuction alone were both unsuccessful treatment options and she required debulking procedures, along with further liposuction, as definitive management. The patient underwent 2 procedures at the clinic, both consisting of liposuction and panniculectomy of the lower extremities and buttocks. The procedures were conducted 1 year apart but were able to achieve the patient's desired aesthetics goals. Management of lipedema can be challenging, but not impossible. This case report shows that local excision is a viable option for treatment if minimally invasive options yield limited results.","['Bouillon VN', 'Hinson CS', 'Hu M', 'Brooks RM']",2023,5,,Aesthet Surg J Open Forum,"Bouillon VN, et al.

37789512,Diagnostic imaging in lipedema: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing lipedema remains a challenge due to its heterogeneous presentation, co-existing diseases, and the lack of objective diagnostic imaging.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to outline the currently available diagnostic imaging methods to characterize lipedema in the legs along with their diagnostic performance.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. The quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) tool was used for quality assessment.
RESULTS: Thirty-two studies describing a total of 1154 patients with lipedema were included for final analysis. Features for lipedema have been defined using ultrasound (increased subcutaneous adipose tissue), lymphoscintigraphy (slowing of the lymphatic flow and a frequent asymmetry between the lower extremities), computed tomography (symmetrical bilateral soft tissue enlargement without either skin thickening or subcutaneous edema), magnetic resonance imaging (increased subcutaneous adipose tissue), MR lymphangiography (enlarged lymphatic vessels up to a diameter of 2 mm), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (fat mass in the legs adjusted for body mass index (BMI) ≥ 0.46 or fat mass in the legs adjusted for total fat mass ≥ 0.384).
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of currently available imaging modalities for assessing lipedema is limited. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of each imaging modality. Imaging techniques focusing on the pathogenesis of the disease are needed.","['van la Parra RFD', 'Deconinck C', 'Krug B']",2023,,,Obes Rev,"van la Parra RFD, et al.

AIM: To raise awareness about Aromatase Inhibitor (AI), Letrozole.
METHODS: Possible causes, including Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, Ribociclib and Axillary Web Syndrome, were explored and reviewed, and potential effective treatment options were then sought. New cases presented, which discounted each theory, until Letrozole was suspected.
RESULTS: Inflammatory oedemas were explained by the mechanisms-of-action relating to Aromatase Inhibitor Associated Musculoskeletal Syndrome (AIMSS), the severity of which, especially for slim women with oestrogen deprivation, causes almost 50% of women to cease treatment within 6 months; risking disease reoccurrence.
CONCLUSION: Permissions were gained, a table was collated and sent to referring consultants, requesting risk/benefit analysis of Letrozole with a medication review.

37686378,Enhanced Angiogenesis in HUVECs Preconditioned with Media from Adipocytes Differentiated from Lipedema Adipose Stem Cells In Vitro.,"Lipedema is a connective tissue disorder characterized by increased dilated blood vessels (angiogenesis), inflammation, and fibrosis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. This project aims to gain insights into the angiogenic processes in lipedema using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model. HUVECs were cultured in conditioned media (CM) collected from healthy (non-lipedema, AQH) and lipedema adipocytes (AQL). The impacts on the expression levels of multiple endothelial and angiogenic markers [CD31, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), NOTCH and its ligands] in HUVECs were investigated. The data demonstrate an increased expression of CD31 and ANG2 at both the gene and protein levels in HUVECs treated with AQL CM in 2D monolayer and 3D cultures compared to untreated cells. Furthermore, the expression of the vWF, NOTCH 4, and DELTA-4 genes decreased. In contrast, increased VEGF, MMP9, and HGF gene expression was detected in HUVECs treated with AQL CM cultured in a 2D monolayer. In addition, the results of a tube formation assay indicate that the number of formed tubes increased in lipedema-treated HUVECs cultured in a 2D monolayer. Together, the data indicate that lipedema adipocyte-CM promotes angiogenesis through paracrine-driven mechanisms.","['Al-Ghadban S', 'Walczak SG', 'Isern SU', 'Martin EC', 'Herbst KL', 'Bunnell BA']",2023,24,17,Int J Mol Sci,"Al-Ghadban S, et al.

37681787,"The Advanced Care Study: Current Status of Lipedema in Spain, A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study.","INTRODUCTION: The pathologic features of fatty tissue in lipedema are often challenging to diagnose, thus allowing for variable bias and leading to underdiagnosis. Lipedema is a disease that is currently little known worldwide, but it represents a public health problem and demands immediate, well-directed healthcare. Insufficient scientific information limits medical action, which limits making diagnoses and addressing an adequate multidisciplinary treatment. This study aims to evaluate the current state of lipedema in Spain to contextualize the disease's pathophysiological characteristics and thus achieve a consensus that unifies and defines its diagnostic criteria and medical management. Likewise, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the various treatments applied to the study patients and to evaluate the consequences of the pandemic related to this disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present work is a descriptive, cross-sectional study that analyzed online questionnaires. It was applied to 1069 patients and collected over 9 months between 2021 and 2022. The questionnaires were distributed to the leading national and regional associations of patients affected by lipedema. The study included all patients in a group who had a diagnosis of lipedema and in a group of undiagnosed patients with six or more symptoms. The variables analyzed were age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), type of lipedema (according to Schingale's classification), symptoms (according to Wolf's classification, modified by Herbst), and treatments performed (physiotherapy, compression garments, sports, diet, radiofrequency, mesotherapy, and surgery), associated with the score given by the patients regarding the degree of improvement in their disease with each of these treatments.
RESULTS: There were 967 women and 2 men between 18 and 75 years old (mean of 38.5 years); a body weight between 33 and 150 kg (mean 75.8 kg); a height between 144 and 180 cm (mean 164 cm); and an average body mass index (BMI) of 28.1. The most common kind of lipedema in our study population was type III (affecting the hips, thighs, and calves). The treatment that individually improved patients' quality of life the most was surgery, only surpassed by the multidisciplinary approach to the disease, including conservative measures.
CONCLUSIONS: With this study, we can conclude that, in Spain, there is a real problem associated with the diagnosis of lipedema, specifying the need to seek this diagnosis actively and propose multidisciplinary management, since it offers the best overall results, of course not without forgetting that surgery is one of the most critical pillars in the approach to this disease. Consistent with the results obtained in this study, criteria were proposed and applied to represent a statistical value at the time of ruling on the clinical diagnosis of lipedema, considering that a patient who presents six or more of these diagnostic criteria, with a very high probability, will have lipedema.","['Carballeira Braña A', 'Poveda Castillo J']",2023,20,17,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Carballeira Braña A and Poveda Castillo J.

37646300,Body mass index vs. waist-to-height-ratio in patients with lipohyperplasia dolorosa (vulgo lipedema).,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema, also known as lipohyperplasia dolorosa (LiDo), is a painful condition affecting women, causing a disproportionate accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the extremities. It carries a lower risk of diabetes and cardio-metabolic dysfunctions compared to obesity, but coincident obesity can complicate diagnosis and treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 607 female LiDo patients, ≥ 18 years, stage 1-3, from Germany, the UK, and Spain. Data were collected as part of the standard initial assessment for LiDo patients.
RESULTS: Based on waist-to-height-ratio (WHtR), 15.2% of patients were underweight, 45.5% normal weight, 22.1% overweight and 17.3% obese. There was a significant association between WHtR category and age group. Body mass index (BMI) is often overestimated, leading to misdiagnosis of obesity.

The primary purpose of this study is to explore the state of knowledge and understanding of lipoedema among Polish women. The secondary aim is to investigate the possible association between knowledge and factors such as BMI, self-reported symptoms, and age.
METHODS: One hundred seventy polish women took part in an online survey study that was posted to social media groups and forums in January 2022. The survey consisted of 12 questions and aimed at assessing the basic knowledge about lipoedema.
RESULTS: The least proportion of participants (4%) could correctly indicate the methods of lipoedema treatment. The accurate definition of lipoedema was indicated only by 7% of women, 12% identified characteristic features of lipoedema, and 37% correctly evaluated lipoedema curability. The greatest proportion of respondents knew the differences between obesity and lipoedema (50%).
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of lipoedema among women is deficient. A significant proportion of the respondents report the occurrence of lipoedema symptoms.

37638423,The value of sonographic microvascular imaging in the diagnosis of lipedema.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a chronic disease marked by symmetric enlargement of painful nodular and fibrotic adipose tissue, predominantly affecting the limbs. Since there is no specific test or biomarker for this condition, years often pass before the diagnosis of lipedema is established for the first time, thereby causing psychosocial distress, including depression, eating disorders, and social isolation. Over the last few years several advanced Doppler-based technologies have been developed to visualize slow flow blood vessels and superficial microvascular architecture undetectable by traditional color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the superficial microvascular anatomy in lipedema patients compared to healthy controls and investigate the clinical significance of the Ultra Micro Angiography (UMA) technology in the diagnosis of lipedema. This new technique may contribute to reduce the diagnostic delay and, eventually, establish and guide treatment strategies toward a better therapeutic outcome in lipedema patients.
METHODS: 25 patients with lipedema and ten healthy controls with no history of lipedema were included in this study. All ultrasound examinations were performed on a novel high-performance ultrasound system (Resona R9/Mindray) using CDFI and the UMA technique.
RESULTS: In all of the patients, Ultra Micro Angiography achieved the excellent visualization of microvascular structures, revealing that most lipedema patients showed grade 3 (n = 13) or grade 2 (n = 8) flow. UMA was superior to CDFI for depicting the microvascular structures.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that UMA imaging characterizes the subcutaneous microvasculature with an unprecedented accuracy. The method has the advantage of being sensitive to small, slow-flowing vessels. This allows for the assessment of the course of vessels and vascular pathologies in great detail. Thus, UMA as a non-invasive diagnostic method can improve diagnostic accuracy in lipedema.","['Kempa S', 'Tessmann V', 'Prantl L', 'Schmid S', 'Müller M', 'Jung EM', 'Tews HC']",2023,,,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,"Kempa S, et al.

37630844,Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet and Carboxytherapy as Personalized Therapeutic Strategies in Lipedema: A Pilot Study.,"In recent years, the use of the ketogenic diet as a proper nutritional treatment for lipedema has been hypothesized in the literature. This is the first clinical study evaluating the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy in lipedema patients. In the present study, it was decided to use a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in combination with carboxytherapy. Since lipedema is characterized by microangiopathy, local hypoxia, and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) deposition, carboxytherapy could improve painful symptoms and skin tone. A total of 22 subjects were included in the data analysis, divided into three groups; 8 patients underwent MMKD combined with carboxytherapy sessions (KDCB group), 8 underwent MMKD nutritional treatment alone (KD group), and 6 patients underwent only carboxytherapy sessions (CB group), for a total of 10 weeks of treatment for all three groups. It was observed that the ketogenic diet effectively induced weight and fat mass loss, including in the limbs, areas considered unresponsive to diet therapy in lipedema patients. However, the best results were obtained from the combination of the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy, which showed improvements in both body composition and skin texture and a reduction in pain, along with an improvement in sleep quality. It would be helpful to conduct a clinical trial on a larger scale and over a more extended period to observe the results in the long term as well.","['Di Renzo L', 'Gualtieri P', 'Zomparelli S', 'De Santis GL', 'Seraceno S', 'Zuena C', 'Frank G', 'Cianci R', 'Centofanti D', 'De Lorenzo A']",2023,15,16,Nutrients,"Di Renzo L, et al.

37575263,"Lipedema stage affects adipocyte hypertrophy, subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation and interstitial fibrosis.","INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a painful subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) disease characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, immune cell recruitment, and fibrosis in the affected areas. These features are thought to contribute to the development and progression of the condition. However, the relationship between lipedema disease stage and the associated adipose tissue changes has not been determined so far.
METHODS: SAT biopsies of 32 lipedema patients, ranging across the pathological stages I to III, and 14 BMI- and age-matched controls were harvested from lipedema-affected thighs and non-symptomatic lower abdominal regions. Histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and expression analysis of markers for adipogenesis, immunomodulation, and fibrosis were performed on the tissue biopsies.
RESULTS: Lipedema patients showed increased adipocyte areas and a stage-dependent shift towards larger cell sizes in the thighs. Lipedema SAT was linked with increased interstitial collagen accumulation in the thighs, but not the lower abdominal region when compared to controls. There was a trend toward progressive SAT fibrosis of the affected thighs with increasing lipedema stage. Elevated gene expression levels of macrophage markers were found for thigh SAT biopsies, but not in the abdominal region. IHC staining of lipedema thigh biopsies confirmed a transiently elevated macrophage polarization towards an M2-like (anti-inflammatory) phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, lipedema SAT is associated with stage-dependent adipocyte hypertrophy, stage-progressive interstitial fibrosis and elevated proportion of M2-like macrophages. The character of the inflammatory response differs from primary obesity and may possess an essential role in the development of lipedema.","['Kruppa P', 'Gohlke S', 'Łapiński K', 'Garcia-Carrizo F', 'Soultoukis GA', 'Infanger M', 'Schulz TJ', 'Ghods M']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Kruppa P, et al.

37510461,Patient-Reported Outcomes of Liposuction for Lipedema Treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema, as a disabling and consequential disease, is gaining more awareness due to its potential omnipresence. Patients suffering from lipedema show a characteristic painful display of symmetric accumulations of adipose tissue. The combination of swelling, pain and decreased quality of life (QOL) is outstanding for the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of liposuction in terms of the QOL for patients and underline important factors of current and pending research regarding surgical therapy of lipoedema.
METHODS: Patients suffering from lipedema prior to and after receiving liposuction at our hospital were included in this study. Patients completed a lipedema-specific self-designed 50 item questionnaire: the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). A linear mixed model was used for outcome analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 511 patients completed a questionnaire prior to the surgery at primary presentation to the hospital and a total number of 56 patients completed a questionnaire after liposuction. A total of 34 of these patients filled in both questionnaires prior to and after surgery. The general characteristics of the disease, such as daily symptoms and psychological health, pertinently improved after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Liposuction can have a general improving effect on the QOL of patients, both in private and professional life. Liposuction may currently be the most evident and promising method in the treatment of lipedema.","['Kirstein F', 'Hamatschek M', 'Knors H', 'Aitzetmueller-Klietz ML', 'Aitzetmueller-Klietz M', 'Wiebringhaus P', 'Varnava C', 'Hirsch T', 'Kueckelhaus M']",2023,11,14,Healthcare (Basel),"Kirstein F, et al.

37473773,[Settlement of the surgical treatment of lipoedema].,"The billing of lipoedema treatment in Germany has come to be heterogeneous. This is due to the decision of the Federal Joint Committee (""Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss"", G-BA) to acknowledge lipoedema stage III as a treatment to be paid by the statutory health insurance funds (""Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung"", GKV) until the completion of the trial study ""LipLeg"" at the end of 2024. Based on this decision, inpatient and outpatient surgical treatment of stage III lipoedema can be billed to the GKV, while the reimbursement of costs for surgical treatment of the other two stages remains a case-by-case decision of the GKV and is currently often rejected. Therefore, treatment costs are often paid by patients themselves. The question of the correct settlement of lipoedema treatment repeatedly arises in the context of legal disputes, which, in turn, repeatedly faces experts and courts with a major challenge. In the following article, the Task Force Lipoedema of the German Society for Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery presents an overview of the various billing modalities and presents a proposal for the correct billing of lipoedema within the framework of the German medical fee schedule (""Gebührenordnung für Ärzte"", GOÄ).","['Motamedi M', 'Gensior MHL', 'Ghods M', 'Boos AM', 'Kruppa P', 'Allert S']",2023,55,4,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Motamedi M, et al.

Methods Leukocyte histocompatibility antigen (HLA) tests of 95 women diagnosed with lipedema were analyzed using non-probabilistic sampling for convenience. The prevalence of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 was compared to the general population. Results The prevalence of HLA-DQ2+ was 47.4%, that of HLA-DQ8+ was 22.2%, the presence of any celiac disease associated HLA (HLA-DQ2+ or HLA-DQ8+) was 61.1%, both HLA (HLA-DQ2+ and HLA-DQ8+) was 7.4%, and the absence of celiac disease associated HLA was 39%. Compared to the general population, there was a significantly higher prevalence of HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8, any HLA, and both HLAs in lipedema patients. The mean weight of patients with HLA-DQ2+ was significantly lower than the overall study population, and their mean BMI significantly differed from the overall mean BMI. Conclusion Lipedema patients seeking medical assistance have a higher prevalence of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8.

37416684,Aesthetic training concept during plastic surgery residency - Opportunity or risk?,"BACKGROUND: Aesthetic surgery training renders to be challenging to acquire sufficient hands-on experience during residency. To resolve this problem, the ""Munich Model"" was established in our clinic: Senior residents perform aesthetic surgeries, supervised by an experienced plastic surgeon while patients benefit from reduced surgery costs. With this model, we hypothesize no significant differences in the postoperative outcome between procedures performed by residents and plastic surgeons.
METHODS: Between August 2012 and December 2017, 481 aesthetic surgeries were included in this retrospective single-center study, of which 283 were performed by residents and 198 by plastic surgeons. Procedures included mastopexy, abdominoplasty, extremity lift, breast reduction, breast augmentation, facial surgery, aesthetic liposuction and lipedema liposuction. Postoperative outcomes were compared regarding surgery time, time of drain removal, inpatient length of stay, duration of wound healing, perioperative blood loss and occurrence of major (surgical revision needed) and minor complications (no surgery needed).
RESULTS: We found no significant differences in aesthetic surgical procedures between residents and board-certified plastic surgeons in the outcome measures of surgery duration, time of drain removal, inpatient length of stay, perioperative blood loss and complication rate, including major and minor complications. Only the inpatient stay was prolonged in aesthetic liposuctions performed by residents.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates comparatively that supervised aesthetic surgeries at a university hospital utilizing the ""Munich Model"" widely meet the specialist surgeons' standards.","['Moog P', 'Jiang J', 'Buchner L', 'Suhova I', 'Schmauss D', 'Machens HG', 'Kükrek H']",2023,9,6,Heliyon,"Moog P, et al.

37390539,Lipedema: What we don't know.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a loose connective tissue disease characterized by a disproportionate accumulation of adipose tissue in the limbs of women. Despite its incidence of 10-20%, lipedema is often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to outline current, available evidence regarding this enigmatic syndrome and gives a synopsis of the subjects that are still unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and Embase searches were conducted to identify relevant articles on lipedema pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.
RESULTS: Lipedema can be considered a disease of the adipocytes or a circulatory disorder of the lymphatics. The relationship between lymphatics and adipose tissue remains controversial. The clinical distinction between lipedema, lymphedema, phlebolymphedema, and lipolymphedema can be difficult. Diagnoses often coexist, further complicating the diagnosis of lipedema, which is currently made on clinical grounds alone. The value of diagnostic imaging studies is unclear. Liposuction appears to be an effective treatment and significantly improves symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosing lipedema remains a challenge due to its heterogeneous presentation, co-existing diseases, and lack of objective diagnostic imaging. Further directions for research include the effect of excess skin resection surgery on lymphatic drainage.","['van la Parra RFD', 'Deconinck C', 'Pirson G', 'Servaes M', 'Fosseprez P']",2023,84,,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,"van la Parra RFD, et al.

37351118,Lymphatic Improvement after Suction-assisted Lipectomy in a Lipedema Patient.,"Lipedema is a chronic and progressive disease that may compromise lymphatic function. Although suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) is considered a safe treatment for lipedema patients, the lymphatic repercussions of this surgical procedure are not fully understood. There is not enough evidence to support the role of SAL in lymphatic function treatment in lipedema. Here, we report a case of lymphatic drainage improvement after lipedema treatment with SAL. Tumescent SAL was performed in the deep subcutaneous layer, preserving the superficial and muscular lymphatic vessels. Pre- and postsurgical lymphoscintigraphy was equally documented under the Genoa protocol. A 34-year-old female patient presented with painful enlargement of the arms and lower limbs caused by lipedema. The patient had undergone conservative treatment with mild improvement in pain and heaviness. Lymphoscintigraphy showed slowed radiotracer progression on the left lower limb, collateral and tortuous lymphatic vessels on the right lower limb, and exuberant radiopharmaceutical concentration on the inguinal chain. Nine months after SAL was performed, the patient underwent another lymphoscintigraphy, which exhibited normalized radiopharmaceutical progression time and normal and symmetrical lymphatic vessel patterns. Collateral lymphatic paths and tortuosity vessels were no longer identified. Furthermore, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and the limb's appearance. Tumescent SAL is not only efficient and safe in treating lipedema, but may also be responsible for improvement in lymphatic drainage in lipedema patients. Additional prospective studies are fundamental to reinforce the current evidence and possibly yield predicting information about the tumescent liposuction eligibility in the improvement of lymphatic drainage.","['Vitorasso CSR', 'Silva ACB', 'Batista BPSN', 'Kamamoto F']",2023,11,6,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,"Vitorasso CSR, et al.

A total of 115 women were classified into two groups: the lipedema group and the overweight/obesity group. Both study groups followed the caloric-restricted LCHF diet for 7 months. A total of 48 women completed the study. A reduction in body weight was observed in both study groups. A significant decrease in triglycerides and an increase in HDL-C concentrations were observed in both study groups. Despite the increase in the concentration of LDL-C observed in the lipedema group, changes in LDL-C differed between individual patients. Improvements in liver parameters, glucose tolerance, and a decrease in fasting insulin levels were observed, although they were less pronounced in the lipedema group than in the overweight/obesity group. Kidney and thyroid functions were similar before and after the LCHF diet in both groups. The LCHF diet may be a valuable nutritional strategy for lipedema and overweight/obese women, with a beneficial effect on weight, glucose profile, liver function, the concentration of triglycerides, and HDL-C and with no effect on kidney and thyroid function.","['Jeziorek M', 'Szuba A', 'Sowicz M', 'Adaszyńska A', 'Kujawa K', 'Chachaj A']",2023,15,11,Nutrients,"Jeziorek M, et al.

Although lipedema has acquired more scientific attention in the last decade, validated diagnosis and treatment still remain challenging for specialists.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this article we evaluate the effect of liposuction on appearance, pain and coexisting diseases of 860 patients with lipedema. Comparison among stages of lipedema pre- and post-liposuction was performed by using t-Tests for independent samples and Kruskal-Wallis-Tests.
RESULTS: Our study demonstrates the positive effect on pain reduction in patients with lipedema after liposuction (NRS 2.24) compared with pre-liposuction pain perception (NRS 6.99) and pain perception of patients with conservative treatment (NRS 6.26). Significant differences were shown in the perception between the stages of lipedema and in the reduction of pain perception by liposuction. Furthermore we examined co-diseases in patients with lipedema, primarily menstruation complaints (43%), sleeplessness (36%) and migraine (35%).
CONCLUSIONS: A progress of lipedema disease leads not only to a change of appearance and proportion but also to a progressive increase of pain. Liposuction shows a significant effect on pain reduction -independent of the patients' stage of lipedema.","['Seefeldt T', 'Aitzetmüller-Klietz ML', 'Kückelhaus M', 'Wiebringhaus P', 'Hirsch T', 'Harati K', 'Aitzetmüller-Klietz MM']",2023,21,6,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Seefeldt T, et al.

Despite the apparent similarities and differences among their phenotypes, a comprehensive histological and molecular comparison does not yet exist, supporting the idea that there is an insufficient understanding of the conditions and particularly of lipohypertrophy. In our study, we performed histological and molecular analysis in anatomically-, BMI- and gender-matched samples of lipedema, lipohypertrophy and secondary lymphedema versus healthy control patients. Hereby, we found a significantly increased epidermal thickness only in patients with lipedema and secondary lymphedema, while significant adipocyte hypertrophy was identified in both lipedema and lipohypertrophy. Interestingly, the assessment of lymphatic vessel morphology showed significantly decreased total area coverage in lipohypertrophy versus the other conditions, while VEGF-D expression was significantly decreased across all conditions. The analysis of junctional genes often associated with permeability indicated a distinct and higher expression only in secondary lymphedema. Finally, the evaluation of the immune cell infiltrate verified the increased CD4+ cell and macrophage infiltration in lymphedema and lipedema respectively, without depicting a distinct immune cell profile in lipohypertrophy.

37018528,Evaluation of Interstitium by Lymphatic Uptake Method in Chronic Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema.,"OBJECTIVE: Symmetrical bilateral lower extremity edema (BLEE) needs to be treated effectively. Finding the cause of this condition increases the success of treatment. Fluid increase in the interstitial space (FIIS) is always present as a cause or a result. Subcutaneously administered nanocolloid is transported by uptake by lymphatic pre-collectors, and this uptake takes place in the interstitium. We aimed to evaluate the interstitium with labeled nanocolloid and contribute to the differential diagnosis in cases with BLEE.
METHODS: Our retrospective study included 74 female patients who underwent lymphoscintigraphy for bilateral lower extremity edema. Technetium 99m (Tc-99m) albumin colloid (nanocolloid), a marked colloidal suspension, was applied subcutaneously to two different areas on the dorsum of both feet with a 26 gauge needle The dose volume administered intradermally is approximately 0.2-0.3 ml, and each injector has 22-25MBq of activity. Siemens E-Cam dual-headed SPECT gamma camera was used for imaging. Dynamic and scanning images were taken with a high-resolution parallel hole collimator. Ankle images were re-evaluated by two nuclear medicine specialists, independent of physical examination and scintigraphy findings.
RESULTS: 74 female patients with bilateral lower extremity edema were divided into two groups based on physical examination and lymphoscintigraphy findings. There were 40 and 34 patients in Groups I and II, respectively. In the physical examination, patients in Group I were evaluated as lymphedema, and patients in Group II were evaluated as lipedema. The main lymphatic channel (MLC) was not observed in any of the patients in Group I in the early images, and the MLC was observed at a low level in the late imaging in 12 patients. The sensitivity of the presence of distal collateral flows (DCF) in the presence of significant MLC in early imaging in demonstrating increased fluid in the interstitial space (FIIS) was calculated as 80%, specificity as 80%, PPV 80%, and NPV 84%.
CONCLUSIONS: While MLC is present in early images, concomitant DCF occurs in cases of lipoedema. The transport of increased lymph fluid production in this group of patients can be covered by the existing MLC. Although MLC is evident, the presence of significant DCF supports the presence of lipedema. It can be used as an important parameter in the diagnosis in early cases where physical examination findings are not evident.","['Ceylan S', 'Yilmaz N']",2023,,,Curr Med Imaging,Ceylan S and Yilmaz N.

37007996,Imaging peripheral lymphatic dysfunction in chronic conditions.,"The lymphatics play important roles in chronic diseases/conditions that comprise the bulk of healthcare worldwide. Yet the ability to routinely image and diagnose lymphatic dysfunction, using commonly available clinical imaging modalities, has been lacking and as a result, the development of effective treatment strategies suffers. Nearly two decades ago, investigational near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging and ICG lymphography were developed as routine diagnostic for clinically evaluating, quantifying, and treating lymphatic dysfunction in cancer-related and primary lymphedema, chronic venous disease, and more recently, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we provide an overview of what these non-invasive technologies have taught us about lymphatic (dys) function and anatomy in human studies and in corollary animal studies of human disease. We summarize by commenting on new impactful clinical frontiers in lymphatic science that remain to be facilitated by imaging.","['Sevick-Muraca EM', 'Fife CE', 'Rasmussen JC']",2023,14,,Front Physiol,"Sevick-Muraca EM, et al.

36970766,Sodium in the skin: a summary of the physiology and a scoping review of disease associations.,"A large and growing body of research suggests that the skin plays an important role in regulating total body sodium, challenging traditional models of sodium homeostasis that focused exclusively on blood pressure and the kidney. In addition, skin sodium may help to prevent water loss and facilitate macrophage-driven antimicrobial host defence, but may also trigger immune dysregulation via upregulation of proinflammatory markers and downregulation of anti-inflammatory processes. We performed a systematic search of PubMed for published literature on skin sodium and disease outcomes and found that skin sodium concentration is increased in patients with cardiometabolic conditions including hypertension, diabetes and end-stage renal disease; autoimmune conditions including multiple sclerosis and systemic sclerosis; and dermatological conditions including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and lipoedema. Several patient characteristics are associated with increased skin sodium concentration including older age and male sex. Animal evidence suggests that increased salt intake results in higher skin sodium levels; however, there are conflicting results from small trials in humans. Additionally, limited data suggest that pharmaceuticals such as diuretics and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors approved for diabetes, as well as haemodialysis may reduce skin sodium levels. In summary, emerging research supports an important role for skin sodium in physiological processes related to osmoregulation and immunity. With the advent of new noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging measurement techniques and continued research on skin sodium, it may emerge as a marker of immune-mediated disease activity or a potential therapeutic target.","['Chattopadhyay A', 'Tully J', 'Shan J', 'Sheikh S', 'Ohliger M', 'Gordon JW', 'Mauro T', 'Abuabara K']",2023,48,7,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Chattopadhyay A, et al.

36912938,Lipedema: The Use of Cultured Adipocytes for Identification of Diagnostic Markers.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema, diagnosed most often in women, is a progressive disease characterized by the disproportionate and symmetrical distribution of adipose tissue, primarily in the extremities. Although numerous results from in vitro and in vivo studies have been published, many questions regarding the pathology and genetic background of lipedema remain unanswered.
METHODS: In this study, adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells were isolated from lipoaspirates derived from nonobese and obese donors with or without lipedema. Growth and morphology, metabolic activity, differentiation potential, and gene expression were evaluated using quantification of lipid accumulation, metabolic activity assay, live-cell imaging, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemical staining.
RESULTS: The adipogenic potential of lipedema and nonlipedema adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells did not rise in parallel with the donors' body mass index and did not differ significantly between groups. However, in vitro differentiated adipocytes from nonobese lipedema donors showed significant upregulation of adipogenic gene expression compared with nonobese controls. All other genes tested were expressed equally in lipedema and nonlipedema adipocytes. The adiponectin/leptin ratio was significantly reduced in adipocytes from obese lipedema donors compared with their nonobese lipedema counterparts. Increased stress fiber-integrated smooth muscle actin was visible in lipedema adipocytes compared with nonlipedema controls and appeared enhanced in adipocytes from obese lipedema donors.
CONCLUSIONS: Not only lipedema per se but also body mass index of donors affect adipogenic gene expression substantially in vitro. The significantly reduced adiponectin/leptin ratio and the increased occurrence of myofibroblast-like cells in obese lipedema adipocyte cultures underscores the importance of attention to the co-occurrence of lipedema and obesity. These are important findings toward accurate diagnosis of lipedema.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study highlights not only the difficulty in lipedema diagnostics but also the tremendous need for further studies on lipedema tissue. Although lipedema might seem to be an underestimated field in plastic and reconstructive surgery, the power it holds to provide better treatment to future patients can not be promoted enough.","['Ernst AM', 'Steiner M', 'Kainz V', 'Tempfer H', 'Spitzer G', 'Plank T', 'Bauer HC', 'Bresgen N', 'Habenbacher A', 'Bauer H', 'Lipp AT']",2023,152,5,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Ernst AM, et al.

36876707,The role of MTHFR polymorphisms in the risk of lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: This study examines the role of MTHFR gene polymorphism (rs1801133) in women with lipedema (LIPPY) body composition parameters compared to a control group (CTRL).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We carried out a study on a sample of 45 LIPPY and 50 women as a CTRL. Body composition parameters were examined by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). A genetic test was performed for the MTHFR polymorphism (rs1801133, 677C>T) using a saliva sample for LIPPY and CTRL groups. Mann-Whitney tests evaluated statistically significant differences between four groups (carriers and non-carriers of the MTHFR polymorphism for LIPPY and CTRL groups) on anthropometric/body composition parameters to identify patterns.
RESULTS: LIPPY showed significantly higher (p<0.05) anthropometric parameters (weight, BMI, waist, abdominal, hip circumferences) and lower waist/hip ratio (p<0.05) compared to the CTRL group. The association between the polymorphism alleles related to the rs1801133 MTHFR gene and the body composition values LIPPY carriers (+) showed an increase in fat tissue of legs and fat region of legs percentage, arm's fat mass (g), leg's fat mass (g), and leg's lean mass (g) (p<0.05) compared to CTRL (+). Lean/fat arms and lean/fat legs were lower (p<0.05) in LIPPY (+) than in CTRL (+). In the LIPPY (+), the risk of developing the lipedema disease was 2.85 times higher (OR=2.85; p<0.05; 95% confidence interval = 0.842-8.625) with respect to LIPPY (-) and CTRL.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence or absence of MTHFR polymorphism offers predictive parameters that could better characterize women with lipedema based on the association between body composition and MTHFR presence.","['Gualtieri P', 'Al-Wadart M', 'De Santis GL', 'Alwadart N', 'Della Morte D', 'Clarke C', 'Best T', 'Salimei C', 'Bigioni G', 'Cianci R', 'De Lorenzo A', 'Di Renzo L']",2023,27,4,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Gualtieri P, et al.

36874317,The Association Between Lipedema and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.,"Introduction The current study aimed to investigate the overlap between symptoms of lipedema and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Lipedema is a condition that causes abnormal fat accumulation and inflammation in the legs and buttocks, often accompanied by edema and pain. ADHD is a common condition characterized by difficulty paying attention and controlling behavior, affecting the social, academic, and occupational quality of life. The study's primary objective was to assess the prevalence of ADHD symptoms in a population of women with lipedema symptoms and compare the clinical characteristics. Method The study used a lipedema screening questionnaire and the Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS-18) to assess the prevalence of ADHD in a sample of 354 female volunteers with or without a prior lipedema diagnosis. Results Of the lipedema group, 100 (77%) were ASRS positive, and 30 (23%) were ASRS negative. In the group without lipedema, 121 (54%) were ASRS positive, and 103 (46%) were ASRS negative, with a relative risk of 1.424 (p<0.0001). Conclusion Our results demonstrate a positive correlation between lipedema and ADHD and suggest that targeted strategies to improve clinic attendance for individuals with ADHD may improve lipedema treatment outcomes. Patients with lipedema symptoms are more likely to have ADHD symptoms.","['Amato AC', 'Amato JL', 'Benitti DA']",2023,15,2,Cureus,"Amato AC, et al.

36814359,Differentiation of lipoedema from bilateral lower limb lymphoedema by imaging assessment of indocyanine green lymphography.,"Lipoedema is characterized by disproportionate painful fat accumulation mostly in the lower limbs. The presence of lymphoedema in lipoedema remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the presence or absence of lymphoedema in the lower limbs of women with lipoedema using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography. A cross-sectional retrospective study was undertaken in women with a clinical diagnosis of lipoedema whose lower limbs were examined with ICG lymphography. MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) ICG staging was used to determine lymphoedema presence and severity. Patient characteristics, ICG lymphography findings, Stemmer sign, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, limb volume and bioimpedance spectroscopy measures were recorded. Forty women with lipoedema underwent ICG lymphography for the lower limbs from January 2018 to July 2022. Thirty-four women (85.0%) were determined by ICG lymphography as MDACC ICG Stage 0 representing normal lymphatics. Of the six women who demonstrated dermal backflow on ICG lymphography, all were determined as ICG Stage 1, four had localized traumatic dermal backflow area at their ankles, one had previously diagnosed with primary lymphoedema and one was classified as lipoedema stage 4. ICG lymphography findings suggested the absence of lymphoedema in a clear majority of women with lower limb lipoedema.","['Mackie H', 'Thompson BM', 'Suami H', 'Heydon-White A', 'Blackwell R', 'Tisdall Blake F', 'Koelmeyer LA']",2023,13,3,Clin Obes,"Mackie H, et al.

36808447,Surgical lymphology. Therapy option for lymphoedema and lipohyperplasia dolorosa.,"The typical therapy in lymphology is conservative. However, reconstructive and resective treatments for primary and secondary lymphoedema as well as resective procedures for lipohyperplasia dolorosa (LiDo) ""lipedema"" have been available for several decades. Each of these procedures has its clear indication and decades of successful history. These therapies represent a paradigm shift in lymphology. In reconstruction, the basic idea is to restore lymph flow, to bypass the obstacle to drainage in the vascular system. The combination procedures of two-stage application of resection and reconstruction in lymphoedema are just as much a ""work in progress"" as the concept of prophylactic lymphatic venous anastomosis (LVA). In the case of resective procedures, the focus is not only on improving the silhouette, but also on reducing the complex decongestion therapy (CDT) and - in the case of LiDo - freedom from pain by improving imaging procedures and the early use of surgical therapy options, the development of higher stages of lymphoedema should be a thing of the past. For LiDo, the application of surgical procedures avoids lifelong CDT and achieves painlessness. All surgical procedures, but especially the resection procedures, are now possible in a way that is gentle on the lymphatic vessels and should be offered to patients with lymphoedema or lipohyperplasia dolorosa without reservation if the goals - reduction in circumference, avoidance of lifelong CDT and, in the case of LiDo, painlessness - cannot be achieved by other means.",['Cornely ME'],2023,21,2,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,Cornely ME.

The illness is often misdiagnosed as obesity, and because of this, women often struggle in meetings with healthcare providers. Few studies have assessed these encounters of younger women with lipedema. The aims of this qualitative study were to explore women's experiences in meetings with healthcare providers and the importance of social support and belonging, with a focus on younger women. Fifteen women with lipedema between the ages of 21 and 47 years (mean age 36.2 years) were interviewed. The results indicated that women felt stigmatized by healthcare providers and that younger women in their 20s and early 30s struggled more often than women of higher age when receiving their diagnosis. The feeling of shame and stigma were also dependent on the woman's resources in handling the illness. The younger women reported that their self-confidence and romantic relationships were challenging. Social support and the feeling of belonging through romantic relationships or support groups were important resources for managing the illness. Highlighting the experiences of women may aid in increasing recognition and knowledge of lipedema.

36605202,A distinct M2 macrophage infiltrate and transcriptomic profile decisively influence adipocyte differentiation in lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic and progressive adipose tissue disorder, characterized by the painful and disproportionate increase of the subcutaneous fat in the lower and/or upper extremities. While distinct immune cell infiltration is a known hallmark of the disease, its role in the onset and development of lipedema remains unclear. To analyze the macrophage composition and involved signaling pathways, anatomically matched lipedema and control tissue samples were collected intra-operatively from gender- and BMI-matched patients, and the Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) was used for Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing. The phenotypic characterization of the immune component of lipedema versus control SVF using CyTOF revealed significantly increased numbers of CD163 macrophages. To gain further insight into this macrophage composition and molecular pathways, RNA sequencing of isolated CD11b+ cells was performed. The analysis suggested a significant modification of distinct gene ontology clusters in lipedema, including cytokine-mediated signaling activity, interleukin-1 receptor activity, extracellular matrix organization, and regulation of androgen receptor signaling. As distinct macrophage populations are known to affect adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism, we evaluated the effect of M2 to M1 macrophage polarization in lipedema using the selective PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI-549. Surprisingly, the differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells with conditioned medium from IPI-549 treated SVF resulted in a significant decreased accumulation of lipids in lipedema versus control SVF. In conclusion, our results indicate that CD163+ macrophages are a critical component in lipedema and re-polarization of lipedema macrophages can normalize the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells ","['Wolf S', 'Rannikko JH', 'Virtakoivu R', 'Cinelli P', 'Felmerer G', 'Burger A', 'Giovanoli P', 'Detmar M', 'Lindenblatt N', 'Hollmén M', 'Gousopoulos E']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Wolf S, et al.

36551837,"Lipedema: Insights into Morphology, Pathophysiology, and Challenges.","Lipedema is an adipofascial disorder that almost exclusively affects women. Lipedema leads to chronic pain, swelling, and other discomforts due to the bilateral and asymmetrical expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Although various distinctive morphological characteristics, such as the hyperproliferation of fat cells, fibrosis, and inflammation, have been characterized in the progression of lipedema, the mechanisms underlying these changes have not yet been fully investigated. In addition, it is challenging to reduce the excessive fat in lipedema patients using conventional weight-loss techniques, such as lifestyle (diet and exercise) changes, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological interventions. Therefore, lipedema patients also go through additional psychosocial distress in the absence of permanent treatment. Research to understand the pathology of lipedema is still in its infancy, but promising markers derived from exosome, cytokine, lipidomic, and metabolomic profiling studies suggest a condition distinct from obesity and lymphedema. Although genetics seems to be a substantial cause of lipedema, due to the small number of patients involved in such studies, the extrapolation of data at a broader scale is challenging. With the current lack of etiology-guided treatments for lipedema, the discovery of new promising biomarkers could provide potential solutions to combat this complex disease. This review aims to address the morphological phenotype of lipedema fat, as well as its unclear pathophysiology, with a primary emphasis on excessive interstitial fluid, extracellular matrix remodeling, and lymphatic and vasculature dysfunction. The potential mechanisms, genetic implications, and proposed biomarkers for lipedema are further discussed in detail. Finally, we mention the challenges related to lipedema and emphasize the prospects of technological interventions to benefit the lipedema community in the future.","['Poojari A', 'Dev K', 'Rabiee A']",2022,10,12,Biomedicines,"Poojari A, et al.

36547681,Complications and their management in the surgical treatment of Lipohyperplasia dolorosa. English version.,"BACKGROUND: There are both conservative and surgical treatment options for Lipohyperplasia dolorosa (LiDo). A procedure that has been established since 1997 is the surgical treatment through Lymphological Liposculpture according to Cornely™.
AIM: After extensive suctioning of the extremities, an extensive subcutaneous wound cavity with a trabecular connective tissue scaffold remains. Nevertheless, surgery-related complications are rare. Postoperative management and administration of antibiotics and antithrombotics are reviewed. The therapies for complications are presented in detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, the frequencies of adverse events in 1400 LiDo surgeries in 2020 were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 47.81 years (range 16-78 years). Symmetrically, 504 outer legs (outer half of the limb [BO]), 504 inner legs (inner half of the limb [BI]), and 392 arms [A] were surgically treated.
RESULTS: Relevant adverse events rarely occurred: infections (1.79%), seromas (0.79%), erysipelas (0.28%), necrosis (0.14%) and deep vein thrombosis (0.07).
DISCUSSION: We were able to reduce the rate of postoperative complications to 3.07% in the Lymphological Liposculpture™ regime for the surgical treatment of LiDo. In their meta-analysis on liposuction, Kanapathy et al. reported an overall incidence of major surgical complications of 3.35%. The overall incidence of minor surgical complications was 11.62%, with seroma (5.51%) being the most common minor complication [26]. Kruppa et al. report that the liposuction procedure including fat removal for esthetic reasons has a complication rate of 9.5%.

METHODS: Prospective, randomized controlled, industry-sponsored, proof-in-principle study comparing PCD plus conservative care (PCD+CC) to CC alone (control). Adult females with bilateral lipedema and secondary lymphedema were randomized to PCD+CC or CC. Outcome measures were lower limb and truncal circumferential measurements, bioimpedance, and quality-of-life, symptom, and pain intensity questionnaires.
RESULTS: Both groups experienced improvements in leg circumference and bioimpedance with more improvement in the PCD+CC group than the CC group. Pain scores of the SF-36 survey and numerical rating scales were improved in the PCD+CC group. Wong-Baker Faces scores showed trends toward improvement in both groups.

36484790,[Diagnosis of leg edema].,"Edema of the lower extremities is always associated with a pathological condition that should be treated, especially in patients with chronic wounds. Because the underlying causes of edema can vary greatly and sometimes be complex, clinical and, if necessary, various diagnostic tests should also be performed. Often, a suspected clinical diagnosis can already be made after clinical inspection with testing of Stemmer's and Godet's signs. Sonographic examination should then be performed as the next diagnostic test. Although measurement techniques such as water plethysmography are currently considered gold standard for volume measurements, they are very complex and prone to error, so that they are rarely used in clinical routine today. In summary, it is recommended to perform a clinical examination, if possible in combination with sonography, for edema diagnosis. Especially at the beginning of the decongestion phase, regular circumferential measurements should be performed and documented. This documentation is of high relevance for evaluation of therapeutic success.","['Stücker M', 'Protz K', 'Eder S', 'Läuchli S', 'Traber J', 'Dissemond J']",2023,74,3,Dermatologie (Heidelb),"Stücker M, et al.

36479502,Dietary supplements for lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic disease that mostly manifests in females as the abnormal distribution of subcutaneous adipose connective tissue, usually coupled with bruising, pain, and edema. Lipedema molecular pathophysiology is currently not clear, but several studies suggest that genetics and hormonal imbalance participate in lipedema pathogenesis. Women with lipedema present in some cases with elevated body mass index, and the appearance of obesity in addition to lipedema, where the obesity can cause serious health issues as in lipedema-free individuals with obesity, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Unlike obesity, lipedema tissue does not respond well to diet or physical exercise alone. Therefore, in this review we discuss the effect of various dietary supplements that, along with diet and physical exercise, cause fat burning and weight loss, and which could potentially be important in the treatment of lipedema. Indeed, an effective fat burner should convert stored fats into energy, mobilize and break down triglycerides in adipocytes, boost metabolism and inhibit lipogenesis. Common ingredients of fat burning supplements are green tea, caffeine, chromium, carnitine, and conjugated linoleic acid. The use of fat burners could act synergistically with a healthy diet and physical exercise for decreasing adipose tissue deposition in patients with lipedema and resolve related health issues. The effects of fat burners in human studies are sometimes contradictory, and further studies should test their effectiveness in treating lipedema.","['Bonetti G', 'Herbst KL', 'Dhuli K', 'Kiani AK', 'Michelini S', 'Michelini S', 'Ceccarini MR', 'Michelini S', 'Ricci M', 'Cestari M', 'Codini M', 'Beccari T', 'Bellinato F', 'Gisondi P', 'Bertelli M']",2022,63,2 Suppl 3,J Prev Med Hyg,"Bonetti G, et al.

In silico drug analysis based on the expression of these genetic biomarkers allows the detection of putative therapeutic agents, which could be used to reverse a pathological gene expression signature. Indeed, a set of bioinformatics tools can increase the accuracy of drug discovery, helping in biomarker identification. Once a drug target is identified, in vitro cell line models of disease are used to evaluate and validate the therapeutic potential of putative drugs and novel natural molecules. This study describes the development of efficacious PCR primers that can be used to identify gene expression of specific genetic pathways, which can lead to the identification of natural molecules as therapeutic agents in specific molecular pathways. For this study, genes involved in health conditions and processes were considered. In particular, the expression of genes involved in obesity, xenobiotics metabolism, endocannabinoid pathway, leukotriene B4 metabolism and signaling, inflammation, endocytosis, hypoxia, lifespan, and neurotrophins were evaluated. Exploiting the expression of specific genes in different cell lines can be useful in in vitro to evaluate the therapeutic effects of small natural molecules.","['Dhuli K', 'Bonetti G', 'Anpilogov K', 'Herbst KL', 'Connelly ST', 'Bellinato F', 'Gisondi P', 'Bertelli M']",2022,63,2 Suppl 3,J Prev Med Hyg,"Dhuli K, et al.

Among the several animal species, rats, mice and purpose-bred birds comprise almost 90% of the animals that are used for research purpose. However, growing awareness of the sentience of animals and their experience of pain and suffering has led to strong opposition to animal research among many scientists and the general public. In addition, the usefulness of extrapolating animal data to humans has been questioned. This has led to Ethical Committees' adoption of the 'four Rs' principles (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement and Responsibility) as a guide when making decisions regarding animal experimentation. Some of the essential considerations for humane animal experimentation are presented in this review along with the requirement for investigator training. Due to the ethical issues surrounding the use of animals in experimentation, their use is declining in those research areas where alternative in vitro or in silico methods are available. However, so far it has not been possible to dispense with experimental animals completely and further research is needed to provide a road map to robust alternatives before their use can be fully discontinued.","['Kiani AK', 'Pheby D', 'Henehan G', 'Brown R', 'Sieving P', 'Sykora P', 'Marks R', 'Falsini B', 'Capodicasa N', 'Miertus S', 'Lorusso L', 'Dondossola D', 'Tartaglia GM', 'Ergoren MC', 'Dundar M', 'Michelini S', 'Malacarne D', 'Bonetti G', 'Dautaj A', 'Donato K', 'Medori MC', 'Beccari T', 'Samaja M', 'Connelly ST', 'Martin D', 'Morresi A', 'Bacu A', 'Herbst KL', 'Kapustin M', 'Stuppia L', 'Lumer L', 'Farronato G', 'Bertelli M', 'INTERNATIONAL BIOETHICS STUDY GROUP ']",2022,63,2 Suppl 3,J Prev Med Hyg,"Kiani AK, et al.

In addition, physical inactivity not only increases the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCD), but also contributes significantly to the increased morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from these diseases. On the contrary, physical activity reduces the risk of NCDs - such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer - in a dose-dependent manner; regular exercise is also associated with many health benefits and delayed mortality. However, understanding the role of physical activity in modern society and creating an awareness in the general population is one of the most important tasks of health and recreation promoters. Correspondingly, there is a dire need to enhance our knowledge, perception, and awareness of physical activity and its impacts on an individual's health, ultimately contributing to developing a healthy society.

Bioactive food components and nutrients affect the expression of such genes. Nutrigenomics is the science that analyzes gene-nutrient interactions (nutrigenetics), which can lead to the development of personalized nutritional recommendations to maintain optimal health and prevent disease. Genomic diversity among various ethnic groups might affect nutrients bioavailability as well as their metabolism. Nutrigenomics combines different branches of science including nutrition, bioinformatics, genomics, molecular biology, molecular medicine, and epidemiology. Genes regulate intake and metabolism of different nutrients, while nutrients positively or negatively influence the expression of a number of genes; testing of specific genetic polymorphisms may therefore become a useful tool to manage weight loss and to fully understand gene-nutrient interactions. Indeed, several approaches are used to study gene-nutrient interactions: epigenetics, the study of genome modification not related to changes in nucleotide sequence; transcriptomics, the study of tissue-specific and time-specific RNA transcripts; proteomics, the study of proteins involved in biological processes; and metabolomics, the study of changes of primary and secondary metabolites in body fluids and tissues.

Metabolomics is vital to nearly every aspect of precision nutrition. It can be targeted or untargeted, and it has many applications. Indeed, it can be used to comprehensively characterize the thousands of chemicals in foods, identify food by-products in human biofluids or tissues, characterize nutrient deficiencies or excesses, monitor biochemical responses to dietary interventions, track long- or short-term dietary habits, and guide the development of nutritional therapies. Indeed, metabolomics can be coupled with genomics and proteomics to study and advance the field of precision nutrition.

It is characterized by the consumption of a wide variety of foods, such as extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), legumes, cereals, nuts, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish, and wine. Many of these foods provide several phytonutrients, among which polyphenols and vitamins play an important role. Data from several studies have strongly established that nutrition is a key factor in promoting a healthy lifestyle and preventing many chronic diseases. In particular, a large number of studies have established the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against several chronic diseases, among which are diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, aging disorders, and against overall mortality. Animal and human translational studies have revealed the biological mechanisms regulating the beneficial effects of the traditional Mediterranean diet. Indeed, several studies demonstrated that this nutritional pattern has lipid-lowering, anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-oxidative effects. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet is considered environmentally sustainable. In this review, we describe the composition of the Mediterranean diet, assess its beneficial effects, and analyze their epigenomic, genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic aspects. In the future it will be important to continue exploring the molecular mechanisms through which the Mediterranean diet exerts its protective effects and to standardize its components and serving sizes to understand more precisely its effects on human health.","['Kiani AK', 'Medori MC', 'Bonetti G', 'Aquilanti B', 'Velluti V', 'Matera G', 'Iaconelli A', 'Stuppia L', 'Connelly ST', 'Herbst KL', 'Bertelli M']",2022,63,2 Suppl 3,J Prev Med Hyg,"Kiani AK, et al.

36479476,Methodology for clinical research.,"A clinical research requires a systematic approach with diligent planning, execution and sampling in order to obtain reliable and validated results, as well as an understanding of each research methodology is essential for researchers. Indeed, selecting an inappropriate study type, an error that cannot be corrected after the beginning of a study, results in flawed methodology. The results of clinical research studies enhance the repertoire of knowledge regarding a disease pathogenicity, an existing or newly discovered medication, surgical or diagnostic procedure or medical device. Medical research can be divided into primary and secondary research, where primary research involves conducting studies and collecting raw data, which is then analysed and evaluated in secondary research. The successful deployment of clinical research methodology depends upon several factors. These include the type of study, the objectives, the population, study design, methodology/techniques and the sampling and statistical procedures used. Among the different types of clinical studies, we can recognize descriptive or analytical studies, which can be further categorized in observational and experimental. Finally, also pre-clinical studies are of outmost importance, representing the steppingstone of clinical trials. It is therefore important to understand the types of method for clinical research.

36401222,"Women with lipoedema: a national survey on their health, health-related quality of life, and sense of coherence.","BACKGROUND: Lipoedema is a chronic disease in adipose tissue that almost exclusively affects women during periods of hormonal alterations. Its main symptoms include an abnormal accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the buttock, hips, and legs, which is associated with pain, swelling, and easy bruising. Herein, a grading in three stages is used to determine disease progression. Problematically, lipoedema manifestations are often confused with lifestyle-induced obesity, which is why the various health problems among affected women often remain unrecognized. Overall, research on lipoedema is scarce. As such, this study examined the health, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and sense of coherence (SOC) among women with lipoedema.
METHODS: We conducted a national cross-sectional study using an online survey assessing sociodemographic data, lipoedema characteristics, symptom severity, comorbidities, HRQOL (RAND-36), and SOC (SOC-13). In total, 245 women with lipoedema, recruited from all Lipoedema Association groups in Sweden, participated. Data were compiled with descriptive statistics, and mean differences between groups were analysed by using parametric and non-parametric tests.
RESULTS: Moderate and severe leg heaviness, pain, numbness, cold skin, feeling cold, easy bruising, and sleep problems were found to occur in all lipoedema stages. Moreover, almost all participants reported having comorbidities. Worse physical health and most substantial limitations in daily life were reported among women with the most progressive lipoedema (i.e., stage 3). Social and emotional functioning and SOC were found to be, on the other hand, primarily related to respondents' sociodemographic data and their ages at lipoedema onset. Even though approximately 70% of the women had experienced lipoedema onset before age 30, only three (1.6%) had been diagnosed by a healthcare professional before that age.
CONCLUSION: Having lipoedema is associated with several health problems and a lower HRQOL. In addition, the extent of delay in diagnosis within this sample indicates that many women with lipoedema are often underdiagnosed and are left without support from healthcare. These findings call for the need for greater attention on lipoedema. Moreover, further studies on how women with lipoedema manage their health and symptoms, as well as on their experiences of healthcare services and lipoedema treatments, are needed.","['Falck J', 'Rolander B', 'Nygårdh A', 'Jonasson LL', 'Mårtensson J']",2022,22,1,BMC Womens Health,"Falck J, et al.

36387874,Is subcutaneous adipose tissue expansion in people living with lipedema healthier and reflected by circulating parameters?,"Lipedema may be considered a model for healthy expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). This condition is characterized by the disproportional and symmetrical SAT accumulation in the lower-body parts and extremities, avoiding the abdominal area. There are no circulating biomarkers facilitating the diagnosis of lipedema. We tested the hypothesis that women living with lipedema present a distinct pattern of circulating parameters compared to age- and BMI-matched women. In 26 women (Age 48.3 ± 13.9 years, BMI 32.6 ± 5.8 kg/m2; lipedema group: n=13; control group: n=13), we assessed circulating parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, sex hormones and a proteomics panel. We find that women with lipedema have better glucose metabolism regulation represented by lower HbA1c (5.55 ± 0.62%) compared to controls (6.73 ± 0.85%; p&lt;0.001); and higher adiponectin levels (lipedema: 4.69 ± 1.99 mmol/l; control: 3.28 ± 1.00 mmol/l; p=0.038). Despite normal glycemic parameters, women with lipedema have significantly higher levels of total cholesterol (5.84 ± 0.70 mmol/L vs 4.55 ± 0.77 mmol/L in control; p&lt;0.001), LDL-C (3.38 ± 0.68 mmol/L vs 2.38 ± 0.66 mmol/L in control; p=0.002), as well as higher circulating inflammation (top 6 based on p-values: TNFSF14, CASP8, EN-RAGE, EIF4EBP1, ADA, MCP-1) and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and catalase). Our findings suggest that the expected association between activation of inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways and impaired glucose metabolism are counterbalanced by protective factors in lipedema.","['Nankam PAN', 'Cornely M', 'Klöting N', 'Blüher M']",2022,13,,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),"Nankam PAN, et al.

Although it appears to be heritable, no specific genes have yet been identified. To identify potential genetic risk factors for lipedema, we used bioelectrical impedance analysis and anthropometric data from the UK Biobank to identify women with and without a lipedema phenotype. Specifically, we identified women with both a high percentage of fat in the lower limbs and a relatively small waist, adjusting for hip circumference. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for this phenotype, and performed multiple sensitivity GWAS.

36350372,[Complications and their management in the surgical treatment of lipohyperplasia dolorosa].,"BACKGROUND: There are both conservative and surgical treatment options for lipohyperplasia dolorosa (LiDo). A procedure that has been established since 1997 is the surgical treatment through lymphological liposculpture according to Cornely™.
AIM: After extensive suctioning of the extremities, an extensive subcutaneous wound cavity with a trabecular connective tissue scaffold remains. Nevertheless, surgery-related complications are rare. Postoperative management and administration of antibiotics and antithrombotics are reviewed. The therapies for complications are presented in detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, the frequencies of adverse events in 1400 LiDo surgeries in 2020 were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 47.81 years (range 16-78 years). Symmetrically, 504 outer legs (outer half of the limb [BA]), 504 inner legs (inner half of the limb [BI]), and 392 arms [A] were surgically treated.
RESULTS: Relevant adverse events rarely occurred: infections (1.79%), seromas (0.79%), erysipelas (0.28%), necrosis (0.14%) and deep vein thrombosis (0.07).
DISCUSSION: We were able to reduce the rate of postoperative complications to 3.07% in the Lymphological Liposculpture™ regime for the surgical treatment of LiDo. In their meta-analysis on liposuction, Kanapathy et al. reported an overall incidence of major surgical complications of 3.48%. The overall incidence of minor surgical complications was 11.62%, with seroma (5.51%) being the most common minor complication [26]. Kruppa et al. report that the liposuction procedure including fat removal for esthetic reasons has a complication rate of 9.5%.

36310013,Body Composition Assessment by Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry: A Useful Tool for the Diagnosis of Lipedema.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a poorly known condition. Diagnosis is based almost exclusively on clinical criteria, which may be subjective and not always reliable. This study aimed to investigate regional body composition (BC) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients with lipedema and healthy controls and to determine cut-off values of fat mass (FM) indices to provide an additional tool for the diagnosis and staging of this condition.
METHODS: This study is a single-center case-control study performed at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. Women with clinically diagnosed lipedema underwent regional BC assessment by DXA. The control group without clinical lipedema was matched for age and body mass index (BMI) at a ratio of 1:2 and underwent similar examination. Regional FM (legs, arms, legs and arms, trunk, android and gynoid FM) was measured in (kg) and divided by FM index (FMI) (kg/m2) and total FM (kg). The trunk/legs and android/gynoid ratios were calculated. For all indices of FM distribution showing a significant difference between cases and controls, we defined the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calculating the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index. Types and stages of lipedema were compared in terms of FM indices. Correlation analyses between all FM distribution indices and lipedema stages were performed.
RESULTS: We included 222 women (74 with lipedema and 148 controls). Overall, the mean age was 41 years (standard deviation [SD] 11), and mean BMI was 30.9 kg/m2 (SD 7.6). A statistically significant difference was observed for all DXA-derived indices of FM distribution between groups, except for arm FM indices. The ROC curve analysis of leg FM/total FM, as a potential indicator of lipedema, resulted in an AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.86-0.94). According to Youden's index, optimal cut-off value identifying lipedema was 0.384. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.73, respectively. We found no significant differences between lipedema types and stages in terms of FM indices, nor significant correlations between the latter and lipedema stages.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: BC assessment by DXA, and particularly calculation of the leg FM/total FM index, is a simple tool that may help clinicians rule out lipedema in doubtful cases.","['Buso G', 'Favre L', 'Vionnet N', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez E', 'Hans D', 'Puder JJ', 'Dubath C', 'Eap CB', 'Raffoul W', 'Collet TH', 'Mazzolai L']",2022,15,6,Obes Facts,"Buso G, et al.

36294260,The Difficulties in Emotional Regulation among a Cohort of Females with Lipedema.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a chronic and progressive adipose tissue disorder that causes significant morbidity and negatively influences mental health and quality of life, and increases the risk of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. One construct of relevance to better understanding psychological disorders is emotion regulation (ER). Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the difficulties in ER among lipedema patients compared to healthy people without lipedema.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed differences in ER and anxiety between two groups: 26 female patients with lipedema and 26 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) assessed emotional regulation across six dimensions: Impulse control, goal-directed behavior, awareness, clarity, non-acceptance, and strategies. Anxiety was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). ANOVA assessed differences in measures between lipedema and healthy control groups.
RESULTS: Lipedema patients presented with significantly more difficulties in ER and a higher level of anxiety than those without lipedema. Specifically, the lipedema group showed higher and significant differences in total DERS and anxiety scores and all DERS subscales scores compared to those without lipedema.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipedema patients showed significant difficulties with ER, and were associated with anxiety symptoms, indicating that ER difficulties may play a role in developing emotional disorders, such as anxiety, for patients with lipedema. The health care provider should pay more attention to ER difficulties and psychological status among lipedema patients.","['Al-Wardat M', 'Clarke C', 'Alwardat N', 'Kassab M', 'Salimei C', 'Gualtieri P', 'Marchetti M', 'Best T', 'Di Renzo L']",2022,19,20,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Al-Wardat M, et al.

36285892,Pathophysiology of cellulite: Possible involvement of selective endotoxemia.,"The most relevant hallmarks of cellulite include a massive protrusion of superficial adipose tissue into the dermis, reduced expression of the extracellular glycoprotein fibulin-3, and an unusually high presence of MUSE cells in gluteofemoral white adipose tissue (gfWAT) that displays cellulite. Also typical for this condition is the hypertrophic nature of the underlying adipose tissue, the interaction of adipocytes with sweat glands, and dysfunctional lymph and blood circulation as well as a low-grade inflammation in the areas of gfWAT affected by cellulite. Here, we propose a new pathophysiology of cellulite, which connects this skin condition with selective accumulation of endogenous lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in gfWAT. The accumulation of LPS within a specific WAT depot has so far not been considered as a possible pathophysiological mechanism triggering localized WAT modifications, but may very well be involved in conditions such as cellulite and, secondary to that, lipedema.","['Kruglikov IL', 'Scherer PE']",2023,24,1,Obes Rev,Kruglikov IL and Scherer PE.

36227936,Investigation of clinical characteristics and genome associations in the 'UK Lipoedema' cohort.,"Lipoedema is a chronic adipose tissue disorder mainly affecting women, causing excess subcutaneous fat deposition on the lower limbs with pain and tenderness. There is often a family history of lipoedema, suggesting a genetic origin, but the contribution of genetics is currently unclear. A tightly phenotyped cohort of 200 lipoedema patients was recruited from two UK specialist clinics. Objective clinical characteristics and measures of quality of life data were obtained. In an attempt to understand the genetic architecture of the disease better, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were obtained, and a genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed on 130 of the recruits. The analysis revealed genetic loci suggestively associated with the lipoedema phenotype, with further support provided by an independent cohort taken from the 100,000 Genomes Project. The top SNP rs1409440 (ORmeta ≈ 2.01, Pmeta ≈ 4 x 10-6) is located upstream of LHFPL6, which is thought to be involved with lipoma formation. Exactly how this relates to lipoedema is not yet understood. This first GWAS of a UK lipoedema cohort has identified genetic regions of suggestive association with the disease.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a single centre. Between 2007 and 2018, 36 TKA procedures were performed on 28 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of lymphoedema and lipoedema. Oxford Knee Scores (OKS), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores, satisfaction scores, radiographs, and complications were obtained at the final follow-up. Patients were admitted to the hospital up to two weeks prior to surgery and remained on the ward for daily compression bandaging by the specialist lymphoedema team.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 36 TKAs were performed on 28 patients (5 males, 23 females) with a mean age of 71 years (range 54-90). Of these, 30 TKAs were in patients with lymphoedema, five with lipoedema, and one with a dual diagnosis.

36035515,"The Effect of a Low-Carbohydrate, High-Fat Diet versus Moderate-Carbohydrate and Fat Diet on Body Composition in Patients with Lipedema.","INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a disorder characterized by an excessive accumulation of subcutaneous body fat, mainly bilateral and symmetrical accumulation of fat deposits, particularly in the lower extremities excluding feet. Pain (spontaneous or with palpation) and increased capillary fragility with bruising are also part of clinical presentation. It is estimated to occur in approximately 11.0% of women worldwide. Management of obesity among patients with lipedema is a key component in its treatment.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness of two diets: low-carbohydrate-high-fat diet (LCHF) and medium-fat-medium-carbohydrate diet (MFMC) in body weight, body fat and limb circumference reduction in patients with lipedema.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied women (n = 91) were divided into 2 groups and submitted to 1 of the 2 diets for 16 weeks. Anthropometric measurements such as body height [cm], body weight [kg], body fat percentage [%], body fat [kg], lean body mass [kg], and visceral fat level were collected at the beginning and end of the study.
RESULTS: We have not found any significant differences in anthropometric measurements at the baseline between groups. Body weight and all anthropometric parameters decreased significantly in both groups after 16 weeks of diets, excluding the circumference above the right ankle for the MFMC diet which did not change. The LCHF diet contributed to reduction of body weight (-8.2 ± 4.1 kg vs -2.1 ± 1.0 kg; p < 0.0001), body fat (-6.4 ± 3.2 kg vs 1.6 ± 0.8 kg; p < 0.0001), waist (-7.8 ± 3.9 cm vs -2.3 ± 1.1 cm; p < 0.0001), hips (-7.4 ± 3.7 cm vs -2.5 ± 1.3 cm; p < 0.0001), thighs and calves' circumferences compared with the MFMC diet. We observed reduction of pain in the extremities and mobility improvement in LCHF group (data not shown).
CONCLUSION: The LCHF diet was more effective than MFMC in body weight, body fat and lower limb circumferences reduction.","['Jeziorek M', 'Szuba A', 'Kujawa K', 'Regulska-Ilow B']",2022,15,,Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,"Jeziorek M, et al.

35976393,"Deep learning for standardized, MRI-based quantification of subcutaneous and subfascial tissue volume for patients with lipedema and lymphedema.","OBJECTIVES: To contribute to a more in-depth assessment of shape, volume, and asymmetry of the lower extremities in patients with lipedema or lymphedema utilizing volume information from MR imaging.
METHODS: A deep learning (DL) pipeline was developed including (i) localization of anatomical landmarks (femoral heads, symphysis, knees, ankles) and (ii) quality-assured tissue segmentation to enable standardized quantification of subcutaneous (SCT) and subfascial tissue (SFT) volumes. The retrospectively derived dataset for method development consisted of 45 patients (42 female, 44.2 ± 14.8 years) who underwent clinical 3D DIXON MR-lymphangiography examinations of the lower extremities. Five-fold cross-validated training was performed on 16,573 axial slices from 40 patients and testing on 2187 axial slices from 5 patients. For landmark detection, two EfficientNet-B1 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were applied in an ensemble. One determines the relative foot-head position of each axial slice with respect to the landmarks by regression, the other identifies all landmarks in coronal reconstructed slices using keypoint detection. After landmark detection, segmentation of SCT and SFT was performed on axial slices employing a U-Net architecture with EfficientNet-B1 as encoder. Finally, the determined landmarks were used for standardized analysis and visualization of tissue volume, distribution, and symmetry, independent of leg length, slice thickness, and patient position.
RESULTS: Excellent test results were observed for landmark detection (z-deviation = 4.5 ± 3.1 mm) and segmentation (Dice score: SCT = 0.989 ± 0.004, SFT = 0.994 ± 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DL pipeline allows for standardized analysis of tissue volume and distribution and may assist in diagnosis of lipedema and lymphedema or monitoring of conservative and surgical treatments.
KEY POINTS: • Efficient use of volume information that MRI inherently provides can be extracted automatically by deep learning and enables in-depth assessment of tissue volumes in lipedema and lymphedema. • The deep learning pipeline consisting of body part regression, keypoint detection, and quality-assured tissue segmentation provides detailed information about the volume, distribution, and asymmetry of lower extremity tissues, independent of leg length, slice thickness, and patient position.","['Nowak S', 'Henkel A', 'Theis M', 'Luetkens J', 'Geiger S', 'Sprinkart AM', 'Pieper CC', 'Attenberger UI']",2023,33,2,Eur Radiol,"Nowak S, et al.

35972618,Stages of lipoedema: experiences of physical and mental health and health care.,"PURPOSE: Lipoedema is a progressive adipose (fat) disorder, and little is known about its psychological effect. This study aimed to determine the experiences of physical and mental health and health care across stages of lipoedema.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, secondary data from an anonymous survey (conducted 2014-2015) in Dutch and English in those with self-reported lipoedema were used (N = 1,362, Mdnage = 41-50 years old, 80.2% diagnosed). χ
RESULTS: Compared to 'Stage 1-2', 'Stage 3-4' reported more loss of mobility (p =  < .001), pain (p =  < .001), fatigue (p = .002), problems at work (p =  < .001) and were seeking treatment to improve physical functioning (p =  < .001) more frequently. 'Stage 3-4' were more likely to report their GP did not have knowledge of lipoedema, did not take them seriously, gave them diet and lifestyle advice, dismissed lipoedema, and treated them 'badly' due to overweight/lipoedema compared to 'Stage 1-2' (p =  < .001). 'Stage 3-4' were more likely to report depression (p =  < .001), emotional lability (p = .033) eating disorders (p = .018) and feeling lonelier, more fearful, and stayed at home more (p =  < .001) and less likely to have visited a psychologist (p =  < .001) compared to 'Stage 1-2'.
CONCLUSIONS: A divergent pattern of physical and psychological experiences between lipoedema stages reflects physical symptom differences and differences in psychological symptoms and health care experiences. These findings increase the understanding of lipoedema symptoms to inform psychological supports for women with lipoedema in navigating chronic health care management.","['Clarke C', 'Kirby JN', 'Smidt T', 'Best T']",2023,32,1,Qual Life Res,"Clarke C, et al.

35950131,Lipoedema: detailed left atrial volumetric and strain analysis by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography from the MAGYAR-Path Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipoedema is a chronic feminine disease with disproportional painful fat deposition of the lower body half and occassional arm affection.
AIM: The objective of the present study was to assess LA volumetric and functional properties by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) in patients with lipoedema and to compare their results to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. It was also aimed to examine whether one-hour use of medical compression stockings (MCS) has any effect on LA volumes and functional properties.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 25 female patients with stage 2 lipoedema (mean age: 42.5 ±12.2 years). Their results were compared to those of the control group consisting of 54 age- and gender-matched healthy female subjects (mean age: 42.7 ±10.6 years) without classic risk factors.
RESULTS: Increased LA volumes could be measured in lipoedema patients as compared to controls regardless of the phase of the cardiac cycle it was measured in, and the LA volumes showed further increase after 1-hour use of MCS. Similarly, LA total and active stroke volumes and LA passive emptying fraction were increased in lipoedema patients, and these parameters were further increased in systole and early-diastole. Peak global radial and 3D strains were increased in lipoedema patients. Peak global longitudinal strain increased in lipoedema patients after one-hour use of MCS compared to data measured at rest.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipoedema is associated with increased LA volumes and changes in LA functional properties. The use of MCS further increases some of the LA volumetric parameters.","['Nemes A', 'Kormányos Á', 'Domsik P', 'Kalapos A', 'Gyenes N', 'Kemény L', 'Szolnoky G']",2022,39,3,Postepy Dermatol Alergol,"Nemes A, et al.

The lipedema SAT has been found to be resistant to diet, exercise and bariatric surgery, in regard to both weight loss (WL) and symptom relief. Current experience indicates that a low carbohydrate and high fat (LCHF-diet) might have a beneficial effect on weight and symptom management in lipedema.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an eucaloric low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF)-diet on pain and quality of life (QoL) in patients with lipedema.
METHODS: Women diagnosed with lipedema, including all types and stages affecting the legs, (age 18-75 years, BMI 30-45 kg/m
RESULTS: Nine women (BMI: 36.7 ± 4.5 kg/m

35811389,A Case Series of Lymphatic Injuries After Suction Lipectomy in Women with Lipedema.,"BACKGROUND Lipedema is a loose connective tissue disease characterized by disproportionate subcutaneous adipose tissue hypertrophy in the extremities. There is evidence of impaired lymphatic function in women with lipedema at all stages without signs of trophic skin changes associated with hereditary or acquired lymphedema. A modification of suction lipectomy is used to treat lipedema tissue and can reduce pain, limb size, and limb swelling and reduce the need for compression in women with lipedema. Studies have shown that modified liposuction can improve quality of life and mobility. There are no reports of lymphatic injury after suction lipectomy in patients with lipedema in PubMed indexed journals. CASE REPORT Three women with lipedema who had no prior venous or lymphatic disease developed new-onset symptomatic International Society of Lymphology (ISL) Stage 2 or 3 lymphedema and skin and tissue changes within 6 months to 1 year after suction lipectomy for lipedema tissue on the legs. Each of the 3 women had their surgeries performed using different suction devices and under different types of anesthesia. Two of the lymphatic injury cases had subsequent nuclear lymphoscintigrams that confirmed impaired lymphatic function. CONCLUSIONS We report 3 cases of women with lymphatic injuries after modified suction lipectomy to treat lipedema. Clinical history, exams, and confirmatory studies support the assessment that suction lipectomy caused newly-manifested signs and symptoms of lymphedema. Further study is needed to determine the risk of permanent lymphatic injury with suction lipectomy in larger numbers of lipedema patients.","['Wright TF', 'Herbst KL']",2022,23,,Am J Case Rep,Wright TF and Herbst KL.

35743063,"Current Mechanistic Understandings of Lymphedema and Lipedema: Tales of Fluid, Fat, and Fibrosis.","Lymphedema and lipedema are complex diseases. While the external presentation of swollen legs in lower-extremity lymphedema and lipedema appear similar, current mechanistic understandings of these diseases indicate unique aspects of their underlying pathophysiology. They share certain clinical features, such as fluid (edema), fat (adipose expansion), and fibrosis (extracellular matrix remodeling). Yet, these diverge on their time course and known molecular regulators of pathophysiology and genetics. This divergence likely indicates a unique route leading to interstitial fluid accumulation and subsequent inflammation in lymphedema versus lipedema. Identifying disease mechanisms that are causal and which are merely indicative of the condition is far more explored in lymphedema than in lipedema. In primary lymphedema, discoveries of genetic mutations link molecular markers to mechanisms of lymphatic disease. Much work remains in this area towards better risk assessment of secondary lymphedema and the hopeful discovery of validated genetic diagnostics for lipedema. The purpose of this review is to expose the distinct and shared (i) clinical criteria and symptomatology, (ii) molecular regulators and pathophysiology, and (iii) genetic markers of lymphedema and lipedema to help inform future research in this field.","['Duhon BH', 'Phan TT', 'Taylor SL', 'Crescenzi RL', 'Rutkowski JM']",2022,23,12,Int J Mol Sci,"Duhon BH, et al.

However, more and more researchers attempt to incorporate the most effective lipoedema treatment methods. When assessing a new therapeutic method, choosing correct, objective tools to measure the therapeutic outcome is very important. This article aims to present possible instruments that may be used in the evaluation of therapeutic effects in patients with lipoedema. (2) Methods: The data on therapeutic outcome measurements in lipoedema were selected in February 2022, using the Medical University of Gdansk Main Library multi-search engine. (3) Results: In total, 10 papers on this topic have been identified according to inclusion criteria. The tools evaluating the therapeutic outcomes used in the selected studies were: volume and circumference measurement, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, ultrasonography and various scales measuring the quality of life, the level of experiencing pain, the severity of symptoms, functional lower extremity scales, and a 6 min walk test. (4) Conclusion: The tools currently used in evaluating the effectiveness of conservative treatment in women with lipoedema are: volume and circumference measurement, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage, ultrasonography, VAS scale, quality of life scales (SF-36, RAND-36), symptom severity questionnaire (QuASiL), Lower Extremity Functional Scale and 6 min walk.

35707862,Lymphatic function and anatomy in early stages of lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: Lipedema is an inflammatory subcutaneous adipose tissue disease that develops in women and may progress to lipolymphedema, a condition similar to lymphedema, in which lymphatic dysfunction results in irresolvable edema. Because it has been shown that dilated lymphatic vessels, impaired pumping, and dermal backflow are associated with presymptomatic, cancer-acquired lymphedema, this study sought to understand whether these abnormal lymphatic characteristics also characterize early stages of lipedema prior to lipolymphedema development.
METHODS: In a pilot study of 20 individuals with Stage I or II lipedema who had not progressed to lipolymphedema, lymphatic vessel anatomy and function in upper and lower extremities were assessed by near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging and compared with that of a control population of similar age and BMI.
RESULTS: These studies showed that, although lower extremity lymphatic vessels were dilated and showed intravascular pooling, the propulsion rates significantly exceeded those of control individuals. Upper extremity lymphatics of individuals with lipedema were unremarkable. In contrast to individuals with lymphedema, individuals with Stage I and II lipedema did not exhibit dermal backflow.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite the confusion in the diagnoses between lymphedema and lipedema, their etiologies differ, with lipedema associated with lymphatic vessel dilation but not lymphatic dysfunction.","['Rasmussen JC', 'Aldrich MB', 'Fife CE', 'Herbst KL', 'Sevick-Muraca EM']",2022,30,7,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Rasmussen JC, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of lipedema and identify health factors related to it in the Brazilian population.
METHODS: Administration of a previously validated online screening questionnaire to a representative sample of the general population. The questionnaire was distributed and administered to anonymous volunteers representing the general Brazilian population using software designed for population analyses.
RESULTS: 253 women answered the questionnaire, 12.3 ± 4% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%) of whom presented symptoms compatible with a high probability of being diagnosed with lipedema.

35657120,Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Edema in Lipedema Revealed by Noninvasive 3T MR Lymphangiography.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema exhibits excessive lower-extremity subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) deposition, which is frequently misidentified as obesity until lymphedema presents. MR lymphangiography may have relevance to distinguish lipedema from obesity or lymphedema.
HYPOTHESIS: Hyperintensity profiles on 3T MR lymphangiography can identify distinct features consistent with SAT edema in participants with lipedema.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective cross-sectional study.
SUBJECTS: Participants (48 females, matched for age [mean = 44.8 years]) with lipedema (n = 14), lipedema with lymphedema (LWL, n = 12), cancer treatment-related lymphedema (lymphedema, n = 8), and controls without these conditions (n = 14).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T MR lymphangiography (nontracer 3D turbo-spin-echo).
ASSESSMENT: Review of lymphangiograms in lower extremities by three radiologists was performed independently. Spatial patterns of hyperintense signal within the SAT were scored for extravascular (focal, diffuse, or not apparent) and vascular (linear, dilated, or not apparent) image features.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Interreader reliability was computed using Fleiss Kappa. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the proportion of image features between study groups. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between image features and study groups. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of SAT extravascular and vascular features was reported in groups compared to lipedema. The threshold of statistical significance was P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Reliable agreement was demonstrated between three independent, blinded reviewers (P < 0.001). The frequency of SAT hyperintensities in participants with lipedema (36% focal, 36% diffuse), LWL (42% focal, 33% diffuse), lymphedema (62% focal, 38% diffuse), and controls (43% focal, 0% diffuse) was significantly distinct. Compared with lipedema, SAT hyperintensities were less frequent in controls (focal: OR = 0.63, CI = 0.11-3.41; diffuse: OR = 0.05, CI = 0.00-1.27), similar in LWL (focal: OR = 1.29, CI = 0.19-8.89; diffuse: OR = 1.05, CI = 0.15-7.61), and more frequent in lymphedema (focal: OR = 9.00, CI = 0.30-274.12; diffuse: OR = 5.73, CI = 0.18-186.84).
DATA CONCLUSION: Noninvasive MR lymphangiography identifies distinct signal patterns indicating SAT edema and lymphatic load in participants with lipedema.

In clinical practice, it is still difficult to reliably diagnose the disease. This study aims to provide further insights into the characteristics of lipedema patients of all stages and provide a baseline prior to surgery for a surgical treatment evaluation by means of patient-reported outcome measures.
METHODS: Patients completed a lipedema-specific questionnaire containing 50 items, the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The data were analyzed using SPSS statistics 27. Patients who had already received liposuction were excluded.
RESULTS: Five hundred and eleven patients were included, of whom 337 completed the PHQ9 and 333 completed the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. The general characteristics of lipedema patients, especially the daily symptoms, are described. Previous observations, such as the frequent occurrence of hypothyroidism and the low rate of type 2 diabetes, were confirmed. Over 49% suffer from severe impairments in their jobs, whereby the disease shows a familial accumulation. The results of the WHOQOL-BREF and the PHQ-9 suggest a high level of mental stress.
DISCUSSION: As surgical intervention in lipedema patients is gaining traction, its effects should be well-documented. Therefore, a comprehensive baseline needs to be established prior to surgical treatment. The psychological components are just as important as the inclusion of daily impairments.","['Hamatschek M', 'Knors H', 'Klietz ML', 'Wiebringhaus P', 'Aitzetmueller M', 'Hirsch T', 'Kueckelhaus M']",2022,11,10,J Clin Med,"Hamatschek M, et al.

35625899,Multi-Level Analysis of Adipose Tissue Reveals the Relevance of Perivascular Subpopulations and an Increased Endothelial Permeability in Early-Stage Lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic, progressive disease of adipose tissue with unknown etiology. Based on the relevance of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell population in lipedema, we performed a thorough characterization of subcutaneous adipose tissue, SVF isolated thereof and the sorted populations of endothelial cells (EC), pericytes and cultured adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC) of early-stage lipedema patients. We employed histological and gene expression analysis and investigated the endothelial barrier by immunofluorescence and analysis of endothelial permeability in vitro. Although there were no significant differences in histological stainings, we found altered gene expression of factors relevant for local estrogen metabolism (aromatase), preadipocyte commitment (ZNF423) and immune cell infiltration (CD11c) in lipedema on the tissue level, as well as in distinct cellular subpopulations. Machine learning analysis of immunofluorescence images of CD31 and ZO-1 revealed a morphological difference in the cellular junctions of EC cultures derived from healthy and lipedema individuals. Furthermore, the secretome of lipedema-derived SVF cells was sufficient to significantly increase leakiness of healthy human primary EC, which was also reflected by decreased mRNA expression of VE-cadherin. Here, we showed for the first time that the secretome of SVF cells creates an environment that triggers endothelial barrier dysfunction in early-stage lipedema. Moreover, since alterations in gene expression were detected on the cellular and/or tissue level, the choice of sample material is of high importance in elucidating this complex disease.","['Strohmeier K', 'Hofmann M', 'Jacak J', 'Narzt MS', 'Wahlmueller M', 'Mairhofer M', 'Schaedl B', 'Holnthoner W', 'Barsch M', 'Sandhofer M', 'Wolbank S', 'Priglinger E']",2022,10,5,Biomedicines,"Strohmeier K, et al.

35457187,3D Visualization of Human Blood Vascular Networks Using Single-Domain Antibodies Directed against Endothelial Cell-Selective Adhesion Molecule (ESAM).,"High-quality three-dimensional (3D) microscopy allows detailed, unrestricted and non-destructive imaging of entire volumetric tissue specimens and can therefore increase the diagnostic accuracy of histopathological tissue analysis. However, commonly used IgG antibodies are oftentimes not applicable to 3D imaging, due to their relatively large size and consequently inadequate tissue penetration and penetration speed. The lack of suitable reagents for 3D histopathology can be overcome by an emerging class of single-domain antibodies, referred to as nanobodies (Nbs), which can facilitate rapid and superior 2D and 3D histological stainings. Here, we report the generation and experimental validation of Nbs directed against the human endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (hESAM), which enables spatial visualization of blood vascular networks in whole-mount 3D imaging. After analysis of Nb binding properties and quality, selected Nb clones were validated in 2D and 3D imaging approaches, demonstrating comparable staining qualities to commercially available hESAM antibodies in 2D, as well as rapid and complete staining of entire specimens in 3D. We propose that the presented hESAM-Nbs can serve as novel blood vessel markers in academic research and can potentially improve 3D histopathological diagnostics of entire human tissue specimens, leading to improved treatment and superior patient outcomes.","['Hansmeier NR', 'Büschlen IS', 'Behncke RY', 'Ulferts S', 'Bisoendial R', 'Hägerling R']",2022,23,8,Int J Mol Sci,"Hansmeier NR, et al. 3D Visualization of Human Blood Vascular Networks Using Single-Domain Antibodies Directed against Endothelial Cell-Selective Adhesion Molecule (ESAM). 3D Visualization of Human Blood Vascular Networks Using Single-Domain Antibodies Directed against Endothelial Cell-Selective Adhesion Molecule (ESAM). 2022; 23:(unknown pages). doi: 10.3390/ijms23084369",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35457187/
35452183,Exploring disease interrelationships in patients with lymphatic disorders: A single center retrospective experience.,"BACKGROUND: The lymphatic contribution to the circulation is of paramount importance in regulating fluid homeostasis, immune cell trafficking/activation and lipid metabolism. In comparison to the blood vasculature, the impact of the lymphatics has been underappreciated, both in health and disease, likely due to a less well-delineated anatomy and function. Emerging data suggest that lymphatic dysfunction can be pivotal in the initiation and development of a variety of diseases across broad organ systems. Understanding the clinical associations between lymphatic dysfunction and non-lymphatic morbidity provides valuable evidence for future investigations and may foster the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapies.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the electronic medical records of 724 patients referred to the Stanford Center for Lymphatic and Venous Disorders. Patients with an established lymphatic diagnosis were assigned to groups of secondary lymphoedema, lipoedema or primary lymphovascular disease. Individuals found to have no lymphatic disorder were served as the non-lymphatic controls. The prevalence of comorbid conditions was enumerated. Pairwise co-occurrence pattern analyses, validated by Jaccard similarity tests, was utilised to investigate disease-disease interrelationships.
RESULTS: Comorbidity analyses underscored the expected relationship between the presence of secondary lymphoedema and those diseases that damage the lymphatics. Cardiovascular conditions were common in all lymphatic subgroups. Additionally, statistically significant alteration of disease-disease interrelationships was noted in all three lymphatic categories when compared to the control population.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence or absence of a lymphatic disease significantly influences disease interrelationships in the study cohorts. As a physiologic substrate, the lymphatic circulation may be an underappreciated participant in disease pathogenesis. These relationships warrant further, prospective scrutiny and study.","['Rockson SG', 'Zhou X', 'Zhao L', 'Hosseini DK', 'Jiang X', 'Sweatt AJ', 'Kim D', 'Tian W', 'Snyder MP', 'Nicolls MR']",2022,12,4,Clin Transl Med,"Rockson SG, et al.

Research strongly supports that estrogen factors likely contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease. We aim to help demonstrate this link by quantifying estrogen factor differences between women with and without lipedema. For time and lipedema adipose tissue conservation, the Protein Simple WES machine will be utilized in place of traditional western blotting. Here, we are interested in evaluating estrogen related factors, such as, but not limited to, estrogen receptors and enzymes involved in the successive conversions of cholesterol and androgens to estrogens in human subcutaneous adipose. Evaluation of these factors within adipose tissue, however, is novel for this instrument. Thus, we optimized tissue lysis and protein extraction for 11 proteins of interest. Antibodies and their working concentrations were determined based upon specific and distinguishable (signal-to-noise) peaks from electropherogram outputs across different tissue lysate concentrations. We found that overnight acetone precipitation proved to be the best procedure for extracting protein from lipid rich adipose tissue samples. Six of the eleven proteins were found to migrate to their expected molecular weights, however, five did not. For proteins that did not migrate as expected, overexpression lysates and empty vector controls were used to validate detection antibodies. Protein extract from subcutaneous adipose tissue and overexpression lysates were then combined to understand if migration was specifically altered by adipose tissue. From these results, we concluded that the lipid rich nature of adipose tissue in combination with the separation matrix designated for use with the WES were preventing the appropriate migration of some proteins rather than non-specific antibody binding or inappropriate preparation methods.","['Hill JL', 'McIver KB', 'Katzer K', 'Foster MT']",2022,5,2,Methods Protoc,"Hill JL, et al.

35287836,What do lymphedema patients expect from a treatment and what do they achieve? A descriptive study.,"PURPOSE: Lymphedema is characterized by swelling and fibroadipose tissue deposition that is a physically, psychologically, and socially debilitating condition due to chronic and progressive nature of the disease. Treatment benefit evaluation from the patient's perspective is important for medical decision-making. The aim of this study is to investigate important treatment goals and benefits of treatment from the patients' perspective.
METHOD: Eighty-one patients with lymphedema, lipoedema, or lipolymphoedema who are currenlty treated or who underwent previous treatment were included in the study. Socio-demographic data was recorded. Important goals and benefit from treatment were assessed with Patients Needs Questionnaire and Patient Benefit Questionnaire which are sub-questionnaires of Patient Benefit Index-Lymphedema.
RESULTS: The most important expectation and needed item was ""To find a clear diagnosis and therapy"" (n:59, 72%). The least important item for the lymphedema patients was ""To feel more attractive"" (n:9, 11%). Most beneficial effect of treatment was ""To have no fear that the disease will become worse"" (n:37, 45.7%). ""To have fewer out of pocket treatment expenses"" was rated as the least beneficial effect of treatment (n:24, 29.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify patients' needs and expectations. Patients should be referred for treatment according to their needs. The effectiveness of the treatment should be evaluated objectively. Patient education should be considered as a part of the effective treatment to teach patients how to control their lymphedema. A clear diagnosis and access to treatment should be ensured for lymphedema patients.

35144895,Persistent lipedema pain in patients after bariatric surgery: a case series of 13 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema often remains undiagnosed in patients with obesity, leading to mismanagement of treatment. Because of this, despite remarkable weight loss after bariatric surgery and decreases in hip and abdomen circumference, some patients show only small decreases in circumference of the extremities and report persistent limb pain.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to raise awareness of lipedema coincident with obesity, mistakenly diagnosed as obesity alone, in order to ensure the correct diagnosis of the condition and to achieve better treatment outcomes for people with lipedema and coincident obesity.
SETTING: CG Lympha Clinic, Cologne, and Ernst von Bergmann Clinic, Potsdam.
METHODS: From clinical records, we identified 13 patients who were diagnosed with lipedema only after undergoing bariatric surgery. We describe the course of their pain before and after bariatric surgery, focusing on the long-term progression of symptoms accompanying the disease.
RESULTS: Lipedema cannot be cured by bariatric surgery, and although the patients in this study lost an average of more than 50 kg of weight, they displayed no improvement in the pain symptoms typical of lipedema.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the different etiologies of lipedema and obesity, lipedema requires its own specific treatment. Patients suffering from obesity should always be assessed for pain and lipedema. If coincident lipedema is diagnosed, we suggest that bariatric surgery only be performed first if diet and exercise have failed, the patient's body mass index is >40 kg/m","['Cornely ME', 'Hasenberg T', 'Cornely OA', 'Ure C', 'Hettenhausen C', 'Schmidt J']",2022,18,5,Surg Obes Relat Dis,"Cornely ME, et al.

35142618,Using a Patient Portal to Increase Enrollment in a Newborn Screening Research Study: Observational Study.,"BACKGROUND: Many research studies fail to enroll enough research participants. Patient-facing electronic health record applications, known as patient portals, may be used to send research invitations to eligible patients.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim was to determine if receipt of a patient portal research recruitment invitation was associated with enrollment in a large ongoing study of newborns (Early Check). The second aim was to determine if there were differences in opening the patient portal research recruitment invitation and study enrollment by race and ethnicity, age, or rural/urban home address.
METHODS: We used a computable phenotype and queried the health care system's clinical data warehouse to identify women whose newborns would likely be eligible. Research recruitment invitations were sent through the women's patient portals. We conducted logistic regressions to test whether women enrolled their newborns after receipt of a patient portal invitation and whether there were differences by race and ethnicity, age, and rural/urban home address.
RESULTS: Research recruitment invitations were sent to 4510 women not yet enrolled through their patient portals between November 22, 2019, through March 5, 2020. Among women who received a patient portal invitation, 3.6% (161/4510) enrolled their newborns within 27 days. The odds of enrolling among women who opened the invitation was nearly 9 times the odds of enrolling among women who did not open their invitation (SE 3.24, OR 8.86, 95% CI 4.33-18.13; P<.001). On average, it took 3.92 days for women to enroll their newborn in the study, with 64% (97/161) enrolling their newborn within 1 day of opening the invitation. There were disparities by race and urbanicity in enrollment in the study after receipt of a patient portal research invitation but not by age. Black women were less likely to enroll their newborns than White women (SE 0.09, OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16-0.55; P<.001), and women in urban zip codes were more likely to enroll their newborns than women in rural zip codes (SE 0.97, OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.62-5.67; P=.001). Black women (SE 0.05, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57-0.78; P<.001) and Hispanic women (SE 0.07, OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60-0.89; P=.002) were less likely to open the research invitation compared to White women.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient portals are an effective way to recruit participants for research studies, but there are substantial racial and ethnic disparities and disparities by urban/rural status in the use of patient portals, the opening of a patient portal invitation, and enrollment in the study.

35089257,A 10-Year Retrospective before-and-after Study of Lipedema Surgery: Patient-Reported Lipedema-Associated Symptom Improvement after Multistage Liposuction.,"BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing demand for surgical treatment of lipedema, the evidence for liposuction is still limited. Little is known about the influence of disease stage, patient age, body mass index, or existing comorbidities on clinical outcomes. It was hypothesized that younger patients with lower body mass index and stage would report better results.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, noncomparative study included lipedema patients who underwent liposuction between July of 2009 and July of 2019. After a minimum of 6 months since the last surgery, all patients completed a disease-related questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the need for complex decongestive therapy based on a composite score. Secondary endpoints were the severity of disease-related complaints measured on a visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: One hundred six patients underwent a total of 298 large-volume liposuctions (mean lipoaspirate, 6355 ± 2797 ml). After a median follow-up of 20 months, a median complex decongestive therapy score reduction of 37.5 percent (interquartile range, 0 to 88.8 percent; p < 0.0001) was observed. An improvement in lipedema-associated symptoms was also observed (p < 0.0001). The percentage reduction in complex decongestive therapy scores was greater in patients with a body mass index less than or equal to 35 kg/m2 (p < 0.0001) and in stage I and II patients (p = 0.0019).
CONCLUSION: Liposuction reduces the severity of symptoms and the need for conservative treatment in lipedema patients, especially if it is performed in patients with a body mass index below 35 kg/m2 at an early stage of the disease.

35073621,Prevalence of clinical manifestations and orthopedic alterations in patients with lipedema: A prospective cohort study.,"Lipedema is a chronic disease seen frequently in women that causes abnormal fat deposition in the lower limbs and associated bruising and pain. Despite increasing knowledge concerning lipedema, there are still aspects of diagnosis that need further investigation. We performed a prospective, observational cohort study to describe prevalence of clinical characteristics present in patients with lipedema in an attempt to establish diagnostic criteria. Participants were consecutive patients with lipedema presenting at a public hospital in Spain from September 2012 to December 2019. Patients were examined for the following signs and symptoms of lipedema: symmetrical involvement; disproportion between the upper and lower part of the body; sparing of the feet; pain; bruising; Stemmer' sign; pitting test; fibrosis; venous insufficiency; upper limbs involvement; vascular spiders; skin coldness; and lymphangitis attacks. In addition, orthopedic alterations were examined in all patients. We recruited 138 patients (median age=47.6 years; mean BMI=29.9 Kg/m2). Using waist-to-height-ratio, 41.3% of the patients were slim or healthy. The most frequent type of lipedema was Type III (71%), and most were in stage 1 and 2. The features of lipedema with a prevalence >80% were symmetrical involvement, unaffected feet, pain, bruising, vascular spiders, and disproportion. Pain was nociceptive in 60.2% and neuropathic in 33.1%, and there was a reduced social or working activities in 37.9%. Orthopedic alterations including cavusfeet or valgus-knees were observed in 1/3 of the patients. X-ray of the knees was performed in 63 patients and knee osteoarthritis diagnosed in 37. We found that the most frequent manifestations of lipedema were bilateral involvement, unaffected feet, pain, easy bruising, vascular spiders, and disproportion between the upper and lower parts of the body. These should be considered as major criteria for diagnosis. In addition, our findings on the prevalence of orthopedic alterations in patients with lipedema highlights the need for a multidisciplinary and integrated approach.","['Forner-Cordero I', 'Perez-Pomares MV', 'Forner A', 'Ponce-Garrido AB', 'Munoz-Langa J']",2021,54,4,Lymphology,"Forner-Cordero I, et al.

For these reasons, a therapeutic approach is also complex and sometimes controversial. The inflammation state present in lipedema can be limited by controlling the glycemic peaks. Specifically, the ketogenic diet (KD) seems to have the right conditions to be effective. Herein, we reported a subject diagnosed with lipedema who, with only KD nutritional intervention, achieved a significant weight loss (-41 Kg), with a net decrease in body circumferences, and also reporting an improvement in pain, and therefore in the overall quality of life. She refused other types of intervention and kept KD for two years. This case could represent the first step to organize a KD nutritional protocol specifically applied to lipedema.","['Cannataro R', 'Michelini S', 'Ricolfi L', 'Caroleo MC', 'Gallelli L', 'De Sarro G', 'Onorato A', 'Cione E']",2021,11,12,Life (Basel),"Cannataro R, et al.

34896377,Indocyanine green lymphography as novel tool to assess lymphatics in patients with lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: Lipedema is a chronic and progressive disease associated with lymphatic impairment at later stages. The aim of our study was to describe the functional status and anatomy of lower limb superficial lymphatic system using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography in patients with lipedema.
METHODS: Following ICG injection at the dorsum of the foot, distance (cm) covered by the dye at 10 (T10') and 25 min (T25') was measured and normalized for limb length. If the dye did not reach the groin within 25 min, patients were classified as ""drainage-needing"" group (DNG). Values of fat and lean distribution assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were extracted, and correlation analysis was performed. Furthermore, anatomical patterns of superficial lymphatics were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 45 women were included, 25 (56%) of whom were classified as DNG. Symptoms duration was significantly associated with DNG status at multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14; p = 0.047). Moreover, Spearman's analysis showed a negative correlation between symptoms duration and T25' dye migration (r = -0.469; p = 0.037). Overall, no major anatomical lymphatic changes were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Present study suggests that lymphatic functioning in patients with lipedema correlates with symptoms duration. Further research on larger cohorts should verify our findings and clarify their potential therapeutic implications. Overall, ICG lymphography may be promising technique to assess both lymphatic anatomy and functioning in patients with lipedema.","['Buso G', 'Favre L', 'Maufus M', 'Honorati M', 'Lessert C', 'Depairon M', 'Raffoul W', 'Tomson D', 'Mazzolai L']",2022,140,,Microvasc Res,"Buso G, et al.

34871293,Lipedema Can Be Treated Non-Surgically: A Report of 5 Cases.,"BACKGROUND Lipedema is a chronic progressive disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fat in the subcutaneous region. Both medical and surgical treatments have been described in international guidelines; however, the current literature is biased toward promoting liposuction as the primary treatment of lipedema, and this can lead to the misapprehension that liposuction is the only form of definitive treatment. CASE REPORT In the present study, we report 5 cases at various stages of the evolution of lipedema, all with different therapeutic objectives. Case 1 reported having persistent bruising and pain, case 2 reported pain and fat deposition, case 3 reported night cramps and discomfort, case 4 reported leg thickening, and case 5 reported redness in the legs. All of were diagnosed with lipedema in different evolution stages. Our purpose was to demonstrate the possibility of non-surgical therapy, as well as to improve signs and symptoms of lipedema, using the QuASiL questionnaire and measuring changes in volumes and proportions. Good aesthetic outcomes improve both social and psychological status. CONCLUSIONS Currently, there are many described therapies available for lipedema. Liposuction surgery for lipedema should be considered one possible tool. Treatment objectives can be different for each patient. It is imperative to understand each patient's needs in order to offer the best therapy attainable that meets patient requirements and induces a better quality of life. Non-surgical treatment of lipedema is feasible in selected cases, and it can meet the criteria for achieving selected clinical objectives.","['Amato ACM', 'Benitti DA']",2021,22,,Am J Case Rep,Amato ACM and Benitti DA.

34769153,Lipedema and the Potential Role of Estrogen in Excessive Adipose Tissue Accumulation.,"Lipedema is a painful fat disorder that affects ~11% of the female population. It is characterized by bilateral, disproportionate accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue predominantly in the lower body. The onset of lipedema pathophysiology is thought to occur during periods of hormonal fluctuation, such as puberty, pregnancy, or menopause. Although the identification and characterization of lipedema have improved, the underlying disease etiology remains to be elucidated. Estrogen, a key regulator of adipocyte lipid and glucose metabolism, and female-associated body fat distribution are postulated to play a contributory role in the pathophysiology of lipedema. Dysregulation of adipose tissue accumulation via estrogen signaling likely occurs by two mechanisms: (1). altered adipocyte estrogen receptor distribution (ERα/ERß ratio) and subsequent metabolic signaling and/or (2). increased release of adipocyte-produced steroidogenic enzymes leading to increased paracrine estrogen release. These alterations could result in increased activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), free fatty acid entry into adipocytes, glucose uptake, and angiogenesis while decreasing lipolysis, mitochondriogenesis, and mitochondrial function. Together, these metabolic alterations would lead to increased adipogenesis and adipocyte lipid deposition, resulting in increased adipose depot mass. This review summarizes research characterizing estrogen-mediated adipose tissue metabolism and its possible relation to excessive adipose tissue accumulation associated with lipedema.","['Katzer K', 'Hill JL', 'McIver KB', 'Foster MT']",2021,22,21,Int J Mol Sci,"Katzer K, et al.

34764426,"Key signaling networks are dysregulated in patients with the adipose tissue disorder, lipedema.","OBJECTIVES: Lipedema, a poorly understood chronic disease of adipose hyper-deposition, is often mistaken for obesity and causes significant impairment to mobility and quality-of-life. To identify molecular mechanisms underpinning lipedema, we employed comprehensive omics-based comparative analyses of whole tissue, adipocyte precursors (adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)), and adipocytes from patients with or without lipedema.
METHODS: We compared whole-tissues, ADSCs, and adipocytes from body mass index-matched lipedema (n = 14) and unaffected (n = 10) patients using comprehensive global lipidomic and metabolomic analyses, transcriptional profiling, and functional assays.
RESULTS: Transcriptional profiling revealed >4400 significant differences in lipedema tissue, with altered levels of mRNAs involved in critical signaling and cell function-regulating pathways (e.g., lipid metabolism and cell-cycle/proliferation). Functional assays showed accelerated ADSC proliferation and differentiation in lipedema. Profiling lipedema adipocytes revealed >900 changes in lipid composition and >600 differentially altered metabolites. Transcriptional profiling of lipedema ADSCs and non-lipedema ADSCs revealed significant differential expression of >3400 genes including some involved in extracellular matrix and cell-cycle/proliferation signaling pathways. One upregulated gene in lipedema ADSCs, Bub1, encodes a cell-cycle regulator, central to the kinetochore complex, which regulates several histone proteins involved in cell proliferation. Downstream signaling analysis of lipedema ADSCs demonstrated enhanced activation of histone H2A, a key cell proliferation driver and Bub1 target. Critically, hyperproliferation exhibited by lipedema ADSCs was inhibited by the small molecule Bub1 inhibitor 2OH-BNPP1 and by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Bub1 gene depletion.
CONCLUSION: We found significant differences in gene expression, and lipid and metabolite profiles, in tissue, ADSCs, and adipocytes from lipedema patients compared to non-affected controls. Functional assays demonstrated that dysregulated Bub1 signaling drives increased proliferation of lipedema ADSCs, suggesting a potential mechanism for enhanced adipogenesis in lipedema. Importantly, our characterization of signaling networks driving lipedema identifies potential molecular targets, including Bub1, for novel lipedema therapeutics.","['Ishaq M', 'Bandara N', 'Morgan S', 'Nowell C', 'Mehdi AM', 'Lyu R', 'McCarthy D', 'Anderson D', 'Creek DJ', 'Achen MG', 'Shayan R', 'Karnezis T']",2022,46,3,Int J Obes (Lond),"Ishaq M, et al.

34718498,Crosstalk Between Adipose and Lymphatics in Health and Disease.,"Adipose tissue, once thought to be an inert receptacle for energy storage, is now recognized as a complex tissue with multiple resident cell populations that actively collaborate in response to diverse local and systemic metabolic, thermal, and inflammatory signals. A key participant in adipose tissue homeostasis that has only recently captured broad scientific attention is the lymphatic vasculature. The lymphatic system's role in lipid trafficking and mediating inflammation makes it a natural partner in regulating adipose tissue, and evidence supporting a bidirectional relationship between lymphatics and adipose tissue has accumulated in recent years. Obesity is now understood to impair lymphatic function, whereas altered lymphatic function results in aberrant adipose tissue deposition, though the molecular mechanisms governing these phenomena have yet to be fully elucidated. We will review our current understanding of the relationship between adipose tissue and the lymphatic system here, focusing on known mechanisms of lymphatic-adipose crosstalk.","['Westcott GP', 'Rosen ED']",2022,163,1,Endocrinology,Westcott GP and Rosen ED.

34717741,A randomised controlled multicentre investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing efficacy and safety of surgery versus complex physical decongestive therapy for lipedema (LIPLEG).,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a chronic disorder of the adipose tissue that affects mainly women, characterised by symmetrical, excessive fatty tissue on the legs and pain. Standard conservative treatment is long-term comprehensive decongestive therapy (CDT) to alleviate lipedema-related pain and to improve psychosocial well-being, mobility and physical activity. Patients may benefit from surgical removal of abnormally propagated adipose tissue by liposuction. The LIPLEG trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of liposuction compared to standard CDT.
METHODS/DESIGN: LIPLEG is a randomised controlled multicentre investigator-blinded trial. Women with lipedema (n=405) without previous liposuction will be allocated 2:1 to liposuction or CDT. The primary outcome of the trial is leg pain reduction by ≥2 points on a visual analogue scale ranging 0-10 at 12 months on CDT or post-completion of liposuction. Secondary outcomes include changes in leg pain severity, health-related quality of life, depression tendency, haematoma tendency, prevalence of oedema, modification physical therapy scope, body fat percentage, leg circumference and movement restriction. The primary analysis bases on intention-to-treat. Success proportions are compared using the Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by lipedema stage at a 5% two-sided significance level. If this test is statistically significant, the equality of the response proportions in the separate strata is evaluated by Fisher's exact test in a hierarchical test strategy.
DISCUSSION: LIPLEG assesses whether surgical treatment of lipedema is safe and effective to reduce pain and other lipedema-related health issues. The findings of this trial have the potential to change the standard of care in lipedema.

34687412,Elevated magnetic resonance imaging measures of adipose tissue deposition in women with breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema.,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common co-morbidity of breast cancer therapies, yet factors that contribute to BCRL progression remain incompletely characterized. We investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of subcutaneous adipose tissue were uniquely elevated in women with BCRL.
METHODS: MRI at 3.0 T of upper extremity and torso anatomy, fat and muscle tissue composition, and T
RESULTS: Fat-to-muscle volume fraction in healthy participants was symmetric in the right and left sides (p = 0.51); in BCRL participants matched for age, sex, and BMI, fat-to-muscle volume fraction was elevated on the affected side (fraction = 0.732 ± 0.184) versus right and left side in controls (fraction = 0.545 ± 0.221, p < 0.001). Fat-to-muscle volume fraction directly correlated with muscle T
CONCLUSION: Adiposity quantified by MRI is elevated in the affected upper extremity of women with BCRL and may provide a surrogate marker of condition onset or severity.

34639524,Lipoedema as a Social Problem. A Scoping Review.,"(1) Background: Lipoedema is a disease characterized by excessive bilateral and symmetrical accumulation of subcutaneous tissue in the lower extremities. It is a poorly understood condition, and low awareness of its existence often leads to incorrect diagnosis Initially, lipoedema was considered to be completely independent of lifestyle Currently, however, more and more cases of the coexistence of lipoedema and obesity are described in the literature as additionally affecting the severity of the disease The aim of the review is to present lipoedema as a social problem. (2) Methods: Materials on lipoedema in the social context were selected from 2018-2021. The PRISMA-Scr checklist was used in the review. (3) Results: Research has shown that more than 3/4 of patients with lipoedema are also overweight or obese. Patients with lipoedema have many comorbidities, and their presence negatively affects the quality of life. The quality of life in patients with lipoedema is lower than in healthy patients. (4) Conclusions: The number of studies available on lipoedema is low. Obesity is common in patients with lipoedema. Mental disorders increase the level of experienced pain. Lipoedema significantly reduces quality of life. A healthy lifestyle in patients with lipoedema could be helpful for prevention of complications and disability.","['Czerwińska M', 'Ostrowska P', 'Hansdorfer-Korzon R']",2021,18,19,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Czerwińska M, et al.

34557035,Common and Contrasting Characteristics of the Chronic Soft-Tissue Pain Conditions Fibromyalgia and Lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the common and specific characteristics of fibromyalgia and lipedema, two chronic soft-tissue pain syndromes without curative therapy options.
METHODS: Diseases' characteristics were compared using the findings of extensive literature and the empiric data from two cohorts, both fulfilling standardized diagnostic criteria. Outcome was measured by various socio-demographics, the generic Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Fibromyalgia Severity Questionnaire (FSQ), and the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Empiric SF-36 data were compared to specific population-based norms and between the diagnostic groups, using standardized mean differences (SMD).
RESULTS: Female participants with fibromyalgia (n = 77) and lipedema (n = 112) showed comparable education levels and living situations. Lipedema cases were, on average, 3.9 years younger and BMI 6.3kg/m
DISCUSSION: Fibromyalgia and lipedema share characteristics of clinical phenomenology and comorbid conditions. Disease perception is more pronounced in fibromyalgia than in lipedema, especially in social and role dysfunction, whereas the walking distance was similar for both syndromes. This difference may be explicable by limited coping skills in fibromyalgia.","['Angst F', 'Benz T', 'Lehmann S', 'Sandor P', 'Wagner S']",2021,14,,J Pain Res,"Angst F, et al.

34323062,The association between serum vitamin D and mood disorders in a cohort of lipedema patients.,"OBJECTIVES: The association between serum Vitamin D (Vit. D) and mood disorders in lipedema patients has not been investigated. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between serum Vit. D, depression and anxiety risk.
METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of lipedema patients were investigated by collecting the clinical and demographic data. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton of Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were used to evaluating the risk of depression and anxiety. Serum concentrations of Vit. D were measured. The association between Vit. D levels and both HAM-A and HAM-D scores were statistically examined by bivariate and partial correlations.
RESULTS: Forty lipedema patients were enrolled in this study. Around two-thirds of them had a higher depression or anxiety risk, and 77.5% were under the normal serum Vit. D levels. A significant and inverse correlation was observed between serum Vit. D levels and both HAM-D (r=-0.661, p<0.001), and HAM-A (r=-0.496, p=0.001) scores. This strong association was sustained after the statistical model adjusted for the main potential confounding factors (age, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, and lipedema stages). Additionally, serum Vit. D correlated significantly and inversely with BMI (r=-0.647, p<0.001). Moreover, BMI significantly correlated with HAM-D: r=0.560, p<0.001, and HAM-A: r=0.511, p=0.00.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a strong correlation between Vit. D levels, depression scores, and anxiety scores in lipedema patients. Our results also demonstrate a strong and direct relationship between BMI, Vit. D levels, depression, and anxiety.","['Al-Wardat M', 'Alwardat N', 'Lou De Santis G', 'Zomparelli S', 'Gualtieri P', 'Bigioni G', 'Romano L', 'Di Renzo L']",2021,42,4,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,"Al-Wardat M, et al.

34250078,Leg Volume in Patients with Lipoedema following Bariatric Surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipoedema is characterized as subcutaneous lipohypertrophy in association with soft-tissue pain affecting female patients. Recently, the disease has undergone a paradigm shift departing from historic reiterations of defining lipoedema in terms of classic edema paired with the notion of weight loss-resistant leg volume towards an evidence-based, patient-centered approach. Although lipoedema is strongly associated with obesity, the effect of bariatric surgery on thigh volume and weight loss has not been explored.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, thigh volume and weight loss of 31 patients with lipoedema were analyzed before and 10-18 and ≥19 months after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Fourteen patients, with distal leg lymphoedema (i.e., with healthy thighs), who had undergone bariatric surgery served as controls. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for patient age and initial BMI.
RESULTS: Adjusted initial thigh volume in patients with lipoedema was 23,785.4 mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 22,316.6-25,254.1). Thigh volumes decreased significantly in lipoedema and control patients (baseline vs. 1st follow-up, 
CONCLUSION: SG and RYGB lead to a significant thigh volume reduction in patients with lipoedema.","['Fink JM', 'Schreiner L', 'Marjanovic G', 'Erbacher G', 'Seifert GJ', 'Foeldi M', 'Bertsch T']",2021,37,3,Visc Med,"Fink JM, et al.

34211528,Development of a questionnaire and screening model for lipedema.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is greatly underdiagnosed and there is a lack of low-cost tools to facilitate diagnostic. We created a lipedema screening questionnaire based on a questionnaire for assessing symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to identify relevant clinical questions, develop a screening questionnaire, and construct a model for predicting lipedema.
METHOD: A simplified questionnaire was constructed and administered to a sample of patients with and without lipedema and then the probability of correct diagnosis was analyzed.
RESULTS: All 109 patients who answered the questionnaire were female and all of them understood the questions. A predictive model using individual question scores achieved an excellent probability of correct diagnosis, at 91.2%, and a predictive model based on total score also achieved a good probability of correct diagnosis, at 86.15%.
CONCLUSIONS: The lipedema screening questionnaire is a practical instrument that is quick and easy to administer and can be used with our population for identification of possible lipedema patients, raising the level of suspicion when taking a patient's history and conducting a physical examination.","['Amato ACM', 'Amato FCM', 'Benitti DA', 'Amato LGL']",2020,19,,J Vasc Bras,"Amato ACM, et al.

34178078,"Translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of a lipedema symptoms questionnaire.","BACKGROUND: Lipedema is characterized as abnormal bilateral deposition of fat in the buttocks and legs that may be accompanied by orthostatic edema in women. A questionnaire for assessment of lipedema symptoms has previously been published in German and English to assess treatment progress.
OBJECTIVES: To translate, culturally adapt, and validate the lipedema symptoms assessment questionnaire for Brazilian Portuguese.
METHODS: The process involved three translations and two back-translations performed by independent translators, followed by construction of a consensus version and adaptation according patients' comprehension. The questionnaire was converted into a digital version and administered to 56 volunteers and then administered to 154 patients from a vascular clinic and correlated with volume determined by segmental bioimpedance.
RESULTS: The 20 pre-test patients were female and at least 90% of the interviewees were able to understand the questions in the final phase. Volunteers had a 96.4% rate of comprehension of the digital online version and a mean completion time of 4 minutes. In 154 patients, limb volume was positively correlated with intensity of symptoms, as assessed by the translated questionnaire, and 3 out of 15 questions were weakly correlated with educational level.
CONCLUSIONS: The translated and culturally adapted Brazilian Portuguese version of the lipedema symptoms assessment questionnaire (QuASiL) is a practical tool that is easy and quick to administer and can be used in our population.

34121088,"A Young Woman with Excessive Fat in Lower Extremities Develops Disordered Eating and Is Subsequently Diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Lipedema, and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.","BACKGROUND Lipedema is a loose connective tissue disease that causes disproportionate subcutaneous fat accumulation on the extremities. As a result of the increased subcutaneous tissue accumulation, lipedema is often confused with obesity by both physicians and patients. Poor awareness and limited diagnosis of lipedema contribute to the confusion of lipedema with obesity and can lead to decreased body image acceptance. Patients with lipedema may have anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by a distortion of body image, incorrect self-identification of being overweight, restricted eating behavior, and a relentless pursuit of weight loss. CASE REPORT A young woman with disproportionate fat accumulation on the lower half of her body self-identified as having obesity. She developed restrictive eating behavior and became obsessed with weight loss, resulting in anorexia nervosa. Her disproportionate subcutaneous tissue persisted despite losing weight to reach a nadir BMI of 15 kg/m². After a decade-long struggle, her eating disorder resolved, and she maintained a healthy weight and BMI of 21.5 kg/m² but disproportionate fat remained in her lower body. She experienced increasing leg tenderness, pain, and easy bruising and was diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS Lack of recognition of lipedema by medical professionals and the public as a weight loss-resistant disease can affect body image acceptance. Lipedema was mistaken for obesity by the young woman in this case and likely played a role in her development of an eating disorder. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, are not rare and may be more common in women with lipedema.","['Wright TF', 'Herbst KL']",2021,22,,Am J Case Rep,"Wright TF and Herbst KL.

34049453,Standard of care for lipedema in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a loose connective tissue disease predominantly in women identified by increased nodular and fibrotic adipose tissue on the buttocks, hips and limbs that develops at times of hormone, weight and shape change including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Lipedema tissue may be very painful and can severely impair mobility. Non-lipedema obesity, lymphedema, venous disease, and hypermobile joints are comorbidities. Lipedema tissue is difficult to reduce by diet, exercise, or bariatric surgery.
METHODS: This paper is a consensus guideline on lipedema written by a US committee following the Delphi Method. Consensus statements are rated for strength using the GRADE system.
RESULTS: Eighty-five consensus statements outline lipedema pathophysiology, and medical, surgical, vascular, and other therapeutic recommendations. Future research topics are suggested.

Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema of the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty, with progression to swollen ankles and feet despite dietary caloric restriction. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 165 kg, and underwent a Roux-En-Y gastric bypass. Over 12 months, she lost 74.8 kg. Her trunk significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from hysterectomy surgery, she became progressively weaker and swollen over her entire body. Laboratory test results showed hypoalbuminemia (2.0 g/dL), lymphopenia, and hypolipoproteinemia. She was diagnosed with protein and calorie malnutrition with marked gut edema requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. After restoration of normal protein, her health returned and her pitting edema resolved, but her extremities remained enlarged. She was subsequently diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important, as women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer the consequences of calorie or protein-calorie deficiency in an attempt to lose weight.","['Wright TF', 'Herbst KL']",2021,22,,Am J Case Rep,"Wright TF and Herbst KL.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients (n = 69) who underwent liposuction for treatment of lipoedema between 2004 and 2019, and gathered data on patient age, body mass index, the number of liposuction sessions, and the amount of fat removed per side. The study also prospectively evaluated the QoL in 20 lipoedema patients before and after liposuction using the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphatic diseases questionnaire. The mean age was 50.6 ± 12.8 years, and the average number of liposuction sessions performed was 2.9 ± 1.9, with a mean volume of 1868 ± 885.5 mL of fat removed per side. Before treatment with liposuction, disease-specific QoL in patients with lipoedema was low on every single subscale as well as on the global score and showed a significant improvement in all aspects after liposuction. There was a significant correlation between a higher number of liposuction treatment sessions and general health status in lipoedema patients (P = .007). Liposuction greatly improves the QoL in lipoedema patients. A higher number of liposuction treatment sessions seem to have a positive effect on general health status in these patients.","['Schlosshauer T', 'Heiss C', 'von Hollen AK', 'Spennato S', 'Rieger UM']",2021,18,6,Int Wound J,"Schlosshauer T, et al.

33906512,Choroid plexus perfusion in sickle cell disease and moyamoya vasculopathy: Implications for glymphatic flow.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid exchange have been shown to increase following pharmacologically-manipulated increases in cerebral arterial pulsatility, consistent with arterial pulsatility improving CSF circulation along perivascular glymphatic pathways. The choroid plexus (CP) complexes produce CSF, and CP activity may provide a centralized indicator of perivascular flow. We tested the primary hypothesis that elevated cortical cerebral blood volume and flow, present in sickle cell disease (SCD), is associated with fractionally-reduced CP perfusion relative to healthy adults, and the supplementary hypothesis that reduced arterial patency, present in moyamoya vasculopathy, is associated with elevated fractional CP perfusion relative to healthy adults. Participants (n = 75) provided informed consent and were scanned using a 3-Tesla arterial-spin-labeling MRI sequence for CP and cerebral gray matter (GM) perfusion quantification. ANOVA was used to calculate differences in CP-to-GM perfusion ratios between groups, and regression analyses applied to evaluate the dependence of the CP-to-GM perfusion ratio on group after co-varying for age and sex. ANOVA yielded significant (p < 0.001) group differences, with CP-to-GM perfusion ratios increasing between SCD (ratio = 0.93 ± 0.28), healthy (ratio = 1.04 ± 0.32), and moyamoya (ratio = 1.29 ± 0.32) participants, which was also consistent with regression analyses. Findings are consistent with CP perfusion being inversely associated with cortical perfusion.","['Johnson SE', 'McKnight CD', 'Jordan LC', 'Claassen DO', 'Waddle S', 'Lee C', 'Garza M', 'Patel NJ', 'Davis LT', 'Pruthi S', 'Trujillo P', 'Chitale R', 'Fusco M', 'Donahue MJ']",2021,41,10,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,"Johnson SE, et al.

33870676,Update in the management of lipedema.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a chronic feminine disease that causes abnormal fat deposition in lower limbs and occasionally upper limbs. Easy bruising and pain are common. Lipedema patients suffer from both physical and psychological disability. Despite the relatively high prevalence and the impact on the quality of life, little is known about the disease. Most patients are misdiagnosed as lymphedema or obesity. The aim was to perform a non-systematic review on lipedema literature, related to diagnosis and therapy.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed by three researchers, to retrieve pertinent articles in PubMed Web of Science and ResearchGate from the last 20 years. The documents were selected from systematic reviews, reviews, meta-analyses, consensus documents and guidelines, randomized controlled trials and retrospective, cohort and clinical series.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Regarding pathophysiology, alterations are not exclusively confined to adipose tissue. Lymphatic dysfunction, cardiovascular variations, blood capillary fragility and increased permeability are common. Patients often present with neurological alterations and hormonal malfunction. Elevated cutaneous sodium has been documented. Due to the absence of a defined etiology, evidence-based research is difficult in the management of lipedema.
CONCLUSIONS: The setting of realistic expectations is important for both patient and medical care provider. The major aims of the management are multimodal for improvements in the quality of life; reduction in heaviness and pain, reshaping the affected limbs, weight control, improvements in mobility. Compression garments, physical therapy, exercise regimens, diet and psychological counseling are necessities. For selected patients, surgical treatment is an added option.","['Forner-Cordero I', 'Forner-Cordero A', 'Szolnoky G']",2021,40,4,Int Angiol,"Forner-Cordero I, et al.

33853452,Ultrasound criteria for lipedema diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is characterized by the deposition of abnormal fat in the lower and upper limbs bilaterally. It is a disease with high prevalence and genetic characteristics. Non-specific and non-quantified increases in the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue have previously been demonstrated using magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the thickness of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in predetermined areas as a distinguishing feature between individuals with and without lipedema using ultrasound.
METHODS: Ultrasound images of 89 female patients were analyzed, including patients undergoing clinical investigation for venous insufficiency or lipedema who underwent ultrasound evaluations at our institution. Patients were divided in two groups: with lipedema clinically diagnosed and those without lipedema. They underwent a common Doppler protocol for venous mapping to assess venous insufficiency associated with the evaluation of dermis and subcutaneous thickness at pre-defined points of the lower limbs.
RESULTS: There were 63 patients with lipedema. Anterior thigh, pre-tibial and lateral aspect of the leg and supra-just medial malleolar region were significantly different. Supra-just medial malleolar region was significantly different with BMI above 25. An optimal cutoff value was calculated for the ultrasound diagnosis of lipedema using thickness of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Studied criteria allow use of simple and reproducible ultrasound cutoff values to diagnose lipedema in the lower limbs. Pre-tibial region thickness measurement, followed by thigh and lateral leg thickness are recommended for the ultrasound diagnosis of lipedema.","['Amato ACM', 'Saucedo DZ', 'Santos KDS', 'Benitti DA']",2021,36,8,Phlebology,"Amato ACM, et al.

33814418,Management of large volume liposuction in lipedema patients with von Willebrand disease: A systematic review and treatment algorithm.,"BACKGROUND: When performing large volume liposuction, perioperative management of lipedema patients with coagulation disorders remains challenging due to a lack of clinical experience. With a prevalence of 1% of von Willebrand disease (VWD) in the general population, basic knowledge on diagnostic and adapted surgical strategies are essential for patients' safety.
OBJECTIVE: Based on a selective literature review, the purpose of this article is to present a standardized algorithm for diagnosis and perioperative treatment of VWD patients undergoing large volume liposuction.
METHODS: The databases MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Web of Science were selectively searched with the term ""(((liposuction) OR (surgery)) OR (lipectomy)) AND (((VWD) OR (hemostaseology)) OR (von Willebrand disease))"". Included were articles published in English or German until November 2020.
RESULTS: The evidence for large volume liposuctions in patients with VWD is limited. Experience is largely based on operations with similar bleeding risks. A safe performance requires an adjustment of the surgical technique and a customized perioperative drug substitution plan. According to the current literature, perioperative thromboembolic events appear to be rare with adequate drug treatment.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of the developed diagnostic and treatment algorithm may help further reducing bleeding complications and improve the safety for treated patients.","['Schmidt J', 'Kruppa P', 'Georgiou I', 'Ghods M']",2021,78,3,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,"Schmidt J, et al.

33805070,A Distinct Cytokine Profile and Stromal Vascular Fraction Metabolic Status without Significant Changes in the Lipid Composition Characterizes Lipedema.,"Lipedema is an adipose tissue disorder characterized by the disproportionate increase of subcutaneous fat tissue in the lower and/or upper extremities. The underlying pathomechanism remains unclear and no molecular biomarkers to distinguish the disease exist, leading to a large number of undiagnosed and misdiagnosed patients. To unravel the distinct molecular characteristic of lipedema we performed lipidomic analysis of the adipose tissue and serum of lipedema versus anatomically- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control patients. Both tissue groups showed no significant changes regarding lipid composition. As hyperplastic adipose tissue represents low-grade inflammation, the potential systemic effects on circulating cytokines were evaluated in lipedema and control patients using the Multiplex immunoassay system. Interestingly, increased systemic levels of interleukin 11 (","['Wolf S', 'Deuel JW', 'Hollmén M', 'Felmerer G', 'Kim BS', 'Vasella M', 'Grünherz L', 'Giovanoli P', 'Lindenblatt N', 'Gousopoulos E']",2021,22,7,Int J Mol Sci,"Wolf S, et al.

33683073,High Volume Liposuction in Tumescence Anesthesia in Lipedema Patients: A Retrospective Analysis.,"Lipedema is a chronic, progressive disease that occurs almost exclusively in women and leads to pathological, painful fat growths at the extremities. Only symptomatic therapy can be offered since the etiology of the disease has not yet been clarified. Liposuction in tumescent anesthesia has established itself as a surgical treatment method of choice. The complication rate associated with the procedure and the pharmacological course and safety of treatment in patients with lipedema has not yet been sufficiently studied. The aim of the study was to broaden the evidence on the safety of ambulatory high-volume liposuction in tumescent anesthesia in lipedema patients. Influencing factors of patients (weight, fat content, comorbidities) or the process technique (drug administration, volume of aspirates) should be investigated on the safety and risks of tumescent anesthesia. This was a retrospective data analysis in which data from 27 patients (40 liposuction procedures) treated at the Sandhofer and Barsch lipedema center between 2016 and 2018 were evaluated. The liposuctions were carried out in tumescent anesthesia and using a Power-Assisted Liposuction system. Clinical examinations and regular blood samples were carried out before the procedure, intra- and postoperatively. The procedures lasted an average of 118 minutes and an average of 6111 ml of aspirate was removed. For tumescent anesthesia, patients were given an average lidocaine dose of 34.23 mg/kg body weight and an epinephrine dose of 0.11 mg/kg body weight. No relevant complications associated with drug side effects, hypovolemia or hypervolemia or blood loss were detected. Liposuction under high volume tumescent anesthesia for the treatment of lipedema patients is, even for major intervention, a safe procedure.

33623507,Rest/stress intradermal lymphoscintigraphy in diagnosis of lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by a symmetrical and bilateral swelling of the lower extremities. In general, the feet are not involved. Lipedema is believed to affect nearly 1 in 9 adult women worldwide. Despite this relatively common disease, lipedema is often confused with primary lymphedema or obesity. In clinically advanced lipedema stages, fat continues to build up and may block the lymphatic vessels causing a secondary lymphedema (Lipo-Lymphedema). We consecutively evaluated 54 women with a clinical diagnosis of lower limbs lipedema. Two doses of 99mTc-nanocolloid were injected intradermally at the first intermetatarsal space and in the lateral malleolar area. Two static planar scans were taken at rest immediately following the intradermal injection. Subsequently, all patients were asked to perform an isotonic muscular exercise (stepping) for 2 min. Then, post exercise scans were performed to monitor the tracer pathway. Subsequently, the patient was asked to take a 30-40 min walk (prolonged exercise) and delayed scans were acquired. In early clinical stages, the lymphatic flow is usually preserved and the rest/stress intradermal lymphoscintigraphy may visualize a normal lymphatic drainage with a frequent pattern (tortuous course) of the leg lymphatic pathway. In clinically advanced stages, lymph stagnation areas were observed. Unlike obesity, lipedema fat storage is resistant to dietary regimen, bariatric surgery, and physical activity. Surgical treatment (tumescent liposuction and reductive surgery) is the most effective treatment to remove adipose tissue. Complex decongestive therapies are helpful in reducing the lymph stagnation, especially in patients with advanced lipolymphedema.","['Tartaglione G', 'Visconti G', 'Bartoletti R', 'Ieria FP', 'Salgarello M']",2020,19,4,World J Nucl Med,"Tartaglione G, et al.

33504026,Potential Effects of a Modified Mediterranean Diet on Body Composition in Lipoedema.,"Lipoedema is a subcutaneous adipose tissue disease characterized by the increase in the amount and structure of fat mass (FM) in specific areas, causing pain and discomfort. 95% of patients fail to lose weight in the lipoedema areas. The study was conducted to evaluate body composition and general health status modification in a group of lipoedema patients (LIPPY) and a control group (CTRL) after four weeks of a modified Mediterranean diet therapy (mMeD). A total of 29 subjects were included in the data analysis, divided in two groups: 14 LIPPY and 15 CTRL. After the mMeD, both groups significantly decreased their weight and body mass index; the CTRL also showed a reduction of all the circumferences and all FM's compartments. LIPPY showed a decrease of FM in upper and lower limbs. No significant differences in Δ% between the groups were observed for the lean mass (LM). In LIPPY, an increase in the patients' ability to perform various daily physical activities related to the loss of arms' and legs' fat was observed. According to the European Quality of Life scale, the possibility for LIPPY subjects to perform simple daily activities with less fatigue, pain and anxiety is highlighted. Further long-term studies are recommended to confirm the mMeD as a good strategy for Lipoedema treatment.","['Di Renzo L', 'Cinelli G', 'Romano L', 'Zomparelli S', 'Lou De Santis G', 'Nocerino P', 'Bigioni G', 'Arsini L', 'Cenname G', 'Pujia A', 'Chiricolo G', 'De Lorenzo A']",2021,13,2,Nutrients,"Di Renzo L, et al.

33461763,[Diagnosis and treatment of lipedema in Spain. Results of an online survey].,"INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a chronic and progressive disease. Most studies agree that it is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The aim of this study was to identify the diagnostic characteristics and types of treatment for lipedema in the Spanish population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out through an anonymous 10-item online survey in November- December 2019. The minimum sample size was calculated for a 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error. Information was collected on sociodemographic variables (age, sex, place of residence), diagnostic characteristics and perceived improvement with distinct treatment options.
RESULTS: A total of 463 valid responses were obtained. The mean age at first manifestation was 18.2 (SD: 9.0) years. Onset occurred between the ages of 10 and 19 years in 69% of the patients. It took an average of 19.9 (SD: 10.1) years to receive a diagnosis and 4.9 medical visits. Diagnosis was most frequently made in private clinics by surgeons. Most patients (78.4%) had tried at least three different types of treatment. Weight loss was the most frequent treatment (92%) and compression garments were perceived to be the most effective. Only 34% of respondents had access to financing for compression garments.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no standard treatment for lipedema and patients perceive current treatments to be unsatisfactory. Better knowledge of this entity is needed to allow early diagnosis and provide adequate treatment.","['Vaquero Ramiro E', 'Gutiérrez Retortillo M', 'Goiri Noguera D', 'Morello Ostos P', 'Solera-Martínez M']",2022,56,2,Rehabilitacion (Madr),"Vaquero Ramiro E, et al.

33446179,"Quality of life, its factors, and sociodemographic characteristics of Polish women with lipedema.","BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a type of subcutaneous adipose tissue disorder that affects mainly women. Its main symptom is bilateral fat accumulation on the extremities with associated pain in the affected areas. Despite growing interest in lipedema among patients and medical health professionals, lipedema is still often misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and mistreated. To promote better understanding of lipedema, we aimed to investigate factors related to the quality of life and describe selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of women with lipedema in Poland.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was completed by 98 women with lipedema. The participants responded to questionnaires regarding quality of life, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and depression symptom severity.
RESULTS: The participants reported low quality of life and high severity of depressive symptoms. The more severe the symptoms related to pain, heaviness, and swelling, the lower the quality of life. Further analyses showed that depression severity mediated this relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides initial information on screening questions, lipedema symptoms, and comorbidities, pointing to the areas needing in-depth investigation. Further steps to improve quality of life in women with lipedema and to reduce health costs should include the education of medical health professionals, using diagnostic tools that allow for differentiation among diagnoses and precise health risk assessment, and creating Polish treatment guidelines for lipedema.","['Dudek JE', 'Białaszek W', 'Gabriel M']",2021,21,1,BMC Womens Health,"Dudek JE, et al.

The objective of this French National Diagnosis and Care Protocol (Protocole National de Diagnostic et de Soins; PNDS), based on a critical literature review and multidisciplinary expert consensus, is to provide health professionals with an explanation of the optimal management and care of patients with primary lymphedema. This PNDS, written by consultants at the French National Referral Center for Primary Lymphedema, was published in 2019 ( https://has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2019-02/pnds_lymphoedeme_primaire_final_has.pdf ). Primary lymphedema can be isolated or syndromic (whose manifestations are more complex with a group of symptoms) and mainly affects the lower limbs, or, much more rarely, upper limbs or external genitalia. Women are more frequently affected than men, preferentially young. The diagnosis is clinical, associating mild or non-pitting edema and skin thickening, as confirmed by the Stemmer's sign (impossibility to pinch the skin on the dorsal side or the base of the second toe), which is pathognomonic of lymphedema. Limb lymphoscintigraphy is useful to confirm the diagnosis. Other causes of swelling or edema of the lower limbs must be ruled out, such as lipedema. The main acute lymphedema complication is cellulitis (erysipelas). Functional and psychological repercussions can be major, deteriorating the patient's quality of life. Treatment aims to prevent those complications, reduce the volume with low-stretch bandages, then stabilize it over the long term by exercises and wearing a compression garment. Patient education (or parents of a child) is essential to improve observance.","['Vignes S', 'Albuisson J', 'Champion L', 'Constans J', 'Tauveron V', 'Malloizel J', 'Quéré I', 'Simon L', 'Arrault M', 'Trévidic P', 'Azria P', 'Maruani A', 'French National Referral Center for Primary Lymphedema']",2021,16,1,Orphanet J Rare Dis,"Vignes S, et al.

33303304,Ketogenic diet as a potential intervention for lipedema.,"Lipedema (LI) is a common yet misdiagnosed condition, often misconstrued with obesity. LI affects women almost exclusively, and its painful and life-changing symptoms have long been thought to be resistant to the lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise. In this paper, we discuss possible mechanisms by which patients adopting a ketogenic diet (KD) can alleviate many of the unwanted clinical features of LI. This paper is also an effort to provide evidence for the hypothesis of the potency of this dietary intervention for addressing the symptoms of LI. Specifically, we examine the scientific evidence of effectiveness of adopting a KD by patients to alleviate clinical features associated with LI, including excessive and disproportionate lower body adipose tissue (AT) deposition, pain, and reduction in quality of life (QoL). We also explore several clinical features of LI currently under debate, including the potential existence and nature of edema, metabolic and hormonal dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. The effectiveness of a KD on addressing clinical features of LI has been demonstrated in human studies, and shows promise as an intervention for LI. We hope this paper leads to an improved understanding of optimal nutritional management for patients with LI and stimulates future research in this area of study.","['Keith L', 'Seo CA', 'Rowsemitt C', 'Pfeffer M', 'Wahi M', 'Staggs M', 'Dudek J', 'Gower B', 'Carmody M']",2021,146,,Med Hypotheses,"Keith L, et al.

33291167,[Current review of factors in the stem cell donor that influence the regenerative potential of adipose tissue-derived stem cells].,"BACKGROUND: Regenerative therapies like cell-assisted lipotransfer or preclinical experimental studies use adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) as the main therapeutic agent. But there are also factors depending on the clinical donor that influence the cell yield and regenerative potential of human ASCs and stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Therefore, the aim of this review was to identify and evaluate these factors according to current literature.
METHODS: For this purpose, a systematic literature review was performed with focus on factors affecting the regenerative potential of ASCs and SVF using the National Library of Medicine.
RESULTS: Currently, there is an abundance of studies regarding clinical donor factors influencing ASCs properties. But there is some contradiction and need for further investigation. Nevertheless, we identified several recurrent factors: age, sex, weight, diabetes, lipoedema, use of antidepressants, anti-hormonal therapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: We recommend characterisation of the ASC donor cohort in all publications, regardless of whether they are experimental studies or clinical trials. By these means, donor factors that influence experimental or clinical findings can be made transparent and results are more comparable. Moreover, this knowledge can be used for study design to form a homogenous donor cohort by precise clinical history and physical examination.","['Kuhlmann C', 'Schenck TL', 'Haas EM', 'Giunta R', 'Wiggenhauser PS']",2020,52,6,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Kuhlmann C, et al.

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of subclinical systemic lymphedema and clinical lymphedema of the lower limbs detected by bioimpedance (InBody S10 device, Seoul, Korea) in 258 women with clinically diagnosed lipedema. The patients were divided into three groups based on BMI: Group I - BMI below 30 kg/m
RESULTS:  Fisher's exact test revealed a statistically significant difference between Group I and both Groups II and III (p = 0.0001) regarding the occurrence of lower limb lymphedema.
CONCLUSION: Patients with lipedema can develop edema even when their weight is within the standards of normality. However, obesity is an aggravating factor, as the prevalence of lipedema increases progressively with the increase in weight.","['Pereira de Godoy LM', 'Pereira de Godoy HJ', 'Pereira de Godoy Capeletto P', 'Guerreiro Godoy MF', 'Pereira de Godoy JM']",2020,12,12,Cureus,"Pereira de Godoy LM, et al.

33190432,Physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications in lipedema management: A literature review.,"Lipedema is a chronic and progressive disease of adipose tissue caused by abnormal fat accumulation in subcutaneous tissue. Although there is no known cure for lipedema, possible complications can be prevented with conservative and surgical treatments. One of the conservative treatment options is physiotherapy and rehabilitation (PR). When the literature is examined, few studies focusing on the efficacy of PR were found for this patient group. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of PR applications by compiling existing studies. A bibliographic PubMed search was performed for published studies regarding PR in lipedema management in June 2019 including the last 58 years (1951-2019). Articles were chosen by reading the abstracts and subsequently data were analyzed by reading the entire text through full-text resources. A total of 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results document how lipedema patients are benefited by PR and the effectiveness of different types of PR programs. The current review also showed that complex decongestive physiotherapy, gait training, hydrotherapy, aerobic exercise, and resistance exercise training each have value in the management of lipedema. The effects of PR for the treatment of lipedema are variable among studies, although overall PR seems to be effective in lipedema management. Although physiotherapy applications have a potentially important role in the management of lipedema, they should be used in combination with other treatment modalities. More studies with higher quality are needed to fully demonstrate the effect and efficacy of PR in lipedema patients.","['Esmer M', 'Schingale FJ', 'Unal D', 'Yazıcı MV', 'Güzel NA']",2020,53,2,Lymphology,"Esmer M, et al.

33171717,3D Spheroids Derived from Human Lipedema ASCs Demonstrated Similar Adipogenic Differentiation Potential and ECM Remodeling to Non-Lipedema ASCs In Vitro.,"The growth and differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) is stimulated and regulated by the adipose tissue (AT) microenvironment. In lipedema, both inflammation and hypoxia influence the expansion and differentiation of ASCs, resulting in hypertrophic adipocytes and deposition of collagen, a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The goal of this study was to characterize the adipogenic differentiation potential and assess the levels of expression of ECM-remodeling markers in 3D spheroids derived from ASCs isolated from both lipedema and healthy individuals. The data showed an increase in the expression of the adipogenic genes (ADIPOQ, LPL, PPAR-γ and Glut4), a decrease in matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, 9 and 11), with no significant changes in the expression of ECM markers (collagen and fibronectin), or integrin A5 in 3D differentiated lipedema spheroids as compared to healthy spheroids. In addition, no statistically significant changes in the levels of expression of inflammatory genes were detected in any of the samples. However, immunofluorescence staining showed a decrease in fibronectin and increase in laminin and Collagen VI expression in the 3D differentiated spheroids in both groups. The use of 3D ASC spheroids provide a functional model to study the cellular and molecular characteristics of lipedema AT.","['Al-Ghadban S', 'Pursell IA', 'Diaz ZT', 'Herbst KL', 'Bunnell BA']",2020,21,21,Int J Mol Sci,"Al-Ghadban S, et al. 3D Spheroids Derived from Human Lipedema ASCs Demonstrated Similar Adipogenic Differentiation Potential and ECM Remodeling to Non-Lipedema ASCs In Vitro. 3D Spheroids Derived from Human Lipedema ASCs Demonstrated Similar Adipogenic Differentiation Potential and ECM Remodeling to Non-Lipedema ASCs In Vitro. 2020; 21:(unknown pages). doi: 10.3390/ijms21218350",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33171717/

33167927,Medical crowdfunding in a healthcare system with universal coverage: an exploratory study.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, crowdfunding for medical expenses has gained popularity, especially in countries without universal health coverage. Nevertheless, universal coverage does not imply covering all medical costs for everyone. In countries with universal coverage unmet health care needs typically emerge due to financial reasons: the inability to pay the patient co-payments, and additional and experimental therapies not financed by the health insurance fund. This study aims at mapping unmet health care needs manifested in medical crowdfunding campaigns in a country with universal health coverage.
METHODS: In this exploratory study we assess unmet health care needs in Germany by investigating 380 medical crowdfunding campaigns launched on Leetchi.com . We combine manual data extraction with text mining tools to identify the most common conditions, diseases and disorders which prompted individuals to launch medical crowdfunding campaigns in Germany. We also assess the type and size of health-related expenses that individuals aim to finance from donations.
RESULTS: We find that several conditions frequently listed in crowdfunding campaigns overlap with the most disabling conditions: cancer, mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurological disorders. Nevertheless, there is no strong association between the disease burden and the condition which prompted individuals to ask for donations. Although oral health, lipoedema, and genetic disorders and rare diseases are not listed among leading causes of disability worldwide, these conditions frequently prompted individuals to turn to crowdfunding. Unmet needs are the highest for various therapies not financed by the health insurance fund; additional, complementary, and animal-assisted therapies are high on the wish list. Numerous people sought funds to cover the cost of scientifically poorly supported or unsupported therapies. In line with the social drift hypothesis, disability and bad health status being associated with poor socioeconomic status, affected individuals frequently collected donations for their living expenses.
CONCLUSIONS: In universal healthcare systems, medical crowdfunding is a viable option to finance alternative, complementary, experimental and scientifically poorly supported therapies not financed by the health insurance fund. Further analysis of the most common diseases and disorders listed in crowdfunding campaigns might provide guidance for national health insurance funds in extending their list of funded medical interventions. The fact of numerous individuals launching crowdfunding campaigns with the same diseases and disorders signals high unmet needs for available but not yet financed treatment. One prominent example of such treatment is liposuction for patients suffering from lipoedema; these treatments were frequently listed in crowdfunding campaigns and might soon be available for patients at the expense of statutory health insurance in Germany.",['Lublóy Á'],2020,20,1,BMC Public Health,Lublóy Á.

Throughout infancy, childhood, and adulthood, abnormalities in body composition and in multiple endocrine axes may arise for individuals with Williams syndrome. This review describes the current literature regarding growth, body composition, and endocrine issues in Williams syndrome with recommendations for surveillance and management by the endocrinologist, geneticist, or primary care physician.
RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to known abnormalities in stature, calcium metabolism, and thyroid function, individuals with Williams syndrome are increasingly recognized to have low bone mineral density, increased body fat, and decreased muscle mass. Furthermore, recent literature identifies a high prevalence of diabetes and obesity starting in adolescence, and, less commonly, a lipedema phenotype in both male and female individuals. Understanding of the mechanisms by which haploinsufficiency of genes in the Williams syndrome-deleted region contributes to the multisystem phenotype of Williams syndrome continues to evolve.
SUMMARY: Multiple abnormalities in growth, body composition, and endocrine axes may manifest in individuals with Williams syndrome.

Despite its relative abundance in the human body, the clinical significance of AT in musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine, particularly its role in painful MSK conditions, is under-recognized. Pain associated with AT can be divided into intrinsic (AT as a primary pain generator), extrinsic (AT as a secondary pain generator) or mixed origin. Understanding AT as an MSK pain generator, both by mechanism and its specific role in pain generation by body region, enhances the clinical decision-making process and guides therapeutic strategies in patients with AT-related MSK disorders. This article reviews the existing literature of AT in the context of pain generation in the lower back and lower extremity to increase clinician awareness and stimulate further investigation into AT in MSK medicine.","['Lee SW', 'Van Dien C', 'Won SJ']",2020,1,5,HCA Healthc J Med,"Lee SW, et al.

33030376,Use of upper-limb compression garments in the management of lipoedema.,"Compression hosiery is commonly used for the management of lymphoedema as well as lipoedema, but it is more commonly indicated for the lower limbs than for the upper limbs. The effects of compression hosiery on upper-limb lipoedema are poorly understood and researched. It is known that compression hosiery works in conjunction with activity or movement when standing or walking, which produces anti-inflammatory and oxygenating effects in the tissues. This effect is naturally difficult to realise in the upper limbs. Lymphoedema practitioners who treat those with lipoedema should bear in mind that compression treatment might not produce the same effects in upper-limb lipoedema as it does in lower-limb lipoedema. In these times of an overstretched health service, pragmatic resource use is essential.","['Elwell R', 'Rich A']",2020,25,Sup10,Br J Community Nurs,Elwell R and Rich A.

33001552,Cause and management of lipedema-associated pain.,"Lipedema is a painful, underdiagnosed adipose tissue disorder, characterized by symmetrical swelling of the extremities due to subcutaneous fat deposition in the buttocks, thighs, legs, and arms, sparing the most distal part of the extremities. Although etiology and pathogenesis of lipedema is unclear, possible role of hormonal and genetic factors have been proposed previously. Patients with lipedema suffer from pain, easy bruising, tenderness, and disfigurement. Pain is the leading symptom in lipedema. Since the pain is associated with depression and impaired quality of life, reduction of pain is the major therapeutic approach. Pain in lipedema is attributed to allodynia, exaggerated sympathetic signaling, and estrogens. Although the mechanism of pain in lipedema is uncertain, effective treatment of lipedema should provide a satisfactory pain reduction. Efficacy of the conservative treatment is a matter of debate. Microcannular tumescent liposuction is the most effective therapeutic option for lipedema. There is a large body of evidence that this procedure significantly reduces pain in patients with lipedema.","['Aksoy H', 'Karadag AS', 'Wollina U']",2021,34,1,Dermatol Ther,"Aksoy H, et al.

32934317,Lower extremity lymphatic function predicted by body mass index: a lymphoscintigraphic study of obesity and lipedema.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Patients with obesity and lipedema commonly are misdiagnosed as having lymphedema. The conditions share phenotypic overlap and can influence each other. The purpose of this study was to delineate obesity-induced lymphedema, obesity without lymphedema, and lipedema in order to improve their diagnosis and treatment.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our Lymphedema Center database of 700 patients was searched for patients with obesity-induced lymphedema (OIL), obesity without lymphedema (OWL), and lipedema. Patient age, sex, diagnosis, cellulitis history, body mass index (BMI), and treatment were recorded. Only subjects with lymphoscintigraphic documentation of their lymphatic function were included.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients met inclusion criteria. Subjects with abnormal lymphatic function (n = 46) had a greater BMI (65 ± 12) and cellulitis history (n = 30, 65%) compared to individuals with normal lymphatic function [(BMI 42 ± 10); (cellulitis n = 8, 15%)] (p < 0.001). Seventeen patients had a history of lipedema and two exhibited abnormal lymphatic function (BMI 45, 54). The risk of having lower extremity lymphedema was predicted by BMI: BMI < 40 (0%), 40-49 (17%), 50-59 (63%), 60-69 (86%), 70-79 (91%), ≥80 (100%). Five patients with OIL (11%) underwent resection of massive localized lymphedema (MLL) or suction-assisted lipectomy. Three individuals (18%) with lipedema were treated with suction-assisted lipectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of lymphedema in patients with obesity and lipedema can be predicted by BMI; confirmation requires lymphoscintigraphy. Individuals with OIL are at risk for cellulitis and MLL. Patients with a BMI > 40 are first managed with weight loss. Excisional procedures can further reduce extremity size once BMI has been lowered.","['Greene AK', 'Sudduth CL']",2021,45,2,Int J Obes (Lond),Greene AK and Sudduth CL.

OBJECTIVE: To find out whether the improvements persist for a further 4 years.
METHODS: In 60 patients with lipedema a single-centre study with a mail questionnaire - often in combination with clinical controls - was performed after an average period of 12 years following liposuction(s). All patients in this group had already been surveyed 4 and 8 years after surgery.
RESULTS: Compared with the earlier results improvement persisted with regard to spontaneous pain, sensitivity to pressure, edema, bruising and restriction of movement; similar outcomes were observed for self-assessment of cosmetic impairment, reduction in quality of life and overall impairment. While in the period from 4 to 8 years postoperatively complaints slightly increased, this was not the case for the period 8 to 12 years postoperatively. In addition a similar reduction of conservative treatment (decongestive therapy, compression garments) was observed as after 4 and 8 years postoperatively. Compared with the body weight before liposuction, 55% of the patients showed a reduction of 6.2 kg on average and 43.3% had a weight increase with an average of 7.9 kg.
CONCLUSION: The results show, that the positive effects of liposuction last 12 years postoperatively without relevant worsening.

32792644,The MMP14-caveolin axis and its potential relevance for lipoedema.,"Lipoedema is associated with widespread adipose tissue expansion, particularly in the proximal extremities. The mechanisms that drive the development of lipoedema are unclear. In this Perspective article, we propose a new model for the pathophysiology of lipoedema. We suggest that lipoedema is an oestrogen-dependent disorder of adipose tissue, which is triggered by a dysfunction of caveolin 1 (CAV1) and subsequent uncoupling of feedback mechanisms between CAV1, the matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 and oestrogen receptors. In addition, reduced CAV1 activity also leads to the activation of ERα and impaired regulation of the lymphatic system through the transcription factor prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1). The resulting upregulation of these factors could effectively explain the main known features of lipoedema, such as adipose hypertrophy, dysfunction of blood and lymphatic vessels, the overall oestrogen dependence and the associated sexual dimorphism, and the mechanical compliance of adipose tissue.","['Kruglikov IL', 'Joffin N', 'Scherer PE']",2020,16,11,Nat Rev Endocrinol,"Kruglikov IL, et al.

No specific biomarker has yet been found, and the diagnosis is currently made on clinical grounds alone. Ancillary tests are used only to rule out competing diagnoses. The state of the evidence on treatment is poor. Treatment generally consists of complex decongestive therapy. In observational studies, liposuction for the permanent reduction of adipose tissue has been found to relieve symptoms to a significant extent, with only rare complications. The statutory healthinsurance carriers in Germany do not yet regularly cover the cost of the procedure; studies of high methodological quality will be needed before this is the case.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of lipedema remains a challenge because of the hetero - geneous presentation of the condition and the current lack of objective measuring instruments to characterize it. This review provides a guide to its diagnosis and treatment in an interdisciplinary setting. Research in this area should focus on the elucidation of the pathophysiology of lipedema and the development of a specific biomarker for it.","['Kruppa P', 'Georgiou I', 'Biermann N', 'Prantl L', 'Klein-Weigel P', 'Ghods M']",2020,117,22-23,Dtsch Arztebl Int,"Kruppa P, et al.

32698883,Cross-sectional validity and specificity of comprehensive measurement in lymphedema and lipedema of the lower extremity: a comparison of five outcome instruments.,"BACKGROUND: Literature on the validity of outcome measurement in lymphedema and lipedema is very sparse. This study aimed to examine the convergent, divergent and discriminant validity of a set of 5 instruments in both conditions.
METHODS: Cross-sectional outcome was measured by the generic Short Form 36 (SF-36), the lymphedema-specific Freiburg Quality of Life Assessment for lymphatic disorders, Short Version (FLQA-lk), the knee-specific Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL), the Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90R), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT). Construct convergent/divergent validity was quantified by bivariate correlations and multivariate factor analysis, and discriminant validity by standardized mean differences (SMDs).
RESULTS: Health was consistently better in lymphedema (n = 107) than in lipedema (n = 96). The highest construct convergence was found for physical health between the SF-36 and KOS-ADL (bivariate correlations up to 0.78, factor loads up to 0.85, explained variance up to 56.8%). The second most important factor was mental health (bivariate correlations up to 0.79, factor loads up to 0.86, explained variance up to 13.3%). Discriminant validity was greatest for the FLQA-lk Physical complaints (adjusted SMD = 0.93) followed by the SF-36 Bodily pain (adjusted SMD = 0.83), KOS-ADL Function (adjusted SMD = 0.47) and SF-36 Vitality (adjusted SMD = 0.39).
CONCLUSIONS: All five instruments have specific strengths and can be implemented according to the scope and aim of the outcome examination. A minimum measurement set should comprise: the SF-36 Bodily pain, SF-36 Vitality, FLQA-lk Physical complaints, FLQA-lk Social life, FLQA-lk Emotional well-being, FLQA-lk Health state, KOS-ADL Symptoms, KOS-ADL Function, and the SCL-90R Interpersonal sensitivity.","['Angst F', 'Lehmann S', 'Aeschlimann A', 'Sandòr PS', 'Wagner S']",2020,18,1,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Angst F, et al.

32616854,Increased levels of VEGF-C and macrophage infiltration in lipedema patients without changes in lymphatic vascular morphology.,"Lipedema is a chronic adipose tissue disorder characterized by the disproportional subcutaneous deposition of fat and is commonly misdiagnosed as lymphedema or obesity. The molecular determinants of the lipedema remain largely unknown and only speculations exist regarding the lymphatic system involvement. The aim of the present study is to characterize the lymphatic vascular involvement in established lipedema. The histological and molecular characterization was conducted on anatomically-matched skin and fat biopsies as well as serum samples from eleven lipedema and ten BMI-matched healthy patients. Increased systemic levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C (P = 0.02) were identified in the serum of lipedema patients. Surprisingly, despite the increased VEGF-C levels no morphological changes of the lymphatic vessels were observed. Importantly, expression analysis of lymphatic and blood vessel-related genes revealed a marked downregulation of Tie2 (P < 0.0001) and FLT4 (VEGFR-3) (P = 0.02) consistent with an increased macrophage infiltration (P = 0.009), without changes in the expression of other lymphatic markers. Interestingly, a distinct local cytokine milieu, with decreased VEGF-A (P = 0.04) and VEGF-D (P = 0.02) expression was identified. No apparent lymphatic anomaly underlies lipedema, providing evidence for the different disease nature in comparison to lymphedema. The changes in the lymphatic-related cytokine milieu might be related to a modified vascular permeability developed secondarily to lipedema progression.","['Felmerer G', 'Stylianaki A', 'Hollmén M', 'Ströbel P', 'Stepniewski A', 'Wang A', 'Frueh FS', 'Kim BS', 'Giovanoli P', 'Lindenblatt N', 'Gousopoulos E']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Felmerer G, et al.

32573965,The impact of lower body compression garment on left ventricular rotational mechanics in patients with lipedema-Insights from the three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiographic MAGYAR-Path Study.,"Lipedema is a lymphedema-masquerading symmetrical, bilateral and disproportional obesity. Its conservative maintenance treatment comprises the use of flat-knitted compression pantyhoses. Lipedema is known to be associated with left ventricular morphological and functional alterations. The present study aimed to assess the effects of graduated compression stockings on left ventricular (LV) rotational mechanics measured by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) in lipedema patients. The present study comprised twenty lipedema patients (mean age: 45.8 ± 11.0 years, all females) undergoing 3DSTE who were also compared to 51 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age: 39.8 ± 14.1 years, all females). 3DSTE analysis was performed at rest, and subsequent to 1 hour application of compression class 2 made-to-measure flat-knitted pantyhose. Six lipedema patients showed significant LV rotational abnormalities. Of the remaining fourteen lipedema patients LV basal rotation rotation showed significant reduction, while LV apical rotation showed significant increase with unchanged LV twist after a 60-minute use of compression garment. Significant changes in LV rotational mechanics could be detected among 14 women with lipedema after the use of compression garment however six probands have special LV rotational abnormalities at baseline and/or after compression.","['Nemes A', 'Kormányos Á', 'Domsik P', 'Kalapos A', 'Kemény L', 'Szolnoky G']",2020,10,5,Clin Obes,"Nemes A, et al.

32568462,Neuroimaging of Cerebral Blood Flow and Sodium in Women with Lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: Lipedema is characterized by pain, fatigue, and excessive adipose tissue and sodium accumulation of the lower extremities. This case-control study aims to determine whether sodium or vascular dysfunction is present in the central nervous system.
METHODS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T in patients with lipedema (n = 15) and control (n = 18) participants matched for sex, age, race, and BMI. Standard anatomical imaging and intracranial angiography were applied to evaluate brain volume and vasculopathy, respectively; arterial spin labeling and sodium magnetic resonance imaging were applied to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) (milliliters per 100 grams of tissue/minute) and brain tissue sodium content (millimoles per liter), respectively. A Mann-Whitney U test (significance criteria P < 0.05) was applied to evaluate group differences.
RESULTS: No differences in tissue volume, white matter hyperintensities, intracranial vasculopathy, or tissue sodium content were observed between groups. Gray matter CBF was elevated (P = 0.03) in patients with lipedema (57.2 ± 9.6 mL per 100 g/min) versus control participants (49.8 ± 9.1 mL per 100 g/min).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence that brain sodium and tissue fractions are similar between patients with lipedema and control participants and that patients with lipedema do not exhibit abnormal radiological indicators of intracranial vasculopathy or ischemic injury. Potential explanations for elevated CBF are discussed in the context of the growing literature on lipedema symptomatology and vascular dysfunction.","['Petersen KJ', 'Garza M', 'Donahue PMC', 'Harkins KD', 'Marton A', 'Titze J', 'Donahue MJ', 'Crescenzi R']",2020,28,7,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Petersen KJ, et al.

32561380,Non-contrast MR Lymphography of lipedema of the lower extremities.,"AIM: To assess imaging findings and characteristics of the lymphatic system in patients affected by lipedema and lipolymphedema of the lower extremities on Non-Contrast MR Lymphography (NCMRL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 44 lower extremities in 11 consecutive female patients affected by lipedema, and 11 patients with lipolymphedema were examined by NCMRL. MR imaging was performed on 1.5-T system MR equipment. The examination consisted of one 3D short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) and one heavily T2-weighted 3D-Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) sequence.
RESULTS: All patients showed symmetrical enlargement of the lower extremities with increased subcutaneous fat tissue. The fat tissue was homogeneous, without any signs of edema in pure lipedema patients. In all the extremities with lipolymphedema, high signal intensity areas in the epifascial region could be detected on the 3D-TSE sequence (p < .001) with evidence of mild epifascial fluid collections (p < .001). No sign of honeycomb pattern fat appearance was observed. The appearance of the iliac lymphatic trunks was normal in both lipedema and lipolymphedema patients. Dilated peripheral lymphatics were observed in 2 patients affected by lipedema, indicating a subclinical status of lymphedema, and in 10 patients with lipolymphedema (p = .001). Signs of vascular stasis were observed in both groups, without statistically significant difference (p = .665).
CONCLUSION: NCMRL is a non-invasive imaging technique that is suitable for the evaluation of patients affected by lipedema and lipolymphedema, helping in the differential diagnosis.","['Cellina M', 'Gibelli D', 'Soresina M', 'Menozzi A', 'Martinenghi C', 'Panzeri M', 'Oliva G']",2020,71,,Magn Reson Imaging,"Cellina M, et al.

32560947,Extended overview of the longitudinal pain-depression association: A comparison of six cohorts treated for specific chronic pain conditions.,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to quantify and to compare the associations between longitudinal changes in pain and depression in different chronic pain conditions.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from 6 observational cohort studies. From baseline to the 6-month follow-up, the score changes on the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) bodily pain (pain) and the SF-36 mental health (depression) scales (0=worst, 100=best) were quantified, using partial correlations obtained by multiple regression. Adjustment was performed by age, living alone/with partner, education level, number of comorbidities, baseline pain and baseline depression.
RESULTS: Stronger associations were found between changes in levels of pain and depression for neck pain after whiplash (n = 103, mean baseline pain=21.4, mean baseline depression=52.5, adjusted correlation r = 0.515), knee osteoarthritis (n = 177, 25.4, 64.2, r = 0.502), low back pain (n = 134, 19.0, 49.4, r = 0.495), and fibromyalgia (n = 125, 16.8, 43.2, r = 0.467) than for lower limb lipedema (n = 68, 40.2, 62.6, r = 0.452) and shoulder arthroplasty (n = 153, 35.0, 76.4, r = 0.292). Those correlations were somewhat correlated to baseline pain (rank r=-0.429) and baseline depression (rank r=-0.314).
LIMITATIONS: The construct of the full range of depressive symptoms is not explicitly covered by the SF-36.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate associations between changes in pain and depression levels were demonstrated across 5 of 6 different chronic pain conditions. The worse the pain and depression scores at baseline, the stronger those associations tended to be. Both findings indicate a certain dose-response relationship - an important characteristic of causal interference. Relieving pain by treatment may lead to the relief of depression and vice versa.","['Angst F', 'Benz T', 'Lehmann S', 'Wagner S', 'Simmen BR', 'Sandòr PS', 'Gengenbacher M', 'Angst J']",2020,273,,J Affect Disord,"Angst F, et al.

32525843,Platelet factor 4 is a biomarker for lymphatic-promoted disorders.,"Genetic or acquired defects of the lymphatic vasculature often result in disfiguring, disabling, and, occasionally, life-threatening clinical consequences. Advanced forms of lymphedema are readily diagnosed clinically, but more subtle presentations often require invasive imaging or other technologies for a conclusive diagnosis. On the other hand, lipedema, a chronic lymphatic microvascular disease with pathological accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue, is often misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema; currently there are no biomarkers or imaging criteria available for a conclusive diagnosis. Recent evidence suggests that otherwise-asymptomatic defective lymphatic vasculature likely contributes to an array of other pathologies, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders. Accordingly, identification of biomarkers of lymphatic malfunction will provide a valuable resource for the diagnosis and clinical differentiation of lymphedema, lipedema, obesity, and other potential lymphatic pathologies. In this paper, we profiled and compared blood plasma exosomes isolated from mouse models and from human subjects with and without symptomatic lymphatic pathologies. We identified platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXCL4) as a biomarker that could be used to diagnose lymphatic vasculature dysfunction. Furthermore, we determined that PF4 levels in circulating blood plasma exosomes were also elevated in patients with lipedema, supporting current claims arguing that at least some of the underlying attributes of this disease are also the consequence of lymphatic defects.","['Ma W', 'Gil HJ', 'Escobedo N', 'Benito-Martín A', 'Ximénez-Embún P', 'Muñoz J', 'Peinado H', 'Rockson SG', 'Oliver G']",2020,5,13,JCI Insight,"Ma W, et al.

32459759,Lipedema: A Commonly Misdiagnosed Fat Disorder.,"Lipedema is a fat disorder that is often misdiagnosed. It was first identified at the Mayo Clinic in 1940, but medical schools do not include it in their curriculum and is therefore poorly understood. It presents as disproportionate and symmetrical accumulations of fat (bilateral), which is often accompanied by orthostatic edema. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial, as the disease is progressive and can lead to immobility as well as a significant decrease in the quality of life. Lipedema differs from obesity because it does not respond to diet and exercise. This article gives you a glimpse into what lipedema is about and will help you identify some differences between lipedema and lymphedema. It will also help you identify which surgical procedures have been successful in treating the disease.",['Caruana M'],2020,40,2,Plast Surg Nurs,Caruana M.

Several studies have examined the effectiveness of liposuction in the treatment of lipedema, but none has focused on water-jet-assisted liposuction technique.
METHODS: A standardized treatment protocol for liposuction in lipedema, which was established over the course of 15 years, is presented. Patients received questionnaires preoperatively and after operative treatment assessing characteristics and symptom severity on visual analog scales in a prospective manner.
RESULTS: Pre- and postoperative questionnaires were available for 63 patients. Median age was 35 years and mean (body mass index) BMI 28.4 ± 0.6, all patients had stages I or II lipedema diagnosed by two separate specialists. After a mean follow-up of 22 months after operative treatment, all assessed symptom had decreased significantly in severity. All patients wore compression garments and/or received manual lymphatic drainage preoperatively; this could be reduced to only 44% of patients needing any conservative treatment postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Liposuction in water-jet-assisted technique using the presented treatment protocol is an efficient method of operative treatment of early-stage lipedema patients leading to a marked decrease in symptom severity and need for conservative treatment.","['Witte T', 'Dadras M', 'Heck FC', 'Heck M', 'Habermalz B', 'Welss S', 'Lehnhardt M', 'Behr B']",2020,73,9,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,"Witte T, et al.

32407981,"Adipose Tissue Hypertrophy, An Aberrant Biochemical Profile and Distinct Gene Expression in Lipedema.","BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a common adipose tissue disorder affecting women, characterized by a symmetric subcutaneous adipose tissue deposition, particularly of the lower extremities. Lipedema is usually underdiagnosed, thus remaining an undertreated disease. Importantly, no histopathologic or molecular hallmarks exist to clearly diagnose the disease, which is often misinterpreted as obesity or lymphedema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of the present study is to characterize in detail morphologic and molecular alterations in the adipose tissue composition of lipedema patients compared with healthy controls. Detailed histopathologic and molecular characterization was performed using lipid and cytokine quantification as well as gene expression arrays. The analysis was conducted on anatomically matched skin and fat tissue biopsies as well as fasting serum probes obtained from 10 lipedema and 11 gender and body mass index-matched control patients.
RESULTS: Histologic evaluation of the adipose tissue showed increased intercellular fibrosis and adipocyte hypertrophy. Serum analysis showed an aberrant lipid metabolism without changes in the circulating adipokines. In an adipogenesis gene array, a distinct gene expression profile associated with macrophages was observed. Histologic assessment of the immune cell infiltrate confirmed the increased presence of macrophages, without changes in the T-cell compartment.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipedema presents a distinguishable disease with typical tissue architecture and aberrant lipid metabolism, different to obesity or lymphedema. The differentially expressed genes and immune cell infiltration profile in lipedema patients further support these findings.","['Felmerer G', 'Stylianaki A', 'Hägerling R', 'Wang A', 'Ströbel P', 'Hollmén M', 'Lindenblatt N', 'Gousopoulos E']",2020,253,,J Surg Res,"Felmerer G, et al.

The present study was designed to determine whether lipedema is associated with three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE)-derived left ventricular (LV) deformation abnormalities, and to assess the effects of 1-hour use of medical compression stockings (MCS).
METHODS: The present study comprised 19 female patients with lipedema (mean age: 42.2 ± 12.4 years), compared to 28 age-matched healthy female controls (mean age: 42.0 ± 9.8 years).
RESULTS: Lipedema patients showed larger left atrial and LV dimensions and greater LV ejection fraction than controls, without significant difference in other echocardiography variables. Lipedema patients had greater 3DSTE-derived global and mean segmental LV circumferential and area strains than controls. Following 1-hour use of wearing MCS, neither global and nor mean segmental LV strains showed significant impairment or improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased LV strains could be compensatory effects maintaining LV pumping function in lipedema. Short-term wearing of MCS has no global effect on LV strains.","['Nemes A', 'Kormányos Á', 'Domsik P', 'Kalapos A', 'Gyenes N', 'Kemény L', 'Szolnoky G']",2020,48,8,J Clin Ultrasound,"Nemes A, et al.

32350368,SVF-derived extracellular vesicles carry characteristic miRNAs in lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic, progressive disease of adipose tissue with lack of consistent diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study was a thorough comparative characterization of extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of healthy and lipedema adipose tissue. For this, we analyzed 187 extracellular miRNAs in concentrated conditioned medium (cCM) and specifically in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) enriched thereof by size exclusion chromatography. No significant difference in median particle size and concentration was observed between sEV fractions in healthy and lipedema. We found the majority of miRNAs located predominantly in cCM compared to sEV enriched fraction. Surprisingly, hierarchical clustering of the most variant miRNAs showed that only sEVmiRNA profiles - but not cCMmiRNAs - were impacted by lipedema. Seven sEVmiRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-454-p, miR-144-5p, miR-130a-3p, let-7c-5p) were differently regulated in lipedema and healthy individuals, whereas only one cCMmiRNA (miR-188-5p) was significantly downregulated in lipedema.

32344864,Selenium Deficiency in Lymphedema and Lipedema-A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study from a Specialized Clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Selenium is a trace element, which is utilized by the human body in selenoproteins. Their main function is to reduce oxidative stress, which plays an important role in lymphedema and lipedema. In addition, selenium deficiency is associated with an impaired immune function. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of selenium deficiency in these conditions, and if it is associated with disease severity and an associated medical condition such as obesity.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study is an anonymized, retrospective analysis of clinical data that was routinely recorded in a clinic specialized in lymphology. The data was comprised from 791 patients during 2012-2019, in which the selenium status was determined as part of their treatment.
RESULTS: Selenium deficiency proved common in patients with lymphedema, lipedema, and lipo-lymphedema affecting 47.5% of the study population. Selenium levels were significantly lower in patients with obesity-related lymphedema compared to patients with cancer-related lymphedema (96.6 ± 18.0 μg/L vs. 105.1 ± 20.2 μg/L; 
CONCLUSIONS: In countries with low selenium supply, selenium deficiency is common, especially in lymphedema patients.

Body composition (Fat mass, FM; lean mass, LM) was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The genetic tests for IL-6 (rs18oo795) gene were performed for both groups, using a saliva sample.
RESULTS: The study of the relationship between the IL-6 (rs1800795) gene polymorphism, the anthropometric values and the body composition indices has provided the following significant results: subjects with diagnosis of lipedema present statistically significant increased values with regard to weight, BMI, waist, abdomen and hip circumferences, arms, legs and whole FM (% and kg), gynoid FM (kg), legs LM (kg) and ASMMI. Moreover, the value of the waist hip ratio was found to be decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we suggested that IL-6 gene polymorphism could characterize subjects with lipedema respect to Normal Weight Obese and obese subjects. The intra-group comparisons (LIPPY carriers vs. LIPPY non-carriers and CTRL carriers vs. CTRL non-carriers) showed no statistically significant values. In contrast, the inter-group comparisons (LIPPY non-carriers vs. CTRL non-carriers and LIPPY carriers vs. CTRL carriers) resulted statistically significant. We have identified other indices, such as leg index, trunk index, abdominal index, total index, that could be promising clinical tools for diagnosis of the lipedema phenotype and for predicting the evolution of the disease.","['Di Renzo L', 'Gualtieri P', 'Alwardat N', 'De Santis G', 'Zomparelli S', 'Romano L', 'Marchetti M', 'Michelin S', 'Capacci A', 'Piccioni A', 'Costacurta M', 'Tarsitano MG', 'Franceschi F', 'Merra G']",2020,24,6,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Di Renzo L, et al.

32271105,Survey of lipoedema symptoms and experience with compression garments.,"Lipoedema is an incurable chronic disease causing limb deformity, painful skin and excessive ecchymosis. Compression garments are frequently recommended to manage symptoms, but the existing products are not designed specifically for lipoedema, and are for other medical conditions. A structured questionnaire was prepared in Online Surveys in October 2018 to investigate lipoedema symptoms and the use of compression garments to manage them. Some 279 people with lipoedema completed the survey; 70% wore compression garments in all four compression classes, of which class 2 was most common (58% of wearers). The top three reasons for wearing compression garments were to feel supported (73%), reduce lipoedema pain (67%) and improve mobility (54%). Most people with lipoedema who wore compression garments found compression helpful in managing their symptoms, but overall satisfaction was low. Problems with existing compression garments were so severe in some cases that the garments were not worn at all or used less often. The information collected in this survey might be useful for the design and development of compression garments specifically for lipoedema.","['Paling I', 'Macintyre L']",2020,25,Sup4,Br J Community Nurs,Paling I and Macintyre L.

Optimisation of compression therapy is not a new concept, but, in the UK, the use of 24-hour compression therapy as part of the maintenance phase of treatment has not been standard practice and, until recently, has only been adopted by certain specialist centres. One such modality in the process of optimisation is the use of products that are classed as 'reduced compression' or 'night-time garments'. These are not traditional flat- or circular-knit garments but are made of various components to include foam and, more recently, knitted cotton fabrics.

METHODS: MRI was performed at 3.0 T in females with lipedema (n = 15, age = 43.2 ± 10.0 years, BMI = 30.3 ± 4.4 kg/m
RESULTS: In the calf, skin TSC (16.3 ± 2.6 vs. 14.4 ± 2.2 mmol/L, P = 0.04), muscle TSC (20.3 ± 3.0 vs. 18.3 ± 1.7 mmol/L, P = 0.03), and fat/water (1.03 ± 0.37 vs. 0.56 ± 0.21 ratio, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in participants with lipedema versus control participants. In the forearm, skin TSC (13.4 ± 3.3 vs. 12.0 ± 2.3 mmol/L, P = 0.2, Cohen's d = 0.50) and fat/water (0.65 ± 0.24 vs. 0.48 ± 0.24 ratio, P = 0.07, Cohen's d = 0.68) demonstrated moderate effect sizes in participants with lipedema versus control participants.

32038308,Lymphatic Vasculature in Energy Homeostasis and Obesity.,"Obesity is a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Body mass is regulated by the balance between energy uptake and energy expenditure. The etiology of obesity is determined by multiple factors including genetics, nutrient absorption, and inflammation. Lymphatic vasculature is starting to be appreciated as a critical modulator of metabolism and obesity. The primary function of lymphatic vasculature is to maintain interstitial fluid homeostasis. Lymphatic vessels absorb fluids that extravasate from blood vessels and return them to blood circulation. In addition, lymphatic vessels absorb digested lipids from the intestine and regulate inflammation. Hence, lymphatic vessels could be an exciting target for treating obesity. In this article, we will review our current understanding regarding the relationship between lymphatic vasculature and obesity, and highlight some open questions.","['Ho YC', 'Srinivasan RS']",2020,11,,Front Physiol,Ho YC and Srinivasan RS.

31992537,The clinical characteristics of lower extremity lymphedema in 440 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Lower extremity lymphedema is frequently encountered in the vascular clinic. Established dogma purports that cancer is the most common cause of lower extremity lymphedema in Western countries, whereas chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is often overlooked as a potential cause. Moreover, lymphedema is typically ascribed to a single cause, yet multiple causes can coexist.
METHODS: A 3-year retrospective analysis was conducted of demographic and clinical characteristics of 440 eligible patients with lower extremity lymphedema who presented for lymphatic physiotherapy to a university medical center's cancer-based physical therapy department.
RESULTS: The four most common causes of lower extremity lymphedema were CVI (phlebolymphedema; 41.8%), cancer-related lymphedema (33.9%), primary lymphedema (12.5%), and lipedema with secondary lymphedema (11.8%). The collective cohort was more likely to be female (71.1%; P < .0001), to be white (78.9%; P < .0001), to demonstrate bilateral distribution (74.5%; P < .0001), and to have involvement of the left leg (bilateral, 69.1% [P < .0001]; unilateral, 58.9% [P = .0588]). Morbid obesity was pervasive (mean weight and body mass index, 115.8 kg and 40.2 kg/m
CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients treated in a cancer-affiliated physical therapy department, CVI (phlebolymphedema), not cancer, was the predominant cause of lower extremity lymphedema. One in four patients had more than one cause of lymphedema. Notable clinical characteristics included a proclivity for female patients, bilateral distribution, left limb, cellulitis, and nearly universal morbid obesity.","['Dean SM', 'Valenti E', 'Hock K', 'Leffler J', 'Compston A', 'Abraham WT']",2020,8,5,J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,"Dean SM, et al.

31990592,"Cross-cultural validation of the French version of the Lymphedema Functioning, Disability and Health Questionnaire for Upper Limb Lymphedema (Lymph-ICF-UL).","PURPOSE: Upper limb lymphedema is a vexing morbidity that can occur after the treatment for breast cancer. The Lymphedema Functioning, Disability and Health Questionnaire for Upper Limb Lymphedema (Lymph-ICF-UL) is a valid and reliable tool assessing problems in functioning in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Until now, a French-language version was lacking. The aim of this study was to perform a cross-cultural validation of the French version of the Lymph-ICF-UL questionnaire.
METHODS: A forward-backward translation process between the original language (Dutch) and the target language (French) was performed. Psychometric properties of this final French version were examined in 50 participants.
RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.66 to 0.95. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency were higher than 0.77. Face and content validity were very good because the scoring system was clear for all participants (100%), questions were understandable (100%), and all complaints due to BCRL were mentioned by 78% of the participants. Construct validity was moderate. Convergent validity was established since 3 out of 5 expected domains of the Lymph-ICF-UL showed a moderate correlation with expected domains of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. There was satisfactory divergent validity as 6 out of 9 hypotheses assessing divergent validity were accepted.
CONCLUSION: The French version of the Lymph-ICF-UL is a reliable and valid questionnaire and ready for use in clinical as well as in scientific practice.Implications for rehabilitationSince the introduction of more effective treatment modalities increasing the number of breast cancer survivors, the amount of patients dealing with lymphedema is rising likewise up to a pooled incidence rate of more than 16% of the women treated for breast cancer.The French version of the Lymph-ICF-UL is a reliable and valid questionnaire for assessing problems in functioning of patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema of the arm and/or hand.As the questionnaire provides patient information in the different domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, it facilitates evaluating the impact of breast cancer-related lymphedema on daily functioning.Based on the outcomes of the Lymph-ICF-UL treatment goals can be set, where after the questionnaire can be used to monitor long-term results of this treatment and self-care.","['De Vrieze T', 'Frippiat J', 'Deltombe T', 'Gebruers N', 'Tjalma WAA', 'Nevelsteen I', 'Thomis S', 'Vandermeeren L', 'Belgrado JP', 'De Groef A', 'Devoogdt N']",2021,43,19,Disabil Rehabil,"De Vrieze T, et al.

The adipofascia diseases discussed in this chapter can be localized or generalized and include a common disorder primarily affecting women, lipedema, and four rare diseases, familial multiple lipomatosis, angiolipomatosis, Dercum disease, and multiple symmetric lipomatosis. The fat in adipofascial disorders is difficult to lose by standard weight loss approaches, including lifestyle (diet, exercise), pharmacologic therapy, and even bariatric surgery, due in part to tissue fibrosis. In the management of obesity, healthcare providers should be aware of this difficulty and be able to provide appropriate counseling and care of these conditions. Endocrinologists and primary care providers alike will encounter these conditions and should consider their occurrence during workup for bariatric surgery or hypothyroidism (lipedema) and in those that manifest, or are referred for, dyslipidemia or diabetes (Dercum disease). People with angiolipomas should be worked up for Cowden’s disease where a mutation in the gene PTEN increases their risk for thyroid and breast cancer.

31764671,New Insights on Lipedema: The Enigmatic Disease of the Peripheral Fat.,"BACKGROUND: Although a large number of adult women worldwide are affected by lipedema, the physiologic conditions triggering onset and progression of this chronic disease remain enigmatic. In the present study, a descriptive epidemiologic situation of postoperative lipedema patients is presented.
METHODS: The authors developed an online survey questionnaire for lipedema patients in Germany. The survey was conducted on 209 female patients who had been diagnosed with lipedema and had undergone tumescent liposuction.
RESULTS: Most of the participants (average age, 38.5 years) had noticed a first manifestation of the disease at the age of 16. It took a mean of 15 years to accomplish diagnosis. Liposuction led to a significant reduction of pain, swelling, tenderness, and easy bruising as confirmed by the majority of patients. Hypothyroidism [n = 75 (35.9 percent) and depression [n = 48 (23.0 percent)] occurred at a frequency far beyond the average prevalence in the German population. The prevalence of diabetes type 1 [n = 3 (1.4 percent)], and diabetes type 2 [n = 2 (1 percent)] was particularly low among the respondents. Forty-seven of the lipedema patients (approximately 22.5 percent) suffered from a diagnosed migraine. Following liposuction, the frequency and/or intensity of migraine attacks became markedly reduced, as stated by 32 patients (68.1 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life increases significantly after surgery with a reduction of pain and swelling and decreased tendency to easy bruising. The high prevalence of hypothyroidism in lipedema patients could be related to the frequently observed lipedema-associated obesity. The low prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension appears to be a specific characteristic distinguishing lipedema from lifestyle-induced obesity.","['Bauer AT', 'von Lukowicz D', 'Lossagk K', 'Aitzetmueller M', 'Moog P', 'Cerny M', 'Erne H', 'Schmauss D', 'Duscher D', 'Machens HG']",2019,144,6,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Bauer AT, et al.

31674863,Does tumescent liposuction damage the lymph vessels in lipoedema patients?,"BACKGROUND: Lymphatic insufficiency might play a significant role in the pathophysiology of lipoedema. Liposuction is up to now the best treatment. As liposuction is invasive, the technique could destruct parts of the lymphatic system and by this aggravate the lymphatic component and/or induce lymphoedema. We investigated the function of the lymphatic system in lipoedema patients before and after tumescent liposuction and thus whether tumescent liposuction can be regarded as a safe treatment.
METHODS: Lymphoscintigraphy was performed to quantify the lymph outflow of 117 lipoedema patients. Mean clearance percentages of radioactive protein loaded after 1 min with respect to the total injected dose and corrected for decay of the radiopharmaceutical in the subcutaneous lymphatics were used as functional quantitative parameters as well as the clearance percentages and inguinal uptake 2 h post injection. The results of lymphatic function in lipoedema patients were compared with values obtained from normal healthy volunteers. We also compared 50 lymphoscintigraphies out of the previous 117 lipoedema patients before and six months after tumescent liposuction.
RESULTS: In 117 lipoedema patients clearance 2 h post injection in the right and left foot was disturbed in 79.5 and 87.2% respectively. The inguinal uptake 2 h post injection in the right and left groin was disturbed in 60.3 and 64.7% respectively. In 50 lipoedema patients mean clearance and inguinal uptake after tumescent liposuction were slightly improved, 0.01 (p = 0.37) versus 0.02 (p = 0.02), respectively. This is statistically not relevant in clearance.
CONCLUSION: Lipoedema legs have a delayed lymph transport. Tumescent liposuction does not diminish the lymphatic function in lipoedema patients, thus tumescent liposuction can be regarded as a safe treatment.","['van de Pas CB', 'Boonen RS', 'Stevens S', 'Willemsen S', 'Valkema R', 'Neumann M']",2020,35,4,Phlebology,"van de Pas CB, et al.

METHODS:  Patients with lipedema receiving lymphoscintigraphy between January 2015 and October 2017 were included. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and lymphoscintigraphic findings were extracted. Klienhan's transport index (TI) was utilized to assess lymphatic flow in patient's lower extremities (LEs).Scores ranged from 0 to 45, with values > 10 denoting pathologic lymphatic transport.
RESULTS:  A total of 19 total patients with lipedema underwent lymphoscintigraphic evaluation. Mean age was 54.8 years and mean body mass index was 35.9 kg/m

It almost exclusively affects women, leading to considerable disability, daily functioning impairment, and psychosocial distress. Literature shows both scarce and conflicting data regarding its prevalence. Lipedema has been considered a rare entity by several authors, though it may be a far more frequent condition than thought. Despite the clinical impact on women's health, lipedema is in fact mostly unknown, underdiagnosed, and too often misdiagnosed with other similarly presenting diseases. Polygenic susceptibility combined with hormonal, microvascular, and lymphatic disorders may be partly responsible for its development. Furthermore, consistent information on lipedema pathophysiology is still lacking, and an etiological treatment is not yet available. Weight loss measures exhibit minimal effect on the abnormal body fat distribution, resulting in eating disorders, increased obesity risk, depression, and other psychological complaints. Surgical techniques, such as liposuction and excisional lipectomy, represent therapeutic options in selected cases. This review aims to outline current evidence regarding lipedema epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management.

31461015,Adipose Stem Cells from Lipedema and Control Adipose Tissue Respond Differently to Adipogenic Stimulation In Vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is characterized by localized accumulation of fat in the extremities, which is typically unresponsive to dietary regimens or physical activity. Although the disease is well described and has a high incidence, little is known regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology of lipedema adipose cells in vitro.
METHODS: Adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from lipoaspirates derived from lipedema and nonlipedema patients undergoing tumescent liposuction. In vitro differentiation studies were performed for up to 14 days using adipogenic or regular culture medium. Supernatants and cell lysates were tested for adiponectin, leptin, insulin-like growth factor-1, aromatase (CYP19A1), and interleukin-8 content at days 7 and 14, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Adipogenesis was evaluated by visualizing and measuring cytoplasmic lipid accumulation.
RESULTS: Lipedema adipose-derived stem cells showed impeded adipogenesis already at early stages of in vitro differentiation. Concomitant with a strongly reduced cytoplasmic lipid accumulation, significantly lower amounts of adiponectin and leptin were detectable in supernatants from lipedema adipose-derived stem cells and adipocytes compared with control cells. In addition, lipedema and nonlipedema cells differed in their expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, aromatase (CYP19A1), and interleukin-8 and in their proliferative activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings indicate that in vitro adipogenesis of lipedema adipose-derived stem cells is severely hampered compared with nonlipedema adipose-derived stem cells. Lipedema adipose cells differ not only in their lipid storage capacity but also in their adipokine expression pattern. This might serve as a valuable marker for diagnosis of lipedema, probably from an early stage on.","['Bauer AT', 'von Lukowicz D', 'Lossagk K', 'Hopfner U', 'Kirsch M', 'Moog P', 'Bauer H', 'Machens HG', 'Schmauss D']",2019,144,3,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Bauer AT, et al.

31448007,[Lymphedema complicated with verrucous papillomatosis].,"Limb lymphedemas are due to a malfunction of the lymphatic system responsible for lymph stasis in the interstitial tissue and secondarily to an increase in the volume of the affected limb. They are divided into primary lymphedema (PL) and secondary lymphedema (SL). SLs develop most frequently in lower limbs after breast cancer treatment while lymphedemas are either secondary (iatrogenic or infectious) or primitive, most often sporadic, sometimes familial or they can be part of syndromes resulting in malformations and/or more complex genetics in upper limbs. The diagnosis of lymphedema is essentially based on clinical examination. Erysipelas are the main complication of lymphedema. Other abnormalities are often visible: yellowish skin and nails, lymphangiectasias, keratotic papules with papillomatosis, lichenified plaques. The main differential diagnosis in patients with limb lymphedema is lipoedema, defined as body fat distribution from the hips up to the ankles and affecting almost exclusively obese women. We report the case of a 30 year old man with left lower limb lymphedema occurred at puberty complicated by verrucous papillomatosis.

V.). This survey collected responses to questions about pain and pain characteristics as well as demographic data. It revealed that only a little more than 50 % of respondents were genuine cases of obesity. Lipoedema and obesity must therefore be regarded as clinical pictures unrelated to one another. The pain was mostly described as pressing and tearing in nature. Attributes such as throbbing or pulsing, consistent with acute inflammation, were rated as ""not applicable"". Symptoms were independent of the BMI, which is only useable to a limited extent in lipohyperplasia dolorosa. On the whole, the main symptom ""pain"" is multi-faceted. The study initiated by the German Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) must therefore be viewed critically. Congenital (as opposed to acquired) lipoedema fat on the extremities significantly impairs a person's ability to undertake activities in general as well as leisure activities. Since no objectively verifiable findings in lipoedema can be ascertained thus far, the diagnosis should be based on a careful patient survey.","['Gensior MHL', 'Cornely M']",2019,51,4,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Gensior MHL and Cornely M.

31412387,[Whole-body surface assessment - implementation and experiences with 360° 3D whole-body scans: opportunities to objectively monitor the extremities and the body trunk].,"BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional surface imaging (3DSI) has proven to be useful in providing objective aid to the planning process and documentation of various plastic-surgical procedures. Although this technology is routinely used in the surface and volume analysis of the face and breast, it has been of limited use in registering and quantifying the resulting changes to the entire body surface. The aim of this study was the clinical implementation of 360° whole-body scans to evaluate the treatment of lipoedema.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three 3DSI devices (Eva, Thor and Sense) were tested for precision and reproducibility regarding whole-body scans. Using a standardised setup consisting of an automatic turntable and predetermined body poses, human subjects were analysed by measuring axial circumferences and quantifying defined layers of body volume. The relevant statistical and clinical deviations were subsequently evaluated.
RESULTS: A standardised procedure for 360° scans was successfully implemented. All tested scanners yielded sufficient results with respect to intraindividual reproducibility (p > 0.05). The Eva and Thor scanners delivered comparable results for axial circumference and volume analysis (p > 0.05). The Sense scanner allowed for a precise analysis in the area of the body trunk, but had significant deficits regarding the lower extremity (p < 0.05). The data analysis was then successfully applied to selected clinical cases.
CONCLUSION: A procedure to reproducibly capture and analyse the human body was successfully established for clinical use in plastic surgery. Two of the tested 3DSI devices allowed for an objective surface and volume analysis of the human body. The third scanner (Sense) offered the ability to perform 360° scans at a low cost, albeit lacking in precision when applied to certain areas of the body. These findings may help to objectively evaluate the effects of different procedures on the entirety of the body surface in the future.","['Etzel L', 'Koban KC', 'Li Z', 'Frank K', 'Giunta RE', 'Schenck TL']",2019,51,4,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Etzel L, et al.

31318091,The mitral annulus in lipedema: Insights from the three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic MAGYAR-Path Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a barely recognized and poorly diagnosed, but common disease affecting almost exclusively female patients. The pathomechanism of lipedema is not known, and clinically, it is a bilateral, symmetrical, disproportional fatty enlargement of the lower half of the body, the disease does not affect the feet, and the upper extremities are often involved. Since lipedema is associated with increased aortic stiffness and altered left ventricular (LV) rotational mechanics, the present study was designed to compare the size and function of the mitral annulus (MA) between lipedema patients and controls by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE).
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with stage 2 lipedema and 48 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched healthy control patients were included in the study. Each person from the lipedema and the control groups underwent two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and 3DSTE.
RESULTS: Significantly enlarged left atrial diameter, LV end-diastolic diameter and volume, and LV end-systolic volume could be detected in lipedema patients as compared to controls. None of the lipedema patients and controls showed ≥grade 1 mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated end-systolic and end-diastolic MA diameter, area, and perimeter could be demonstrated in lipedema patients as compared to controls, and these changes were accompanied by impaired MA fractional area change at rest. Following 1-hour use of compression stockings, no significant improvement was seen in these parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipedema is associated with MA enlargement and functional impairment. The use of compression stockings does not improve these alterations.","['Nemes A', 'Kovács Z', 'Kormányos Á', 'Domsik P', 'Kalapos A', 'Piros GÁ', 'Kemény L', 'Forster T', 'Szolnoky G']",2019,36,8,Echocardiography,"Nemes A, et al.

METHODS: The authors collected articles through a search into Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and the Cochrane Review. Search terms used included ""Lipoedema,"" ""Lipedema,"" ""psychological status,"" ""Quality of life,"" ""Health related quality of life,"" and ""HRQOL.""
RESULTS: A total of four observational studies were evaluated. The included studies were moderate-quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Three of the included studies demonstrated deterioration of HRQOL and psychological status in patients with lipedema. These studies also identify that pain and tenderness are a more common and dominant characteristic.
CONCLUSION: Future studies should establish a specific approach to treat and manage lipedema symptoms. Based on this narrative review of the literature findings, we recommended for the health care provider to pay more attention to HRQOL and psychological status. Moreover, validated and adapted measures of HRQOL and psychological status for patients with lipedema are required.

30870871,[The Swollen Leg in Vascular Medical Practice].,"In case of an acute leg swelling a deep leg vein thrombosis needs to be excluded. In order to do this, compression sonography and the D-dimer-test are applied in the framework of an established diagnostic algorithm. The ensuing therapy consists in anticoagulation and compression.In case of a chronic leg swelling anamnesis and a clinical check-up often lead to a differential diagnosis. Chronic venous insufficiency is a generic term for a disturbed venous backflow. It is caused by an obstruction or an antegrade or retrograde flow insufficiency. Most common diseases in this context are varicosis or a post-thrombotic syndrome. Sonography and special function tests provide a diagnosis. The basic therapy consists in regular exercise, normalization of weight and compression therapy. In case of a hemodynamically relevant varicose vein surgery or endovascular treatment is advisable. The post-thrombotic syndrome must be treated consistently with the basic therapy.A lymphedema may be hereditary or acquired. In a first step diseases like neoplasia need to be excluded. The initial therapy consists in manual lymph drainage in combination with special compression bandages. Flat knit stockings should be prescribed.

30689902,"Clinical Features of Nonobese, Apparently Healthy, Japanese Men With Reduced Adipose Tissue Insulin Sensitivity.","CONTEXT: Adipose tissue insulin resistance has been observed in obese subjects and is considered an early metabolic defect that precedes insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Although Asians can readily develop metabolic disease without obesity, the clinical features of nonobese, apparently healthy, Asians with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (ATIS) have not been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical parameters associated with reduced ATIS in nonobese, apparently healthy (body mass index <25 kg/m2), Japanese men.
METHODS: We studied 52 nonobese Japanese men without cardiometabolic risk factors. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with a glucose tracer, we evaluated the insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. ATIS was calculated as the percentage of free fatty acid (FFA) suppression/insulin concentration during the first step of the glucose clamp.
RESULTS: Using the median ATIS value, the subjects were divided into low- and high-FFA suppression groups. The low-FFA suppression group had moderate fat accumulation in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. Compared with the high-FFA group, they also had a lower fitness level, decreased insulin clearance, impaired insulin sensitivity in muscle, moderately elevated triglycerides, and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these factors correlated significantly with ATIS. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was comparable between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In nonobese, apparently healthy, Japanese men, reduced ATIS was associated with moderate fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and liver, lower insulin clearance, muscle insulin resistance, and moderate lipedema. These data suggest that reduced ATIS can occur early in the development of the metabolic syndrome, even in nonobese, apparently healthy, men.","['Sugimoto D', 'Tamura Y', 'Takeno K', 'Kaga H', 'Someya Y', 'Kakehi S', 'Funayama T', 'Furukawa Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Kadowaki S', 'Nishitani-Yokoyama M', 'Shimada K', 'Daida H', 'Aoki S', 'Kanazawa A', 'Kawamori R', 'Watada H']",2019,104,6,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"Sugimoto D, et al.

A precise summary of all described protocols and a critical evaluation have not been published to date. This review aims to create a basic structure for future Standard Operative Protocols (SOPs) in the surgical treatment of lipoedema.

30620977,[Quantitative volumetric analysis of the lower extremity: validation against established tape measurement and water displacement].,"BACKGROUND: Tape measures continue to be used for the diagnosis and evaluation of lipoedema and lymphoedema in the clinical routine. Extremity volumes are calculated based on standardised circumferential measurements. Other volume measurements such as water displacement are not applied on a regular basis. This study aimed to evaluate a 3D scanner as an alternative and reproducible tool to objectively measure the volumes of the lower extremity.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHOD: We used a commercially available 3D scanner, the Artec Eva
RESULTS: There were no significant deviations between the results from 3D volumetry and water displacement (p > 0.05). The cone method significantly overestimated the volume measured by water displacement and 3D volumetry. The disc method revealed no statistically significant differences, but clinically relevant differences with a high variance in the 95 % confidence interval. All methods demonstrated high positive correlations with each other. Water displacement was the most timeconsuming method.
CONCLUSION: Our findings obtained from the examination of 40 lower extremities show that 3D scans and software-based volumetric calculations can achieve objective and reproducible measurements in a relatively short time. The deviation from the gold-standard method of water displacement is small. Compared with the cone and disc method, however, we observed clinically relevant deviations with a high variance. We therefore recommend the 3D scan procedure for the objective documentation of conservative and surgical treatments for lipoedema or lymphoedema and have incorporated it into our clinical routine.","['Koban KC', 'Titze V', 'Etzel L', 'Frank K', 'Schenck T', 'Giunta R']",2018,50,6,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Koban KC, et al.

30620976,[Imaging for treatment planning in lipo-and lymphedema].,"Lipoedema is a progressive disease, which predominantly affects women. It is characterised by circumferential growth, with increase in fat tissue of the extremities, and can lead to oedema. In contrast, the lymphoedema is defined by a specific lymphatic drainage disorder and can lead to fibrosis of the surrounding connective tissue. While lipoedema is diagnosed through clinical symptoms and diagnostic imaging can usually only be used to rule out comorbidities, lymphatic drainage disorder can be visualised using imaging methods. Ultrasound is a basis diagnostic tool to show retained interstitial fluid in lip- and lymphoedema. Lymphoscintigraphy is considered to be the gold standard to demonstrate a lymphatic drainage disorder, which can be combined with computed tomography. Indocyanine green(ICG) lymphography is a dynamic imaging tool, which is of increasing significance due to its possible intraoperative use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lymphography has the ability to visualise a lymphoedema and a lymphatic drainage disorder in three dimensions and is therefore considered to be a meaningful supplement. Therapy of lip- and lymphoedema should always be based on a combination of conservative and surgical strategies. While liposuction and other resection procedures can lead to symptom relief in lipedoema or advanced lymphoedema, newer reconstructive procedures such as lymph node transplantation or lymphovenous anastomoses are modern techniques to treat lymphoedema. A long lasting volume reduction can be achieved by creating new lymphatic pathways leading to improved quality of life and reduced symptoms.","['Zetzmann K', 'Ludolph I', 'Horch RE', 'Boos AM']",2018,50,6,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,"Zetzmann K, et al.

These changes are related to prolonged lymph stasis and contribute to an increased risk of infection. Similarly, lipedema is associated with skin thickening and appearance of nodular adipose deposition. Skin care is essential in both conditions. We examined whether inclusion of targeted skin products for 2 weeks to an established pre-surgical conservative treatment program was associated with beneficial effects on the skin condition in 150 patients with lymphedema and lipedema. Patients were randomly assigned to control or one of two treatment groups. All three groups (and for both lymphedema and lipedema) demonstrated a significant reduction in softness. Dimpling/ redness was significantly reduced in the targeted skin product groups for both patients with lymphedema or lipedema. Only patients with lipedema demonstrated a significant reduction in dryness/ hyperkeratosis following targeted skin product treatment. This study demonstrates that short-term use of targeted skin products in both patients with lymphedema and lipedema can be of benefit and further studies are needed to replicate these results and explore possible mechanisms.","['Campisi CC', 'Ryan M', 'di Summa P', 'Scarabosio A', 'Campisi CS', 'Campisi C']",2019,52,4,Lymphology,"Campisi CC, et al.

DESIGN: Individuals with WS had outpatient assessment at Massachusetts General Hospital. Controls were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005-2006).
PATIENTS: A total of 22 individuals with WS, each matched by age, sex and race to four NHANES controls.
MEASUREMENTS: Blood sampling, oral glucose tolerance test, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan.
RESULTS: WS and control groups were 59% female and 29 ± 8 years old. Compared to controls, individuals with WS were shorter but had similar body weight, with more fat and less lean mass. Per cent body fat was higher in WS even after adjusting for BMI (+2.1% [95% CI 0.4, 3.9%]). Four WS patients had abnormal lower extremity fat accumulation resembling lipedema. HbA1c (+0.5% [0.2, 0.7]) and 2-hour glucose (+68 mg/dL [44, 93]) were higher in WS vs controls, differences which persisted after adjusting for BMI. Fasting glucose was comparable between groups. LDL (-18 mg/dL [-35, -2]) and triglycerides (-45 mg/dL [-87, -2]) were significantly lower in WS. Whole-body BMD was significantly lower (-0.15 g/cm

It essentially affects females and is often misdiagnosed as lymphoedema or obesity. It is globally misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, and the literature is lacking appropriate guidance to assist clinicians towards this diagnosis. However, the need to recognise this disorder as a unique entity has important implications to establish proper treatment and, therefore, its tremendous effect on patients. Early diagnosis and treatment can turn these patients' lives upside down. The aim of this review is to focus on the clinical guidance, differential diagnosis, and management strategies. In addition, other aspects of lipoedema, including epidemiology and pathogenesis, are also being discussed here. Lipoedema is distinct from obesity and distinct from lymphoedema, although it might progress to involve the venous and lymphatic system (venolipedema or lympholipedema or both). Late diagnosis can leave the patient debilitated. Management of lipoedema includes weight loss, control of oedema, complex decongestive physiotherapy, liposuction, and laser-assisted lipolysis. However; there are increasing reports on tumescent liposuction as the preferred surgical option with long-lasting results. The role of more randomised controlled studies to further explore the management of this clinical entity remains promising.","['Shavit E', 'Wollina U', 'Alavi A']",2018,15,6,Int Wound J,"Shavit E, et al.

29951853,[S1 guideline on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)].,"Under the direction of the German Society of Phlebology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Phlebologie) and in cooperation with other specialist associations, the S1 guideline on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) was adopted in January 2018. It replaces the previous guideline from March 2005. The aim of the guideline is to optimize the indication and therapeutic use of IPC in vascular diseases and edema. An extensive literature search of MEDLINE, existing guidelines, and work relevant to the topic was performed. In view of the often methodologically weak study quality with often small numbers of cases and heterogeneous treatment protocols, recommendations can often only be derived from the available data using good clinical practice/expert consensus. Intermittent pneumatic compression is used for thromboembolism prophylaxis, decongestive therapy for edema, and to positively influence arterial and venous circulation to improve clinical symptoms and accelerate ulcer healing in both the outpatient and inpatient care setting. The therapy regimens and devices used depend on the indication and target location. They can be used as outpatient and inpatient devices as well as at home for long-term indications. A target indication is thrombosis prophylaxis. IPC should be used in severe chronic venous insufficiency (stages C4b to C6), in extremity lymphedema as an add-on therapy and in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) with stable intermittent claudication or critical ischemia. IPC can be used in post-traumatic edema, therapy-resistant venous edema, lipedema and hemiplegia with sensory deficits and edema. Absolute and relative contraindications to IPC must be taken into account and risks considered and avoided as far as possible. Adverse events are extremely rare if IPC is used correctly. If the indication and application are correct-also as an add-on therapy-it is a safe and effective treatment method, especially for the treatment of the described vascular diseases and edema as well as thrombosis prophylaxis.","['Schwahn-Schreiber C', 'Breu FX', 'Rabe E', 'Buschmann I', 'Döller W', 'Lulay GR', 'Miller A', 'Valesky E', 'Reich-Schupke S']",2018,69,8,Hautarzt,"Schwahn-Schreiber C, et al.

29927481,Validation of a short-form of the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphoedema (FLQA-LS) instrument.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphoedema (CLE) is a burdensome disease of multiple causes leading to significant reductions in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A specific method to assess HRQoL is the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphoedema (FLQA-L), which consists of 92 items.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a short form of the FLQA-L with improved psychometric properties and feasibility.
METHODS: The FLQA-L validation data were reanalysed by patients and experts. The application of factor analysis enabled the exclusion of lower-load items. An optimized short version of the questionnaire (FLQA-LS) with 33 items was generated and tested in a validation study on patients with different forms of CLE.
RESULTS: In total, 348 patients with CLE of the upper or lower extremities were included (mean age 57.3 years, range 24-89; 90.8% female), and data from 301 patients could be analysed. Overall, 42.8% of the patients had secondary lymphoedema, 23.6% had primary lymphoedema, 9.5% had lipoedema and 24.1% had lipolymphoedema. The lower extremities were mostly affected (64.4% of the patients presented with leg involvement and 17.5% with both arm and leg impairment). The FLQA-LS showed good internal consistency, with high Cronbach's alpha in the subscales and in the global scale ranging between 0.79 and 0.94. Regarding convergent validity, a good correlation was found with the general HRQoL questionnaire EQ-5D (r = 0.72, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: FLQA-LS is an improved version of the FLQA-L questionnaire for chronic lymphoedema. It demonstrated validity and feasibility and can be easily used in clinical practice and research studies.","['Augustin M', 'Conde Montero E', 'Hagenström K', 'Herberger K', 'Blome C']",2018,179,6,Br J Dermatol,"Augustin M, et al.

29748843,Exploration of Patient Characteristics and Quality of Life in Patients with Lipoedema Using a Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: Lipoedema is a chronic disorder in which excessive fat distribution occurs predominantly from the waist down, resulting in a disproportion between the lower extremities and upper torso. Lipoedema is often not recognized, while patients experience pain and easy bruising. As a long-term condition, lipoedema has a massive effect on patients' lives and mental health. The aim of this study is to explore patient characteristics, quality of life, physical complaints and comorbidities in patients with lipoedema.
METHODS: A survey was conducted by email amongst lipoedema patients, consisting of informed consent and multiple questionnaires. The questionnaires included general patient characteristics, physical complaints, comorbidities, RAND-36 and EQ-5D-3L. Participants who responded to a message on the Dutch Lipoedema Association website were recruited.
RESULTS: All lipoedema patients experience physical complaints, with pain (88.3 %) and easy bruising (85.9 %) as primary complaints. The diagnosis was mostly made by a dermatologist after visiting a mean of 2.8 doctors. Furthermore, mean time from onset until diagnosis was 18 years. Quality of life (59.3) was significantly lower than the Dutch female average (74.9; p < 0.001). Additionally, patients with comorbidities had significant lower quality of life (RAND 54.7, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Lipoedema patients often have severe complaints and experience lower quality of life regarding physical, emotional and social functioning. Additionally, comorbidities have a large impact on quality of life.","['Romeijn JRM', 'de Rooij MJM', 'Janssen L', 'Martens H']",2018,8,2,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Romeijn JRM, et al.

29614880,Depression and appearance-related distress in functioning with lipedema.,"Lipedema is a chronic, progressive adipose tissue disorder that may impact the quality of life of women who suffer from it. The main aim of this study was to asses the role of perceived symptom severity, physical and psychological functioning with the disease in predicting quality of life in patients with lipedema. We conducted an online study with 329 participants who responded to five questionnaires measuring quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF), lipedema symptom severity, mobility (Lower Extremity Functional Scale), depression (Patients Health Questionnaire-9), and appearance-related distress (Derriford Appearance Scale 24). Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that appearance-related distress and depression explained significantly more variance in quality of life when added to the symptom severity and mobility. Lower quality of life was predicted by higher symptom severity, lower mobility, higher appearance-related distress and higher depression severity. Appearance-related distress and depression constitute important aspects of psychological functioning in women with lipedema. Considering their relationship with quality of life, their assessment should be included in lipedema treatment with appropriate interventions aimed at decreasing appearance-related distress, as well as preventing and addressing depression.","['Dudek JE', 'Białaszek W', 'Ostaszewski P', 'Smidt T']",2018,23,7,Psychol Health Med,"Dudek JE, et al.

29532136,[Survey on the diagnostics and therapy of patients with lymphedema and lipedema].,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and therapy of lipedema and lymphedema seems to be problematic in daily routine. Systematic data for Germany are missing. The aim of the study was data collection regarding diagnosis and therapy of lymphologic diseases in an outpatient setting.
METHODS: Monocentric, prospective survey of patients from a lymphologic outpatient clinic using a standardized questionnaire focusing on diagnostics and therapy at the initial diagnosis.
RESULTS: In all, 72 patients (83.3% women) with lymphedema (n = 26), lipedema (n = 14) or lipolymphedema (n = 32) were included; 44.4% had symptoms more than 5 years before the initial diagnosis. Main symptoms were swelling of the leg and foot (especially lymphedema) and feeling of heaviness (especially lipedema). In 75%, the initial diagnosis was made by a medical specialist. The basic diagnostics recommended by the guidelines-medical history (73.6%) and clinical examination (84.7%)-were done in most of the patients. After the initial diagnosis, 46% of the patients had decongestion therapy of different intensity and quality. A total of 58.3% of the patients were directly provided a prescription for a medical stocking. Only a few patients received instructions for breathing exercises (22.2%), self-performed lymphatic drainage (6.9%) or muscle exercises (8.3%).
DISCUSSION: There are still deficits in the diagnosis and especially in the therapy of patients with lymphologic diseases in an outpatient setting. Further education and training are necessary for physicians, physiotherapists, medical supply businesses, and patients.","['Reich-Schupke S', 'Mohren E', 'Stücker M']",2018,69,6,Hautarzt,"Reich-Schupke S, et al.

29522416,Lipedema: friend and foe.,"Background Lipedema is a chronic disorder presenting in women during puberty or other times of hormonal change such as childbirth or menopause, characterized by symmetric enlargement of nodular, painful subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat) in the limbs, sparing the hands, feet and trunk. Healthcare providers underdiagnose or misdiagnose lipedema as obesity or lymphedema. Materials and methods The benefits (friend) and negative aspects (foe) of lipedema were collected from published literature, discussions with women with lipedema, and institutional review board approved evaluation of medical charts of 46 women with lipedema. Results Lipedema is a foe because lifestyle change does not reduce lipedema fat, the fat is painful, can become obese, causes gait and joint abnormalities, fatigue, lymphedema and psychosocial distress. Hypermobility associated with lipedema can exacerbate joint disease and aortic disease. In contrast, lipedema fat can be a friend as it is associated with relative reductions in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. In new data collected, lipedema was associated with a low risk of diabetes (2%), dyslipidemia (11.7%) and hypertension (13%) despite an obese average body mass index (BMI) of 35.3 ± 1.7 kg/m2. Conclusion Lipedema is a painful psychologically distressing fat disorder, more foe than friend especially due to associated obesity and lymphedema. More controlled studies are needed to study the mechanisms and treatments for lipedema.","['Torre YS', 'Wadeea R', 'Rosas V', 'Herbst KL']",2018,33,1,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,"Torre YS, et al.

29280322,Tissue Sodium Content is Elevated in the Skin and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in Women with Lipedema.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that tissue sodium and adipose content are elevated in patients with lipedema; if confirmed, this could establish precedence for tissue sodium and adipose content representing a discriminatory biomarker for lipedema.
METHODS: Participants with lipedema (n = 10) and control (n = 11) volunteers matched for biological sex, age, BMI, and calf circumference were scanned with 3.0-T sodium and conventional proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Standardized tissue sodium content was quantified in the calf skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and muscle. Dixon MRI was employed to quantify tissue fat and water volumes of the calf. Nonparametric statistical tests were applied to compare regional sodium content and fat-to-water volume between groups (significance: two-sided P ≤ 0.05).
RESULTS: Skin (P = 0.01) and SAT (P = 0.04) sodium content were elevated in lipedema (skin: 14.9 ± 2.9 mmol/L; SAT: 11.9 ± 3.1 mmol/L) relative to control participants (skin: 11.9 ± 2.0 mmol/L; SAT: 9.4 ± 1.6 mmol/L). Relative fat-to-water volume in the calf was elevated in lipedema (1.2 ± 0.48 ratio) relative to control participants (0.63 ± 0.26 ratio; P < 0.001). Skin sodium content was directly correlated with fat-to-water volume (Spearman's rho = 0.54; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Internal metrics of tissue sodium and adipose content are elevated in patients with lipedema, potentially providing objective imaging-based biomarkers for differentially diagnosing the under-recognized condition of lipedema from obesity.","['Crescenzi R', 'Marton A', 'Donahue PMC', 'Mahany HB', 'Lants SK', 'Wang P', 'Beckman JA', 'Donahue MJ', 'Titze J']",2018,26,2,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Crescenzi R, et al.

29158895,A journey through liposuction and liposculture: Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, liposuction is the most frequently performed aesthetic surgery procedure in Western Countries. This technique has had rapid development since the 1970s, when it was experimented for the first time by A. and G. Fischer. It is currently widely used in clinical practice for many different situations in aesthetic, reconstructive and functional fields.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review aims to describe the historical evolution of liposuction by analyzing the transformation of the method in function of the introduction of innovative ideas or instruments. We have also focused on reporting the major clinical applications of this surgical technique, applicable to almost the entire body surface. We finally analyzed the complications, both major and minor, associated with this surgical technique.
RESULTS: Liposuction is mainly used to correct deep and superficial fat accumulations and remodel the body contour. It has become an essential complementary technique to enhance the aesthetic result of many other aesthetic procedures such as reduction mammoplasty, abdominoplasty, brachioplasty, thigh lift and post bariatric body contouring. However, it can be largely used for the treatment of innumerable pathologies in reconstructive surgery such as lipomas, lipedema, lipodystrophies, pneudogynecomastia and gynecomastia, macromastia e gigantomastia, lymphedema and many others. The complication rate is very low, especially when compared with conventional excisional surgery and the major, complications are generally associated with improper performance of the technique and poor patient management before and after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Liposuction is a safe, simple and effective method of body contouring. It has enormous potential for its application in ablative and reconstructive surgery, far from the most common aesthetic processes with a very low complication rate.","['Bellini E', 'Grieco MP', 'Raposio E']",2017,24,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Bellini E, et al.

29050723,[Scalp lipedema].,"BACKGROUND: Lipedematous scalp, with or without alopecia, is a poorly known and rarely reported entity. It was first described in 1935 by Cornbleet. It involves increased thickness of the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp, responsible for an overall thickening of the scalp, which may be associated with alopecia, pruritus or painful sensations. Currently, fewer than 50 cases of lipedematous scalp, both with and without alopecia, have been reported in the literature.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein we present the case of a 36-year-old woman from the Ivory Coast, who presented scalp pain associated with infiltration of the entire subcutaneous tissue of the scalp seen clinically and confirmed at MRI. Histology added nothing.
DISCUSSION: We diagnosed a new case of lipedematous scalp in an African woman. No cause was found.

SAT therapy is a manual therapy to improve soft tissue quality. Objective Determine if SAT therapy improves pain and structure of lipedema SAT. Design Single arm prospective pilot study. Setting Academic medical center. Patients Seven women, 46 ± 5 years, weight 90 ± 19 kg, with lipedema. Intervention Twelve 90-min SAT therapy sessions over 4 weeks. Outcomes Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, SAT ultrasound (Vevo 2100), leg volumetrics, skin caliper assessment, tissue exam, weight, resting metabolic rate, pain assessment, lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) and body shape questionnaire (BSQ) at baseline and end of study. Results Weight, resting metabolic rate and BSQ did not change significantly. Limb fat over total body fat mass (p = 0.08) and trunk fat over total body mass trended down from baseline (p = 0.08) by DXA. Leg volume and caliper assessments in eight of nine areas (p < 0.007), LEFS (p = 0.002) and average pain (p = 0.007) significantly decreased from baseline.

28728329,Liposuction in the Treatment of Lipedema: A Longitudinal Study.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a condition consisting of painful bilateral increases in subcutaneous fat and interstitial fluid in the limbs with secondary lymphedema and fibrosis during later stages. Combined decongestive therapy (CDT) is the standard of care in most countries. Since the introduction of tumescent technique, liposuction has been used as a surgical treatment option. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of liposuction used as treatment for lipedema.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients who received 72 liposuction procedures for the treatment of lipedema completed a standardized questionnaire. Lipedema-associated complaints and the need for CDT were assessed for the preoperative period and during 2 separate postoperative follow-ups using a visual analog scale and a composite CDT score. The mean follow-up times for the first postoperative follow-up and the second postoperative follow-up were 16 months and 37 months, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients showed significant reductions in spontaneous pain, sensitivity to pressure, feeling of tension, bruising, cosmetic impairment, and general impairment to quality of life from the preoperative period to the first postoperative follow-up, and these results remained consistent until the second postoperative follow-up. A comparison of the preoperative period to the last postoperative follow-up, after 4 patients without full preoperative CDT were excluded from the analysis, indicated that the need for CDT was reduced significantly. An analysis of the different stages of the disease also indicated that better and more sustainable results could be achieved if patients were treated in earlier stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Liposuction is effective in the treatment of lipedema and leads to an improvement in quality of life and a decrease in the need for conservative therapy.","['Dadras M', 'Mallinger PJ', 'Corterier CC', 'Theodosiadi S', 'Ghods M']",2017,44,4,Arch Plast Surg,"Dadras M, et al.

28677175,S1 guidelines: Lipedema.,"The present, revised guidelines on lipedema were developed under the auspices of and funded by the German Society of Phlebology (DGP). The recommendations are based on a systematic literature search and the consensus of eight medical societies and working groups. The guidelines contain recommendations with respect to diagnosis and management of lipedema. The diagnosis is established on the basis of medical history and clinical findings. Characteristically, there is a localized, symmetrical increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue in arms and legs that is in marked disproportion to the trunk. Other findings include edema, easy bruising, and increased tenderness. Further diagnostic tests are usually reserved for special cases that require additional workup. Lipedema is a chronic, progressive disorder marked by the individual variability and unpredictability of its clinical course. Treatment consists of four therapeutic mainstays that should be combined as necessary and address current clinical symptoms: complex physical therapy (manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy, exercise therapy, and skin care), liposuction and plastic surgery, diet, and physical activity, as well as psychotherapy if necessary. Surgical procedures are indicated if - despite thorough conservative treatment - symptoms persist, or if there is progression of clinical findings and/or symptoms. If present, morbid obesity should be therapeutically addressed prior to liposuction.","['Reich-Schupke S', 'Schmeller W', 'Brauer WJ', 'Cornely ME', 'Faerber G', 'Ludwig M', 'Lulay G', 'Miller A', 'Rapprich S', 'Richter DF', 'Schacht V', 'Schrader K', 'Stücker M', 'Ure C']",2017,15,7,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Reich-Schupke S, et al.

A total of 254 new patients ((217 women, 37 men), median (Q1-Q3) age 61 (46-72) years) were referred for suspected limb lymphedema to an exclusively lymphedema-dedicated department for a first consultation (January - March 2015) were included; among 118 with upper limb involvement, 100 (84.7%) were diagnosed with post-breast cancer therapy and four with primary lymphedemas; among 136 with lower limb involvement, 31 (22.8%) were diagnosed with primary lymphedemas and 35 (25.7%) with post-cancer lymphedemas. The main alternative diagnoses were: 32 (45.7%) lipedemas/lipo-lymphedemas and 21 (30%) chronic venous insufficiencies. Age at symptom onset, body mass index, referral origins and first-symptom-to-specialized-consultation intervals differed between primary, post-cancer lymphedema and alternative diagnosis patients. Among the entire cohort, 57 (22.4%) had cellulitis. For all 135 (53.1%) upper or lower limb post-cancer lymphedemas and the 119 (46.9%) others, the median (Q1-Q3) first-symptom-to-specialized-consultation intervals were 1.4 (0.7-3.8) and 4 (1.1-18.8) years, respectively ( p < 0.0001).

28454682,The adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction cells from lipedema patients: Are they different?,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Lipedema is a hormone-related disease of women characterized by enlargement of the extremities caused by subcutaneous deposition of adipose tissue. In healthy patients application of autologous adipose tissue-derived cells has shown great potential in several clinical studies for engrafting of soft tissue reconstruction in recent decades. The majority of these studies have used the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a heterogeneous cell population containing adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC), among others. Because cell identity and regenerative properties might be affected by the health condition of patients, we characterized the SVF cells of 30 lipedema patients in comparison to 22 healthy patients.
METHODS: SVF cells were analyzed regarding cell yield, viability, adenosine triphosphate content, colony forming units and proliferative capacity, as well as surface marker profile and differentiation potential in vitro.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated a significantly enhanced SVF cell yield isolated from lipedema compared with healthy patients. In contrast, the adipogenic differentiation potential of SVF cells isolated from lipedema patients was significantly reduced compared with healthy patients. Interestingly, expression of the mesenchymal marker CD90 and the endothelial/pericytic marker CD146 was significantly enhanced when isolated from lipedema patients.

Generic as well as disease-specific health-related QoL was assessed using EQ-5D and FLQA-LK, respectively. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). About 301 patients (median age of 60.5 years, 90.8% female) with lymphedema of any origin were included. About 66.4% had lymphedema, 24.1% combined lipolymphedema, and 9.5% lipoedema. Mean disease-specific QoL (FLQA-LK) was 2.4 (range 0 = no to 4 = maximum burden). The highest impairment values were observed in subscales for physical complaints, everyday life, and emotional well-being. Mean EQ-5D VAS was 70.4, mean EQ-5D score 63.3. Lymphedema was associated with major impairments in QoL, which differed for subgroups of pain, clinical severity, and comorbidity.

30248725,Measurement of capillary fragility: a useful tool to differentiate lipedema from obesity?,"Lipedema is a disproportional obesity featuring spontaneous or light pressure-induce pain and frequent hematoma formation due to even minor traumatic injuries. It is generally distinguished from general obesity primarily based on clinical hallmarks; however, this becomes difficult when appearing in a concomitant form (combination of obesity and lipedema). Our study group has recently demonstrated that lipedema-associated bruising is correlated with increased capillary fragility (CF) and also that CF could be significantly improved by complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP). In this study, we measured CF in female subjects with lipedema (15) or non-complicated obesity (15) who were body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) matched. CF was evaluated with the vacuum suction method (VSM) using Parrot's angiosterrometer in both groups. Application of VSM resulted in a significantly higher number of petechiae in subjects with lipedema. Capillary fragility measurement appears to be a useful differential diagnostic tool between lipedema and obesity under these trial parameters.","['Szolnoky G', 'Ifeoluwa A', 'Tuczai M', 'Varga E', 'Varga M', 'Dosa-Racz E', 'Kemeny L']",2017,50,4,Lymphology,"Szolnoky G, et al.

27857136,Differentiating lipedema and Dercum's disease.,"BACKGROUND: People with lipedema or Dercum's disease (DD) can have a similar distribution of excess painful nodular subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), making them difficult to differentiate.
METHODS: Case series of 94 patients with DD, 160 with lipedema and 18 with both diagnoses (Lip+DD) from a single clinic in an academic medical center to improve identification and differentiation of these disorders by comparison of clinical findings, prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DM2), hypermobility by the Beighton score and assessment of a marker of inflammation, Total complement activity (CH50).
RESULTS: Differences between groups were by Student's t-test with α of 0.05. The Lipedema Group had significantly greater weight, body mass index (BMI), gynoid distributed nodular SAT and fibrotic and heavy tissue than the DD Group. Hypermobility was significantly higher in the Lipedema (58±0.5%) than DD Group (23±0.4%; P<0.0001). DM2 was significantly greater in the DD (16±0.2%; P=0.0007) than the Lipedema Group (6±0.2%). Average pain by an analog scale was significantly higher in the DD (6±2.5%) than the Lipedema Group (4±2.1%; P<0.0001). Fatigue and swelling were common in both groups. Easy bruising was more common in the Lipedema Group, whereas abdominal pain, shortness of breath, fibromyalgia, migraines and lipomas were more prevalent in the DD Group. The percentage of patients with elevated CH50 was significantly positive in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The significantly lower prevalence of DM2 in people with lipedema compared with DD may be due to the greater amount of gynoid fat known to be protective against metabolic disorders. The high percentage of hypermobility in lipedema patients indicates that it may be a comorbid condition. The location of fat, high average daily pain, presence of lipomas and comorbid painful disorders in DD patients may help differentiate from lipedema.","['Beltran K', 'Herbst KL']",2017,41,2,Int J Obes (Lond),Beltran K and Herbst KL.

27757353,Lipedema: A Relatively Common Disease with Extremely Common Misconceptions.,"Lipedema, or adiposis dolorosa, is a common adipose tissue disorder that is believed to affect nearly 11% of adult women worldwide. It is characterized most commonly by disproportionate adipocyte hypertrophy of the lower extremities, significant tenderness to palpation, and a failure to respond to extreme weight loss modalities. Women with lipedema report a rapid growth of the lipedema subcutaneous adipose tissue in the setting of stress, surgery, and/or hormonal changes. Women with later stages of lipedema have a classic ""column leg"" appearance, with masses of nodular fat, easy bruising, and pain. Despite this relatively common disease, there are few physicians who are aware of it. As a result, patients are often misdiagnosed with lifestyle-induced obesity, and/or lymphedema, and subjected to unnecessary medical interventions and fat-shaming. Diagnosis is largely clinical and based on criteria initially established in 1951. Treatment of lipedema is effective and includes lymphatic support, such as complete decongestive therapy, and specialized suction lipectomy to spare injury to lymphatic channels and remove the diseased lipedema fat. With an incidence that may affect nearly 1 in 9 adult women, it is important to generate appropriate awareness, conduct additional research, and identify better diagnostic and treatment modalities for lipedema so these women can obtain the care that they need and deserve.","['Buck DW', 'Herbst KL']",2016,4,9,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,Buck DW and Herbst KL.

It is commonly misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphoedema, but careful assessment will reveal a disproportionate enlargement below the waist which is resistant to dieting, sparing of the feet, legs are tender or painful to touch and bruise easily, there is occasional orthostatic oedema, and there is often significant psychological morbidity. Lipoedema is a oestrogen-regulated condition with onset around puberty in 78% of women, and there is often a strong family history. The condition is exacerbated by weight gain and there is increasing anecdotal evidence that women who are obese are seeking a diagnosis of lipoedema, either to procure NHS funded manual lymphatic drainage, or to medicalise their obesity and avoid acknowledging that the responsibility for their weight gain is lifestyle orientated. Management of lipoedema consists of accurate diagnosis, psychological care, management of orthostatic oedema, and prevention of progression through skin care and weight management.",['Todd M'],2016,21,Suppl 10,Br J Community Nurs,Todd M.

Diagnosis of lymphedema is mainly clinical and lymphoscintigraphy is useful in primary form to assess precisely the lymphatic function of the two limbs. Erysipelas (cellulitis) is the main complication, but psychological or functional discomfort may occur throughout the course of lymphedema. Lipedema is the main differential diagnosis, defined as an abnormal accumulation of fat from hip to ankle. Lymphedema management is based on complete decongestive physiotherapy (multilayer low-stretch bandage, manual lymph drainage, skin care, exercises).

27169339,A review of the evidence for adjustable compression wrap devices.,"UNLABELLED: Compression therapy is a key component in the effective management of people with lower limb problems associated with venous, lymphatic and fat disorders such as lipoedema. Individuals with lymphoedema, venous ulceration and lipoedema often require long-term compression therapy to prevent and manage problems such as chronic ulceration and skin changes, persistent swelling and shape distortion. Challenges remain in achieving acceptable, safe, effective and cost-efficient compression therapy choices. Adjustable compression wrap devices using hook and loop fasteners, commonly called VELCRO brand fasteners, present new opportunities for improving treatment outcomes, supporting patient independence and self-management in the use of compression therapy. This paper reports the findings of an evidence review of adjustable compression wrap devices in people with lymphoedema, chronic oedema, venous ulceration and lipoedema.

27075680,"First Dutch guidelines on lipedema using the international classification of functioning, disability and health.","Introduction Lipedema is a chronic, progressive condition that can result in considerable disability. In 2011, the Dutch Society of Dermatology and Venereology organized a task force to create guidelines on lipedema, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health of the World Health Organization. Guideline development Clinical questions on significant issues in lipedema care were proposed, involving (1) making the diagnosis of lipedema; (2) clinimetric measurements for early detection and adequate follow-up; and (3) treatment. A systematic review of literature published up to June 2013 was conducted. Based on available evidence and experience of the task force, answers were formed and recommendations were stated. The guidelines define criteria to make a medical diagnosis of lipedema, a minimum data set of (repeated) clinical measurements that should be used to ensure early detection and an individually outlined follow-up plan, pillars on which conservative treatment should be based and recommendations on surgical treatment options. Conclusions Little consistent information concerning either diagnostics or therapy can be found in the literature. It is likely that lipedema is frequently misdiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed as only an aesthetic problem and therefore under- or mis-treated. Treatment is divided into conservative and chirurgic treatment. The only available technique to correct the abnormal adipose tissue is surgery. Recommendations To ensure early detection and an individually outlined follow-up, the committee advises the use of a minimum data set of (repeated) measurements of waist circumference, circumference of involved limbs, body mass index and scoring of the level of daily practice and psychosocial distress. Promotion of a healthy lifestyle with individually adjusted weight control measures, graded activity training programs, edema reduction, and other supportive measures are pillars of conservative therapy. Tumescent liposuction is the treatment of choice for patients with a suitable health profile and/or inadequate response to conservative and supportive measures.","['Halk AB', 'Damstra RJ']",2017,32,3,Phlebology,"Halk AB and Damstra RJ.

27049087,Lipedema  lack of evidence for the involvement of tyrosine kinases.,"Lipedema is a chronic disorder characterized by abnormal distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue on the proximal extremities, pain and capillary fragility. Its etiology is unknown but in analogy to central obesity, chronic low-level inflammation in adipose tissue has been suggested. There seems to be an increased propagation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes contributing to the massive enlargement of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We investigated whether tyrosine kinases might be involved. Proteins from adipose tissue harvested during microcannular tumescent liposuction in lipedema and in lipomas were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide-gel, transferred to a polyvinylidenfluorid membrane and immunoblotted with indicated P-Tyr-100 antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. A survey of all blots did not reveal tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with a molecular weight >100 kD in lipedema tissue and controls. These investigations suggest absence of activated growth factor receptors. Some signals indicating unspecific tyrosine-phosphorylation of smaller proteins were detected in tissue of both lipedema patients and controls. The present data suggest that there is no enduring activation of tyrosine kinase pathways of adipogenesis in lipedema as in lipoma controls.","['Schneble N', 'Wetzker R', 'Wollina U']",2016,30,1,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Schneble N, et al.

27046426,Specialist approaches to managing lipoedema.,"While there is no proven cure for lipoedema, early detection is key as specialist treatments, complemented by self-management techniques, can improve symptoms and prevent progression. There is no universal approach as the correct treatment or treatments will depend on each patient's particular circumstances; however, when chosen early and appropriately, interventions can provide huge benefits. The most common treatments in the management of lipoedema include compression, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), tumescent liposuction, intermittent pneumatic compression therapy (IPC), kinesio taping, deep oscillation therapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).",['Fetzer A'],2016,Suppl,,Br J Community Nurs,Fetzer A.

In this study, the authors describe a 44-year-old obese woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia in molecular remission on dasatinib therapy, who presented with a painful urticarial eruption limited to lipo-lymphedematous skin and accompanied by malaise, episodic fever, diarrhea, neutrophilia, and leukocytosis. Initially transient and migratory, the rash became fixed, papular, and vesicular and showed minimal response to corticosteroids. Biopsy demonstrated sparse perivascular and interstitial dermal neutrophilic infiltrates, without vasculitis or significant dermal edema. Aggregates of neutrophils were found within and surrounding lymphangiectases. Biopsy of a new onset papule 3 weeks later demonstrated papillary dermal edema, denser neutrophilic infiltrate, and vasculitis-like changes. These 2 histopathologic patterns of ND, early and late, resemble neutrophilic urticarial dermatitis (also known as neutrophilic dermatitis with systemic inflammation) and Sweet syndrome, respectively. Extensive workup did not reveal evidence of relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia, infection, or a coexisting systemic inflammatory disease. Dasatinib was discontinued and the eruption gradually resolved over 2.5 months. Still in molecular remission (no detectable BCR-ABL gene fusion), dasatinib therapy was recommenced at 3-month follow-up. After 10 months, she complains of malaise and arthralgia, but no cutaneous symptoms. The evolution and slow resolution of this ND in lipo-lymphedematous skin implicate poor lymphatic clearance of factors, antigenic and/or toxic, involved in the pathogenesis of ND.","['Ainechi S', 'Carlson JA']",2016,38,2,Am J Dermatopathol,Ainechi S and Carlson JA.

OBJECTIVE: To find out whether the improvement of complaints persists for a further 4 years.
METHODS: In a single-centre study, 85 patients with lipoedema had already been examined after 4 years. A mail questionnaire - often in combination with clinical controls - was repeated after another 4 years (8 years after liposuction).
RESULTS: Compared with the results after 4 years, the improvement in spontaneous pain, sensitivity to pressure, oedema, bruising and restriction of movement persisted. The same held true for patient self-assessment of cosmetic appearance, quality of life and overall impairment. Eight years after surgery, the reduction in the amount of conservative treatment (combined decongestive therapy, compression garments) was similar to that observed 4 years earlier.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of liposuction techniques for pediatric overgrowth diseases. Patients treated between 2007 and 2015 who had follow-up were reviewed. Seventeen patients were included; the median age was 12.7 years. The causes of overgrowth included infiltrating lipomatosis (n = 7), capillary malformation (n = 6), hemihypertrophy (n = 1), infantile hemangioma (n = 1), lipedema (n = 1), and macrocephaly-capillary malformation (n = 1). Forty-seven percent had enlargement of an extremity, 41 percent had facial hypertrophy, and 12 percent had expansion of the trunk. All subjects had a reduction in the size of the overgrown area and improved quality of life. Suction-assisted tissue removal is an effective technique for reducing the volume of the subcutaneous compartment for patients with pediatric overgrowth diseases.

However, in most cases, diagnosis is simple and does not usually necessitate laboratory examinations. There is an extremely high demand for therapy since the condition causes major morbidity and affects quality of life. The aim of treatment is to reduce patient weight; although weight loss does not affect the morphology of the lower limbs, it optimises patient mobility while reducing related complaints and improving quality of life. Conservative surgical measures, of which tumescent liposuction is the most frequent, provide improvement of certain symptoms. A better understanding of this entity will result in improved therapy.","['Truchetet F', 'Bonhomme A']",2015,142,8-9,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Truchetet F and Bonhomme A.

26216585,Quality of life in women with lipoedema: a contextual behavioral approach.,"PURPOSE: Lipoedema is a chronic, progressive adipose disorder of unknown etiology, often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as obesity. It manifests itself with accumulation of the fat in lower parts of the body and associated edema and, due to numerous physical and psychological consequences, affects the quality of life (QOL) of those who suffer. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological factors that might have an impact on the QOL of women with lipoedema from the contextual behavioral viewpoint.
METHODS: In an Internet-based cross-sectional study, women suffering from lipoedema (N = 120) were asked to fill in questionnaires assessing: symptom severity, QOL (WHOQOL-BREF), satisfaction with life (SWLS), psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II), social connectedness (Social Connectedness Scale-Revised) and other psychological factors. The majority of participants were from the USA, the UK, and Australia.
RESULTS: Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that a higher level of QOL was predicted by higher levels of psychological flexibility and social connectedness, while controlling for symptom severity. Higher level of SWL was predicted only by higher level of social connectedness.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy with psychological flexibility as the target of change and Functional Analytic Psychotherapy with social connectedness as the target of change might be useful in treating women with lipoedema; however, further research in this area is needed. The authors conclude that psychological and biomedical interventions for women with lipoedema and their QOL merit more attention from researchers and the medical community than is currently received.","['Dudek JE', 'Białaszek W', 'Ostaszewski P']",2016,25,2,Qual Life Res,"Dudek JE, et al.

26058726,Referral patterns to a surgical lymphoedema service: 10 years of experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Liposuction for lymphoedematous limbs is an effective treatment for chronic lymphoedema, with excellent long-term results in well-selected patients. In 2008 NICE produced guidelines 'Liposuction for Chronic lymphoedema', acknowledging this treatment modality. However, there remain very few centers that provide this service in the United Kingdom. We aim to share our experience of our referral system at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland.
METHODS: A 10 year prospective database from 2005 to 2014 was analysed. Referral sources, patient demographics, diagnosis and treatment offered were examined.
RESULTS: There were 221 referrals in total, 190 (86%) female and 31 (14%) male. The mean age was 51 (range 7-86 years). 127 (58%) were referred via their general practitioners, 72 (33%) from a hospital consultant and 22 (10%) from a lymphoedema nurse specialist. 153 (69%) referrals were from Scotland, 61 (28%) from England and 7 (3%) from Northern Ireland. The majority of patients 165 (75%) were referred with lower limb swelling. Following assessment in clinic, 146 (66%) were found to have lymphoedema whilst the rest were deemed to have other non-lymphoedematous diagnoses which include lipoedema (47, 21%), dependent oedema (8, 4%) and obesity (5, 2%). 131 (59%) were offered liposuction- 74 (34%) have received liposuction, 18 (8%) are awaiting their procedure, 3 (1%) have declined surgery, 27 (12%) are awaiting funding approval and 9 (4%) have been declined funding by their primary care trust/clinical commissioning group (PCT/CCG). 4 (2%) are awaiting investigations to further evaluate the cause of their swelling, whilst the remaining 86 (39%) were felt unsuitable for surgery and were treated conservatively.

25950394,Early lipoedema diagnosis and the RCGP e-learning course.,"Frequently misdiagnosed as obesity, lipoedema is chronic condition involving an abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks that cannot be shifted by exercise or dieting. Estimated to affect up to 11% of the female population, the condition is widely unknown by health professionals. This means women typically wait for many years before diagnosis. This allows the condition to progress unchecked, resulting in unnecessary deterioration and the development of associated comorbidities, as well as significant pain and mental anguish. A free, 30-minute Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) e-learning course created in partnership with Lipoedema UK aims to rectify this situation by educating nurses, GPs and other health professionals on how to diagnose and manage lipoedema in primary care. This article aims to describe the condition of lipoedema, how to recognise/diagnose it, current treatment options and the findings of a 240-patient survey carried out by Lipoedema UK in 2013 that included documenting the difficulties for patients in obtaining a diagnosis as well as the mental and physical effects of the condition.","['Fetzer A', 'Fetzer S']",2015,Suppl,,Br J Community Nurs,"Fetzer A and Fetzer S.

25695452,Functional and Therapeutic Indications of Liposuction: Personal Experience and Review of the Literature.,"Liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgical procedure worldwide. It has evolved from being designed primarily for body contouring to becoming essential adjunct to various other aesthetic procedures, greatly enhancing their outcome. Despite its hard clear differentiation between an aesthetic and therapeutic indication for some pathologic conditions, liposuction has been increasingly applied to a gamut of disorders as a therapeutic tool or to improve function. In fact, liposuction has ceased to define a specific procedure and became synonymous to a surgical technique or tool same as the surgical knife, laser, electrocautery, suture material, or even wound-dressing products. At present, there seems to be an enormous potential for the application of the basic liposuction technique in ablative and reconstructive surgery outside the realm of purely aesthetic procedures. The present review contemplates the various nonaesthetic applications of liposuction, displaying the enormous potentials of what should be considered a basic surgical technique rather than a specific aesthetic procedure. Implications of this new definition of liposuction should induce third-party public payers and insurance companies to reconsider their remuneration and reimbursement policies.","['Atiyeh B', 'Costagliola M', 'Illouz YG', 'Dibo S', 'Zgheib E', 'Rampillon F']",2015,75,2,Ann Plast Surg,"Atiyeh B, et al.

Combining bioresonance with transcutaneous passage of active principles, by means of skin electroporation, microcirculation and clearance of connective tissues may be theoretically activated. A pilot study on an electro-medical device which includes these two technologies (Transponder(®)), has been performed on patients affected by lymphedema (LYM) and/or lipedema (LIP) of the lower limbs.
METHODS: Eight patients affected by primary or secondary unilateral LYM or LIP were submitted to six consecutive daily sessions with the medical device; the first two sessions were performed by a trained physiotherapist, whilst the following four sessions were self-administered by the patients themselves at home (who were educated about the technique). Magnesium silicate was delivered transcutaneously by means of the device at each session. Pre-post-treatment assessment included: 1) limb volumetry by means of tape measurement; 2) segmental multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy for fluid changes, with L-DEX measurement; 3) visual analogue scale (VAS) (0-10 score) questionnaire for related symptoms.
RESULTS: All the patients completed the scheduled treatment. After the treatment the mean volume of the whole limb decreased from 9462.85 (±3407.02) to 9297.37 cc (±3393.20), which accounts for a 165.48 cc (2%) reduction after six days of treatment. The pre/post-treatment VAS mean score changes were: heaviness from 4.57±3.46 to 2.43±2.57 (-47%), dysesthesias from 1.71±2.63 to 0.71±1.50 (-58%), pain from 1.57±2.57 to 0.57±0.79 (-64%). Diuresis VAS measurement passed from 7.43±1.81 to 8.57±0.98 (15% increase). The average L-DEX percentage reduction was 21%. No side effects were reported and a good patients' compliance was recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary data of this pilot study show that the combination of microcurrents of bioresonance with transdermal delivery of active principles indicate that it could result in edema decrease and symptom improvement in patients affected by LYM and/or LIP of the lower limbs. Self-administered modality of the electrical device is possible and effective; no side effects have been reported.","['Elio C', 'Guaitolini E', 'Paccasassi S', 'Rosati N', 'Cavezzi A']",2014,149,6,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Elio C, et al.

25326446,Lipedema: A Review of the Literature.,"Lipedema is a disorder of adipose tissue that primarily affects females and is often misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema. Relatively few studies have defined the precise pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management strategies for this disorder, yet the need to successfully identify this disorder as a unique entity has important implications for proper treatment. In this review, we sought to review and identify information in the existing literature with respect to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management strategies for lipedema. The current literature suggests that lipedema appears to be a clinical entity thought to be related to both genetic factors and fat distribution. While distinct from lymphedema and obesity, there are some existing treatments such as complex decongestive physiotherapy, liposuction, and laser-assisted lipolysis. Management of lipedema is complex and distinct from lymphedema. The role of newer randomized controlled studies to further explore the management of this clinical entity remains promising.","['Okhovat JP', 'Alavi A']",2015,14,3,Int J Low Extrem Wounds,Okhovat JP and Alavi A.

25200646,Pathophysiological dilemmas of lipedema.,"Lipedema is a common, but often underdiagnosed masquerading disease of obesity, which almost exclusively affects females. There are many debates regarding the diagnosis as well as the treatment strategies of the disease. The clinical diagnosis is relatively simple, however, knowledge regarding the pathomechanism is less than limited and curative therapy does not exist at all demanding an urgent need for extensive research. According to our hypothesis, lipedema is an estrogen-regulated polygenetic disease, which manifests in parallel with feminine hormonal changes and leads to vasculo- and lymphangiopathy. Inflammation of the peripheral nerves and sympathetic innervation abnormalities of the subcutaneous adipose tissue also involving estrogen may be responsible for neuropathy. Adipocyte hyperproliferation is likely to be a secondary phenomenon maintaining a vicious cycle. Herein, the relevant articles are reviewed from 1913 until now and discussed in context of the most likely mechanisms leading to the disease, which could serve as a starting point for further research.","['Szél E', 'Kemény L', 'Groma G', 'Szolnoky G']",2014,83,5,Med Hypotheses,"Szél E, et al.

24741382,Debulking surgery for elephantiasis nostras with large ectatic podoplanin-negative lymphatic vessels in patients with lipo-lymphedema.,"OBJECTIVE: Elephantiasis nostras is a rare complication in advanced lipo-lymphedema. While lipedema can be treated by liposuction and lymphedema by decongestive lymphatic therapy, elephantiasis nostras may need debulking surgery.
METHODS: We present 2 cases of advanced lipo-lymphedema complicated by elephantiasis nostras. After tumescent microcannular laser-assisted liposuction both patients underwent a debulking surgery with a modification of Auchincloss-Kim's technique. Histologic examination of the tissue specimen was performed.
RESULTS: The surgical treatment was well tolerated and primary healing was uneventful. After primary wound healing and ambulation of the patients, a delayed ulceration with lymphorrhea developed. It was treated by surgical necrectomy and vacuum-assisted closure leading to complete healing. Mobility of the leg was much improved. Histologic examination revealed massive ectatic lymphatic vessels nonreactive for podoplanin.
CONCLUSIONS: Debulking surgery can be an adjuvant technique for elephantiasis nostras in advanced lipo-lymphedema. Although delayed postoperative wound healing problems were observed, necrectomy and vacuum-assisted closure achieved a complete healing. Histologic data suggest that the ectatic lymphatic vessels in these patients resemble finding in podoplanin knockout mice. The findings would explain the limitations of decongestive lymphatic therapy and tumescent liposuction in such patients and their predisposition to relapsing erysipelas.","['Wollina U', 'Heinig B', 'Schönlebe J', 'Nowak A']",2014,14,,Eplasty,"Wollina U, et al.

Because of progressive chronic pain of the right knee joint her walking distance was limited to a few meters. Conservative therapy was exhausted.
INVESTIGATIONS: Clinical examination showed a restricted and painful range of motion of the right knee and distinctive obeseness on the trunk and the extremities including a lipedema/lymphedema.
TREATMENT AND COURSE: After a complicated course of treatment lasting for 220 days the total knee replacement ended in an arthrodesis combined with a gastrocnemius muscle flap.
CONCLUSION: With respect to this case the high complication-rates in obese patients should be taken into account: Total knee replacement can even lead to loss of the limb in the worst case. In addition to extended preoperative examination this indication should be critically scrutinized.","['Brinkmann V', 'Wohlrab D', 'Esmer E', 'Juch F', 'Delank KS', 'Freche S']",2014,139,15,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Brinkmann V, et al.

In advanced stages, reduction of adipose tissue is the only available effective treatment. In elderly patients with advanced lipedema, correction of increased skin laxity has to be considered for an optimal outcome.
METHODS: We report on a tailored combined approach to improve advanced lipedema in elderly females with multiple comorbidities. Microcannular laser-assisted liposuction of the upper legs and knees is performed under tumescent anesthesia. Medial thigh lift and partial lower abdominoplasty with minimal undermining are used to correct skin laxity and prevent intertrigo. Postsurgical care with nonelastic flat knitted compression garments and manual lymph drainage are used.
RESULTS: We report on three women aged 55-77 years with advanced lipedema of the legs and multiple comorbidities. Using this step-by-step approach, a short operation time and early mobilization were possible. Minor adverse effects were temporary methemoglobinemia after tumescent anesthesia and postsurgical pain. No severe adverse effects were seen. Patient satisfaction was high.

24264570,[Leg swelling].,"Leg swelling is an extremely frequent symptom with a broad variety of largely differing causes. The most important mechanisms behind the symptom include venous and lymphatic pathology, volume overload, increased capillary permeability, and lowered oncotic pressure. Therefore, the most frequent diseases associated with leg swelling are deep vein thrombosis and chronic venous insufficiency, primary or secondary lymphedema, cardiac failure, hypoproteinemia due to liver or renal failure, idiopathic cyclic edema, and drug-induced edema. Lipedema as a misnomer represents an important differential diagnosis. History and physical examination, when based on a sound knowledge of the diseases of interest, enable a conclusive diagnosis in most cases. Additional test are required in only a minority of patients. The present review discusses pathophysiology and clinical features of the most prevalent types of leg swelling.

24239143,Evaluation of patient-relevant outcomes of lymphedema and lipedema treatment: development and validation of a new benefit tool.,"OBJECTIVES: Patient-relevant treatment benefit is traditionally measured with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments. The Patient Benefit Index (PBI) methodology allows for a more direct measurement, with the patients rating both importance and achievement of treatment goals. Here, we developed and validated a PBI version specific for the assessment of benefit in lymphedema and lipedema treatment (PBI-L).
METHODS: The development included five steps: (1) open item collection; (2) consensus of items in a multidisciplinary expert panel; (3) application of the German PBI-L in a cross-sectional study (n = 301); (4) translation into English; (5) application of the English PBI-L in a randomized clinical trial (n = 82). Subscales were developed using factor analysis. Construct validity was analyzed by correlating PBI-L and convergent criteria such as HRQoL and quality of care. To test for responsiveness, the association to change in HRQoL measures was computed.
RESULTS: Floor and ceiling effects were low. There were few missing values. Two well-interpretable subscales were found with Cronbach's alpha >0.8 each. Global and subscale scores correlated with convergent criteria and with change in disease-specific HRQoL, but not with change in generic HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: The PBI-L is an internally consistent, valid, and responsive instrument for the assessment of patient-relevant benefit of edema treatment.","['Blome C', 'Augustin M', 'Heyer K', 'Knöfel J', 'Cornelsen H', 'Purwins S', 'Herberger K']",2014,47,1,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,"Blome C, et al.

24033279,Can tissue dielectric constant measurement aid in differentiating lymphoedema from lipoedema in women with swollen legs?,"BACKGROUND: Distinguishing lymphoedema from lipoedema in women with swollen legs can be difficult. Local tissue water content can be quantified using tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measurements.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether TDC measurements can differentiate untreated lower extremity lymphoedema from lipoedema, and to test interobserver agreement.
METHODS: Thirty-nine women participated in the study; 10 patients with lipoedema (LipP), nine patients with untreated lymphoedema (U-LP), 10 patients with lymphoedema treated with compression bandaging for ≥ 4 weeks (T-LP) and 10 healthy controls. All subjects were measured at three predefined sites (foot, ankle and lower leg). All groups except U-LP were measured by three blinded investigators. Using a handheld device, a 300-MHz electromagnetic wave is transmitted into the skin via a 2.5-mm depth probe. TDC calculated from the reflected wave is directly proportional to tissue water content ranging from 1 (vacuum) to 78.5 (pure water).
RESULTS: Mean ± SD TDC values for U-LP were 48.8 ± 5.2. TDC values of T-LP, LipP and controls were 34.0 ± 6.6, 29.5 ± 6.2 and 32.3 ± 5.7, respectively. U-LP had significantly higher TDC values in all measurement sites compared with all other groups (P < 0.001). A cut-off value of 40 for ankle and lower-leg measurements correctly differentiated all U-LP from LipP and controls. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.94 for the ankle and the lower leg and 0.63 for the foot.
CONCLUSIONS: TDC values of U-LP were significantly higher than those of T-LP, LipP and controls and may aid in differentiating lymphoedema from lipoedema. Interobserver agreement was high in ankle and lower-leg measurements but low in foot measurements.","['Birkballe S', 'Jensen MR', 'Noerregaard S', 'Gottrup F', 'Karlsmark T']",2014,170,1,Br J Dermatol,"Birkballe S, et al.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed at evaluating the quality of care of lymphoedema in the metropolitan area of Hamburg using guideline-based indicators.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based study including patients with lymphoedema. Assessment included a structured interview, clinical examination and patient-reported outcomes. Quality indicators derived from guidelines by a Delphi consensus were applied.
RESULTS: 348 patients (median age 60.5 years) with lymphoedema (66.4%), lipoedema (9.5%) or combined oedema (24.1%) were included. 86.4% performed compression therapy, 85.6% received lymphatic drainage. On average 55.0% of the quality of care criteria were met; 64.8% were satisfied with care. The distribution curve of the health care index was almost normal.

23800822,Acute epidural lipedema: a novel entity and potential complication of bone morphogenetic protein use in lumbar spine fusion.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce osteogenesis, making them useful for decreasing time to union and increasing union rates. Although the advantages of BMP-2 as a substitute for iliac crest graft have been elucidated, less is known about the safety profile and adverse events linked to their use in spinal fusion. An accumulation of reactive edema in the epidural fat may lead to neural compression and significant morbidity after lumbar spinal fusion. Bone morphogenetic protein has never been implicated as a cause of spinal epidural lipedema.
PURPOSE: We report on a case of rapid accumulation of edematous adipose tissue in the epidural space after lumbar spine decompression and fusion with bone morphogenic protein.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
METHODS: The patient was a 45-year-old woman with chronic back pain, worsening bilateral L5 radiculopathy, and degenerative disc disease. Surgery consisting of a one-level transpedicular decompression, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, and posterolateral fusion was performed using BMP-2 as an adjunct for arthrodesis.
RESULTS: Two days postoperatively, the patient developed progressive cauda equina syndrome. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed edematous epidural fat extending above the initial laminectomy, compromising the spinal canal, and compressing the thecal sac. Emergent laminectomies at L3, L4, and L5 were performed, and intraoperative pathology revealed edematous epidural adipose tissue. The patient's cauda equina syndrome resolved after spinal decompression and the removal of epidural fat. Final cultures were negative for infection, and histology report yielded an accumulation of edematous fibroadipose tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of rapid accumulation of edematous adipose tissue causing cauda equina syndrome after a lumbar decompression and fusion surgery. The acute nature and extensive development of the lipedema presented in this case indicate an intense inflammatory reaction. We hypothesize that there may be a link between the use of BMP-2 and the accumulation of this edematous tissue. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of BMP-2 and specific guidelines for their role in spinal surgery may improve functional outcomes and reduce the number of preventable complications. To the best of our knowledge and after a thorough literature search, this is the only reported case of epidural lipedema causing cauda equina syndrome.","['Merrick MT', 'Hamilton KD', 'Russo SS']",2013,13,10,Spine J,"Merrick MT, et al.

23709549,An under-diagnosed cause of leg swelling.,"A grossly obese woman was wrongly diagnosed throughout her adult life of having lymphoedema. Her condition was subsequently confirmed as lipoedema, an entirely different condition, which is noted in medical text books but is seldom taught to medical students or to general practitioners. The condition is caused by abnormal deposition of adipose tissue in the extremities (usually the lower limbs) and almost exclusively affects women. It often starts at puberty or may occur after pregnancy. The exact aetiology is not yet understood but genetic and hormonal factors may be implicated. The problem is that misdiagnosis leads to inappropriate tests and improper treatment to the patient. When recognised it is often too late to do anything for the patient and they become highly dependent on social care. This case describes how the diagnosis can be confirmed through an ultrasound image and illustrates the need for early recognition to facilitate specialist care.","['Goodliffe JM', 'Ormerod JO', 'Beale A', 'Ramcharitar S']",2013,2013,,BMJ Case Rep,"Goodliffe JM, et al.

We investigated the hypothesis that lymphadenectomy, involves the pelvic floor results in a localized hides or silent pelvic lymphedema characterized by symptoms without signs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 13 colo-rectal cancer patients: five intra-peritoneal adenocarcinoma: 1 sigmoid and 4 upper third rectal cancer (1 male and 3 female) and 9 extra-peritoneal adenocarcinoma: 3 middle and 5 lower third rectal cancer (4 male and 5 female) using 1.5-T magnetic resonance, one week before and twelve months after discharged from hospital.
RESULTS: Lymphedema was discovered on post-operative magnetic resonance imaging of all 9 patients with extra-pertitoneal cancer, whereas preoperative magnetic resonance imaging as well as a post-operative examination of 4 intra-peritoneal adenocarcinoma, revealed no evidence of lymphedema. Unlike the common clinical skin signs that typify all other sites of lymphedema, pelvic lymphedema is hides or silent, with no skin changes or any single symptom manifested. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that pelvic illness alone is accompanied by lymphedema related exclusively to venous congestion, and accumulation of liquid in adipose tissue or lipedema.
CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of the pelvic lymphatic network during pelvic surgery can lead to lymphedema and, pelvic floor disease. Patients should be routinely examined for the possibility of developing this post-surgical syndrome and further studies are needed to establish diagnosis and to evaluate treatment preferences.","['Vannelli A', 'Basilico V', 'Zanardo M', 'Caizzone A', 'Rossi F', 'Battaglia L', 'Scaramuzza D']",2013,17,7,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Vannelli A, et al.

It is being employed with increasing frequency. In 2010, in the USA more than 200.000 liposuctions were performed. Apart from aesthetic indications, liposuction also is suitable for treatment of benign adipose tissue diseases. This intervention is not a simple procedure but requires extensive knowledge and experience to prevent irreversible medical or aesthetic complications. Severe complications including necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, hemorrhage, perforation of inner organs und pulmonary embolism - some even with lethal outcome - occasionally have been reported. These complications were mostly due to inadequate hygiene measures, inappropriate patient selection, use of excessive local anesthesia during mega-liposuction (tumescent technique) and inadequate post-operative surveillance.

Our aim was to investigate whether a monoclonal gammopathy could be a causal factor in progressive lymphedema. We describe a 75 year old patient with a rapidly progressive lipo-lymphedema and a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) suspected as a key etiological factor. Dermal fibroblasts were cultured from lesional lower leg skin and non-lesional abdominal skin and compared to healthy control fibroblasts.

Upon restimulation with patient or healthy control serum, lesional fibroblasts showed significantly increased proliferation rates and FGF-2 production in vitro. Non-lesional abdominal fibroblasts showed an intermediate phenotype between lesional and control fibroblasts. Our findings provide the first evidence that lesional dermal fibroblasts from lipo-lymphedema with plasma cell infiltration show increased proliferation and FGF-2 production and that both local tissue factors and altered FGF-2 serum levels associated with monoclonal gammopathies might contribute to this phenotype. Thus we propose a possible pathophysiologic link between the gammopathy-associated factors and the generation of lymphedema with initial fibrogenesis aggravating pre-existing lipedema.","['Thielitz A', 'Bellutti M', 'Bonnekoh B', 'Franke I', 'Wiede A', 'Lotzing M', 'Reinhold D', 'Gollnick H']",2012,45,3,Lymphology,"Thielitz A, et al.

23231593,Thick legs - not always lipedema.,"Due to its increased presence in the press and on television, the diagnosis of lipedema is on the way to becoming a trendy diagnosis for those with thick legs. Despite this, one must recognize that lipedema is a very rare disease. It is characterized by disproportional obesity of the extremities, especially in the region of the hip and the legs, hematoma development after minimal trauma, and increased pressure-induced or spontaneous pain. Aids for making the correct diagnosis are (duplex) sonography, the waist-hip index or the waist-height index and lymphoscintigraphy. Important differential diagnoses are constitutional variability of the legs, lipohypertrophy in obesity, edema in immobility, edema in chronic venous insufficiency and rheumatic diseases. The symptom-based therapy of lipedema consists of conservative (compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise) and surgical treatments (liposuction). Until now there is no curative therapy. Obesity is an important risk factor for the severity and prognosis of lipedema. Further studies for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of lipedema and in the end possible curative treatments are urgently needed.","['Reich-Schupke S', 'Altmeyer P', 'Stücker M']",2013,11,3,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Reich-Schupke S, et al.

23185156,Is lymphostasis an aggravant of lipedema?,A 54-year-old female patient reported that a characteristic of her family was 'fat legs' with postural edema since adolescence. Over the years the patient had been gaining weight with an increase in fatty tissue in the legs and arms. At the age of 24 years she started taking oral contraceptives and noted worse swelling and pain in the lower limbs. She was advised to suspend the use of the contraceptives and to start using a transdermal lymphatic system drug and physical exercise which partially improved the symptoms. Three years ago she noted that the swelling was increasing without improvement and sought a physician who raised the hypothesis of lymphedema and referred her to a specialized center. Lipedema and lymphedema was diagnosed in the physical examination. A 3-day intensive treatment program (8 h daily) was started for lymphedema which included manual and mechanical lymph drainage associated with short-strech (<50 mm Hg) compression stockings custom made using a cotton-polyester fabric. Volumetry and perimetry were performed before starting and after the treatment and the legs were photographed. Volumetric and perimetric reductions were obtained suggesting the involvement of regional cutaneous lymphostasis in this disease.,"['Godoy Mde F', 'Buzato E', 'Brigidio PA', 'Pereira de Godoy JM']",2012,4,3,Case Rep Dermatol,"Godoy Mde F, et al.

23057152,Lipedema is associated with increased aortic stiffness.,"Lipedema is a disproportional obesity due to unknown pathomechanism. Its major hallmark is frequent hematoma formation related to increased capillary fragility and reduced venoarterial reflex. Beyond microangiopathy, both venous and lymphatic dysfunction have also been documented. However, arterial circulation in lipedema has not been examined, and therefore we explored aortic elastic properties by echocardiography. Fourteen women with and 14 without lipedema were included in the study. Each subject consented to blood pressure measurement, physical examination, and transthoracic echocardiography. Aortic stiffness index (beta), distensibility, and strain were evaluated from aortic diameter and blood pressure data. Mean systolic (30.0 +/- 3.2 vs. 25.5 +/- 3.6, P < 0.05) and diastolic (27.8 +/- 3.3 vs. 22.3 +/- 3.1) aortic diameters (in mm) and aortic stiffness index (9.05 +/- 7.45 vs. 3.76 +/- 1.22, P < 0.05) were significantly higher, while aortic strain (0.082 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.143 +/- 0.038, P < 0.05) and distensibility (2.24 +/- 1.07 vs. 4.38 +/- 1.61, P < 0.05) were significantly lower in lipedematous patients compared to controls.

All of the current consensus documents can be accessed on the ICC website (http://www.icc-compressionclub.com/index.php). In May 2011, the ICC met in Brussels during the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) annual conference. With almost 50 members in attendance, the day-long ICC meeting challenged a series of dogmas and myths that exist when considering compression therapies. In preparation for a discussion on beliefs surrounding compression, a forum was established on the ICC website where presenters were able to display a summary of their thoughts upon each dogma to be discussed during the meeting. Members of the ICC could then provide comments on each topic thereby widening the discussion to the entire membership of the ICC rather than simply those who were attending the EWMA conference. This article presents an extended report of the issues that were discussed, with each dogma covered in a separate section.

Lipedema is a disorder of adipose tissue that occurs almost exclusively in obese women. It is characterized by bilateral enlargement from hip to ankle due to abnormal depositions of subcutaneous fat associated with often mild edema, usually sparing the feet. Disease onset is usually at or soon after puberty. Lipedema results in considerable frustration and distress resulting from the cosmetic appearance. Patients may complain of pain, tenderness, easy bruising of the affected areas with moderate to severe sensitivity to digital pressure or pinching. Imaging studies using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, lymphoscintigraphy are not indicated, except if the diagnosis is atypic or doubtful. Long-term evolution may alter lymphatic system and lead to a lipo-lymphedema with specific complications such as cellulitis. Lipedema management is not codified and included weight loss (poorly improving leg appearance or discomfort), psychological counselling and compression therapy.

22546240,"Review of Dercum's disease and proposal of diagnostic criteria, diagnostic methods, classification and management.","UNLABELLED: DEFINITION AND CLINICAL PICTURE: We propose the minimal definition of Dercum's disease to be generalised overweight or obesity in combination with painful adipose tissue. The associated symptoms in Dercum's disease include fatty deposits, easy bruisability, sleep disturbances, impaired memory, depression, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, diabetes, bloating, constipation, fatigue, weakness and joint aches.
CLASSIFICATION: We suggest that Dercum's disease is classified into: I. Generalised diffuse form A form with diffusely widespread painful adipose tissue without clear lipomas, II. Generalised nodular form - a form with general pain in adipose tissue and intense pain in and around multiple lipomas, and III. Localised nodular form - a form with pain in and around multiple lipomas IV. Juxtaarticular form - a form with solitary deposits of excess fat for example at the medial aspect of the knee.
EPIDEMIOLOGY: Dercum's disease most commonly appears between the ages of 35 and 50 years and is five to thirty times more common in women than in men. The prevalence of Dercum's disease has not yet been exactly established.
AETIOLOGY: Proposed, but unconfirmed aetiologies include: nervous system dysfunction, mechanical pressure on nerves, adipose tissue dysfunction and trauma. DIAGNOSIS AND DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and should be made by systematic physical examination and thorough exclusion of differential diagnoses. Advisably, the diagnosis should be made by a physician with a broad experience of patients with painful conditions and knowledge of family medicine, internal medicine or pain management. The diagnosis should only be made when the differential diagnoses have been excluded.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Differential diagnoses include: fibromyalgia, lipoedema, panniculitis, endocrine disorders, primary psychiatric disorders, multiple symmetric lipomatosis, familial multiple lipomatosis, and adipose tissue tumours. GENETIC COUNSELLING: The majority of the cases of Dercum's disease occur sporadically. A to G mutation at position A8344 of mitochondrial DNA cannot be detected in patients with Dercum's disease. HLA (human leukocyte antigen) typing has not revealed any correlation between typical antigens and the presence of the condition. MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT: The following treatments have lead to some pain reduction in patients with Dercum's disease: Liposuction, analgesics, lidocaine, methotrexate and infliximab, interferon α-2b, corticosteroids, calcium-channel modulators and rapid cycling hypobaric pressure. As none of the treatments have led to long lasting complete pain reduction and revolutionary results, we propose that Dercum's disease should be treated in multidisciplinary teams specialised in chronic pain.

We therefore aimed to measure pain intensity prior and subsequent to treatment. 38 women with lipedema were enrolled in the study with 19 patients undergoing treatment and 19 serving as the control group using exclusively moisturizers. Treatment consisted of once daily manual lymph drainage (MLD), intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), and multilayered short-stretch bandaging performed throughout a 5-day-course. Pain was evaluated with a 10-item questionnaire, a pain rating scale (PRS), and the Wong-Baker Faces scale. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction of pain with a decrease in mean scores of all three measures. In the control group, only PRS showed significant decrease. Our study results indicate that this treatment regimen not only reduces leg volume and capillary fragility, but also improves pain intensity in patients with lipedema.","['Szolnoky G', 'Varga E', 'Varga M', 'Tuczai M', 'Dósa-Rácz E', 'Kemény L']",2011,44,4,Lymphology,"Szolnoky G, et al.

Lifestyle changes, such as reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity are standard care for obesity. Although lifestyle changes and bariatric surgery work effectively for the obesity component of RADs, these treatments do not routinely reduce the abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of RADs. RAD SAT likely results from the growth of a brown stem cell population with secondary lymphatic dysfunction in MSL, or by primary vascular and lymphatic dysfunction in lipedema and DD. People with RADs do not lose SAT from caloric limitation and increased energy expenditure alone. In order to improve recognition of RADs apart from obesity, the diagnostic criteria, histology and pathophysiology of RADs are presented and contrasted to familial partial lipodystrophies, acquired partial lipodystrophies and obesity with which they may be confused. Treatment recommendations focus on evidence-based data and include lymphatic decongestive therapy, medications and supplements that support loss of RAD SAT. Associated RAD conditions including depression, anxiety and pain will improve as healthcare providers learn to identify and adopt alternative treatment regimens for the abnormal SAT component of RADs.

21824127,Tumescent liposuction in lipoedema yields good long-term results.,"BACKGROUND: Lipoedema is a painful disease in women with circumscribed increased subcutaneous fatty tissue, oedema, pain and bruising. Whereas conservative methods with combined decongestive therapy (manual lymphatic drainage, compression garments) have been well established over the past 50years, surgical therapy with tumescent liposuction has only been used for about 10years and long-term results are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of liposuction concerning appearance (body shape) and associated complaints after a long-term period.
METHODS: A total of 164 patients who had undergone conservative therapy over a period of years, were treated by liposuction under tumescent local anaesthesia with vibrating microcannulas. In a monocentric study, 112 could be re-evaluated with a standardized questionnaire after a mean of 3years and 8months (range 1year and 1month to 7years and 4months) following the initial surgery and a mean of 2years and 11months (8months to 6years and 10months) following the last surgery.
RESULTS: All patients showed a distinct reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue (average 9846mL per person) with improvement of shape and normalization of body proportions. Additionally, they reported either a marked improvement or a complete disappearance of spontaneous pain, sensitivity to pressure, oedema, bruising, restriction of movement and cosmetic impairment, resulting in a tremendous increase in quality of life; all these complaints were reduced significantly (P<0·001). Patients with lipoedema stage II and III showed better improvement compared with patients with stage I. Physical decongestive therapy could be either omitted (22·4% of cases) or continued to a much lower degree. No serious complications (wound infection rate 1·4%, bleeding rate 0·3%) were observed following surgery.

Many general practitioners will rarely see these disorders with the consequence that diagnosis is often delayed. The pathophysiological basis is edematization of the tissues. Lymphedema involves an impairment of lymph drainage with resultant fluid build-up. Lipedema arises from an orthostatic predisposition to edema in pathologically increased subcutaneous tissue. Treatment includes complex physical decongestion by manual lymph drainage and absolutely uncompromising compression therapy whether it is by bandage in the intensive phase to reduce edema or with a flat knit compression stocking to maintain volume.,['Wagner S'],2011,40,4,Vasa,Wagner S.

21197318,Pilot study: rapidly cycling hypobaric pressure improves pain after 5 days in adiposis dolorosa.,"Adiposis dolorosa (AD) is a rare disorder of painful nodular subcutaneous fat accompanied by fatigue, difficulty with weight loss, inflammation, increased fluid in adipose tissue (lipedema and lymphedema), and hyperalgesia. Sequential compression relieves lymphedema pain; we therefore hypothesized that whole body cyclic pneumatic hypobaric compression may relieve pain in AD. To avoid exacerbating hyperalgesia, we utilized a touch-free method, which is delivered via a high-performance altitude simulator, the Cyclic Variations in Altitude Conditioning™ (CVAC™) process. As a pilot study, 10 participants with AD completed pain and quality of life questionnaires before and after 20-40 minutes of CVAC process daily for 5 days. Participants lost weight (195.5 ± 17.6-193.8 ± 17.3 lb; P = 0.03), and bioimpedance significantly decreased (510 ± 36-490 ± 38 ohm; P = 0.01). There was a significant decrease in scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (P = 0.039), in average (P = 0.002), highest (P = 0.029), lowest (P = 0.04), and current pain severity (P = 0.02) on the Visual Analogue Scale, but there was no change in pain quality by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. There were no significant changes in total and physical SF-36 scores, but the mental score improved significantly (P = 0.049). There were no changes in the Pain Disability Index or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. These data present a potential, new, noninvasive means of treating pain in AD by whole body pneumatic compression as part of the CVAC process.

21187804,Differential diagnosis of lower extremity enlargement in pediatric patients referred with a diagnosis of lymphedema.,"BACKGROUND: There are many causes for a large lower limb in the pediatric age group. These children are often mislabeled as having lymphedema, and incorrect diagnosis can lead to improper treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients referred for lower extremity ""lymphedema"" and to clarify management.
METHODS: The authors' Vascular Anomalies Center database was reviewed between 1999 and 2010 for patients referred with a diagnosis of lymphedema of the lower extremity. Records were studied to determine the correct cause for the enlarged extremity. Alternative diagnoses, sex, age of onset, and imaging studies were also analyzed.
RESULTS: A referral diagnosis of lower extremity lymphedema was given to 170 children; however, the condition was confirmed in only 72.9 percent of patients. Forty-six children (27.1 percent) had another disorder: microcystic/macrocystic lymphatic malformation (19.6 percent), noneponymous combined vascular malformation (13.0 percent), capillary malformation (10.9 percent), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (10.9 percent), hemihypertrophy (8.7 percent), posttraumatic swelling (8.7 percent), Parkes Weber syndrome (6.5 percent), lipedema (6.5 percent), venous malformation (4.3 percent), rheumatologic disorder (4.3 percent), infantile hemangioma (2.2 percent), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (2.2 percent), or lipofibromatosis (2.2 percent). Age of onset in children with lymphedema was older than in patients with another diagnosis (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: ""Lymphedema"" is not a generic term. Approximately one-fourth of pediatric patients with a large lower extremity are misdiagnosed as having lymphedema; the most commonly confused causes are other types of vascular anomalies. History, physical examination, and often radiographic studies are required to differentiate lymphedema from other conditions to ensure the child is managed appropriately.","['Schook CC', 'Mulliken JB', 'Fishman SJ', 'Alomari AI', 'Grant FD', 'Greene AK']",2011,127,4,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Schook CC, et al.

21166777,Liposuction is an effective treatment for lipedema-results of a study with 25 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a painful, genetically induced abnormal deposition of subcutaneous fat in the extremities of almost exclusively women. The pathogenesis is unknown and no curative treatment is available. Conservative therapy consisting of lymphatic drainage and compression stockings is often recommended, but is only effective against the edema. Some patients show a short-term improvement when treated in this way. The removal of the increased fat tissue of lipedema has become possible by employing advanced liposuction techniques which utilize vibrating microcannulas under tumescent local anesthesia. The effectiveness of this approach to lipedema is the subject of this study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 25 patients were examined before liposuction and six months thereafter. The survey included the measurement of the volume of the legs and several parameters of typical pain and discomfort. The parameters were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS, scale 0-10).
RESULTS: The volume of the leg was reduced by 6.99 %. Pain, as the predominant symptom in lipedema, was significantly reduced from 7.2 ± 2.2 to 2.1 ± 2.1 (p < 0.001). Quality of life as a measure of the psychological strain caused by lipedema improved from 8.7 ± 1.7 to 3.6 ± 2.5 (p < 0.001).

In a subset of these patients, a clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) results; this needs to be quickly and definitively clarified by a vascular physician. The question arose of how often a clinical suspicion of DVT was confirmed in an inpatient population and which alternative diagnoses were able to be made by angiologists.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, all inpatients in the Angiologic Vascular Diagnostics Center of the University Hospital Halle, Germany, examined in 2007 for a suspicion of DVT were evaluated with respect to the definitively made diagnosis.
RESULTS: In 213 (28.6%) of 745 suspected cases of DVT, a DVT was confirmed. In 532 patients (71.4%), DVT was excluded. In 314 of these patients, 436 alternative diagnoses were recorded in the diagnostic reports of angiologic examinations. In 38.6% (n = 168), other venous causes could be confirmed as the most common alternative diagnosis. There were chronic venous diseases in 28% (n = 122), superficial thrombophlebitis (n = 27), and tumor-related pelvic vein compression (n = 19). 17.4% (n = 76) exhibited lymphedema. In 13.3% (n = 58), a generalized edema was diagnosed. Arthrogenic causes followed with 12.8% (n = 56). Lipedema (5.3%) and hematoma (5%) could be verified as other important differential diagnoses. Rare causes were symptomatic or ruptured Baker's cysts (2.5%), erysipelas (2.5%), abscess, aneurysm, muscle tears, and tumors.
CONCLUSION: The variety of alternative diagnoses in patients with clinical suspicion of DVT is high. The knowledge and systematic examination of potential, even rare differential diagnoses after exclusion of DVT are part of the repertoire of the vascular physician. Unnecessary and expensive, as well as onerous, diagnostic procedures on the patient can be avoided. Anticoagulation that was begun as a result of the suspicion of DVT can quickly be stopped.","['Taute BM', 'Melnyk H', 'Podhaisky H']",2010,105,9,Med Klin (Munich),"Taute BM, et al.

METHODS: Six patients treated at a single center during the years 2004 to 2008 have been included. All patients were female and obese (body mass index 34 to 41.9; mean 38.2+/-3.8) with an age range from 29 to 78 years (mean 55.7+/-20.5 years), five of them had co-morbidities.
RESULTS: The total amount of lipoaspirates varied between 1500 mL and 4800 mL. Pain could be reduced in all four patients with Dercum's disease. Large adipose tissue removing implies a better the outcome for pain. Patient's satisfaction was ""high"" or ""very high"" in 5 and ""medium"" in one.

20408836,High-resolution cutaneous ultrasonography to differentiate lipoedema from lymphoedema.,"BACKGROUND: Lipoedema is an accumulation of fat abnormally distributed in the lower limbs, and lymphoedema is oedema caused by a deficiency of the lymphatic system. High-resolution ultrasound operating at 20 MHz makes it possible to characterize dermal oedema.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to demonstrate that high-resolution ultrasound imaging of the skin can differentiate lipoedema from lymphoedema.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with lymphoedema (22 legs), eight patients with lipoedema (16 legs) and eight controls (16 legs) were included. Patients with lipolymphoedema were excluded. Ultrasound examinations were carried out with a real-time high-resolution ultrasound device on three different sites for each lower limb. The images were then anonymized and examined by an independent dermatologist who was blind to the clinical diagnosis. A new series of images was examined by three dermatologists to check interobserver agreement.
RESULTS: A significant difference in dermal thickness was observed between patients with lymphoedema and those with lipoedema and between patients with lymphoedema and controls. No significant difference in dermal thickness was shown between patients with lipoedema and controls at the thigh or ankle. Dermal hypo-echogenicity was found in at least one of the three sites in 100% of patients with lymphoedema, 12.5% of cases with lipoedema and 6.25% of the controls. Hypoechogenicity affected the entire dermis in all cases of lymphoedema except one. In cases of lipoedema and controls, hypoechogenicity was localized at the ankle and prevailed in the upper dermis. The expert correctly diagnosed all lower limbs with lymphoedema. No cases of lipoedema were diagnosed as lymphoedema. Exact interobserver agreement was excellent (0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution cutaneous ultrasonography makes it possible to differentiate lymphoedema from lipoedema. Obtaining a reliable diagnosis through high-resolution cutaneous ultrasonography might be valuable for improving the treatment of lipoedema and lymphoedema.","['Naouri M', 'Samimi M', 'Atlan M', 'Perrodeau E', 'Vallin C', 'Zakine G', 'Vaillant L', 'Machet L']",2010,163,2,Br J Dermatol,"Naouri M, et al.

Lipedema is an under-recognized condition, often misdiagnosed as lymphedema or dismissed as simple obesity. We present a series of pedigrees and propose that lipedema is a genetic condition with either X-linked dominant inheritance or more likely, autosomal dominant inheritance with sex limitation. Lipedema appears to be a condition almost exclusively affecting females, presumably estrogen-requiring as it usually manifests at puberty. Lipedema is an entity distinct from obesity, but may be wrongly diagnosed as primary obesity, due to clinical overlap.

A detailed family history revealed short stature and swelling of legs which only affected females in four generations of his family.
METHODS: Combined pituitary function tests revealed growth hormone deficiency, secondary hypothyroidism and hypoprolactinemia in the proband. His mother had hypoprolactinemia and growth hormone deficiency. A diagnosis of inherited combined pituitary deficiency due to a PIT-1 mutation was suspected in view of the short stature with associated multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies.
RESULTS: A mutation was identified in PIT-1 (POU1F1), 196C>T, which produces the amino acid change P24L in exon 1. The mutation was also found in the mother of the proband but not in his phenotypically normal half-sister.
CONCLUSION: The case shows a novel association of two rare conditions Pit-1 mutation and lipoedema in a family that has not been described before.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 26 lower extremities in 13 consecutive patients (5 lipedema, 8 lipo-lymphedema) were examined by MR lymphangiography. 18 mL of gadoteridol and 1 mL of mepivacainhydrochloride 1% were subdivided into 10 portions and injected intracutaneously in the forefoot. MR imaging was performed with a 1.5-T system equipped with high-performance gradients. For MR lymphangiography, a 3D-spoiled gradient-echo sequence was used. For evaluation of the lymphedema a heavily T2-weighted 3D-TSE sequence was performed.
RESULTS: In all 16 lower extremities (100%) with lipo-lymphedema, high signal intensity areas in the epifascial region could be detected on the 3D-TSE sequence. In the 16 examined lower extremities with lipo-lymphedema, 8 lower legs and 3 upper legs demonstrated enlarged lymphatic vessels up to a diameter of 3 mm. In two lower legs with lipo-lymphedema, an area of dermal back-flow was seen, indicating lymphatic outflow obstruction. In the 10 examined lower extremities with clinically pure lipedema, 4 lower legs and 2 upper legs demonstrated enlarged lymphatic vessels up to a diameter of 2 mm, indicating a subclinical status of lymphedema. In all examined extremities, the inguinal lymph nodes demonstrated a contrast material enhancement in the first image acquisition 15 min after injection.
CONCLUSION: MR lymphangiography is a safe and accurate minimal-invasive imaging modality for the evaluation of the lymphatic circulation in patients with lipedema and lipo-lymphedema of the lower extremities. If the extent of lymphatic involvement is unclear at the initial clinical examination or requires a better definition for optimal therapeutic planning, MR lymphangiography is able to identify the anatomic and physiological derangements and to establish an objective baseline.","['Lohrmann C', 'Foeldi E', 'Langer M']",2009,77,3,Microvasc Res,"Lohrmann C, et al.

On the basis of clinical observations, complete decongestive physiotherapy diminishes the incidence of hematomas due to minor injuries beyond leg volume reduction. Hematoma development may be caused by altered capillary resistance (CR) or altered capillary fragility (CF). We measured capillary fragility (CF) before and after complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) to examine, whether CDP could reduce CF. 38 women with lipedema were included in the study. Twenty-one (21) patients were treated with CDP and 17 using exclusively moisturizers as the control group. CDP comprised once daily manual lymph drainage, intermittent pneumatic compression and multilayered short-stretch bandaging performed throughout a 5-day-course. CF was evaluated with the vacuum suction method (VSM) using Parrot's angiosterrometer in both groups. Decongestive therapy resulted in a significant reduction of the number of petechiae while no change was detected within the control group. Complete decongestive physiotherapy significantly reduced CF in patients with lipedema and this reduction may lead to reduced hematoma formation.","['Szolnoky G', 'Nagy N', 'Kovács RK', 'Dósa-Rácz E', 'Szabó A', 'Bársony K', 'Balogh M', 'Kemény L']",2008,41,4,Lymphology,"Szolnoky G, et al.

Spontaneous pain, pain to pressure and tendency to hematoma are characteristic. One of the possible causes of a fat leg, that is a very common complaint, is lipedema. Main differential diagnoses are obesity, lipohypertrophy and primary and secondary lymphedema. It is often associated with chronic venous and lymphatic insufficiency, early degenerative articular disease and obesity. The disease is rarely recognized and the treatment modalities are not widely known. Therefore patients feel very frustrated that leads to psychologic disorders. Until recently only conservative treatment was possible (combination of manual or intermittent pneumatic drainage, compression bandages and garments and physiotherapy). More recently surgical intervention (liposuction) is also included in the treatment options. The significance of lipedema is due not only to the disease itself, but also to the combination of lipedema and the group of associated and secondary diseases (articular and venous diseases, lymphedema, obesity, psychologic disorders). The more diseases coexist, the worse is the prognosis of lipedema itself.

18512541,Lymphoedema and lipoedema of the extremities.,"Lymphoedema is a clinical manifestation of an impaired lymphatic drainage with accumulation of lymphatic fluid. Lipoedema is characterized by bilateral enlargement of the legs and/or arms due to abnormal deposition of fatty tissue, which accumulates fluid. Conservative treatment including compressions garments and lymphatic drainage is suitable to prevent ongoing clinical deterioration although both diseases cannot be cured. The ability to properly diagnose lymphoedema and lipoedema is crucial to prevent the significant morbidity and loss of quality of life that is associated with this condition. It is imperative that patients with lymphoedema are referred to specially trained healthcare professionals to ensure optimal treatment. Continuous therapy with strict compliance of the patients is essential, and premature interruption is the most frequent mistake. Lipoedema is a different entity but patients are still fighting for acceptance. The mutual relation of lipoedema and obesity and the poor knowledge of the underlying mechanisms limit the acceptance of lipoedema as a relevant disease.",['Kröger K'],2008,37,1,Vasa,Kröger K.

18489272,Cellulite: nature and aetiopathogenesis.,"Only a limited number of studies on cellulite have been published in the international literature and many of them reach somewhat antithetical conclusions. Consequently, it is not yet possible to reconcile the extreme differences of opinion which have lingered on for years concerning the nature of this disorder, as well as its origin and even the most basic aspects of its histopathological classification. It does not even have a recognized name: in fact, the term 'cellulitis' is used in scientific English to indicate a spreading gangrenous infection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The other terms used from time to time [panniculitis, lipodystrophy, edematofibrosclerotic panniculitis (EFP), liposclerosis, lipoedema, etc.] have quite different morphological and pathogenetic connotations in general. Over the last few decades, three major conflicting theories have emerged in relation to the ethiopathogenesis of cellulite. These indicate, respectively, the following causes: 1. Oedema caused by excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix. 2. A homeostatic alteration on a regional microcirculatory level; this pathogenetic theory is summarized in a synthetic and self-explanatory denomination: EFP. 3. A peculiar anatomical conformation of the subcutaneous tissue of women, different from male morphology. These theories must all now be updated in the light of recent advances on the sophisticated and composite physiopathology of the adipose organ - which acts not only as a control device which regulates the systematic equilibrium of energy and modulates the food intake and the metabolism of other tissue substrate through a multiple glandular secretion of hormones and parahormones.","['Terranova F', 'Berardesca E', 'Maibach H']",2006,28,3,Int J Cosmet Sci,"Terranova F, et al.

A complex of methods was employed: the clinical nmltimodality examination, multilevel volumetric monitoring before and after daily orthostatic loading, occlusion plethysmography, multilevel ultrasound duplex scanning of the venous system arid subcutis as well as radiography. Only in the third of cases (n=149, 36.0%) was primarily of distal character attended by lesion of the foot and leg, with clear daily dynamics and dependence on the daily orthostatic loading-eaema proper. Two types of edema were distinguished: 1)with pronounced daily dynamics and return to the initial parameters in the morning hours (131 patients) and 2) with moderate daily dynamics of edema and the lack of return to the initial parameters in the morning hours (18 patients). Such difference stems from the type of coexistent lymphatic insufficiency (with a high and low drop). However, only the first type is initially determined by venous insufficiency. The majorityof this group patients were found to suffer thrombosis of the ti-bial veins in the presence of varicosity running a prolonged course. Hinetyone patients (22.0%) had a proximally oriented enlargement, with pronounced orthostasodependerice, of the muscle segments of the limb because of orthostasodependent phlebopaxhy. In the remaining 173 (41.9%) patients examined, vascular eaema was coupled with non-vascular causes of limb size enlargement (arthrosis of leg joints, lipoedema) or the latter ones were isblated. The aim of the present study was to analyze the causes of the syndrome of limb size enlargement in varicosity with the purpose of upgrading the efficacy and trend of the treatment.","['Tsukanov IuT', 'Tsukanov AIu']",2007,13,4,Angiol Sosud Khir,Tsukanov IuT and Tsukanov AIu.

18250486,Lymphedema in the morbidly obese patient: unique challenges in a unique population.,"The population of morbidly obese patients, along with the incidence of lymphedema and massive localized lymphedema associated with this condition, is increasing. A 5-year retrospective review of data (2000-2005) shows that the percentage of patients >350 lb in the authors' clinic population increased from approximately 7% to 11% and 75% of their morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40) had or have lymphedema. After a differential diagnosis between lipedema and lymphedema (primary or secondary) has been made, lymphedema management options include compression bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage, and localized surgeries. The treatment of morbidly obese lymphedema patients requires additional staff time and specialized equipment to move or position them and may be confounded by other conditions (eg, heart failure and venous insufficiency) that contribute to edema. Lymphedema treatments have been found to be useful, providing patients are able to follow treatment guidelines, especially with regard to weight control. In the authors' experience, massive localized lymphedema will recur unless the primary issue of obesity is addressed. Establishing clear criteria and patient participation guidelines before initiating a comprehensive localized lymphedema program will improve outcomes.","['Fife CE', 'Carter MJ']",2008,54,1,Ostomy Wound Manage,Fife CE and Carter MJ.

17853615,Fluorescence microlymphography: diagnostic potential in lymphedema and basis for the measurement of lymphatic pressure and flow velocity.,"Fluorescence microlymphography (FML) is an almost atraumatic technique used to visualize the superficial skin network of initial lymphatics through the intact skin of man. Visualization was performed with an incident light fluorescence microscope following subepidermal injection of minute amounts of FITC-dextran 150,000 using microneedles. Emanating from the bright dye depot, the surrounding network of microvessels is filled, documentation performed by photography or video film. In congenital Milroy lymphedema, a lack of microlymphatics (aplasia) is typical while in other primary lymphedemas and in secondary lymphedema after mastectomy or irradiation of proximal lymph nodes, the network remains intact but the depicted area is enlarged. Lymphatic microangiopathy characterized by obliterations of capillary meshes or mesh segments develops in phleboedema with trophic skin changes, progressive systemic sclerosis and Fabry's disease. In lipedema, lymphatic microaneurysms are stained. Microlymphatic pressure may also be measured using FML. For this purpose, glass micropipettes are inserted into the capillaries by means of a micromanipulator and pressure is determined by the servo-nulling technique. Normal subjects produced significantly lower pressure (7.9 +/- 3.4 mmHg) compared to patients with primary lymphedema (15.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg, p<0.001). This characteristic lymphatic hypertension may be improved by complex physiotherapy or local application of prostaglandins. Additionally, a modification of the FML procedure can be used to measure lymphatic capillary flow velocity in controls and patients. FML is suited to confirm the clinical diagnosis of lymphedema, contributes to distinguish among various forms of edema, and is useful in clinical research. In addition, FML has also become a tool for experimental animal studies including the depiction of gastric microlymphatics, the measurement of flow velocity in the naked mouse tail, and in evaluation of lymphangiogenesis in a model of Milroy disease.","['Bollinger A', 'Amann-Vesti BR']",2007,40,2,Lymphology,Bollinger A and Amann-Vesti BR.

17255648,Evaluation and management of the fat leg syndrome.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss the initial evaluation of a patient presenting with lower extremity enlargement. 2. Distinguish underlying medical conditions causing lower extremity enlargement, including lymphedema and lipedema. 3. Discuss appropriate management and treatment for patients presenting with these conditions.
BACKGROUND: Given the epidemic of obesity in the United States, many patients will consult the plastic surgeon with complaints of lower extremity enlargement secondary to ""fat legs."" In addition to cosmetic disfigurement, some patients may suffer from underlying medical conditions that are responsible for their symptoms. Knowledge of these other causes, including lymphedema and a disorder of abnormal fat deposition known as lipedema, ensures appropriate management and/or surgical treatment for affected patients.
METHODS: Initial evaluation for lower extremity enlargement should include a discussion of pertinent medical history and a focused physical examination for findings that might indicate a pathologic underlying cause. When indicated, patients should undergo additional testing, including radiologic studies, to confirm their diagnoses.
RESULTS: For those patients found to have lymphatic dysfunction, conservative management, such as massage therapy, use of compression garments, and limb elevation, should be initially recommended. Excisional or suction-assisted lipectomy may be considered in patients who fail conservative therapy. More extensive consultation with the plastic surgeon is recommended for patients seeking aesthetic improvement in contour and shape of large legs without a specified underlying abnormality.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower extremity enlargement may present to the plastic surgeon unsure of the specific cause of their deformity. A broad differential diagnosis exists for their presentation, which can be narrowed by using the common features and unique manifestations of the conditions.","['Warren AG', 'Janz BA', 'Borud LJ', 'Slavin SA']",2007,119,1,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Warren AG, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of surgery (liposuction) concerning appearance and associated complaints.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients, who had undergone conservative therapy over a period of years, were treated by liposuction under tumescent local anesthesia with vibrating microcannulas. Twenty-one could be reevaluated after an average of 12.2 (1-26) months.
RESULTS: All showed great improvement, with normalization of body proportions. Additionally, spontaneous pain, sensitivity to pressure, and bruising either disappeared completely or improved markedly. Other than minor swelling for a few days, no complications could be observed following surgery. All patients reported a tremendous increase in their quality of life. Physical therapy had to be continued to a much lower degree.
CONCLUSION: Tumescent liposuction has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for lipedema.","['Schmeller W', 'Meier-Vollrath I']",2006,10,1,J Cutan Med Surg,Schmeller W and Meier-Vollrath I.

16403988,Anti-fibrosclerotic effects of shock wave therapy in lipedema and cellulite.,"In vivo measurements in 26 female patients with lipedema and cellulite parameters were carried out before and after therapy by means of complex physical decongestive therapy (CPDT) including manual lymph drainage and compression as main components and/or shock wave therapy (SWT). Oxidative stress parameters of blood serum and biomechanic skin properties/smoothening of dermis and hypodermis surface were evaluated. Oxidative stress in lipedema and cellulite was demonstrated by increased serum concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and plasma protein carbonyls compared with healthy control persons. Both MDA and protein carbonyls in blood plasma decreased after serial shock wave application and CPDT. The SWT itself and CPDT itself lead to MDA release from edematous tissue into the plasma. Obviously both therapy types, SWT and CPDT, mitigate oxidative stress in lipedema and cellulite. In parallel SWT improved significantly the biomechanic skin properties leading to smoothening of dermis and hypodermis surface. Significant correlation between MDA depletion of edematous and lipid enriched dermis and improvement of mechanic skin properties was demonstrated. From these findings it is concluded, that a release of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products from edematous dermis is an important sclerosis-preventing effect of SWT and/or CPDT in lipedema and cellulite. Expression of factors stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis such as VEGF was not induced by SWT and/or CPDT and, therefore, not involved in beneficial effects by SWT and/or CPDT.","['Siems W', 'Grune T', 'Voss P', 'Brenke R']",2005,24,1-4,Biofactors,"Siems W, et al.

16324854,Management of lower limb lymphoedema in the United Kingdom.,"OBJECTIVE: Many investigations and treatments exist for lower limb lymphoedema. We undertook a survey on the management of this condition by vascular surgeons and the resources available for its treatment in the UK.
DESIGN: A questionnaire was designed to assess the management of lymphoedema.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A postal questionnaire was sent to all members of the The Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
RESULTS: 251/440 (57%) consultant surgeons returned a completed questionnaire comprising 45.3% teaching hospital and 54.7% district general hospital (DGH) consultants. 77.9% of the consultants saw less than 10 patients annually with lymphoedema. The commonest causes of lymphoedema were primary lymphoedema (99.3%) and malignancy (37.1%). Lipoedema, a cause of limb swelling was only seen or recognised by 46.2% of the consultants. The commonest investigations performed were a duplex scan, lymphoscintigram, full blood count and urea and electrolytes. The common methods of confirming lymphoedema were either by lymphoscintigram (54.5%) or from a diagnosis of exclusion (33.7%). Lymphoedema physiotherapy was available only to 53.8% of the consultants. Surgery was performed by 10.5% of consultants. 73.4% of the consultants believed that lymphoedema is managed inadequately and 72.9% believed that resources are insufficient in the UK for this condition.
CONCLUSION: In the UK the majority of vascular consultants see less than 10 patients annually with lymphoedema. Very few patients undergo confirmation of this diagnosis with non-invasive investigation and very few consultants perform surgery. Management of this condition is perceived by the consultants to be poor, with a lack of resources and particular shortage of lymphoedema physiotherapists. Centralisation of these services may be a way of improving this condition.","['Tiwari A', 'Myint F', 'Hamilton G']",2006,31,3,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,"Tiwari A, et al.

It is seen most frequently in obese women. Lipedema appears to be a distinct clinical entity but may be confounded with lymphedema.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To analyze and to compare between lipedema and lymphedema the qualitative and quantitative aspects of lymphoscintigraphy.
METHODS: Fifteen women with lipedema were recruited. Mean age of onset of lipedema was 31.5 +/- 15 years. Body mass index was 35.1 +/- 7.9 kg/m2, 13 women were obese. Lipedema was compared to 15 cases of primary lymphedema (women: 13, men: 2) of the lower limbs (unilateral: 13, bilateral: 2), with a mean age at onset of 28.7 +/- 12.6 years. Lymphoscintigraphy of the lower limbs with morphologic (visualization of inguinal lymph nodes) and kinetic (half-life, lymphatic speed of the colloid) studies was performed in all cases.
RESULTS: Absence of visualization of inguinal lymph nodes was observed in 14/15 cases of lymphedema and in 1/15 cases of lipedema (p<0.001). In the 13 cases of unilateral lymphedema, colloid half-life was higher in the pathologic limb than in the controlateral limb (230 +/- 92 vs 121 +/- 36 minutes, p<0.01) and lymphatic speed of the colloid was slower (6.91 +/- 0.86 vs 8.16 +/- 1.02 cm/min, p<0.001). The two patients with bilateral lymphedema had an increased half-life and decreased lymphatic speed of the colloid. Colloid half-life was significantly higher in lipedema than in controlateral limbs of lymphedema (154 +/- 23 vs 121 +/- 36 minutes, p<0.01) with no difference in lymphatic speed of the colloid. Colloid half-life was significantly higher in lymphedema than in lipedema (230 +/- 92 vs 154 +/- 23 minutes, p<0.01) and the lymphatic speed of the colloid was slower (6.91 +/- 0.86 vs 8.10 +/- 0.45 cm/min, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Lower limb lymphoscintigraphy showed lymphatic insufficiency in lipedema without morphologic abnormality as seen in lymphedema.

Microscopically, there are dermal and septal edema, adipocyte degeneration, and numerous mast cells, features held in common with lipedematous alopecia.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 60-year-old woman with a long history of bilateral leg masses with microscopic features of lipedema. In addition, elastic-fiber changes typical of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) were discovered within the subcutaneous septa in three separate specimens obtained from an affected extremity. The patient did not have other clinical findings of PXE, although there was a history of both hypertension and congestive heart failure.
CONCLUSION: This tumefactive presentation of lipedema has not been previously described. Regarding the elastic-tissue abnormalities, the patient could have either a subclinical form of PXE, perhaps predisposing to lipedema, or secondary elastic-tissue changes resulting from the massive edema.

12822730,"Lymphedema, lipedema, and the open wound: the role of compression therapy.","As the science of wound healing has evolved over the past two decades, so has awareness of the ""hidden epidemic"" of lymphedema. Substantial information has been accumulated regarding the pathophysiology and therapy of lymphedema. Until recently, the relationship between wound healing and the negative effects of associated peri-wound lymphedema has received little attention. Identifying wound-related lymph stasis and safe mobilization of the fluid are fundamentals that must be addressed for proper therapy. Experience gained from the successful treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema has proven very useful in the applications to wound-related lymphedema. The mobilization of lymph fluid from the peri-wound area with the use of reasoned compression is essential for proper therapy of the open wound, as are appropriate bandage selection and safeguards for bandage application.","['Macdonald JM', 'Sims N', 'Mayrovitz HN']",2003,83,3,Surg Clin North Am,"Macdonald JM, et al.

12578410,"Differential diagnosis, investigation, and current treatment of lower limb lymphedema.","HYPOTHESIS: The causes and management of lower limb lymphedema in the Western population are different from those in the developing world.
OBJECTIVE: To look at the differential diagnosis, methods of investigation, and available treatments for lower limb lymphedema in the West.
DATA SOURCE: A PubMed search was conducted for the years 1980-2002 with the keyword ""lymphedema."" English language and human subject abstracts only were analyzed, and only those articles dealing with lower limb lymphedema were further reviewed. Other articles were extracted from cross-referencing.
RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-five review articles pertaining to lymphedema were initially examined. This review summarizes the findings of relevant articles along with our own practice regarding the management of lymphedema.
CONCLUSIONS: The common differential diagnosis in Western patients with lower limb swelling is secondary lymphedema, venous disease, lipedema, and adverse reaction to ipsilateral limb surgery. Lymphedema can be confirmed by a lymphoscintigram, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound. The lymphatic anatomy is demonstrated with lymphoscintigraphy, which is particularly indicated if surgical intervention is being considered. The treatment of choice for lymphedema is multidisciplinary. In the first instance, combined physical therapy should be commenced (complete decongestive therapy), with surgery reserved for a small number of cases.","['Tiwari A', 'Cheng KS', 'Button M', 'Myint F', 'Hamilton G']",2003,138,2,Arch Surg,"Tiwari A, et al.

12363222,High resolution unenhanced computed tomography in patients with swollen legs.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) scan imaging in distinguishing lymphedema from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and lipodystrophy (lipedema) in patients with swollen legs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT scans of the lower limbs were performed in 55 patients with 76 swollen legs (44 lymphedemas, 12 DVT and 20 lipedemas). Thirty-four normal contralateral legs were also similarly evaluated. Primary lymphedema was verified by lymphography or lymphoscintigraphy, whereas secondary lymphedema was documented by a typical clinical history. DVT was established by ultrasound Doppler imaging. The diagnosis of lipedema was made with bilateral swollen legs where lymphoscintigraphy and Doppler examination were both unremarkable. Qualitative CT analysis was based on skin thickening, subcutaneous edema accumulation with a honeycombed pattern, and muscle compartment enlargement.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of CT scan for the diagnosis of lymphedema was 93 and 100%, respectively; for lipedema it was 95 and 100%, respectively; andfor DVT it was 91 and 99%, respectively. Skin thickening was found in 42 lymphedemas (95%), in 9 DVT (75%), and in 2 lipedemas (16%). Subcutaneous edema accumulation was demonstrated in 42 legs (95%) with lymphedema and in 5 (42%) with DVT but in none with lipedema. A honeycombed pattern was present only in lymphedema (18 legs or 41%); muscle enlargement was present in all patients with DVT, in no patient with lipedema, and in 4 (9%) with lymphedema.
CONCLUSION: Edema accumulation is readily demonstrated with plain CT scan and is not present in lipedema. Specific CT features of the subcutaneous fat and muscle compartments allow accurate differentiation between lymphedema and DVT.","['Monnin-Delhom ED', 'Gallix BP', 'Achard C', 'Bruel JM', 'Janbon C']",2002,35,3,Lymphology,"Monnin-Delhom ED, et al.

12162202,[Tests and imaging of the lymphatic system].,"Methods for lymphatic imaging are numerous and can be roughly classified as anatomic or functional studies. Direct or indirect lymphographies provide useful informations in case of lymphostasis. Contrast lymphangiography is the only anatomical method giving precise informations either on lymphatic ducts or lymph nodes. Nevertheless this invasive method is no more indicated in cases of limb edemas. Indirect lymphographies study the spontaneous lymphatic drainage of inert particles injected into the dermis. The blue dye test is the most simple and the oldest indirect lymphography used in the positive diagnosis of a lymphostasis. It has been replaced with the indirect radionuclide lymphography which give more reliable informations. Fluorescence microlymphoangiography is an atraumatic method which permits the visualization of skin lymphatics. Indirect lymphangiography with contrast medium give reliable informations on the status of the initial lymphatics and is the best imaging method to differentiate between lipedema and lymphedema. Indirect radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy is a safe, non invasive and physiological method for the assessment of the limb lymphatic system used for morphological studies and objective measurement of the peripheral lymphatic function necessary to assess the lymphatic variation under therapy (decongestive physiotherapy, surgery, drugs).","['Pecking AP', 'Desprez-Curely JP', 'Cluzan RV']",2002,23 Suppl 3,,Rev Med Interne,"Pecking AP, et al.

11783595,Microlymphatic aneurysms in patients with lipedema.,"""Lipedema,"" a special form of obesity syndrome, represents swelling of the legs due to an increase of subcutaneous adipose tissue. In 12 patients with lipedema of the legs and in 12 healthy subjects (controls), fluorescence microlymphography was performed to visualize the lymphatic capillary network at the dorsum of the foot, at the medial ankle, and at the thigh. Microaneurysm of a lymphatic capillary was defined as a segment exceeding at least twice the minimal individual diameter of the lymphatic vessel. In patients with lipedema, the propagation of the fluorescent dye into the superficial lymphatic network of the skin was not different from the control group (p > 0.05). In all 8 patients with lipedema of the thigh, microaneurysms were found at this site (7.9 +/- 4.7 aneurysms per depicted network) and in 10 of the 11 patients with excessive fat involvement of the lower leg, multiple microlymphatic aneurysms were found at the ankle region. Two obese patients showed lymphatic microaneurysms in the unaffected thigh and in only 4 patients were microaneurysms found at the foot. None of the healthy controls exhibited microlymphatic aneurysms at the foot and ankle, but in one control subject a single microaneurysm was detected in the thigh. Multiple microlymphatic aneurysms of lymphatic capillaries are a consistent finding in the affected skin regions of patients with lipedema.

In each group, the results were dismal as leg swelling worsened or was unchanged in greater than 90% whereas symptoms such as heaviness, fatigue, cramps (termed varicogenic symptomatology) were improved in less than 10%. These findings support that operations for varicose veins in the legs of patients with lymphedema, lipedema, or combinations of these disorders should be undertaken only if there is an absolute indication present (ascending phlebitis and/or bleeding). Otherwise, complete decongestive physiotherapy is still the best treatment approach for these groups of patients.","['Földi M', 'Idiazabal G']",2000,33,4,Lymphology,Földi M and Idiazabal G.

9664268,Analysis of lymphatic drainage in various forms of leg edema using two compartment lymphoscintigraphy.,"The anatomical and functional status of the epifascial and subfascial lymphatic compartments was analyzed using two compartment lymphoscintigraphy in five groups of patients (total 55) with various forms of edema of the lower extremities. Digital whole body scintigraphy enabled semiquantitative estimation of radiotracer transport with comparison of lymphatic drainage between those individuals without (normal) and those with leg edema by calculating the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical transported to regional lymph nodes. A visual assessment of the lymphatic drainage pathways of the legs was also performed. In patients with cyclic idiopathic edema, an accelerated rate of lymphatic transport was detected (high lymph volume overload or dynamic insufficiency). In those with venous (phlebo) edemas, high volume lymphatic overload (dynamic insufficiency) of the epifascial compartment was scintigraphically detected by increased tracer uptake in regional nodes. In patients with deep femoral venous occlusion (post-thrombotic syndrome). subfascial lymphatic transport was uniformly markedly reduced (safety valve lymphatic insufficiency). On the other hand, in the epifascial compartment, lymph transport was accelerated. In those patients with recurrent or extensive skin ulceration, lymph transport was reduced. Patients with lipedema (obesity) scintigraphically showed no alteration in lymphatic transport. This study demonstrates that lymphatic drainage is notably affected (except in obesity termed lipedema) in various edemas of the leg. Lymphatic drainage varied depending on the specific compartment and the pathophysiologic mechanism accounting for the edema. Two compartment lymphoscintigraphy is a valuable diagnostic tool for accurate assessment of leg edema of known and unknown origin.","['Bräutigam P', 'Földi E', 'Schaiper I', 'Krause T', 'Vanscheidt W', 'Moser E']",1998,31,2,Lymphology,"Bräutigam P, et al.

9412843,MRI and ultrasonographic findings in the investigation of lymphedema and lipedema.,"METHODS: Twenty-four healthy subjects and 16 patients with lymphedema and lipedema were studied with MRI and ultratomography.
RESULTS: In chronic lymphedema, ultrasonography revealed a statistically significant increase of the subcutaneous fat without difference in skin thickness as compared to the healthy subjects. MRI revealed in lymphedema a statistically significant increase of skin thickness + subcutaneous tissue + muscular mass (p = 0.048); in lipedema, a statistically significant increase of skin thickness and subcutaneous tissue (p < 0.0001) as compared to the healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI offers strong qualitative and quantitative parameters in the diagnosis of lymphedema and lipolymphedema, while ultrasonography is expected to improve its diagnostic efficiency with the aid of high frequency echo with more sophisticated resolution apparatus.

Studies with 2-compartment lymphoscintigraphy].,"Two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy was developed to examine the sub- and epifascial lymphatics of the leg. Digital images were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively by calculating the uptake of activity within the lymph nodes. The data from patient groups with four different types of leg edema were compared with those of the control group to prove the involvement of the lymphatics in the non-lymphatic edema. The cyclic idiopathic edema demonstrated an accelerated transport of the lymph consistent with a high volume insufficiency. In phlebedema the high volume insufficiency was epifascially so distinct, that it could be detected scintigraphically. In post thrombotic syndrome the transport of the lymph was reduced dramatically corresponding to a safety valve insufficiency. Epifascially however, an accelerated lymph flow was observed due to compensatory mechanisms. The lipedema did not show any scintigraphic abnormalities. These results show that two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy can detect alterations in lymphatic function secondary to non-lymphogenic leg edema. The lymphatic function is changed according to the underlying pathophysiology which may be facilitate the differential diagnosis of such a leg edema.","['Bräutigam P', 'Vanscheidt W', 'Földi E', 'Krause T', 'Moser E']",1997,48,8,Hautarzt,"Bräutigam P, et al.

Although generally considered to be the result of an abnormal deposition of subcutaneous fat with associated oedema, the precise mechanisms responsible for oedema formation have yet to be fully established. In order to evaluate the possible role of lymphatic or venous dysfunction in the pathogenesis of lipoedema, 10 patients were investigated by photoplethysmography (venous function) and quantitative lymphoscintigraphy (lymphatic function). The results were compared with those from patients with primary lymphoedema and those from healthy volunteers. The results demonstrated minor abnormalities of venous function in only two patients. One patient had moderately impaired lymphatic function in both legs and seven patients had a marginal degree of impairment in one or both legs. However, in none of these cases did the impairment attain the low levels seen in true lymphoedema.

METHOD: From October 1990 to July 1992, 245 patients presented to the Cleveland Clinic Florida with leg edema. All patients were counseled about the benefits of twenty-minute, three-times-a-day raised-leg exercises. Fifty seven (57) of the 245 patients were not compliant with this regimen (nonexercise group). Although not true controls, they formed a comparison group for those who performed the exercise regimen. The exercise group was composed of 188 patients with a mean age of 73 +/- 6.8 years, 25 (13%) men and 163 (87%) women; the nonexercise group was composed of 57 patients with a mean age of 71.9 +/- 4.3, 19 (33%) men and 38 (67%) women. Workup for leg edema included: comprehensive history, clinical examination including prostate or pelvic examination, complete blood count, chemistry profile, thyroid profile, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and, when indicated, pelvic or leg ultrasound and pelvic computed tomographic scan. The circumference of the leg with the maximum amount of edema was measured initially and on the fourth week.
RESULTS: In this study, the common causes of leg edema in the elderly population were venous stasis (63.2%), drug induced (13.8%), and heart failure (15.1%). Postphlebitic syndrome, cirrhosis, lymphedema, lipedema, prostate carcinoma (CA), and ovarian mass were the less frequent findings.

8230563,"Noninvasive evaluation of the lymphatic system with lymphoscintigraphy: a prospective, semiquantitative analysis in 386 extremities.","PURPOSE: Lymphoscintigraphy has emerged as the diagnostic test of choice in patients with suspected lymphedema. To assess the lymphatic circulation of 386 extremities in 188 patients, we prospectively recorded a semiquantitative index of lymphatic transport in addition to visual evaluation of lymphoscintigraphy image patterns.
METHODS: Sixty-one male and 127 female patients were studied (mean age 48 years, range 13 to 87 years). Twenty had upper extremity swelling, and 168 had lower extremity swelling. The disease was bilateral in 60 patients. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed by injecting a mean of 503 microCi of technetium 99m-antimony trisulfide colloid subcutaneously into the second interdigital space of the extremity. Time for transport to regional lymph nodes, appearance of lymph vessels and nodes and distribution pattern were scored. These scores were compiled into a modified Kleinhans transport index (TI). To assess the venous circulation, 155 patients underwent evaluation of the venous system by impedance plethysmography, ultrasonography, or contrast venography.
RESULTS: The mean TI (+/- SEM) in 79 asymptomatic extremities was 2.6 +/- 0.5, with 66 (83.5%) demonstrating normal lymphoscintigraphy pattern (TI < 5). Patients with clinical diagnosis of lymphedema (n = 124) had a mean TI of 23.8 +/- 1.5; 81.5% of these were greater than 5. Fifty-six patients (30%) had primary and 68 (36%) had secondary lymphedema. (TI of 26 +/- 3.5 and 22.1 +/- 1.9, respectively, p = NS). Patients without any lymphatic transport (TI of 45) were more likely to have cellulitis in their history (p < 0.05).

Sixty-four patients (34%) had swelling without lymphedema (venous edema, cardiac edema, lipedema, etc.; TI of 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001). Of the 41 patients with abnormal venous studies, 18 (44%) had an elevated TI.
CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative evaluation of the lymphatic transport with lymphoscintigraphy reliably depicts abnormalities in the lymphatic circulation. Lymphoscintigraphy excluded lymphedema as a cause of leg swelling in one third of our patients.","['Cambria RA', 'Gloviczki P', 'Naessens JM', 'Wahner HW']",1993,18,5,J Vasc Surg,"Cambria RA, et al.

8379250,[Value of nuclear magnetic resonance tomography in leg edema of unknown origin. Preliminary report].,"Edemas of the leg sometimes pose problems for diagnosis. Invasive procedures like lymphography or phlebography are either difficult to perform or might endanger the lymphatics. The value of magnetic resonance imaging was assessed in 20 patients with lymphedema, lipedema and phlebedema. Images of patients with lipedema showed homogenous enlarged subcutaneous tissue. In lymphedema a honeycomb pattern in the subcutaneous tissue was observed; in phlebedema there was an increase of fluid within the muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in differentiating lymphedema, lipedema or phlebedema.","['Werner GT', 'Rodiek SO']",1993,17,1,Z Lymphol,Werner GT and Rodiek SO.

8473066,Microlymphatics of human skin.,"Microlymphatics of human skin form two superposed networks. The superficial one located at the level of dermal papillae may be visualized by fluorescence microlymphography. Microlymphatics fill from a subepidermal depot of minute amounts of FITC-dextran 150,000. In primary lymphedema with late onset the depicted network with vessels of normal size is significantly larger than in healthy controls, whereas in congenital lymphedema (Milroy's disease) microlymphatics are aplastic or ectatic (diameter > 90 microns). Lymphatic microangiopathy with obliterations of microvessels develops in chronic venous insufficiency, in lipedema (preliminary results) and after recurrent erysipelata. In healthy controls microlymphatics are permeable to FITC-dextran 40,000 and impermeable to the larger molecule 150,000. Preserved fragments of the network in chronic venous insufficiency exhibit increased permeability to FITC-dextran 150,000. After visualization of the vessels by the fluorescent dye microlymphatic pressure may be measured by the servo-nulling technique. First results indicate that microlymphatic hypertension contributes to edema formation in patients with primary lymphedema.",['Bollinger A'],1993,12,1,Int J Microcirc Clin Exp,Bollinger A.

1609085,Swollen lower extremity: role of MR imaging.,"The authors assessed the use of magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating lymphedema, phlebedema, and lipedema of the lower limb. They examined 14 patients: five with lipedema, five with lymphedema, and four with phlebedema. T1- and T2-weighted transaxial sequences were performed before administration of gadolinium tetraazacyclododecane-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences were performed after administration of Gd-DOTA in each patient. Images of patients with lipedema showed homogeneously enlarged subcutaneous layers, with no increase in signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging or after Gd-DOTA administration. Patients with phlebedema had areas containing increased amounts of fluid within muscle and subcutaneous fat. In lymphedema, a honeycomb pattern above the fascia between muscle and subcutis was observed, with a marked increase in signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging. After Gd-DOTA administration, there was only a slight increase in signal intensity in the subcutis in lymphedema and phlebedema and a moderate increase in signal intensity in muscle in phlebedema.","['Duewell S', 'Hagspiel KD', 'Zuber J', 'von Schulthess GK', 'Bollinger A', 'Fuchs WA']",1992,184,1,Radiology,"Duewell S, et al.

Venous obstruction results in an increase in the cross sectional area of the muscle compartment. The subcutaneous fat layer is normally homogeneous; in obesity or lipoedema it is increased but remains homogeneous. In lymphoedema fluid collects in the interstitial spaces which become very prominent on CT images. In chronic lymphoedema a honeycomb pattern is seen as a result of increase in the interstitial tissue due to fibrosis. Popliteal cyst extensions result in fluid collections between muscle planes. Haematomas have higher attenuation, and are intramuscular. The findings in 64 patients and 10 controls are presented and the literature is reviewed.",['Vaughan BF'],1990,41,1,Clin Radiol,Vaughan BF.

2678371,[Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of swollen leg].,"Leg swelling is often of edematous nature. The most important differential diagnosis lies in the distinction between venous or lymphatic forms of edema. An increased vascular permeability and alterations in blood composition have also to be taken into account. A particular entity is the lipedema. Next to an accurate history, specific inspection and palpatory criteria permit to distinguish the various forms. Tests for venous function, laboratory and technologically investigative techniques increase diagnostic accuracy.

The back of the foot is usually free of swelling. Pathogenetically it is a disturbance of the distribution pattern of subcutaneous fat tissue. Epidemiologically, the subjects affected are women, starting from puberty. Weight reduction programs do not influence the real deformations. If this abnormal fat tissue is infiltrated by angiological diseases, these manifest themselves in modified form. In particular, all the symptoms are more painful. In arterial ischemic syndromes that taut skin is susceptible to necrosis at atypical locations. For reconstruction of trunk arteries it is advisable to bypass larger bulges for better wound nealing. Venous strips should be peeled out away from fat pads and venous-bridges very carefully to protect the tissue. Acute and chronic phlebothrombosis lead to unusual and asymmetrical forms of swelling. The venous ulcer lies directly beneath a fat-muff in the gaiter region. Since they are hard to compress, free skin transplants should be considered early in the course of development.
