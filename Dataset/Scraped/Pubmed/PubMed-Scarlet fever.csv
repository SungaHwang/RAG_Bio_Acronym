37902815,Early Warning and Prediction of Scarlet Fever in China Using the Baidu Search Index and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average With Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) Model: Time Series Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Internet-derived data and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ARIMA with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) models are extensively used for infectious disease surveillance. However, the effectiveness of the Baidu search index (BSI) in predicting the incidence of scarlet fever remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate whether a low-cost BSI monitoring system could potentially function as a valuable complement to traditional scarlet fever surveillance in China.
METHODS: ARIMA and ARIMAX models were developed to predict the incidence of scarlet fever in China using data from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China between January 2011 and August 2022. The procedures included establishing a keyword database, keyword selection and filtering through Spearman rank correlation and cross-correlation analyses, construction of the scarlet fever comprehensive search index (CSI), modeling with the training sets, predicting with the testing sets, and comparing the prediction performances.
RESULTS: The average monthly incidence of scarlet fever was 4462.17 (SD 3011.75) cases, and annual incidence exhibited an upward trend until 2019. The keyword database contained 52 keywords, but only 6 highly relevant ones were selected for modeling. A high Spearman rank correlation was observed between the scarlet fever reported cases and the scarlet fever CSI (r
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the BSI can be used for the early warning and prediction of scarlet fever, serving as a valuable supplement to traditional surveillance systems.","['Luo T', 'Zhou J', 'Yang J', 'Xie Y', 'Wei Y', 'Mai H', 'Lu D', 'Yang Y', 'Cui P', 'Ye L', 'Liang H', 'Huang J']",2023,25,,J Med Internet Res,"Luo T, et al.

37839888,Past Endemic Izumi Fever or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Infection Which Sporadically Reappears.,"Izumi fever (IF), also known as Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), is caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and it has clinical features resembling those of Kawasaki disease (KD). As both diseases are rare in adolescents and young adults, it is challenging to recognize them, thus often leading to a delayed diagnosis. We herein present two cases of IF or FESLF (IF/FESLF). The first case was misdiagnosed as KD, which led to a diagnostic delay. The second case was recognized earlier owing to our experience with the first case. Although cultures were negative in both cases, presumably due to the prior use of antimicrobial agents, our clinical suspicion and a paired serological assay for anti-Yersinia pseudotuberculosis antibodies finally led to a successful diagnosis.","['Suzuki S', 'Suzuki K', 'Furukawa T', 'Nakajima M', 'Sakai H']",2023,,,Intern Med,"Suzuki S, et al.

37753029,Efficacy of Antidopaminergic Pharmacotherapy in Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS): A Case Report.,"PANDAS, or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, is a neuropsychiatric disease seen in children that presents with prevailing symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tic disorder, or both. These symptoms appear suddenly following a streptococcal infection, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. The antibodies formed to eradicate the streptococcal infection have been shown to alter central dopamine signaling. In spite of being acknowledged in the medical community for the last two to three decades, PANDAS is a disorder that goes unnoticed by many healthcare professionals. Unfortunately, even with correct diagnosis and utilization of commonly prescribed pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, medical management can often be ineffective at treating the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Here, we describe a case of a 15-year-old male who presented to the primary care office with complaints of episodic behavioral changes that would occur multiple times daily. The general symptoms were centered around body dysmorphia where the patient became obsessed with fixed portions of food and became highly focused on only specific food types. The symptoms would exacerbate and progress with a dire need to burn calories, leading the patient to damage carpeted areas in the home due to regular and fanatical pacing. The patient underwent trials with serotonergic pharmacotherapy with little to no relief of the psychiatric symptoms. After discussion with his primary care physician, the patient underwent trial management with antidopaminergic therapy that resulted in significant neurological and psychiatric improvement. The use of antidopaminergic pharmacotherapy to target the induction of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors was efficacious in this patient; however, it warrants additional research with a larger sample to determine its effectiveness in the treatment of this psychiatric condition.","['Hefelfinger D', 'Kaufman H', 'Gilman A', 'Gebhart R']",2023,15,8,Cureus,"Hefelfinger D, et al.

37692760,"Patterns in the Incidence of Scarlet Fever Among Children Aged 0-9 Years - China, 2010-2019.","INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the patterns of scarlet fever among Chinese children aged 0-9 years from 2010 to 2019. The objective is to provide insights that may inform potential adjustments to China's current prevention and control tactics for this illness.
METHODS: The present study utilized data on the occurrence of scarlet fever in children from 2010 to 2019, sourced from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System database, managed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This research implemented SAS9.4 software to construct trajectory models representing the temporal incidence of scarlet fever, accounting for key variables such as sex, geographic region, urban versus rural dwellings, and various age brackets.
RESULTS: From 2010 to 2019, a total of 554,695 scarlet fever cases were reported among children aged 0-9 years in the 31 mainland Chinese provincial-level administrative divisions, signifying a rate of 35.36 per 100,000 individuals. An inconsistent yet generally rising trend was observed, evidenced by a 3.17-fold increase in reported cases and a 3.02-fold escalation in incidence rate over this period. Examination of these trends revealed three distinctive developmental patterns for both males and females, with the lowest prevalence in the first trajectory and the highest in the third. The incidence was consistently higher among males than females in all trajectories. The urban and northern regions displayed equal or greater trajectory rates than their rural and southern counterparts, respectively. In terms of age groups, the lowest incidence was observed in the 0-1-year age group, while the highest was recorded in the 4-5 and 6-7-year age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2010 and 2019, there was a marked increase in the incidence of scarlet fever among children in China. The disease predominantly impacts urban-dwelling children, ranging from 4 to 7 years old, in the northern regions of the country. The incidence is reported to be higher among boys compared to girls.","['Cui J', 'Zhang Y', 'Ge H', 'Cao Y', 'Su X']",2023,5,34,China CDC Wkly,"Cui J, et al.

His extensive observations of the geography and peoples of these Isles were recorded in his books, ""On the Description of the Western Islands of Scotland Circa 1695"" and ""A Late Voyage to St Kilda"". In these books and subsequent papers there were some noteworthy observations on the occurrence (and as he says non-occurrence) of ""epidemical"" diseases and conditions afflicting the peoples of The Isle of Skye and the Western Isles of Scotland in this period, and these are discussed in this review. Martin also gives details of a wide variety of remedies that were observed or reported by inhabitants around that time. Some of these remedies are interesting for their relevance to the period but others are of doubtful merit. These are reviewed here more for their significance in the understanding of the diseases and conditions of humans and even in some cases animals at that time.

Reducing the number of infectious diseases was an essential task of the State Administration of Health. It required new legislation and various steps directed at reducing infectious diseases. Serious infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid, dysentery, smallpox, and malaria, were among the most significant health problems in Czechoslovakia. In 1920, Act No. 412 Coll. regarding compulsory smallpox vaccination was issued, as well as government Regulation No. 298, which describes vaccination obligations and stipulated proper isolation of patients with infectious diseases. Other steps that led to improvements included establishing the National Institute of Health and mobile disinfectant units. Conclusion: The systematic development of new legislation contributed to the new Republic's proficiency at the task and the gradual reduction in the number of infectious diseases.","['Tóth A', 'Kratochvílová I', 'Novotný L', 'Drábek J', 'Hellerová V', 'Červený M', 'Tóthová V']",2023,21,1,Acta Med Hist Adriat,"Tóth A, et al.

37601133,Epidemiological characteristics of common respiratory infectious diseases in children before and during the COVID-19 epidemic.,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), public's awareness of infection prevention and control has increased overall, and various prevention and control measures have been adopted. These measures may also have a certain impact on the occurrence of other infectious diseases. Therefore, we collected information on children with several respiratory infectious diseases in Jinan Children's Hospital in China from 2016 to 2022 and analyzed their changes.
METHOD: We collected data on age, sex and number of cases of pertussis, measles, scarlet fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, mumps and influenza, which were diagnosed by clinical and laboratory criteria, from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2022 in Jinan Children's Hospital in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. Data on the number of people affected by these diseases in China from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were compared. Then, we processed the data by using WPS Excel 2019 and SPSS.
RESULTS: A total of 12,225 cases were included in this study in Jinan Children's Hospital, which consisted of 3,688 cases of pertussis (2,200 cases before COVID-19 and 1,488 during COVID-19), 680 cases of measles (650 cases before COVID-19 and 30 during COVID-19), 4,688 cases of scarlet fever (4,001 cases before COVID-19 and 687 during COVID-19), 114 cases of tuberculosis (86 cases before COVID-19 and 28 during COVID-19), 449 cases of mumps (340 cases before COVID-19 and 109 during COVID-19) and 2,606 cases of influenza (1,051 cases before COVID-19 and 1,555 during COVID-19). The numbers of children in the hospital with pertussis, measles, scarlet fever, mumps and influenza decreased substantially during COVID-19 in 2020-2022 compared with numbers in 2016-2019, while numbers of patients in China with all six respiratory infectious diseases, including pulmonary tuberculosis, declined during the pandemic. A rebound of pertussis, scarlet fever and influenza was observed in 2021 and 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that viral pathogens such as those causing measles, mumps and influenza all decreased during the pandemic, after which influenza rebounded. Infection diseases caused by bacteria such as scarlet fever and pertussis also decreased during COVID-19, and then a rebound occurred. However, tuberculosis stayed relatively constant.","['Wang B', 'Gai X', 'Han Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun J', 'Liu M', 'Yu H', 'Peng Z', 'Wei X', 'Chang Y', 'Ma X', 'Gai Z']",2023,11,,Front Pediatr,"Wang B, et al.

37599641,Managing the deteriorating child with suspected group A Streptococcus infection.,"Group A Streptococcus bacteria can cause various pyogenic infections such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis and pneumonia. Most group A Streptococcus infections in children are mild and respond positively to treatment with antibiotics. However, some children develop severe infection accompanied by complications such as sepsis and will require urgent treatment, which may include non-invasive or invasive ventilation and the administration of fluids and vasoactive agents. In some instances, for example if there are no beds available in the paediatric intensive care unit, these interventions may be undertaken in a ward setting. This article gives an overview of group A Streptococcus infection, including two rare but severe complications, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotising fasciitis. It uses a fictionalised case study to examine the management of the deteriorating child with suspected group A Streptococcus infection, including respiratory support, haemodynamic support and symptom management.","['Kempsell-Smith M', 'Fitzsimons C']",2023,,,Nurs Child Young People,Kempsell-Smith M and Fitzsimons C.

As a complication of scarlet fever, interstitial lesions attracted attention in 1859 and came to be defined as acute interstitial nephritis in 1898. The chronic form of interstitial nephritis was traditionally attributed to pyelonephritis until the advent of kidney biopsy in the 1950s, when interstitial lesions were recognized as an independent primary cause of chronic kidney disease from studies of analgesic nephropathy and vesico-ureteral reflux. The term tubulointerstitial nephritis was introduced in 1963 and promoted to denote the role of the tubules in the pathogenesis and the clinical presentation of interstitial nephritis as tubular dysfunction. Studies since then have established that fibrotic tubulointerstitial nephritis lesions correlate best with the severity and progression of kidney diseases independent of their etiology.",['Eknoyan G'],2023,21,Suppl 2,Exp Clin Transplant,"Eknoyan G.

37489384,Identifying Health-Related Conditions Associated with Tinnitus in Young Adults.,"OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the epidemic of tinnitus in college-aged young adults. Our first objective was to identify health conditions associated with tinnitus in young adults. The second objective was to evaluate the predictive utility of some known risk factors.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for tinnitus.
SETTING: A questionnaire was distributed, reaching out to a large college-aged population. A total of 2258 young adults aged 18-30 years were recruited from April 2021 to February 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: A questionnaire was administered to investigate the epidemiology of tinnitus in a population of college-aged young adults.
RESULTS: About 17.7% of young adults reported bothersome tinnitus perception lasting for ≥5 min in the last 12 months. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for ≥1 year) and acute tinnitus (bothersome tinnitus for <1 year) was 10.6% and 7.1%, respectively. About 19% of the study sample reported at least one health condition. Individuals reporting head injury, hypertension, heart disease, scarlet fever, and malaria showed significantly higher odds of reporting chronic tinnitus. Meningitis and self-reported hearing loss showed significant associations with bothersome tinnitus. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus was significantly higher in males reporting high noise exposure, a positive history of reoccurring ear infections, European ethnic background, and a positive health history. Risk modeling showed that noise exposure was the most important risk factor for chronic tinnitus, followed by sex, reoccurring ear infections, and a history of any health condition. A positive history of COVID-19 and self-reported severity showed no association with tinnitus. Individuals reporting reoccurring ear infections showed a significantly higher prevalence of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: While young adults with health conditions are at a higher risk of reporting tinnitus, the predictive utility of a positive health history remains relatively low, possibly due to weak associations between health conditions and tinnitus. Noise, male sex, reoccurring ear infections, European ethnicity, and a positive health history revealed higher odds of reporting chronic tinnitus than their counterparts. These risk factors collectively explained about 16% variability in chronic tinnitus, which highlights the need for identifying other risk factors for chronic tinnitus in young adults.","['Bhatt IS', 'Washnik NJ', 'Kingsbury S', 'Deshpande AK', 'Kingsbury H', 'Bhagavan SG', 'Michel K', 'Dias R', 'Torkamani A']",2023,13,4,Audiol Res,"Bhatt IS, et al.

37468965,Invasive Group A streptococcal infections: are we facing a new outbreak? A case series with the experience of a single tertiary center.,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric age, Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, from mild localized infections to life-threatening invasive diseases. In December 2022, the World Health Organization reported an increased incidence of scarlet fever and invasive GAS infections (iGAS) cases in Europe and the United States. In line with these observations, surveillance has been strengthened in our Region, allowing the identification of certified or highly suspected forms of iGAS.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report here 4 emblematic cases of iGAS admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the short time span from mid-February to mid-March 2023. Particularly, we describe a case of pleuropneumonia (4 year old boy) and a case of respiratory failure (2 year old boy), who necessitated Non-Invasive Ventilation support, a case of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (6 year old girl), presenting with multi-organ failure, who needed Invasive Ventilation, and a case of meningitis (5 year old girl). All these patients needed intensive care support.
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate differential diagnosis and early treatment both could help to reduce the transmission of GAS and consequently the risk of severe iGAS. These cases confirmed the need for close monitoring and appropriate notification, in order to verify their actual increased incidence.","['Garancini N', 'Ricci G', 'Ghezzi M', 'Tommasi P', 'Zunica F', 'Mandelli A', 'Zoia E', ""D'Auria E"", 'Zuccotti GV']",2023,49,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Garancini N, et al.

37439477,Intracranial invasive group A streptococcus: a neurosurgical emergency in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infections are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement is rare, with iGAS accounting for only 0.2%-1% of all childhood bacterial meningitis. In 2022, a significant increase in scarlet fever and iGAS was reported globally with a displacement of serotype, causing a predominance of the emm1.0 subtype. Here, the authors report on iGAS-related suppurative intracranial complications requiring neurosurgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive cases of confirmed GAS in pediatric neurosurgical patients.
RESULTS: Five children with a median age of 9 years were treated for intracranial complications of GAS infection over a 2-month period between November 2022 and December 2022. All patients had preceding illnesses, including chicken pox and upper respiratory tract infections. Infections included subdural empyema with associated encephalitis (n = 2), extradural empyema (n = 1), intracranial abscess (n = 1), and diffuse global meningoencephalitis (n = 1). Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured from 4 children, and 2 were of the emm1.0 subtype. Antimicrobial therapy in all patients included a third-generation cephalosporin but varied in adjunctive therapy, often including a toxin synthesis inhibitor antibiotic such as clindamycin. Neurological outcomes varied; 3 patients returned to near neurological baseline, 1 had significant residual neurological deficits, and 1 patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the worldwide increased incidence, intracranial complications remain rarely reported resulting in a lack of awareness of iGAS-related intracranial disease. Awareness of intracranial complications of iGAS and prompt referral to a pediatric neurology/neurosurgical center is crucial to optimize neurological outcomes.","['Hutton D', 'Kameda-Smith M', 'Afshari FT', 'Elawadly A', 'Hogg F', 'Mehta S', 'Samarasekara J', 'Aquilina K', 'Jeelani NUO', 'Tahir MZ', 'Thompson D', 'Tisdall MM', 'Silva AHD', 'Hatcher J', 'James G']",2023,32,4,J Neurosurg Pediatr,"Hutton D, et al.

37394399,Streptococcus pyogenes infections in Spanish children before and after the COVID pandemic. Coming back to the previous incidence.,"INTRODUCTION: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes mild diseases, and unfrequently invasive infections (iGAS). Following the December 2022 alert from the United Kingdom regarding the unusual increase in GAS and iGAS infections, we analyzed the incidence of GAS infections in 2018-2022 in our hospital.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients seen in a pediatric emergency department (ED) diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis and scarlet fever and patients admitted for iGAS during last 5 years.
RESULTS: The incidence of GAS infections was 6.43 and 12.38/1000 ED visits in 2018 and 2019, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic the figures were 5.33 and 2.14/1000 ED visits in 2020 and 2021, respectively, and increased to 10.2/1000 ED visits in 2022. The differences observed were not statistically significant (p=0.352).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, as in other countries, GAS infections decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and mild and severe cases increased considerably in 2022, but did not reach similar levels to those detected in other countries.","['de Ceano-Vivas M', 'Molina Gutiérrez MÁ', 'Mellado-Sola I', 'García Sánchez P', 'Grandioso D', 'Calvo C', 'Collaborating Group']",2023,,,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),"de Ceano-Vivas M, et al.

37383247,Epidemiological Impact of the Pediatric Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) Program on Group A Streptococcus (GAS) Infection in England.,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is known to predispose to secondary bacterial infections including invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease. The universal pediatric live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) program introduced in England from the 2013/2014 influenza season was implemented incrementally, introducing cohorts of children annually to 2-16 years of coverage. Additionally, from the beginning of the program, discrete pilot areas offered LAIV vaccination to all primary school-age children, allowing for a unique comparison of infection rates between pilot and nonpilot areas during the program rollout.
METHODS: Cumulative incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of GAS infections (all), scarlet fever (SF), and iGAS infection within each season by age group were compared for pilot and nonpilot areas using Poisson regression. The overall effect of the pilot program in the pre- (2010/2011-2012/2013 seasons) and postintroduction (2013/2014-2016/2017 seasons) periods was assessed using negative binomial regression by comparing changes in incidence between pilot/nonpilot areas (ratio of IRR [rIRR]).
RESULTS: Reductions in IRRs of GAS and SF were observed within most post-LAIV program seasons, among the age groups 2-4 and 5-10 years. Significant reductions were seen among 5-10 years (rIRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45-0.71; 
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vaccination with LAIV may be associated with a reduced risk of GAS infection and support attaining high uptake of childhood influenza vaccination.","['Sinnathamby MA', 'Warburton F', 'Guy R', 'Andrews N', 'Lamagni T', 'Watson C', 'Bernal JL']",2023,10,6,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Sinnathamby MA, et al.

To counteract the pandemic, various measures and restrictions such as lockdowns, closures, social distancing, hygiene, and protective measures such as wearing face masks have been enforced. Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures also had effects on other transmittable diseases. This study therefore determined the impact on case numbers and interest for other infectious diseases as well.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: Anonymized data on reported case numbers from the German Robert Koch Institute and data from Google Trends about the search interest have been used in this study to track courses of infectious diseases before and during the coronavirus pandemic in Germany.
RESULTS: The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the case numbers of influenza, whooping cough, measles, mumps, scarlet fever and chicken pox decreased in the pandemic years, most probably due to anti-pandemic measures in Germany. Additionally, the Google Trends analysis demonstrated public awareness, documented by a corresponding search interest, for the new topic COVID-19 and for other infectious diseases.
CONCLUSION: Online available data provided valuable sources for research purposes in infodemiology or infoveillance.","['Kaatz M', 'Springer S', 'Zieger M']",2022,,,Z Gesundh Wiss,"Kaatz M, et al.

Tuberculosis (TB) and scarlet fever (SF) serve as representatives of chronic and acute respiratory infectious diseases, respectively. In China's Guizhou province, an area with a high prevalence of TB and SF, approximately 40,000 TB cases and hundreds of SF cases are reported annually. To assess the impact of COVID-19 prevention and control on TB and SF in Guizhou, the exponential smoothing method was employed to establish a prediction model for analyzing the influence of COVID-19 prevention and control on the number of TB and SF cases. Additionally, spatial aggregation analysis was utilized to describe spatial changes in TB and SF before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: We analyzed data from a national network of ambulatory pediatricians between 2018 and 2022. Clinicians evaluating children ≤15 years old for tonsillopharyngitis, perianal infections, paronychia/blistering dactylitis, and scarlet fever were invited to perform a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for GAS. Monthly incidence of noninvasive GAS infections per 10,000 visits was modeled using time series analysis, considering two breakpoints: March 2020 (first national lockdown) and March 2022 (end of mandatory mask-wearing in schools).
RESULTS: Over the study period, 125 pediatricians recorded 271,084 infectious episodes. GAS-related illnesses represented 4.3% of all infections. In March 2020, the incidence of GAS diseases decreased by 84.5% (P <0.001), with no significant trend until March 2022. After March 2022, the incidence significantly increased (+23.8% per month, P <0.001), with similar patterns across all monitored GAS-related diseases.
CONCLUSION: By using routine clinical data and RADTs, we have monitored changes in the incidence of noninvasive GAS infections in ambulatory pediatrics. COVID-19 mitigation measures have had a major impact on the epidemiology of noninvasive GAS infections, but their relaxation was followed by a surge above baseline levels.","['Cohen JF', 'Rybak A', 'Werner A', 'Kochert F', 'Cahn-Sellem F', 'Gelbert N', 'Vié Le Sage F', 'Batard C', 'Béchet S', 'Corbaux H', 'Frandji B', 'Levy C', 'Cohen R']",2023,134,,Int J Infect Dis,"Cohen JF, et al.

37288267,The rise and fall of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: a mini review.,"INTRODUCTION: The incidences of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which were leading causes of death in children in the 1920s, have decreased substantially. Considering the recent resurgence of scarlet fever and increased incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis in children, an investigation of the current status of ARF and RHD may be worthwhile.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the prevalence trends, pathogenic factors, and prevention strategies for ARF and RHD in children.
METHODS: A selective search of literature published between January 1920 and February 2023 was done in PubMed, using the terms ""acute rheumatic fever"", ""rheumatic heart disease"", ""group A 
RESULTS: Overcrowded homes and inadequate sanitation led to recurrent group A streptococcal infection, and the causal relationship between group A streptococcal infection and ARF/RHD was well established. Streptococcal infectious diseases, such as group A streptococcal pharyngeal tonsillitis, SF, impetigo, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, were associated with the occurrence of ARF and RHD. ARF and RHD were still prevalent in young people of developing countries and economically poor populations of high-income countries. Universal disease registration systems were critical to locating disease outbreaks, tracking disease transmission, and identifying high-risk populations. Four-level prevention strategies were effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of ARF and RHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Registry and preventive measures for ARF and RHD should be strengthened in areas of dense population; poor sanitation; resurgence of SF; and high incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis, impetigo, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.","['Liang Y', 'Yu D', 'Lu Q', 'Zheng Y', 'Yang Y']",2023,10,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Liang Y, et al.

37280569,"The indirect impacts of nonpharmacological COVID-19 control measures on other infectious diseases in Yinchuan, Northwest China: a time series study.","BACKGROUND: Various nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 continue to have an impact on socioeconomic and population behaviour patterns. However, the effect of NPIs on notifiable infectious diseases remains inconclusive due to the variability of the disease spectrum, high-incidence endemic diseases and environmental factors across different geographical regions. Thus, it is of public health interest to explore the influence of NPIs on notifiable infectious diseases in Yinchuan, Northwest China.
METHODS: Based on data on notifiable infectious diseases (NIDs), air pollutants, meteorological data, and the number of health institutional personnel in Yinchuan, we first fitted dynamic regression time series models to the incidence of NIDs from 2013 to 2019 and then estimated the incidence for 2020. Then, we compared the projected time series data with the observed incidence of NIDs in 2020. We calculated the relative reduction in NIDs at different emergency response levels in 2020 to identify the impacts of NIPs on NIDs in Yinchuan.
RESULTS: A total of 15,711 cases of NIDs were reported in Yinchuan in 2020, which was 42.59% lower than the average annual number of cases from 2013 to 2019. Natural focal diseases and vector-borne infectious diseases showed an increasing trend, as the observed incidence in 2020 was 46.86% higher than the estimated cases. The observed number of cases changed in respiratory infectious diseases, intestinal infectious diseases and sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases were 65.27%, 58.45% and 35.01% higher than the expected number, respectively. The NIDs with the highest reductions in each subgroup were hand, foot, and mouth disease (5854 cases), infectious diarrhoea (2157 cases) and scarlet fever (832 cases), respectively. In addition, it was also found that the expected relative reduction in NIDs in 2020 showed a decline across different emergency response levels, as the relative reduction dropped from 65.65% (95% CI: -65.86%, 80.84%) during the level 1 response to 52.72% (95% CI: 20.84%, 66.30%) during the level 3 response.
CONCLUSIONS: The widespread implementation of NPIs in 2020 may have had significant inhibitory effects on the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, intestinal infectious diseases and sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases. The relative reduction in NIDs during different emergency response levels in 2020 showed a declining trend as the response level changed from level 1 to level 3. These results can serve as essential guidance for policy-makers and stakeholders to take specific actions to control infectious diseases and protect vulnerable populations in the future.","['Liu W', 'Wang R', 'Li Y', 'Zhao S', 'Chen Y', 'Zhao Y']",2023,23,1,BMC Public Health,"Liu W, et al.

The presented case is one of the rare occurrences of necrotizing soft-tissue infection as a consequence of hematogenous spread and is the first described pediatric case of streptococcal myositis that was clearly preceded by pharyngitis. CASE REPORT A 2.5-year-old boy, previously healthy, fell ill 3 days before admission with high-grade fever, diffuse erythematous truncal rash and, later, with pain in the left lower leg. The next day, scarlet fever was diagnosed, and he was started on oral penicillin V. In the following 2 days, the fever and pain in the leg did not subside; edema and redness of the left shin appeared. On admission, he was febrile and had tachycardia, and the mouth examination was consistent with bacterial pharyngitis. The left shin was grossly edematous, with diffuse bluish skin discoloration. Empiric antibiotic treatment with benzylpenicillin and clindamycin was started. An ultrasound scan of the left shin revealed extensive myonecrosis. Urgent fasciotomy was done, and necrotic muscles were surgically excised. CONCLUSIONS Streptococcal necrotizing myositis is exceedingly rare. Due to potentially life-threatening complications and a need for urgent surgical intervention, clinicians must have a low threshold of suspicion, even in atypical pathogenesis and presentation.","['Pirš B', 'Kunič T', 'Alikadič N']",2023,24,,Am J Case Rep,"Pirš B, et al.

Understanding the time-varying epidemiology of bacterial infections diseases can provide scientific evidence to inform prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Yearly incidence data for all 17 major notifiable bacterial infectious diseases (BIDs) at the province level were obtained from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System in China between 2004 and 2019. Of them 16 BIDs are divided into four categories, respiratory transmitted diseases (RTDs, 6 diseases), direct contact/fecal-oral transmitted diseases (DCFTDs, 3 diseases), blood-borne/sexually transmitted diseases (BSTDs, 2 diseases), and zoonotic and vector-borne diseases (ZVDs, 5 diseases), and neonatal tetanus is excluded in the analysis. We characterized the demographic, temporal, and geographical features of the BIDs and examined their changing trends using a joinpoint regression analysis.
RESULTS: During 2004‒2019, 28 779 thousand cases of BIDs were reported, with an annualized incidence rate of 134.00 per 100 000. RTDs were the most commonly reported BIDs, accounting for 57.02% of the cases (16 410 639/28 779 000). Average annual percent changes (AAPC) in incidence were - 1.98% for RTDs, - 11.66% for DCFTDs, 4.74% for BSTDs, and 4.46% for ZVDs. Females had a higher incidence of syphilis than males, and other BIDs were more commonly reported in males. Among 0-5-year-olds, the diseases with the largest increases in incidence were pertussis (15.17% AAPC) and scarlet fever (12.05%). Children and students had the highest incidence rates of scarlet fever, pertussis, meningococcal meningitis, and bacillary dysentery. Northwest China had the highest incidence of RTDs, while South and East China had the highest incidences of BSTDs. Laboratory confirmation of BIDs increased from 43.80 to 64.04% during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: RTDs and DCFTDs decreased from 2004 to 2019 in China, while BSTDs and ZVDs increased during the same period. Great attention should be paid to BSTDs and ZVDs, active surveillance should be strengthened, and timely control measures should be adopted to reduce the incidence.","['Zhu Y', 'Lin S', 'Dong S', 'Zhang C', 'Shi L', 'Ren X', 'Li Z', 'Wang L', 'Fang L']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhu Y, et al.

The 2003 SARS epidemic triggered the initiation of the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP). Since then, numerous studies have investigated the epidemiological features and trends of individual infectious diseases in China; however, few considered the changing spatiotemporal trends and seasonality of these infectious diseases over time.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review the spatiotemporal trends and seasonal characteristics of class A and class B notifiable infectious diseases in China during 2005-2020.
METHODS: We extracted the incidence and mortality data of 8 types (27 diseases) of notifiable infectious diseases from the CISDCP. We used the Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods to investigate the diseases' temporal trends, Moran I statistic for their geographical distribution, and circular distribution analysis for their seasonality.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2020, 51,028,733 incident cases and 261,851 attributable deaths were recorded. Pertussis (P=.03), dengue fever (P=.01), brucellosis (P=.001), scarlet fever (P=.02), AIDS (P<.001), syphilis (P<.001), hepatitis C (P<.001) and hepatitis E (P=.04) exhibited significant upward trends. Furthermore, measles (P<.001), bacillary and amebic dysentery (P<.001), malaria (P=.04), dengue fever (P=.006), brucellosis (P=.03), and tuberculosis (P=.003) exhibited significant seasonal patterns. We observed marked disease burden-related geographic disparities and heterogeneities. Notably, high-risk areas for various infectious diseases have remained relatively unchanged since 2005. In particular, hemorrhagic fever and brucellosis were largely concentrated in Northeast China; neonatal tetanus, typhoid and paratyphoid, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, and AIDS in Southwest China; BAD in North China; schistosomiasis in Central China; anthrax, tuberculosis, and hepatitis A in Northwest China; rabies in South China; and gonorrhea in East China. However, the geographical distribution of syphilis, scarlet fever, and hepatitis E drifted from coastal to inland provinces during 2005-2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall infectious disease burden in China is declining; however, hepatitis C and E, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted infections continue to multiply, many of which have spread from coastal to inland provinces.","['Zheng J', 'Zhang N', 'Shen G', 'Liang F', 'Zhao Y', 'He X', 'Wang Y', 'He R', 'Chen W', 'Xue H', 'Shen Y', 'Fu Y', 'Zhang WH', 'Zhang L', 'Bhatt S', 'Mao Y', 'Zhu B']",2023,9,,JMIR Public Health Surveill,"Zheng J, et al.

37062653,Recrudescence of Scarlet Fever and Its Implications for Dental Professionals.,"A significant increase in the incidence of scarlet fever, mainly in Europe, has been noted during the COVID-19 postpandemic period. Scarlet fever is caused by a pyrogenic exotoxin-producing streptococcus-Streptococcus pyogenes-responsible for more than 500,000 deaths annually worldwide. Superantigens (SAgs) secreted by this Group A streptococcus (GAS) usually overstimulate the human immune system, causing an amplified hypersensitivity reaction leading to initial symptoms such as sore throat, high fever, and a sandpaper-like skin rash. There could be concurrent oral manifestations known as ""strawberry tongue"" or ""raspberry tongue,"" which may be first noted by oral health professionals. The early diagnosis and treatment of this disease is critical to obviate the development of local and systemic sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever, endocarditis, and glomerulonephritis. Antibiotics should be prescribed early to mitigate its duration, sequelae, and community spread. Dental practitioners should be aware of the early symptoms of scarlet fever for infection detection, emergency patient management, and appropriate referral. This concise review outlines the prevalence, pathogenicity, oral and systemic manifestations, as well as the dental implications of scarlet fever.","['Matsubara VH', 'Christoforou J', 'Samaranayake L']",2023,73,3,Int Dent J,"Matsubara VH, et al.

The proportion of individuals remaining culture-positive on day 1, day 2 and days 3-9 were 6.9% (95% CI: 2.7-16.8%), 5.4% (95% CI: 2.1-13.3%) and 2.6% (95% CI: 1.6-4.2%). For penicillins and cephalosporins, day 1 positivity was 6.5% (95% CI: 2.5-16.1%) and 1.6% (95% CI: 0.04-42.9%), respectively. Overall, for 9.1% (95% CI: 7.3-11.3), throat swabs collected after completion of therapy were GAS culture-positive. Only six studies had low risk of bias.ConclusionsOur review provides evidence that antibiotics for pharyngeal GAS achieve a high rate of culture conversion within 24 h but highlights the need for further research given methodological limitations of published studies and imprecision of pooled estimates. Further evidence is needed for non-beta-lactam antibiotics and asymptomatic individuals.","['McGuire E', 'Li A', 'Collin SM', 'Decraene V', 'Cook M', 'Padfield S', 'Sriskandan S', 'Van Beneden C', 'Lamagni T', 'Brown CS']",2023,28,15,Euro Surveill,"McGuire E, et al.

Nevertheless, there has been an increase in prevalence of certain bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea, and conditions such as tuberculosis still pose a serious threat to certain segments of the population. Finally, given the uncommon nature and pathophysiology of these diseases, diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in more clinically significant disease and potential contamination of individuals. Thus, it is prudent that clinicians be familiar with these uncommon but potentially serious infectious diseases, so treatment can be instituted promptly.","['Cabido LF', 'Romañach MJ']",2023,35,2,Oral Maxillofac Surg Clin North Am,Cabido LF and Romañach MJ.

36980098,Toxic Streptococcal Infection in Children: Report on Two Cases with Uncharacteristic Course of Scarlet Fever.,"INTRODUCTION: Scarlet fever is usually a mild childhood disease caused by type A 
AIM: This paper provides a discussion of two pediatric cases in order to determine the possibilities of diagnosis, differentiation, and treatment of patients with severe, non-obvious courses of scarlet fever.
METHODS: The case reports of two patients hospitalized in a pediatric department due to 
RESULTS: The patients were admitted to the emergency room with symptoms not directly indicative of type A streptococcal infection, which required further diagnosis. Both patients complained of weakness at the time of presentation. They had an elevated temperature, were dehydrated during the course of gastroenteritis, and passed liquid stools without pathological admixtures. Further stages of diagnosis and treatment required hospitalization in the pediatric department. Therapeutic benefit from the implemented treatment was obtained, and the patients were discharged in good general condition with further recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical history, which is often very detailed, can be the key to making the final diagnosis and can supplement the data collected on the basis of laboratory tests. Scarlet fever does not always occur with a mild course, and sometimes its course can be quite non-specific and may require a thorough diagnosis.","['Stencel-Gabriel K', 'Konwant D', 'Szejnoga-Tułacz K']",2023,10,3,Children (Basel),"Stencel-Gabriel K, et al.

36928399,[Invasive group A streptococcal infections in the Netherlands].,"Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections are caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. Infection can occur via droplet infection from the throat and via (in)direct contact with infected people. GAS can cause a wide variety of diseases, ranging from superficial skin infections, pharyngitis and scarlet fever, to serious invasive diseases such as puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, necrotising soft tissue infections (NSTI) (also known as necrotising fasciitis/myositis), meningitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). In invasive GAS infections, the bacteria has penetrated into a sterile body compartment (such as the bloodstream, deep tissues, or the central nervous system). Invasive GAS infections are rare but serious, with high morbidity and mortality. Since March 2022, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) reported a national increase in notifiable invasive GAS infections (NSTI, STSS and puerperal fever). Particularly NSTI has increased compared to the years before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Remarkably, the proportion of children aged 0 to 5 years with invasive GAS-infections is higher in 2022 than in the previous years (12% compared to 4%). While seasonal peaks occur, the current elevation exceeds this variation. To promote early recognition and diagnosis of invasive GAS infections different clinical cases are presented.","['Vinkeles Melchers NVS', 'Nawijn F', 'Rümke LW', 'Dix LML', 'Vestjens SMT', 'Hietbrink F', 'Tjon-Kon-Fat R', 'Verspui-van der Eijk E', 'de Gier B', 'Vlaminckx BJM', 'Içli C', 'Quaak MSW', 'Huijskens EIGW']",2023,167,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Vinkeles Melchers NVS, et al.

GAS deploys a range of virulence determinants to allow colonization, dissemination within the host and transmission, disrupting both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Fluctuating global GAS epidemiology is characterized by the emergence of new GAS clones, often associated with the acquisition of new virulence or antimicrobial determinants that are better adapted to the infection niche or averting host immunity. The recent identification of clinical GAS isolates with reduced penicillin sensitivity and increasing macrolide resistance threatens both frontline and penicillin-adjunctive antibiotic treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a GAS research and technology road map and has outlined preferred vaccine characteristics, stimulating renewed interest in the development of safe and effective GAS vaccines.","['Brouwer S', 'Rivera-Hernandez T', 'Curren BF', 'Harbison-Price N', 'De Oliveira DMP', 'Jespersen MG', 'Davies MR', 'Walker MJ']",2023,21,7,Nat Rev Microbiol,"Brouwer S, et al.

36782167,"Epidemiological analysis of Group A streptococcus infection diseases among children in Beijing, China under COVID-19 pandemic.","BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus is human-restricted gram-positive pathogen, responsible for various clinical presentations from mild epidermis infections to life threatened invasive diseases. Under COVID-19 pandemic,. the characteristics of the epidemic strains of GAS could be different.
PURPOSE: To investigate epidemiological and molecular features of isolates from GAS infections among children in Beijing, China between January 2020 and December 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiling was performed based on Cinical Laboratory Sandards Institute. Distribution of macrolide-resistance genes, emm types, and superantigens was examined by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: 114 GAS isolates were collected which were frequent resistance against erythromycin (94.74%), followed by clindamycin (92.98%), tetracycline (87.72%). Emm12 (46.49%), emm1 (25.44%) were dominant emm types. Distribution of ermB, ermA, and mefA gene was 93.85%, 2.63%, and 14.04%, respectively. Frequent superantigenes identified were smeZ (97.39%), speG (95.65%), and speC (92.17%). Emm1 strains possessed smeZ, ssa, and speC, while emm12 possessed smeZ, ssa, speG, and speC. Erythromycin resistance was predominantly mediated by ermB. Scarlet fever strains harbored smeZ (98.81%), speC (94.05%). Impetigo strains harbored smeZ (88.98%), ssa (88.89%), and speC (88.89%). Psoriasis strains harbored smeZ (100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Under COVID-19 pandemic, our collections of GAS infection cutaneous diseases decreased dramatically. Epidemiological analysis of GAS infections among children during COVID-19 pandemic was not significantly different from our previous study. There was a correlation among emm, superantigen gene and disease manifestations.

36721137,Trends in respiratory diseases before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China from 2010 to 2021.,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing benefits of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for respiratory infectious diseases in China are still unclear. We aimed to explore the changes in seven respiratory infectious diseases before, during, and after COVID-19 in China from 2010 to 2021.
METHODS: The monthly case numbers of seven respiratory infectious diseases were extracted to construct autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Eight indicators of NPIs were chosen from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker system. The monthly case numbers of the respiratory diseases and the eight indicators were used to establish the Multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) to calculate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
RESULTS: Compared with the year 2019, the percentage changes in 2020 and 2021 were all below 100% ranging from 3.81 to 84.71%. Pertussis and Scarlet fever started to increase in 2021 compared with 2020, with a percentage change of 183.46 and 171.49%. The ARIMA model showed a good fit, and the predicted data fitted well with the actual data from 2010 to 2019, but the predicted data was bigger than the actual number in 2020 and 2021. All eight indicators could negatively affect the incidence of respiratory diseases. The seven respiratory diseases were significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019, with significant estimated IRRs ranging from 0.06 to 0.85. In the GLM using data for the year 2020 and 2021, the IRRs were not significant after adjusting for the eight indicators in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the incidence of the seven respiratory diseases decreased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. At the end of 2021, we did see a rising trend for the seven respiratory diseases compared to the year 2020 when the NPIs relaxed in China, but the rising trend was not significant after adjusting for the NPIs indicators. Our study showed that NPIs have an effect on respiratory diseases, but Relaxation of NPIs might lead to the resurgence of respiratory diseases.","['Zuo Z', 'Yang C', 'Ye F', 'Wang M', 'Wu J', 'Tao C', 'Xun Y', 'Li Z', 'Liu S', 'Huang J', 'Xu A']",2023,23,1,BMC Public Health,"Zuo Z, et al.

36689967,Tonsillitis and Tonsilloliths: Diagnosis and Management.,"Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g., Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.","['Smith KL', 'Hughes R', 'Myrex P']",2023,107,1,Am Fam Physician,"Smith KL, et al.

36589977,Epidemiological trend in scarlet fever incidence in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: A time series analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Over the past decade, scarlet fever has caused a relatively high economic burden in various regions of China. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are necessary because of the absence of vaccines and specific drugs. This study aimed to characterize the demographics of patients with scarlet fever, describe its spatiotemporal distribution, and explore the impact of NPIs on the disease in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
METHODS: Using monthly scarlet fever data from January 2011 to December 2019, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), advanced innovation state-space modeling framework that combines Box-Cox transformations, Fourier series with time-varying coefficients, and autoregressive moving average error correction method (TBATS) models were developed to select the best model for comparing between the expected and actual incidence of scarlet fever in 2020. Interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) was used to explore whether NPIs have an effect on scarlet fever incidence, while the intervention effects of specific NPIs were explored using correlation analysis and ridge regression methods.
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2017, the total number of scarlet fever cases was 400,691, with children aged 0-9 years being the main group affected. There were two annual incidence peaks (May to June and November to December). According to the best prediction model TBATS (0.002, {0, 0}, 0.801, {<12, 5>}), the number of scarlet fever cases was 72,148 and dual seasonality was no longer prominent. ITSA showed a significant effect of NPIs of a reduction in the number of scarlet fever episodes (β2 = -61526, 
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of scarlet fever during COVID-19 was lower than expected, and the total incidence decreased by 80.74% in 2020. The results of this study indicate that strict NPIs may be of potential benefit in preventing scarlet fever occurrence, especially that related to public event cancellation. However, it is still important that vaccines and drugs are available in the future.","['Ma Y', 'Gao S', 'Kang Z', 'Shan L', 'Jiao M', 'Li Y', 'Liang L', 'Hao Y', 'Zhao B', 'Ning N', 'Gao L', 'Cui Y', 'Sun H', 'Wu Q', 'Liu H']",2022,10,,Front Public Health,"Ma Y, et al.

36510205,Impact of national COVID-19 restrictions on incidence of notifiable communicable diseases in England: an interrupted time series analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as travel restrictions, social distancing and isolation policies, aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 may have reduced transmission of other endemic communicable diseases, such as measles, mumps and meningitis in England.
METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to examine whether NPIs was associated with trends in endemic communicable diseases, using weekly reported cases of seven notifiable communicable diseases (food poisoning, measles, meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever and pertussis) between 02/01/2017 to 02/01/2021 for England.
RESULTS: Following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, there was an 81.1% (95% CI; 77.2-84.4) adjusted percentage reduction in the total number of notifiable diseases recorded per week in England. The greatest decrease was observed for measles, with a 90.5% percentage reduction (95% CI; 86.8-93.1) from 42 to 5 cases per week. The smallest decrease was observed for food poisoning, with a 56.4% (95%CI; 42.5-54.2) decrease from 191 to 83 cases per week.
CONCLUSIONS: A total reduction in the incidence of endemic notifiable diseases was observed in England following the implementation of public health measures aimed at reducing transmission of SARS-COV-2 on March 23, 2020. The greatest reductions were observed in diseases most frequently observed during childhood that are transmitted via close human-to-human contact, such as measles and pertussis. A less substantive reduction was observed in reported cases of food poisoning, likely due to dining services (i.e., home deliveries and takeaways) remaining open and providing a potential route of transmission. This study provides further evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in reducing the transmission of both respiratory and food-borne communicable diseases.","['Nash K', 'Lai J', 'Sandhu K', 'Chandan JS', 'Shantikumar S', 'Ogunlayi F', 'Coleman PC']",2022,22,1,BMC Public Health,"Nash K, et al.

36411416,Spatiotemporal dynamics and potential ecological drivers of acute respiratory infectious diseases: an example of scarlet fever in Sichuan Province.,"OBJECT: Scarlet fever is an acute respiratory infectious disease that endangers public health and imposes a huge economic burden. In this paper, we systematically studied its spatial and temporal evolution and explore its potential ecological drivers. The goal of this research is to provide a reference for analysis based on surveillance data of scarlet fever and other acute respiratory infectious illnesses, and offer suggestions for prevention and control.
METHOD: This research is based on a spatiotemporal multivariate model (Endemic-Epidemic model). Firstly, we described the epidemiology status of the scarlet fever epidemic in Sichuan Province from 2016 to 2019. Secondly, we used spatial autocorrelation analysis to understand the spatial pattern. Thirdly, we applied the endemic-epidemic model to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics by quantitatively decomposing cases into endemic, autoregressive, and spatiotemporal components. Finally, we explored potential ecological drivers that could influence the spread of scarlet fever.
RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, the incidence of scarlet fever in Sichuan Province varied much among cities. In terms of temporal distribution, there were 1-2 epidemic peaks per year, and they were mainly concentrated from April to June and October to December. In terms of transmission, the endemic and temporal spread were predominant. Our findings imply that the school holiday could help to reduce the spread of scarlet fever, and a standard increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was associated with 2.6 folds contributions to the epidemic among cities.
CONCLUSION: Scarlet fever outbreaks are more susceptible to previous cases, as temporal spread accounted for major transmission in many areas in Sichuan Province. The school holidays and GDP can influence the spread of infectious diseases. Given that covariates could not fully explain heterogeneity, adding random effects was essential to improve accuracy. Paying attention to critical populations and hotspots, as well as understanding potential drivers, is recommended for acute respiratory infections such as scarlet fever.

36333699,Application of logistic differential equation models for early warning of infectious diseases in Jilin Province.,"BACKGROUND: There is still a relatively serious disease burden of infectious diseases and the warning time for different infectious diseases before implementation of interventions is important. The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year.
METHODS: Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively.
RESULTS: Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model. In addition, the WRW estimated with the GLDE model were more lagged and had a longer warning time.","['Yang T', 'Wang Y', 'Yao L', 'Guo X', 'Hannah MN', 'Liu C', 'Rui J', 'Zhao Z', 'Huang J', 'Liu W', 'Deng B', 'Luo L', 'Li Z', 'Li P', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu X', 'Xu J', 'Yang M', 'Zhao Q', 'Su Y', 'Chen T']",2022,22,1,BMC Public Health,"Yang T, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected patients given a diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis in 2 paediatric caseloads of 1 primary care centre between June 2016 and April 2020. We compared outcomes in patients treated with 8- to 10-day courses versus 5- to 7-day courses.
RESULTS: The analysis included 350 care episodes (252 patients). Sixty-four percent were managed with 8- to 10-day courses of antibiotherapy (group 1) and 36% with 5- to 7-day courses (group 2). There were no significant differences in the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever in the 3 months that followed (OR, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-2.03), with similar percentages in both groups (9.8% vs 9.5%). Overall, without differentiating based on the type of infection (streptococcal pharyngitis, scarlet fever or other streptococcal infections), we found similar outcomes (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.41-1.59): 13.4% in group 1 and 11.1% in group 2. We also found no differences in the frequency of adverse events documented in the health records (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.04-2.44): 2.7% in group 1 and 0.8% in group 2.

36068673,Ten-year prevalence of acute hospital ENT infections and the impact of COVID: A large population study.,"BACKGROUND: Acute ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections were the commonest referrals from accident and emergency to ENT services. The referral rate changed dramatically with season, year, national outbreaks and during the COVID pandemic.
METHOD: Retrospective longitudinal study of the epidemiology of seven acute ENT infections in secondary care over 10 years. A mixed city and rural population of over 650 000 in central England was studied. The risk factors for each wave of infection during the surge of infection were sought. A statistical analysis of their significance was undertaken. This included analysis and correlation of group A-beta haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) in hospital and community. Seasonal variations, hospital admissions and the impact of the COVID were analysed.
RESULTS: There were 16 883 reported cases of the seven index ENT infections during the 10-year period. Great seasonal and year-to-year variations were recorded. There was an incremental rise in 2018. Spring had the highest season of acute ENT infections. An outbreak of GABHS was noted in the community in 2014. The mean duration of hospital admission was 1.5 days. There was no statistical ethnic or gender predominance. A dramatically lower number of acute ENT infections were recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this continued after lifting of lockdown restrictions.
CONCLUSION: A resurgence in scarlet fever directly and indirectly contributed to an incremental rise in acute ENT infections in the following years. Both hospital and community B-haemolytic cultures have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a reduction in infections as opposed to reduced case ascertainment.","['Mettias B', 'Jenkins D', 'Rea P']",2023,48,1,Clin Otolaryngol,"Mettias B, et al.

36034052,Trends in pediatric ambulatory community acquired infections before and during COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective multicentric surveillance study in France.,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 pandemic control has imposed several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Strict application of these measures has had a dramatic reduction on the epidemiology of several infectious diseases. As the pandemic is ongoing for more than 2 years, some of these measures have been removed, mitigated, or less well applied. The aim of this study is to investigate the trends of pediatric ambulatory infectious diseases before and up to two years after the onset of the pandemic.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study in France with 107 pediatricians specifically trained in pediatric infectious diseases. From January 2018 to April 2022, the electronic medical records of children with an infectious disease were automatically extracted. The annual number of infectious diseases in 2020 and 2021 was compared to 2018-2019 and their frequency was compared by logistic regression.
FINDINGS: From 2018 to 2021, 185,368 infectious diseases were recorded. Compared to 2018 (
INTERPRETATION: While during NPIs strict application, the overall frequency of community-acquired infections was reduced, after relaxation of these measures, a rebound of some of them (enteroviral infections, bronchiolitis, gastroenteritis, otitis) occurred beyond the pre-pandemic level. These findings highlight the need for continuous surveillance of infectious diseases, especially insofar as future epidemics are largely unpredictable.

36011545,Collateral Impact of COVID-19 Prevention Measures on Re-Emergence of Scarlet Fever and Pertussis in Mainland China and Hong Kong China.,"The incidence of scarlet fever and pertussis has increased significantly in China in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stringent non-pharmaceutical intervention measures were widely adopted to contain the spread of the virus, which may also have essential collateral impacts on other infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever and pertussis. We compared the incidence data of scarlet fever and pertussis in Mainland China and Hong Kong from 2004 to 2021 before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the incidence of both diseases decreased significantly in 2020-2021 compared to the after-re-emergence stage in these two locations. Specifically, in 2020, scarlet fever decreased by 73.13% and pertussis by 76.63% in Mainland China, and 83.70% and 76.10%, respectively, in Hong Kong. In the absence of COVID-19, the predicted incidence of both diseases was much higher than the actual incidence in Mainland China and Hong Kong in 2020-2021. This study demonstrates that non-pharmaceutical measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially reduce scarlet fever and pertussis re-emergence in Mainland China and Hong Kong.","['He Y', 'Ma C', 'Guo X', 'Pan J', 'Xu W', 'Liu S']",2022,19,16,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"He Y, et al.

35740153,Decreased Antibiotic Consumption Coincided with Reduction in Bacteremia Caused by Bacterial Species with Respiratory Transmission Potential during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020−2021) have provided a unique opportunity to understand their impact on the wholesale supply of antibiotics and incidences of infections represented by bacteremia due to common bacterial species in Hong Kong. The wholesale antibiotic supply data (surrogate indicator of antibiotic consumption) and notifications of scarlet fever, chickenpox, and tuberculosis collected by the Centre for Health Protection, and the data of blood cultures of patients admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong collected by the Hospital Authority for the last 10 years, were tabulated and analyzed. A reduction in the wholesale supply of antibiotics was observed. This decrease coincided with a significant reduction in the incidence of community-onset bacteremia due to Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, which are encapsulated bacteria with respiratory transmission potential. This reduction was sustained during two pandemic years (period 2: 2020−2021), compared with eight pre-pandemic years (period 1: 2012−2019). Although the mean number of patient admissions per year (1,704,079 vs. 1,702,484, p = 0.985) and blood culture requests per 1000 patient admissions (149.0 vs. 158.3, p = 0.132) were not significantly different between periods 1 and 2, a significant reduction in community-onset bacteremia due to encapsulated bacteria was observed in terms of the mean number of episodes per year (257 vs. 58, p < 0.001), episodes per 100,000 admissions (15.1 vs. 3.4, p < 0.001), and per 10,000 blood culture requests (10.1 vs. 2.1, p < 0.001), out of 17,037,598 episodes of patient admissions with 2,570,164 blood culture requests. Consistent with the findings of bacteremia, a reduction in case notification of scarlet fever and airborne infections, including tuberculosis and chickenpox, was also observed; however, there was no reduction in the incidence of hospital-onset bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. Sustained implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions against respiratory microbes may reduce the overall consumption of antibiotics, which may have a consequential impact on antimicrobial resistance. Rebound of conventional respiratory microbial infections is likely with the relaxation of these interventions.","['Cheng VC', 'Wong SC', 'So SY', 'Chen JH', 'Chau PH', 'Au AK', 'Chiu KH', 'Li X', 'Ip P', 'Chuang VW', 'Lung DC', 'Tse CW', 'Lee RA', 'Fung KS', 'To WK', 'Lai RW', 'Que TL', 'Lo JY', 'Yuen KY']",2022,11,6,Antibiotics (Basel),"Cheng VC, et al.

35544165,"A controlled human infection model of Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis (CHIVAS-M75): an observational, dose-finding study.","BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes is a leading cause of infection-related morbidity and mortality. A reinvigorated vaccine development effort calls for new clinically relevant human S pyogenes experimental infection models to support proof of concept evaluation of candidate vaccines. We describe the initial Controlled Human Infection for Vaccination Against S pyogenes (CHIVAS-M75) study, in which we aimed to identify a dose of emm75 S pyogenes that causes acute pharyngitis in at least 60% of volunteers when applied to the pharynx by swab.
METHODS: This observational, dose-finding study was done in a clinical trials facility in Melbourne (VIC, Australia). Groups of healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years, at low risk of complicated S pyogenes disease, and without high type-specific anti-emm75 IgG antibodies against the challenge strain were challenged and closely monitored as inpatients for up to 6 days, and then as outpatients for 6 months. Antibiotics were started upon diagnosis (clinical signs and symptoms of pharyngitis and a positive rapid molecular test) or after 5 days in those without pharyngitis. Rapid test results were confirmed by standard bacterial culture. After a sentinel participant, cohorts of five and then ten participants were challenged, with protocol-directed dose-escalation or de-escalation for subsequent cohorts. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants at each dose level with pharyngitis by day 5 after challenge. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03361163.
FINDINGS: Between July 10, 2018, and Sept 23, 2019, 25 healthy adults were challenged with emm75 S pyogenes and included in analyses. Pharyngitis was diagnosed in 17 (85%; 95% CI 62-97) of 20 participants at the starting dose level (1-3 × 10
INTERPRETATION: We have established a reliable pharyngitis human infection model with reassuring early safety findings to accelerate development of vaccines and other interventions to control disease due to S pyogenes.

35544097,"Frequency of transmission, asymptomatic shedding, and airborne spread of Streptococcus pyogenes in schoolchildren exposed to scarlet fever: a prospective, longitudinal, multicohort, molecular epidemiological, contact-tracing study in England, UK.","BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations regarding prompt treatment of cases and enhanced hygiene measures, scarlet fever outbreaks increased in England between 2014 and 2018. We aimed to assess the effects of standard interventions on transmission of Streptococcus pyogenes to classroom contacts, households, and classroom environments to inform future guidance.
METHODS: We did a prospective, longitudinal, multicohort, molecular epidemiological, contact-tracing study in six settings across five schools in Greater London, UK. Schools and nurseries were eligible to participate if they had reported two cases of scarlet fever within 10 days of each other among children aged 2-8 years from the same class, with the most recent case arising in the preceding 48 h. We cultured throat swabs from children with scarlet fever, classroom contacts, and household contacts at four timepoints. We also cultured hand swabs and cough plates from all cases in years 1 and 2 of the study, and from classroom contacts in year 2. Surface swabs from toys and other fomites in classrooms were cultured in year 1, and settle plates from classrooms were collected in year 2. Any sample with S pyogenes detected was recorded as positive and underwent emm genotyping and genome sequencing to compare with the outbreak strain.
FINDINGS: Six classes, comprising 12 cases of scarlet fever, 17 household contacts, and 278 classroom contacts were recruited between March 1 and May 31, 2018 (year 1), and between March 1 and May 31, 2019 (year 2). Asymptomatic throat carriage of the outbreak strains increased from 11 (10%) of 115 swabbed children in week 1, to 34 (27%) of 126 in week 2, to 26 (24%) of 108 in week 3, and then five (14%) of 35 in week 4. Compared with carriage of outbreak S pyogenes strains, colonisation with non-outbreak and non-genotyped S pyogenes strains occurred in two (2%) of 115 swabbed children in week 1, five (4%) of 126 in week 2, six (6%) of 108 in week 3, and in none of the 35 children in week 4 (median carriage for entire study 2·8% [IQR 0·0-6·6]). Genome sequencing showed clonality of outbreak isolates within each of six classes, confirming that recent transmission accounted for high carriage. When transmissibility was tested, one (9%) of 11 asymptomatic carriers of emm4 and five (36%) of 14 asymptomatic carriers of emm3.93 had a positive cough plate. The outbreak strain was identified in only one (2%) of 60 surface swabs taken from three classrooms; however, in the two classrooms with settle plates placed in elevated locations, two (17%) of 12 and six (50%) of 12 settle plates yielded the outbreak strain.
INTERPRETATION: Transmission of S pyogenes in schools is intense and might occur before or despite reported treatment of cases, underlining a need for rapid case management. Despite guideline adherence, heavy shedding of S pyogenes by few classroom contacts might perpetuate outbreaks, and airborne transmission has a plausible role in its spread. These findings highlight the need for research to improve understanding and to assess effectiveness of interventions to reduce airborne transmission of S pyogenes.

This study aimed to develop a forecasting model of the incidence of scarlet fever using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Monthly scarlet fever data between 2011 and 2019 in Chongqing, China were retrieved from the Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. From 2011 to 2019, a total of 5073 scarlet fever cases were reported in Chongqing, the male-to-female ratio was 1.44:1, children aged 3-9 years old accounted for 81.86% of the cases, while 42.70 and 42.58% of the reported cases were students and kindergarten children, respectively. The data from 2011 to 2018 were used to fit a SARIMA model and data in 2019 were used to validate the model. The normalised Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the fitted model. The optimal SARIMA model was identified as (3, 1, 3) (3, 1, 0)12. The RMSE and mean absolute per cent error (MAPE) were used to assess the accuracy of the model. The RMSE and MAPE of the predicted values were 19.40 and 0.25 respectively, indicating that the predicted values matched the observed values reasonably well. Taken together, the SARIMA model could be employed to forecast scarlet fever incidence trend, providing support for scarlet fever control and prevention.","['Wu WW', 'Li Q', 'Tian DC', 'Zhao H', 'Xia Y', 'Xiong Y', 'Su K', 'Tang WG', 'Chen X', 'Wang J', 'Qi L']",2022,150,,Epidemiol Infect,"Wu WW, et al.

35523394,The secondary outcome of public health measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the spread of other respiratory infectious diseases in Thailand.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has promoted stringent public health measures such as hand hygiene, face mask wearing, and physical distancing to contain the spread of the viral infection. In this retrospective study, the secondary outcomes of those public health measures on containing other respiratory infections among the Thai population were investigated. Hospitalization data spanning from 2016 to 2021 of six respiratory infectious diseases, namely influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis (TB), were examined. First, the expected respiratory infectious cases where no public health measures are in place are estimated using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Then the expected number of cases and the observed cases were compared. The results showed a significant drop in the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases by an average of 61%. The reduction in hospitalization is significant for influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, and scarlet fever (p < 0.05), while insignificant for TB (p = 0.54). The notable decrease in the incidence of cases is ascribed to the implementation of public health measures that minimized the opportunity for spread of disease. This decline in cases following relaxation of pandemic countermeasure is contingent on its scope and nature, and it is proof that selective physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public places is a viable route for mitigating respiratory morbidities.","['Ndeh NT', 'Tesfaldet YT', 'Budnard J', 'Chuaicharoen P']",2022,48,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Ndeh NT, et al.

35231667,Proteome based mapping and reverse vaccinology techniques to contrive multi-epitope based subunit vaccine (MEBSV) against Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a root cause of human infection like pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, and respiratory tract infections. About 11 million individuals in the US suffer from pharyngitis every year. Unfortunately, no vaccine against S. pyogenes is available yet. The purpose of this study is to create a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MEBSV) targeting S. pyogenes top four highly antigenic proteins by using a combination of immunological techniques and molecular docking to tackle term group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. T-cell (HTL & CTL), B-cell, and IFN-γ of target proteins were forecasted and epitopes having high antigenic properties being selected for subsequent research. For designing of final vaccine, 5LBL, 9CTL, and 4HTL epitopes were joined by the KK, AAY, and GPGPG linkers. To enhance the immune response, the N-end of the vaccine was linked by adjuvant (Cholera enterotoxin subunit B) with a linker named EAAAK. With the addition of adjuvants and linkers, the construct size was 421 amino acids. IFN-γ and B-cell epitopes illustrate that the modeled construct is optimized for cell-mediated immune or humoral responses. The developed MEBSV structure was assessed to be highly antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic. Moreover, disulphide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final vaccine protein. Molecular docking of the MEBSV with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was conducted to check the vaccine's compatibility with the receptor. Besides, in-silico cloning has been carried out for credibility validation and proper expression of vaccine construct. These findings suggested that the multi-epitope vaccine produced might be a potential immunogenic against Group A streptococcus infections but further experimental testing is required to validate this study.","['Aslam S', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Zia T', 'Aslam N', 'Alrumaihi F', 'Shahid F', 'Noor F', 'Qasim M']",2022,100,,Infect Genet Evol,"Aslam S, et al.

35183250,Nonshared environmental factors in the aetiology of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions: a monozygotic co-twin control study.,"BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of variation in likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) has been attributed to nonshared environmental (NSE) factors, although it remains unclear which NSE factors pose specific risks for certain NDCs.
METHODS: A monozygotic co-twin design was applied in a sample of 224 twins (mean age = 17.70 years, SD = 6.28) controlling for confounders such as genes and shared environment. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted, using perinatal and postnatal indications of NSEs as exposure, operationalized both as separate risk factors and as cumulative risk loads. Categorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability and other NDCs were used as outcomes.
RESULTS: Birth weight discordance was associated with dimensional autism and ADHD for the smaller twin, and medication during infancy was associated with dimensional autism. Among postnatal factors scarlet fever during early childhood was associated with lower IQ. Especially autism was associated with a greater cumulative perinatal or postnatal risk load.
LIMITATIONS: When exploring the associations between each condition and specific NSEs the risk of being statistically underpowered increases. Hence, we limit the reported findings on specific indicators of NSEs to trait levels and present descriptive data for categorical NDCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings support previous research by indicating an association between exposure to perinatal and postnatal risks and subsequent NDCs within twin pairs and suggest that autism may be especially linked to accumulative early environmental risks. The findings are potentially important for developmental outcomes prognoses and may inform targeted prevention and early interventions.","['Isaksson J', 'Ruchkin V', 'Aho N', 'Lundin Remnélius K', 'Marschik PB', 'Bölte S']",2022,13,1,Mol Autism,"Isaksson J, et al.

In this follow-up retrospective analysis, we explored these differences in greater detail by calculating prevalence of 52 infectious diseases, across 28 years of data among 6078 individuals with DS and 30,326 age- and sex-matched controls, abstracted from electronic medical records within a large Midwestern health system. We found that the DS cohort had higher prevalence of pneumonias (including aspiration, viral, bacterial, pneumococcal, and unspecified/atypical); otitis externa; and the skin infections impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis. To the contrary, the DS cohort had lower prevalence of many respiratory infections other than pneumonia (including influenza, strep pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, scarlet fever, and otitis media); sexually transmitted infections (including bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus, pelvic inflammatory disease, and trichomoniasis); mononucleosis; shingles; unspecified hepatitis; intestinal infections; and enteritis. These findings highlight that individuals with DS could be more or less prone to different infectious diseases than their non-DS matched counterparts. Additional research to understand why these differences exist and how they might affect the clinical approach to patients with DS is warranted.","['Fitzpatrick V', 'Rivelli A', 'Chaudhari S', 'Chicoine L', 'Jia G', 'Rzhetsky A', 'Chicoine B']",2022,9,1,J Patient Cent Res Rev,"Fitzpatrick V, et al.

Scarlet fever is a toxin-mediated disease characterized by the formation of an erythematous, sandpaper-like rash that typically occurs in children aged 5 to 15. This infectious disease is caused by toxins called superantigens, a family of highly potent immunomodulators. Although scarlet fever had largely declined in both prevalence and severity since the late 19th century, outbreaks have now reemerged in multiple geographical regions over the past decade. Here, we review recent findings that address the role of superantigens in promoting a fitness advantage for S. pyogenes within human populations and discuss how superantigens may be suitable targets for vaccination strategies.","['Hurst JR', 'Brouwer S', 'Walker MJ', 'McCormick JK']",2021,17,12,PLoS Pathog,"Hurst JR, et al.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional community-based study of children with scarlet fever notified to London's three Health Protection Teams, 2018-2019.
PARTICIPANTS: From 2575 directly invited notified cases plus invitations via parental networks at 410 schools/nurseries with notified outbreaks of confirmed/probable scarlet fever, we received 477 responses (19% of those directly invited), of which 412 met the case definition. Median age was 4 years (range <1 to 16), 48% were female, and 70% were of white ethnicity.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Preplanned measures included quantitative description of case demographics, symptoms, care-seeking, and clinical, social, and economic impact on cases and households. After survey completion, secondary analyses of factors associated with delayed diagnosis (by logistic regression) and consequences of delayed diagnosis (by Cox's regression), and qualitative analysis of free text comments were added.
RESULTS: Rash was reported for 89% of cases, but followed onset of other symptoms for 71%, with a median 1-day delay. Pattern of onset varied with age: sore throat was more common at onset among children 5 years and older (OR3.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 5.0). At first consultation, for 28%, scarlet fever was not considered: in these cases, symptoms were frequently attributed to viral infection (60%, 64/106). Delay in diagnosis beyond first consultation occurred more frequently among children aged 5+ who presented with sore throat (OR 2.8 vs 5+without sore throat; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.8). Cases with delayed diagnosis took, on average, 1 day longer to return to baseline activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Scarlet fever may be initially overlooked, especially among older children presenting with sore throat.

34840763,Normal values of antistreptolysin O for adults ages 30 to 70 in Syria: A cross sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus is a very common pathogen which infects a large scale of people around the world causing many symptoms such as scarlet fever, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Most strains of group A and many other strains of group C and G Streptococcus bacteria secreted antigen called Streptolysin O. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) is an antibody produced against streptolysin O that rises after 1 week of infection by streptococcus bacteria, which helps in diagnosing this type of infectious diseases. We conducted a Cross-Sectional study to determine the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for healthy adult in Aleppo, Syria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sero-epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October in 2019. ASO titers were determined on 267 healthy patients' companions who visited Aleppo University Hospital. Geometric mean titer and Upper Limit of Normal of ASO were calculated according to sex, age and residency. Upper Limit of Normal were defined as the 80th percentile.
RESULTS: Out of 267 participants; 126 (45.7%) were males and 150 (54.3) were females. The Upper Limit of Normal for total participants was 210.8 IU/ml. There was no significant difference (P-value > 0.05) among males (204.6 IU/ml) and females (225.8 IU/ml). In contrast to sex, there was a significant difference (P-value < 0.05) according to age groups, where the highest Upper Limit of Normal was in the 30-39 age group (256.0 IU/ml).
CONCLUSION: ASO test is a common, easy, cheap method, so getting enough data about it is very important in the developing countries (such as Syria).

METHODS: A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) combined with a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was applied to quantify the distributed lag effects of air pollutions on scarlet fever, with daily incidence of scarlet fever as the dependent variable and air pollutions as the independent variable adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 6316 cases of scarlet fever were notified, and there were 376 days occurring air pollution during the study period. Scarlet fever was significantly associated with air pollutions at a lag of 7 days with different relative risk (RR) of air pollution degrees [1.172, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.038-1.323 in mild air pollution; 1.374, 95% CI 1.078-1.749 in moderate air pollution; 1.610, 95% CI 1.163-2.314 in severe air pollution; 1.887, 95% CI 1.163-3.061 in most severe air pollution].
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that air pollution is positively associated with scarlet fever in Qingdao, and the risk of scarlet fever could be increased along with the degrees of air pollution.

This study aimed to determine the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemic characteristics of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases.
METHODS: Time series was firstly performed to describe the temporal distribution feature of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases during 2005-2014 in Shandong Province. GIS Natural Breaks (Jenks) was applied to divide the average annual incidence of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases into five grades. Spatial empirical Bayesian smoothed risk maps and excess risk maps were further used to investigate spatial patterns of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases. Global and local Moran's I statistics were used to measure the spatial autocorrelation. Spatial-temporal scanning was used to detect spatiotemporal clusters and identify high-risk locations.
RESULTS: A total of 537,506 cases of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases were reported in Shandong Province during 2005-2014. The morbidity of notifiable respiratory infectious diseases had obvious seasonality with high morbidity in winter and spring. Local Moran's I analysis showed that there were 5, 23, 24, 4, 20, 8, 14, 10 and 7 high-risk counties determined for influenza A (H1N1), measles, tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis, pertussis, scarlet fever, influenza, mumps and rubella, respectively.

METHODS: Data were drawn from the national surveillance from 2008 to 2017, and the participants were students aged from 6 to 22 years who were diagnosed with notifiable infectious diseases. A total of 40 infectious diseases were classified into three groups based on national notifiable infectious diseases classification of A, B and C. The morbidity and mortality rates from infectious diseases were calculated using the numbers of students published by the ministry of education as the denominator. The age- and province-specific infectious diseases with the highest incidence were selected as the leading infectious diseases for analysis.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, the incidence rate, the number of cases and the number of deaths of infectious diseases among the boys aged 6-22 years in China were higher than that of the girls, and the overall trend was downward during the study period. The incidence rates in the boys and girls decreased from 2008 to 2015 with decrease of 43.4% and 40.1%, respectively. However, by 2017, the increase rate rebounded with the increases of 47.1% and 53.8%. The rebound trend was mainly caused by the increase of group C of infectious diseases. During the past decade, the top leading three diseases of groups A and B of infectious diseases were viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and dysentery in 2018, respectively, which changed to tuberculosis, scarlet fever and viral hepatitis in 2017. The top leading three infectious diseases in terms of mortality were rabies, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 2008, which were transformed into HIV/AIDS, rabies, and tuberculosis in 2017. There was no significantly obvious change in the incidence and mortality order of group C of infectious diseases during the decade. In the analysis of age groups and regions, the leading infectious diseases in groups A and B transferred from viral hepatitis to scarlet fever and tuberculosis, while in group C, mumps and infectious diarrhoea almost always dominated the leading infectious diseases. But in recent years, influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease increased significantly in the eastern region.
CONCLUSION: During the past decade, China has got remarkable achievements in the prevention and control of children infectious disease. However, the change patterns and characteristics of notifiable infectious diseases among children and adolescents show the urgent need for prevention and control of respiratory tract infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases as well as new emerging infectious diseases in China in the future. This study provides important basis for policy making of Chinese national school-based infectious disease prevention and control mechanism.","['Dong YH', 'Chen MM', 'Wang LP', 'Xing Y', 'Song Y', 'Zou ZY', 'Dong B', 'Li ZJ', 'Ma J']",2021,53,3,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"Dong YH, et al.

One thousand eight hundred ninety-three iGAS isolates were analyzed over 2007-2019. emm typing was performed by sequencing the gene's variable 5' end, exotoxin genes were identified by PCR, and antimicrobial susceptibility explored via the E test and disk diffusion. Five hundred twenty-three isolates were associated with sepsis, 292 with cellulitis, 232 with scarlet fever, 153 with pneumonia, 141 with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and 94 with necrotizing fasciitis. The most prevalent emm types were emm1 (449/1893 isolates), emm89 (210/1893), emm3 (208/1893), emm4 (150/1893), emm12 (112/1893) emm6 (107/1893), emm87 (89/1893), emm28 (88/1893), emm75 (78/1893), emm77 (78/1893), emm11 (58/1893), and emm22 (35/1893). emm1, emm3, emm4, and emm6 were the predominant types affecting children (mostly respiratory infections), while emm11, emm77, and emm89 prevailed in the elderly (mostly skin infections). Each emm type was associated with one or more exotoxin gene (spe, sme, and ssa) profiles. speA was detected in 660 isolates, speB in 1829, speC in 1014, speF in 1826, speG in 1651, speJ in 716, speH in 331, smeZ in 720, and ssa in 512. Isolates with speA were associated with the most severe infections. Penicillin susceptibility was universal. Two hundred twenty-four isolates were resistant to tetracycline, 169 to erythromycin, and 81 to clindamycin. Tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin resistance rates declined over the study period.

METHODS: The data on scarlet fever cases in mainland China were downloaded from the Data Center of the China Public Health Science, while monthly meteorological data were extracted from the official website of the National Bureau of Statistics. Global Moran's I, local Getis-Ord G
RESULTS: Scarlet fever in China had obvious spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal clustering, high-incidence spatial clusters were located mainly in the north and northeast of China. Nine spatiotemporal clusters were identified. A spatial lag fixed effects panel data model was the best fit for regression analysis. After adjusting for spatial individual effects and spatial autocorrelation (ρ = 0.5623), scarlet fever incidence was positively associated with a one-month lag of average temperature, precipitation, and total sunshine hours (all P-values < 0.05). Each 10 °C, 2 cm, and 10 h increase in temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours, respectively, was associated with a 6.41% increment and 1.04% and 1.41% decrement in scarlet fever incidence, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of scarlet fever in China showed an upward trend in recent years. It had obvious spatiotemporal clustering, with the high-risk areas mainly concentrated in the north and northeast of China. Areas with high temperature and with low precipitation and sunshine hours tended to have a higher scarlet fever incidence, and we should pay more attention to prevention and control in these places.","['Rao HX', 'Li DM', 'Zhao XY', 'Yu J']",2021,777,,Sci Total Environ,"Rao HX, et al.

33499846,"Thoughts, beliefs and concepts concerning infectious childhood diseases of physicians practicing homeopathic, anthroposophic and conventional medicine - a qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: Physicians who include complementary medicine in their practice are thought to have an understanding of health and disease different from that of colleagues practicing conventional medicine. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the thoughts and concepts concerning infectious childhood diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, pertussis and scarlet fever) of physicians practicing homeopathic, anthroposophic and conventional medicine.
METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews. Participating physicians were either general practitioners or pediatricians. Data collection and analysis were guided by a grounded theory approach.
RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed (6 homeopathic, 6 anthroposophic and 6 conventional). All physicians agreed that while many classic infectious childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are rarely observed today, other diseases, such as chickenpox and scarlet fever, are still commonly diagnosed. All interviewed physicians vaccinated against childhood diseases. A core concern for physicians practicing conventional medicine was the risk of complications of the diseases. Therefore, it was considered essential for them to advise their patients to strictly follow the vaccination schedule. Homeopathic-oriented physicians viewed acute disease as a biological process necessary to strengthen health, fortify the immune system and increase resistance to chronic disease. They tended to treat infectious childhood diseases with homeopathic remedies and administered available vaccines as part of individual decision-making approaches with parents. For anthroposophic-oriented physicians, infectious childhood diseases were considered a crucial factor in the psychosocial growth of children. They tended to treat these diseases with anthroposophic medicine and underlined the importance of the family's resources. Informing parents about the potential benefits and risks of vaccination was considered important. All physicians agreed that parent-delivered loving care of a sick child could benefit the parent-child relationship. Additionally, all recognized that existing working conditions hindered parents from providing such care for longer durations of time.
CONCLUSIONS: The interviewed physicians agreed that vaccines are an important aspect of modern pediatrics. They differed in their approach regarding when and what to vaccinate against. The different conceptual understandings of infectious childhood diseases influenced this decision-making. A survey with a larger sample would be needed to verify these observations.","['Mittring-Junghans N', 'Holmberg C', 'Witt CM', 'Teut M']",2021,21,1,BMC Complement Med Ther,"Mittring-Junghans N, et al.

33448168,Scarlet fever - a diagnostic challenge for dentists and physicians: A report of 2 cases with diverse symptoms.,"Scarlet fever is an infectious disease caused by group A streptococcal bacteria, transmitted mainly through direct contact with the saliva and nasal fluids of infected people. It may also arise from streptococcal wound infections or burns. The disease most commonly affects children aged 5-15 years and manifests as a sore throat, fever and a sandpaper-like, papular skin rash. Due to the evident involvement of the oral structures, the awareness of the symptoms of scarlet fever is essential for dentists in order to avoid the spread of this highly contagious disease in crowded places, such as kindergartens and schools. As no vaccine is available to prevent scarlet fever, the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition are important in reducing the risk of developing local and systemic complications, which include acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis. In this report, 2 cases of scarlet fever are described in unrelated children with diverse symptoms, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are discussed.","['Ślebioda Z', 'Mania-Końsko A', 'Dorocka-Bobkowska B']",2020,57,4,Dent Med Probl,"Ślebioda Z, et al.

This secondary burial and violent opening of the coffins in the end of the World War II leaving the body exposed to external climatic conditions led to its natural (spontaneous) dry mummification. The computed tomography scan of the corpse showed that the majority of internal organs were well preserved. And surprisingly, parts of the central nervous system estimated to be about 70% of the original size with distinguishable neural structures. We tested the cerebellum, tentorium and hair for mercury and arsenic, and the body was assessed by a forensic examiner for possible signs of an artificial embalming, and pathology. We did not confirm the hypothesis of the eventual preservation using the salts of mercury and/or arsenic or other fixation common for embalming in the 1800s. The anthropogenic mummification can be excluded due to the presence of fly larvae, historical records confirmed the burial of the individual right after death, and the different degree of organs condition. It appears that the unique preservation of the mummy and its internal organs was most likely caused by stable conditions of the environment.","['Shbat A', 'Beránek M', 'Seifert Z', 'Kratzer J', 'Musil S', 'Klepáček I']",2021,,,Anthropol Anz,"Shbat A, et al.

33304252,"Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data, Mechanisms, and Current Importance.","Stuttering is one of the most well-known speech disorders, but the underlying neurological mechanisms are debated. In addition to genetic factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early 1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid 1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third, there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with genetic predisposition.",['Alm PA'],2020,14,,Front Hum Neurosci,"Alm PA.

33150393,Impact of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on the Incidence of Respiratory Infections During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in Korea: A Nationwide Surveillance Study.,"BACKGROUND: Many countries have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to determine whether NPIs led to the decline in the incidences of respiratory infections.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, ecological study using a nationwide notifiable diseases database and a respiratory virus sample surveillance collected from January 2016 through July 2020 in the Republic of Korea. Intervention period was defined as February-July 2020, when the government implemented NPIs nationwide. Observed incidences in the intervention period were compared with the predicted incidences by an autoregressive integrated moving average model and the 4-year mean cumulative incidences (CuIs) in the same months of the preintervention period.
RESULTS: Five infectious diseases met the inclusion criteria: chickenpox, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, and pertussis. The incidences of chickenpox and mumps during the intervention period were significantly lower than the prediction model. The CuIs (95% confidence interval) of chickenpox and mumps were 36.4% (23.9-76.3%) and 63.4% (48.0-93.3%) of the predicted values. Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in the incidence was universal for chickenpox, while mumps showed a marginal reduction among those aged <18 years, but not in adults. The incidence of respiratory viruses was significantly lower than both the predicted incidence (19.5%; 95% confidence interval, 11.8-55.4%) and the 4-year mean CuIs in the preintervention period (24.5%; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of NPIs was associated with a significant reduction in the incidences of several respiratory infections in Korea.","['Huh K', 'Jung J', 'Hong J', 'Kim M', 'Ahn JG', 'Kim JH', 'Kang JM']",2021,72,7,Clin Infect Dis,"Huh K, et al.

Nowadays, due to effective antibacterial treatment, severe complicated cases of scarlet fever are occasionally rare. Because of immunity particularities, patients with Down syndrome are predisposed to bacterial respiratory diseases (and scarlet fever among them), that usually have prolonged complicated course.
CASE REPORT: A clinical case of scarlet fever in a patient with Down syndrome was analyzed. The disease had a severe course with a specific skin syndrome and was complicated by pneumonia. Hospitalization and adequate treatment of the patient led to his complete recovery despite late initiation of antibacterial medicine.
DISCUSSION: A long severe complicated course of the disease in the presented case was caused by combination of the late initiation of antibacterial treatment and the patient's personal particularities of reactivity.

33026621,"Use of meteorological parameters for forecasting scarlet fever morbidity in Tianjin, Northern China.","The scarlet fever incidence has increased drastically in recent years in China. However, the long-term relationship between climate variation and scarlet fever remains contradictory, and an early detection system is lacking. In this study, we aim to explore the potential long-term effects of variations in monthly climatic parameters on scarlet fever and to develop an early scarlet-fever detection tool. Data comprising monthly scarlet fever cases and monthly average climatic variables from 2004 to 2017 were retrieved from the Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System and National Meteorological Science Center, respectively. We used a negative binomial multivariable regression to assess the long-term impacts of weather parameters on scarlet fever and then built a novel forecasting technique by integrating an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method with a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) based on the significant meteorological drivers. Scarlet fever was a seasonal disease that predominantly peaked in spring and winter. The regression results indicated that a 1 °C increment in the monthly average temperature and a 1-h increment in the monthly aggregate sunshine hours were associated with 17.578% (95% CI 7.674 to 28.393%) and 0.529% (95% CI 0.035 to 1.025%) increases in scarlet fever cases, respectively; a 1-hPa increase in the average atmospheric pressure at a 1-month lag was associated with 12.996% (95% CI 9.972 to 15.919%) decrements in scarlet fever cases. Based on the model evaluation criteria, the best-performing basic and combined approaches were ARDL(1,0,0,1) and ARDL(1,0,0,1)-NARNN(5, 22), respectively, and this hybrid approach comprised smaller performance measures in both the training and testing stages than those of the basic model. Climate variability has a significant long-term influence on scarlet fever. The ARDL-NARNN technique with the incorporation of meteorological drivers can be used to forecast the future epidemic trends of scarlet fever.

The capacity of North-East Asian serotype M12 (emm12) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) to cause scarlet fever has been linked epidemiologically to the presence of novel prophages, including prophage ΦHKU.vir encoding the secreted superantigens SSA and SpeC and the DNase Spd1. Here, we report the molecular characterization of ΦHKU.vir-encoded exotoxins. We demonstrate that streptolysin O (SLO)-induced glutathione efflux from host cellular stores is a previously unappreciated GAS virulence mechanism that promotes SSA release and activity, representing the first description of a thiol-activated bacterial superantigen. Spd1 is required for resistance to neutrophil killing. Investigating single, double and triple isogenic knockout mutants of the ΦHKU.vir-encoded exotoxins, we find that SpeC and Spd1 act synergistically to facilitate nasopharyngeal colonization in a mouse model. These results offer insight into the pathogenesis of scarlet fever-causing GAS mediated by prophage ΦHKU.vir exotoxins.","['Brouwer S', 'Barnett TC', 'Ly D', 'Kasper KJ', 'De Oliveira DMP', 'Rivera-Hernandez T', 'Cork AJ', 'McIntyre L', 'Jespersen MG', 'Richter J', 'Schulz BL', 'Dougan G', 'Nizet V', 'Yuen KY', 'You Y', 'McCormick JK', 'Sanderson-Smith ML', 'Davies MR', 'Walker MJ']",2020,11,1,Nat Commun,"Brouwer S, et al.

Surveillance of resistance and emm type has important implication to provide helpful information on the changing GAS epidemiology and empirical treatment.
METHODS: To study the emergence of resistant GAS in children with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), a retrospective study was conducted from 2000 to 2019 in southern Taiwan. Microbiological studies, including antibiotic susceptibility, were performed. GAS emm types and sequences were determined by molecular methods. The population was divided into two separate decades to analyze potential changes over time. The 1st decade was 2000-2009; the 2nd decade was 2010-2019. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with macrolide resistance between these periods.
RESULTS: A total of 320 GAS from 339 children were enrolled. Most of the children (75%) were under 9 years of age. The most common diagnosis was scarlet fever (225, 66.4%), and the frequency increased from 54.8% in the 1st to 77.9% in the 2nd decade (p < 0.0001). There was a significant increase in resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin from 18.1%, 19.3% in the 1st to 58.4%, 61.0% in the 2nd decade (p < 0.0001). This was associated with clonal expansion of the GAS emm12-ST36 which carrying erm(B) and tet(M) from 3.0% in the 1st to 53.2% in the 2nd decade (p < 0.0001).

32870979,Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and Military Hygiene at the United States Military Academy between 1890 and 1910.,"INTRODUCTION: Military installations are at increased risk for the transmission of infectious disease. Personnel who live and train on military installations live and train near one another facilitating disease transmission. An understanding of historical sanitation and hygiene can inform modern practices. This is especially pertinent considering the continuing rise of variants of infectious diseases, such as the recent pandemic of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this article, we review the rise and decline of infectious disease at the United States Military Academy (USMA) during the period spanning 1890 through 1910, and the public health interventions used to combat disease spread.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data regarding cadet illness were acquired from the historical archives of the USMA. These included annual reports, clinical admission records, casualty ledgers, and sanitation reports. Unpublished documents from the medical history of USMA provide periodic trends of health among cadets because of infectious disease.
RESULTS: Between 1890 and 1910, the USMA at West Point was confronted with cases of influenza, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, smallpox, typhus, and malaria. In response, a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were instituted to curb the spread of infectious disease. These interventions most likely proved effective in suppressing the transmission of communicable diseases. The most common and arguably the most effective NPI was the physical separation of the sick from the well.
CONCLUSIONS: The USMA experience mirrored what was occurring in the larger U.S. Army in the early 20th century and may serve as a model for the application of NPIs in response to modern infectious diseases resulting from novel or unknown etiologies.","['Eslinger M', 'Washington MA', 'Pekny C', 'Nepa N', 'Wickiser JK', 'Limbocker RA', 'Shanks GD']",2020,185,11-12,Mil Med,"Eslinger M, et al.

Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is the first online program in child care centers to report pediatric exanthema.
METHODS: MCRISP aggregated daily counts of children sick, absent, or reported ill by parents. We extracted all MCRISP exanthema cases from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019. Cases were assessed with descriptive statistics and counts were used to construct epidemic curves.
RESULTS: 360 exanthema cases were reported from 12,233 illnesses over 4.5 seasons. Children ages 13-35 months had the highest rash occurrence (45%, n = 162), followed by 36-59 months (41.7%, n = 150), 0-12 months (12.5%, n = 45), and kindergarten (0.8%, n = 3).

METHODS: From 2016 to 2017, pharyngeal swab samples were collected from the outpatients in Children's Hospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, who were diagnosed with scarlet fever. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed according to the distribution of conventional antibiotics and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. The distribution of the macrolide-resistance genes (ermB, ermA, mefA), emm (M protein-coding gene) typing, and superantigens (SAg) gene profiling were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 297 GAS isolates were collected. The susceptibility of the isolates to penicillin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin was 100%. The resistance rate to erythromycin and clindamycin was 98.3 and 96.6%, respectively. The dominant emm types were emm12 (65.32%), emm1 (27.61%), emm75 (2.69%), and emm89 (1.35%). Of the 297 isolates, 290 (97.64%) carried the ermB gene, and 5 (1.68%) carried the mefA gene, while none carried the ermA gene. The most common superantigen genes identified from GAS isolates were smeZ (96.97%), speC (92.59%), speG (91.58%), ssa (85.52%), speI (54.55%), speH (52.19%), and speA (34.34%). Isolates with the genotype emm1 possessed speA, speC, speG, speJ, speM, ssa, and smeZ, while emm12 possessed speC, speG, speH, speI, speM, ssa, and smeZ superantigens.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalent strain of GAS isolates in Beijing has a high resistance rate to macrolides; however, penicillin can still be the preferred antibiotic for treatment. Erythromycin resistance was predominantly mediated by ermB. The common emm types were emm12 and emm1. There was a correlation between emm and the superantigen gene. Thus, long-term monitoring and investigation of the emm types and superantigen genes of GAS prevalence are imperative.","['Li H', 'Zhou L', 'Zhao Y', 'Ma L', 'Liu X', 'Hu J']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Li H, et al.

32592562,Paediatrics in Theresienstadt ghetto.,"The main objective of this study is to describe the most common childhood diseases occurring in the Theresienstadt ghetto during the Second World War as well as applied anti-epidemic measures. A partial objective is to describe medical and nursing care of sick child prisoners. The data was obtained by the method of synthesis of primary and secondary data with the highest importance after adequate external source criticism using selected monographs, memoirs, survivor diaries, Orders of the day by the Council of the Elders and Reports of the Jewish self-government of the Theresienstadt ghetto from 1941 to 1945, the Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague, the Ghetto Museum, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Post Bellum online electronic collection of oral historical interviews, and witness accounts. The validity of the presented conclusions is ensured by comparing data from several sources. The most common infections in Theresienstadt children were enteritis, scarlet fever, infectious jaundice, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, black cough, pneumonia, otitis media, and typhoid fever. Most of these infections had entirely atypical symptomatology or complications. Children were hospitalized in children's hospitals, in children's rooms of hospitals for adults and infirmaries in children's homes. Albeit diagnostic methods had a high standard, options of treatment were very limited. The most common treatments included bed rest, diet and cold compress. Occasionally, chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. a sulphonamide drug Prontosil) and Aspirin were available. The anti-epidemic measures in the ghetto focused on hygiene, enhancing children's immunity, vaccination and pest control.","['Horáčková K', 'Ševčovičová A', 'Hrstka Z', 'Wichsová J', 'Zaviš M']",2020,28,2,Cent Eur J Public Health,"Horáčková K, et al.

32562850,"Increase of emm1 isolates among group A Streptococcus strains causing scarlet fever in Shanghai, China.","OBJECTIVE: Scarlet fever epidemics caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) have been ongoing in China since 2011. However, limited data are available on the dynamic molecular characterizations of the epidemic strains.
METHOD: Epidemiological data of scarlet fever in Shanghai were obtained from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. Throat swabs of patients with scarlet fever and asymptomatic school-age children were cultured. Illumina sequencing was performed on 39emm1 isolates.
RESULTS: The annual incidence of scarlet fever was 7.5-19.4/100,000 persons in Shanghai during 2011-2015, with an average GAS carriage rate being 7.6% in school-age children. The proportion ofemm1 GAS strains increased from 3.8% in 2011 to 48.6% in 2014; they harbored a superantigen profile similar to emm12 isolates, except for the speA gene. Two predominant clones, SH001-emm12, and SH002-emm1, circulated in 66.9% of scarlet fever cases and 44.8% of carriers. Genomic analysis showed emm1 isolates throughout China constituted distinct clades, enriched by the presence of mobile genetic elements carrying the multidrug-resistant determinants ermB and tetM and virulence genes speA, speC, and spd1.
CONCLUSION: A significant increase in the proportion ofemm1 strains occurred in the GAS population, causing scarlet fever in China. Ongoing surveillance is warranted to monitor the dynamic changes of GAS clones.","['Chen M', 'Cai J', 'Davies MR', 'Li Y', 'Zhang C', 'Yao W', 'Kong D', 'Pan H', 'Zhang X', 'Zeng M', 'Chen M']",2020,98,,Int J Infect Dis,"Chen M, et al.

In New Zealand, ARF cases occur more frequently among persons of certain ethnic and socioeconomic groups. We compared GAS pharyngitis estimates (1,257,058 throat swab samples) with ARF incidence (792 hospitalizations) in Auckland during 2010-2016. Among children 5-14 years of age in primary healthcare clinics, GAS pharyngitis was detected in similar proportions across ethnic groups (≈19%). Relative risk for GAS pharyngitis was moderately elevated among children of Pacific Islander and Māori ethnicities compared with those of European/other ethnicities, but risk for ARF was highly elevated for children of Pacific Islander and Māori ethnicity compared with those of European/other ethnicity. That ethnic disparities are much higher among children with ARF than among those with GAS pharyngitis implies that ARF is driven by factors other than rate of GAS pharyngitis alone.","['Oliver J', 'Upton A', 'Jack SJ', 'Pierse N', 'Williamson DA', 'Baker MG']",2020,26,6,Emerg Infect Dis,"Oliver J, et al.

32383412,Two females with coronary artery occlusion caused by presumed Kawasaki disease would have delivered without recognition of ischaemic heart disease.,"We report two females with coronary artery occlusion caused by presumed Kawasaki disease that delivered children without any special treatment. After a 58-year-old female had ventricular tachycardia, a giant coronary artery aneurysm with calcification at the bifurcation of the left coronary artery and segmental stenosis of the right coronary artery were pointed out by CT angiography. She had an episode of sepsis when 3 years old. Further, she remembered chest pain during sleep after that episode. She had delivered twice without any complication during her 20s. Her diagnosis was undiagnosed coronary artery lesions caused by presumed Kawasaki disease and a previous myocardial infarction, and she underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. The other 48-year-old female was accidentally discovered to have coronary artery calcification on CT, while experiencing pneumonia. Her CT angiograms revealed a right coronary artery occlusion and coronary artery calcification at segments 1, 6, and 11. She had a history of ""scarlet fever"" before 12 months. Premature ventricular contractions were detected, while delivering her first child when 31 years old. However, she was not diagnosed as ischaemic heart disease and delivered twice by a vaginal delivery without any complication. Current guidelines recommend systemic anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapy for all patients with giant aneurysms resulting from Kawasaki disease in childhood.

32241761,Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017.,"OBJECTIVES: To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province.
DESIGN: National surveillance studies, 2008-17.
SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China.
PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","['Dong Y', 'Wang L', 'Burgner DP', 'Miller JE', 'Song Y', 'Ren X', 'Li Z', 'Xing Y', 'Ma J', 'Sawyer SM', 'Patton GC']",2020,369,,BMJ,"Dong Y, et al.

In recent years, the incidence of scarlet fever is increasing. Previous studies on the spatial distribution of scarlet fever in China are mainly focused at the provincial and municipal levels, and there is few systematic report on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of scarlet fever on the national level. Based on the incidence information of scarlet fever in mainland China between 2004 and 2017 collected from the China Center for Disease Control, this paper systematically explored the Spatio-temporal distribution of scarlet fever by three methods, contains spatial autocorrelation analysis, Spatio-temporal scanning analysis, and trend surface analysis. The results demonstrate that the incidence of scarlet fever varies by seasons, which is in line with double-peak distribution.The first peak generally occurs from May to June and the second one from November to December, while February and August is the lowest period of incidence. Trend surface analysis indicates that the incidence of scarlet fever in northern China is higher than the south, slightly higher in western compared to the east, and lower in the central part. Additionally, the results show that the clustering regions of scarlet fever centrally distributed in the northeast, northwest, north china and some provinces in the east, such as Zhejiang, Shanghai, Shandong, and Jiangsu.","['Li WT', 'Feng RH', 'Li T', 'Du YB', 'Zhou N', 'Hong XQ', 'Yi SH', 'Zha WT', 'Lv Y']",2020,15,1,Geospat Health,"Li WT, et al.

In addition to descriptive epidemiology analysis, seasonality and spatial autocorrelation analysis were also applied to explore the epidemiologic trends and spatial changing patterns of the five RIDs, respectively. The results indicated that the incidence of tuberculosis, measles, and mumps presented a downtrend trend, while those of scarlet fever and influenza was in a strong uptrend across the research period. The incidences of the five diseases all peaked in spring. There were significant spatial disparities in the distribution of tuberculosis, scarlet fever, and measles cases, with the hotspots mainly located in the western plateau region, northern plain region, and southern mountainous region. To conclude, notable epidemiological differences were observed across regions, indicating that some provincial units should pay more attention to prevent and control respiratory infectious diseases.","['Mao Y', 'He R', 'Zhu B', 'Liu J', 'Zhang N']",2020,17,7,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Mao Y, et al.

32062906,[Dramatic achievements in infectious disease prevention and treatment in China during the past 70 years].,"At the beginning of the founding of People's Republic of China, infectious diseases, such as smallpox, plague, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, meningitis, mumps, schistosomiasis, Kala Azar, hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis, encephalitis B, typhus, malaria, Kala Azar, leprosy, scarlet fever and pinkeye, remained as epidemic in the country and endangered people's health. During the past 70 years, the Chinese government spent huge efforts in infectious disease prevention and treatment by promulgating and implementing series of relative policies, laws and strategies, and also encouraged all Chinese people to participate in. The achievements of these efforts in controlling infectious disease epidemic were extremely successful. Today, the outbreaks and epidemic of infectious diseases in China were rarely happened with the rapid decreases in incidence and mortality rates of all notifiable infectious diseases. Smallpox was eradicated, and polio, filariasis, leprosy and neonatal tetanus were nearly eradicated. In addition, the incidence rates of vaccine-preventable diseases, i.e. measles, diphtheria, pertussis, meningitis, encephalitis B, hepatitis A, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, were dramatically decreased and remained at relatively low levels for years.

32017453,"Bacterial, viral, and fungal infection-related risk of Parkinson's disease: Meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies.","AIMS: Recent studies showed that patients with various bacterial, viral, and fungal infections might be at increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the risk of PD in patients with each specific infection varied. This meta-analysis estimated the association between various infections and PD risk.
METHODS: Literature published from January 1965 to October 2019 in PubMed and EMBASE databases was searched. Data were extracted and pooled using random/fixed effects model. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were also performed to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated by the trim and fill.
RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 6,609 studies were included. Helicobacter pylori (HP; pooled OR = 1.653, 1.426-1.915, p < .001), hepatitis C virus (HCV; pooled OR = 1.195, 1.012-1.410, p = .035), Malassezia (pooled OR = 1.694, 1.367-2.100, p < .001), and pneumoniae (pooled OR = 1.595, 1.020-2.493, p = .041) infection were associated with increased PD risk. Influenza virus, herpes virus, hepatitis B virus, scarlet fever, mumps virus, chicken pox, pertussis, German measles, and measles were not associated with PD risk. After antiviral treatment against HCV reduced the risk of PD in patients with HCV infection (OR = 0.672, 0.571-0.791, p < .001). Significant heterogeneity exists among the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Patients with infection of HP, HCV, Malassezia, pneumoniae might be an increased risk of PD. Antiviral treatment of HCV could reduce the risk of PD.","['Wang H', 'Liu X', 'Tan C', 'Zhou W', 'Jiang J', 'Peng W', 'Zhou X', 'Mo L', 'Chen L']",2020,10,3,Brain Behav,"Wang H, et al.

31972290,Prevalence of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal throat carriage and prospective pilot surveillance of streptococcal sore throat in Ugandan school children.,"OBJECTIVES: Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, is responsible for an annual 600 million cases of acute pharyngitis globally, with 92% of those infections occurring in low-resource settings. Further knowledge of the acute streptococcal pharyngitis burden in low-resource settings is essential if serious post-streptococcal complications - rheumatic fever (RF) and its long-term sequel rheumatic heart disease (RHD) - are to be prevented.
METHODS: Two studies were conducted in school-aged children (5-16 years): a cross-sectional study of streptococcal pharyngeal carriage followed by a prospective cohort study of streptococcal sore throat over 4 weeks from March to April 2017.
RESULTS: The cross-sectional study revealed an overall prevalence of GAS carriage of 15.9% (79/496, 95% confidence interval 12.8-19.5%). Among 532 children enrolled in the prospective cohort study, 358 (67%) reported 528 sore throats, with 221 (41.1%) experiencing at least one GAS-positive sore throat. The overall GAS-positive rate for sore throat was 41.8% (221/528).
CONCLUSIONS: The GAS pharyngeal carriage rates seen in Uganda (15.9%, 95% confidence interval 12.8-19.5%) are higher than the most recent pooled results globally, at 12% (range 6-28%). Additionally, pilot data suggest a substantially higher percentage of sore throat that was GAS-positive (41.8%) compared to pooled global rates when active recruitment is employed.","['DeWyer A', 'Scheel A', 'Webel AR', 'Longenecker CT', 'Kamarembo J', 'Aliku T', 'Engel ME', 'Bowen AC', 'Bwanga F', 'Hovis I', 'Chang A', 'Sarnacki R', 'Sable C', 'Dale JB', 'Carapetis J', 'Rwebembera J', 'Okello E', 'Beaton A']",2020,93,,Int J Infect Dis,"DeWyer A, et al.

31864293,"Epidemiological study of scarlet fever in Shenyang, China.","BACKGROUND: Since 2011, there has been an increase in the incidence of scarlet fever across China. The main objective of this study was to depict the spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of the incidence of scarlet fever in Shenyang, China, in 2018 so as to provide the scientific basis for effective strategies of scarlet control and prevention.
METHODS: Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the month level and ArcGIS10.3 was used to demonstrate the spatial distribution at the district/county level. Moran's autocorrelation coefficient was used to examine the spatial autocorrelation and the Getis-Ord statistic was used to determine the hot-spot areas of scarlet fever.
RESULTS: A total of 2314 scarlet fever cases were reported in Shenyang in 2018 with an annual incidence of 31.24 per 100,000. The incidence among males was higher than that among females(p<0.001). A vast majority of the cases (96.89%) were among children aged 3 to 11 years. The highest incidence was 625.34/100,000 in children aged 5-9 years. In 2018 there were two seasonal peaks of scarlet fever in June (summer-peak) and December (winter-peak). The incidence of scarlet fever in urban areas was significantly higher than that in rural areas(p<0.001). The incidence of scarlet fever was randomly distributed in Shenyang. There are hotspot areas located in seven districts.
CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas are the hot spots of scarlet fever and joint prevention and control measures between districts should be applied. Children aged 3-11 are the main source of scarlet fever and therefore the introduction of prevention and control into kindergarten and primary schools may be key to the control of scarlet fever epidemics.","['Chen H', 'Chen Y', 'Sun B', 'Wen L', 'An X']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Chen H, et al.

31758439,"Long-term, single-center surveillance of non-invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, emm types and emm clusters.","Group A streptococci (GAS) are among the most frequent pathogens in children. Many epidemiological studies focus on specific GAS infections (such as tonsillopharyngitis or invasive disease), on GAS carriers or on post-streptococcal sequelae. By comparison, reports on regional GAS characteristics, particularly circulating non-invasive GAS in Europe, are rare. In a monocentric study, all GAS isolated from pediatric patients at a tertiary care hospital over a 6-year period (2006-2012) were characterized. GAS emm types and clusters were determined. Associated patient data were analyzed. Five hundred sixty-six GAS strains were collected. GAS tonsillopharyngitis was most common (71.6%), followed by pyoderma (6.0%), otitis media (3.7%), perineal dermatitis (3.4%), and invasive infections (1.4%). Colonizing strains represented 13.6% of GAS. GAS emm12 was most prevalent among invasive and non-invasive isolates. Emm1, emm4, emm28, and emm89 were the most frequent non-invasive GAS strains. The emm E4 cluster was most common, followed by the A-C4, A-C3, and E1. Among the GAS infections, different emm types and clusters were identified, e.g., emm4 was more common among patients with scarlet fever. Three new emm subtypes were characterized: emm29.13, emm36.7, and emm75.5. This comprehensive review of a large, local GAS cohort points to the differences between and similarities among GAS genotypes and disease manifestations, while minimizing regional variations. Considerable deviation from previous epidemiological findings is described, especially regarding the frequent detection of emm1 and emm89 in non-invasive GAS infections.

Severe infections as a result of these two streptococci are albeit uncommon but associated with high mortality and morbidity, and often necessitate intensive care support. This paper aims to review the mortality and morbidity of severe infection associated with GAS and GBS isolations at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).
METHODS: All children admitted to PICU of a teaching hospital between October 2002 and May 2018 with laboratory-proven GAS and GBS isolations were included.
RESULTS: There were 19 patients (0.7% PICU admissions) with streptococcal isolations (GAS, n=11 and GBS, n=8). Comparing to GAS, GBS affected infants were younger (median age 0.13 versus 5.47 years, 95% CI, 1.7-8.5, p=0.0003), and cerebrospinal fluids more likely positive (p = 0.0181). All GAS and GBS were sensitive to penicillin (CLSI: MICs 0.06 - 2.0 μg/mL), with the majority of GAS sensitive to clindamycin and erythromycin, and half of the GBS resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. Co-infections were prevalent, but viruses were only isolated with GAS (p=0.024). Isolation of GAS and GBS was associated with nearly 40% mortality and high rates of mechanical ventilation and inotropic supports. All non-survivors had high mortality (PIM2) and sepsis scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe GAS and GBS are rare but associated with high mortality and rates of mechanical ventilation and inotropic supports in PICU. The streptococci are invariably sensitive to penicillin. The high PIM2 and Sepsis scores suggest that prompt recognition of sepsis and the timely judicious institution of antibiotics and intensive care support may be life-saving for these devastating infections.","['Hon KL', 'Chow TC', 'Cheung TS', 'Lam WT', 'Hung LT', 'So KW', 'Margaret IP', 'Qian SY']",2020,15,2,Curr Clin Pharmacol,"Hon KL, et al.

31519541,Emergence of dominant toxigenic M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes clone during increased scarlet fever activity in England: a population-based molecular epidemiological study.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events.
METHODS: We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014-16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009-16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses.
FINDINGS: Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0·0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0·0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p<0·0001).

31516307,Acute rheumatic fever diagnosis and management: Review of the global implications of the new revised diagnostic criteria with a focus on Saudi Arabia.,"Rheumatic fever (RF) is a common cause of acquired heart disease in children worldwide. It is a delayed, nonsuppurative, autoimmune phenomenon following pharyngitis, impetigo, or scarlet fever caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection. RF diagnosis is clinical and based on revised Jones criteria. The first version of the criteria was developed by T. Duckett Jones in 1944, then subsequently revised by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1992 and 2015. However, RF remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because of the lack of specific clinical or laboratory findings. As a result, it has been difficult for some time to maintain a balance between over- and underdiagnosis of RF cases. The Jones criteria were revised in 2015 by the AHA, and the main modifications were as follows: the population was subdivided into moderate- to high-risk and low risk; the concept of subclinical carditis was introduced; and monoarthritis was included as a feature of musculoskeletal inflammation in the moderate- to high-risk population. This review will highlight the major changes in the AHA 2015 revised Jones criteria for pediatricians and general practitioners.","['Alqanatish J', 'Alfadhel A', 'Albelali A', 'Alqahtani D']",2019,31,4,J Saudi Heart Assoc,"Alqanatish J, et al.

31217476,Complementing conventional infectious disease surveillance with national health insurance claims data in the Republic of Korea.,"Surveillance remains an important tool for timely outbreak detection and response. Many countries, including Korea, have established national infectious disease surveillance systems with clinical notification. We aimed to evaluate the National Health Insurance Claims-based Surveillance (NHICS) compared to conventional passive report-based National Infectious Diseases Surveillance (NIDS). Reported to claimed cases ratios (R/C ratio) were evaluated from monthly notifiable disease cases captured by NIDS and NHICS. The relationships between 26 infectious diseases and each surveillance system were analysed using Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression. There was an overall increase in R/C ratio from 2010-2017 (0.37 to 0.78). In 22 infectious diseases, there was a correlation between NIDS and NHICS. Moreover, claim-based surveillance showed less fluctuating disease incidence rates than report-based surveillance for specific infectious diseases, such as varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever. However, for infectious diseases with episodic outbreaks or low incidence, it was difficult to assess NHICS usefulness. Claim-based surveillance is less affected by limitations of conventional report-based surveillance systems, such as reporting rate.

31163954,"Incidence of Scarlet Fever in Children in Jeju Province, Korea, 2002-2016: An Age-period-cohort Analysis.","OBJECTIVES: Outbreaks of scarlet fever in Mexico in 1999, Hong Kong and mainland China in 2011, and England in 2014-2016 have received global attention, and the number of notified cases in Korean children, including in Jeju Province, has also increased since 2010. To identify relevant hypotheses regarding this emerging outbreak, an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of scarlet fever incidence was conducted among children in Jeju Province, Korea.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from the nationwide insurance claims database administered by the Korean National Health Insurance Service. The inclusion criteria were children aged ≤14 years residing in Jeju Province, Korea who received any form of healthcare for scarlet fever from 2002 to 2016. The age and year variables were categorized into 5 groups, respectively. After calculating the crude incidence rate (CIR) for age and calendar year groups, the intrinsic estimator (IE) method was applied to conduct the APC analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 2345 cases were identified from 2002 to 2016. Scarlet fever was most common in the 0-2 age group, and boys presented more cases than girls. Since the CIR decreased with age between 2002 and 2016, the age and period effect decreased in all observed years. The IE coefficients suggesting a cohort effect shifted from negative to positive in 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the recent outbreak of scarlet fever among children in Jeju Province might be explained through the cohort effect. As children born after 2009 showed a higher risk of scarlet fever, further descriptive epidemiological studies are needed.","['Kim J', 'Kim JE', 'Bae JM']",2019,52,3,J Prev Med Public Health,"Kim J, et al.

30990838,Detecting spatio-temporal hotspots of scarlet fever in Taiwan with spatio-temporal Gi* statistic.,"A resurgence of scarlet fever has caused many pediatric infections in East Asia and the United Kingdom. Although scarlet fever in Taiwan has not been a notifiable infectious disease since 2007, the comprehensive national health insurance data can still track its trend. Here, we used data from the open data portal of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The scarlet fever trend was measured by outpatient and hospitalization rates from 2009 to 2017. In order to elucidate the spatio-temporal hotspots, we developed a new method named the spatio-temporal Gi* statistic, and applied Joinpoint regression to compute the annual percentage change (APC). The overall APCs in outpatient and hospitalization were 15.1% (95% CI: 10.3%-20.2%) and 7.7% (95%CI: 4.5% -10.9%). The major two infected groups were children aged 5-9 (outpatient: 0.138 scarlet fever diagnoses per 1,000 visits; inpatient: 2.579 per 1,000 visits) and aged 3-4 (outpatient: 0.084 per 1,000 visits; inpatient: 1.469 per 1,000 visits). We found the counties in eastern Taiwan and offshore counties had the most hotspots in the outpatient setting. In terms of hospitalization, the hotspots mostly occurred in offshore counties close to China. With the help of the spatio-temporal statistic, health workers can set up enhanced laboratory surveillance in those hotspots.","['Tang JH', 'Tseng TJ', 'Chan TC']",2019,14,4,PLoS One,"Tang JH, et al.

30961604,A step beyond the hygiene hypothesis-immune-mediated classes determined in a population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidity patterns of childhood infections, atopic diseases, and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are related to immune system programming conditions. The aim of this study was to make a step beyond the hygiene hypothesis and to comprehensively classify these patterns with latent class analysis (LCA). A second aim was to characterize the classes by associations with immunological, clinical, and sociodemographic variables.
METHODS: LCA was applied to data from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study (N = 4874, age range 35-82 years) separately for men and women. It was based on survey information on chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex, pertussis, scarlet fever, hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug allergy, interparental violence, parental maltreatment, and trauma in early childhood. Subsequently, we examined how immune-mediated classes were reflected in leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, hsCRP), chronic inflammatory diseases, and mental disorders, and how they differed across social classes and birth cohorts.
RESULTS: LCA results with five classes were selected for further analysis. Latent classes were similar in both sexes and were labeled according to their associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed (comprising infectious and atopic diseases), and ACE class. They came across with specific differences in biomarker levels. Mental disorders typically displayed increased lifetime prevalence rates in the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes, and decreased rates in the resilient class. The same patterns were apparent in chronic inflammatory diseases, except that the ACE class was relevant specifically in women but not in men.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically determine immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life. They display characteristic associations with biomarker levels and somatic and psychiatric diseases occurring later in life. Moreover, they show different distributions across social classes and allow to better understand the mechanisms beyond the changes in the prevalence of chronic somatic and psychiatric diseases.","['Ajdacic-Gross V', 'Mutsch M', 'Rodgers S', 'Tesic A', 'Müller M', 'Seifritz E', 'Wagner EN', 'von Känel R', 'Landolt MA', 'Steinemann N', 'von Wyl V', 'Castelao E', 'Strippoli MF', 'Glaus J', 'Vandeleur C', 'Marques-Vidal PM', 'Vollenweider P', 'Preisig M']",2019,17,1,BMC Med,"Ajdacic-Gross V, et al.

S. pyogenes is an exclusively human pathogen. As the leucocyte profile of tonsil is unique, the impact of SpeA production on human tonsil cell function was investigated. Human tonsil cells from routine tonsillectomy were co-incubated with purified streptococcal superantigens or culture supernatants from isogenic streptococcal isolates, differing only in superantigen production. Tonsil cell proliferation was quantified by tritiated thymidine incorporation, and cell surface characteristics assessed by flow cytometry. Soluble mediators including immunoglobulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tonsil T cells proliferated in response to SpeA and demonstrated typical release of proinflammatory cytokines. When cultured in the absence of superantigen, tonsil preparations released large quantities of immunoglobulin over 7 days. In contrast, marked B cell apoptosis and abrogation of total immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM, and IgG production occurred in the presence of SpeA and other superantigens. In SpeA-stimulated cultures, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells showed a reduction in C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)5 (CD185) expression, but up-regulation of OX40 (CD134) and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) (CD278) expression. The phenotypical change in the Tfh population was associated with impaired chemotactic response to CXCL13. SpeA and other superantigens cause dysregulated tonsil immune function, driving T cells from Tfh to a proliferating phenotype, with resultant loss of B cells and immunoglobulin production, providing superantigen-producing bacteria with a probable survival advantage.","['Davies FJ', 'Olme C', 'Lynskey NN', 'Turner CE', 'Sriskandan S']",2019,197,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Davies FJ, et al.

30814052,Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the duration of prescriptions for antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care and to compare this with guideline recommendations.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: General practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, 2013-15.
PARTICIPANTS: 931 015 consultations that resulted in an antibiotic prescription for one of several indications: acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions with a duration exceeding the guideline recommendation and the total number of days beyond the recommended duration for each indication.
RESULTS: The most common reasons for antibiotics being prescribed were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), and acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%). Antibiotic treatments for upper respiratory tract indications and acute cough and bronchitis accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations. Notable exceptions were acute sinusitis, where only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions exceeded seven days and acute sore throat where only 2.1% (2.0% to 2.1%) exceeded 10 days (recent guidance recommends five days). More than half of the antibiotic prescriptions were for longer than guidelines recommend for acute cystitis among females (54.6%, 54.1% to 55.0%). The percentage of antibiotic prescriptions exceeding the recommended duration was lower for most non-respiratory infections. For the 931 015 included consultations resulting in antibiotic prescriptions, about 1.3 million days were beyond the durations recommended by guidelines.
CONCLUSION: For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. Substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure can be accomplished by aligning antibiotic prescription durations with guidelines.","['Pouwels KB', 'Hopkins S', 'Llewelyn MJ', 'Walker AS', 'McNulty CA', 'Robotham JV']",2019,364,,BMJ,"Pouwels KB, et al.

30711589,"Effect of meteorological factors on scarlet fever incidence in Guangzhou City, Southern China, 2006-2017.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between meteorological factors and scarlet fever incidence from 2006 to 2017 in Guangzhou, the largest subtropical city of Southern China, and assist public health prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Data for weekly scarlet fever incidence and meteorological variables from 2006 to 2017 in Guangzhou were collected from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS) and the Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau (GZMB). Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were conducted to estimate the effect of meteorological factors on weekly scarlet fever incidence in Guangzhou.
RESULTS: We observed nonlinear effects of temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity. The risk was the highest when the weekly mean temperature was 31 °C during lag week 14, yielding a relative risk (RR) of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.01-2.17). When relative humidity was 43.5% during lag week 0, the RR was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.04-2.12); the highest RR (1.55, 95% CI: 1.20-1.99) was reached when relative humidity was 93.5% during lag week 20. When wind velocity was 4.4 m/s during lag week 13, the RR was highest at 3.41 (95% CI: 1.57-7.44). Positive correlations were observed among weekly temperature ranges and atmospheric pressure with scarlet fever incidence, while a negative correlation was detected with aggregate rainfall. The cumulative extreme effect of meteorological variables on scarlet fever incidence was statistically significant, except for the high effect of wind velocity.
CONCLUSION: Weekly mean temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity had double-trough effects on scarlet fever incidence; high weekly temperature range, high atmospheric pressure, and low aggregate rainfall were risk factors for scarlet fever morbidity. Our findings provided preliminary, but fundamental, information that may be useful for a better understanding of epidemic trends of scarlet fever and for developing an early warning system.

30691408,Phylogenetic relationship of prophages is affected by CRISPR selection in Group A Streptococcus.,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a major human pathogen, which is associated with a wide spectrum of invasive diseases, such as pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). It is hypothesized that differences in GAS pathogenicity are related to the acquisition of diverse bacteriophages (phages). Nevertheless, the GAS genome also harbors clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes, which play an important role in eliminating foreign DNA, including those of phages. However, the structure of prophages in GAS strains is mosaic, and the phylogenetic relationship between prophages and CRISPR is not clear. In this study, we analyzed CRISPR and prophage structure using 118 complete genome sequences of GAS strains to elucidate the relationship between two genomic elements. Additionally, phylogenetic and M-type analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 118 GAS strains, 80 harbored type I-C and/or II-A CRISPR/cas loci. A total of 553 spacer sequences were identified from CRISPR/cas loci and sorted into 229 patterns. We identified and classified 373 prophages into 14 groups. Some prophage groups shared a common integration site, and were related to M-type. We further investigated the correlation between spacer sequences and prophages. Of the 229 spacer sequence patterns, 203 were similar to that of other GAS prophages. No spacer showed similarity with that of a specific prophage group with mutL integration site. Moreover, the average number of prophages in strains with type II-A CRISPR was significantly less than that in type I-C CRISPR and non-CRISPR strains. However, there was no statistical difference between the average number of prophages in type I-C strains and that in non-CRISPR strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that type II-A CRISPR may play an important role in eliminating phages and that the prophage integration site may be an important criterion for the acceptance of foreign DNA by GAS. M type, spacer sequence, and prophage group data were correlated with the phylogenetic relationships of GAS. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic characteristics and/or phylogenetic relationships of GAS may be estimated by analyzing its spacer sequences.","['Yamada S', 'Shibasaki M', 'Murase K', 'Watanabe T', 'Aikawa C', 'Nozawa T', 'Nakagawa I']",2019,19,1,BMC Microbiol,"Yamada S, et al.

30679295,Determinants of inter-practice variation in childhood asthma and respiratory infections: cross-sectional study of a national sentinel network.,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory infections are associated with acute exacerbations of asthma and accompanying morbidity and mortality. In this study we explore inter-practice variations in respiratory infections in children with asthma and study the effect of practice-level factors on these variations.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: We analysed data from 164 general practices in the Royal College of General PractitionersResearch and Surveillance Centresentinel network in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Children 5-12 years.
INTERVENTIONS: None. In this observational study, we used regression analysis to explore the impact of practice-level determinants on the number of respiratory infections in children with asthma.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We describe the distribution of childhood asthma and the determinants of upper/lower respiratory tract infections in these children.
RESULTS: 83.5% (137/164) practices were in urban locations; the mean number of general practitioners per practice was 7; and the mean duration since qualification 19.7 years. We found almost 10-fold difference in the rate of asthma (1.5-11.8 per 100 children) and 50-fold variation in respiratory infection rates between practices. Larger practices with larger lists of asthmatic children had greater rates of respiratory infections among these children.
CONCLUSION: We showed that structural/environmental variables are consistent predictors of a range of respiratory infections among children with asthma. However, contradictory results between measures of practice clinical care show that a purely structural explanation for variability in respiratory infections is limited. Further research is needed to understand how the practice factors influence individual risk behaviours relevant to respiratory infections.","['Hoang U', 'Liyanage H', 'Coyle R', 'Godden C', 'Jones S', 'Blair M', 'Rigby M', 'de Lusignan S']",2019,9,1,BMJ Open,"Hoang U, et al.

Here, we construct a new hybrid method incorporating seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) with a nonlinear autoregressive with external input(NARX) to analyze its seasonality and trend in order to efficiently prevent and control this re-emerging disease.
METHODS: Four statistical models, including a basic SARIMA, basic nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) method, traditional SARIMA-NAR and new SARIMA-NARX hybrid approaches, were developed based on scarlet fever incidence data between January 2004 and July 2018 to evaluate its temporal patterns, and their mimic and predictive capacities were compared to discover the optimal using the mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, mean error rate, and root mean square percentage error.
RESULTS: The four preferred models identified were comprised of the SARIMA(0,1,0)(0,1,1)
CONCLUSIONS: The SARIMA-NARX technique has the promising ability to better consider both linearity and non-linearity behind scarlet fever data than the others, which significantly facilitates its prevention and intervention of scarlet fever.

We estimated secondary household risk for invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) disease within 60 days after onset of scarlet fever. Reports of scarlet fever in England during 2011-2016 were matched by residential address to persons with laboratory-confirmed iGAS infections. We identified 11 iGAS cases in ≈189,684 household contacts and a 60-day incidence rate of 35.3 cases/100,000 person-years, which was 12.2-fold higher than the background rate (2.89). Infants and contacts >75 years of age were at highest risk. Three cases were fatal; sepsis and cellulitis were the most common manifestations. Typing for 6 iGAS cases identified emm 1.0 (n = 4), emm 4.0 (n = 1), and emm 12.0 (n = 1). Although absolute risk in household contacts was low, clinicians assessing household contacts should be aware of the risk to expedite diagnosis and initiate life-saving treatment.","['Watts V', 'Balasegaram S', 'Brown CS', 'Mathew S', 'Mearkle R', 'Ready D', 'Saliba V', 'Lamagni T']",2019,25,3,Emerg Infect Dis,"Watts V, et al.

A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Scarlet fever is a common illness in pediatrics caused by group A beta-hemolytic strep tococcus (GABHS), which usually occurs after an episode of pharyngitis, and has an overall excellent prognosis. Hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever is a rare complication described in adults and even less frequently in children. Our objective was to describe a case of hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever in a pediatric patient.
CLINICAL CASE: A 12-year-old male with scarlet fever presented with a 4-day history of jaundice, dark urine, and decreased appetite. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzy mes and total and direct bilirubin levels, and negative studies for hepatitis A, B and C, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus B19, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal.
DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of scarlet fever associated hepatitis remains unclear. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin mediated cellular injury via cytokine production has been proposed as a possible mechanism of hepatotoxicity in GABHS infections.
CONCLUSION: Hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever remains a rare but benign entity, with complete recovery expected over weeks to months.","['Panchoo AV', 'Saps M', 'Rivera Rivera ED']",2018,89,4,Rev Chil Pediatr,"Panchoo AV, et al.

30500124,[A toddler with a rare complication of scarlet fever].,"BACKGROUND: Haemolytic group A streptococci (GAS) are the most common bacterial cause of infection in the Netherlands. These bacteria can cause many different non-invasive infections, including scarlet fever.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A two-year-old girl presented with fever, tachycardia, exanthema and swelling in the neck. On suspicion of scarlet fever with neck phlegmon we treated her with antibiotics and supportive therapy. Blood and throat cultures revealed growth of haemolytic GAS. Lab tests revealed mild hyperthyroidism and neck ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous appearance of the thyroid. We diagnosed her with 'infectious thyroiditis', a rare complication of infection with haemolytic GAS. A fistula from the pyriform sinus could not be demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: Although GAS infections are common, complications such as thyroiditis are rare. When a paediatric patient is diagnosed with infectious thyroiditis, a fistula from the pyriform sinus should be considered. Patients with such a congenital malformation have an increased risk of recurrent infectious thyroiditis and thyroid abscess formation.","['Smit MP', 'Abdullahi NS', 'Bakker B', 'van den Elzen APM']",2018,162,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Smit MP, et al.

30339254,An Assessment of Potential Unintended Consequences Following a National Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in England: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The ""Quality Premium"" (QP) introduced in England in 2015 aimed to financially reward local healthcare commissioners for targeted reductions in primary care antibiotic prescribing. We aimed to evaluate possible unintended clinical outcomes related to this QP.
METHODS: Using Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics datasets, we examined general practitioner (GP) consultations (visits) and emergency hospital admissions related to a series of predefined conditions of unintended consequences of reduced prescribing. Monthly age- and sex-standardized rates were calculated using a direct method of standardization. We used segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series to evaluate the impact of the QP on seasonally adjusted outcome rates.
RESULTS: We identified 27334 GP consultations and >5 million emergency hospital admissions with predefined conditions. There was no evidence that the QP was associated with changes in GP consultation and hospital admission rates for the selected conditions combined. However, when each condition was considered separately, a significant increase in hospital admission rates was noted for quinsy, and significant decreases were seen for hospital-acquired pneumonia, scarlet fever, pyelonephritis, and complicated urinary tract conditions. A significant decrease in GP consultation rates was estimated for empyema and scarlet fever. No significant changes were observed for other conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study show that overall there was no significant association between the intervention and unintended clinical consequences, with the exception of a few specific conditions, most of which could be explained through other parallel policy changes or should be interpreted with caution due to small numbers.","['Balinskaite V', 'Bou-Antoun S', 'Johnson AP', 'Holmes A', 'Aylin P']",2019,69,2,Clin Infect Dis,"Balinskaite V, et al.

30109840,The fall and rise of Group A Streptococcus diseases.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (or Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a Gram-positive human pathogen responsible for a diverse array of superficial, invasive and immune-related diseases. GAS infections have historically been diseases of poverty and overcrowding, and remain a significant problem in the developing world and in disadvantaged populations within developed countries. With improved living conditions and access to antibiotics, the rates of GAS diseases in developed societies have gradually declined during the 20th century. However, genetic changes in circulating GAS strains and/or changes in host susceptibility to infection can lead to dramatic increases in the rates of specific diseases. No situations exemplify this more than the global upsurge of invasive GAS disease that originated in the 1980s and the regional increases in scarlet fever in north-east Asia and the UK. In each case, increased disease rates have been associated with the emergence of new GAS strains with increased disease-causing capability. Global surveillance for new GAS strains with increased virulence is important and determining why certain populations suddenly become susceptible to circulating strains remains a research priority. Here, we overview the changing epidemiology of GAS infections and the genetic alterations that accompany the emergence of GAS strains with increased capacity to cause disease.","['Barnett TC', 'Bowen AC', 'Carapetis JR']",2018,147,,Epidemiol Infect,"Barnett TC, et al.

During the admission, he was diagnosed with mumps and suspected scarlet fever. Abnormal laboratory findings included elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin 6. Sudden death occurred 8 days after admission. Autopsy confirmed the cause of death to be pericardial tamponade due to a ruptured, inflamed aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary artery. We believe that any typical clinical sign of KD whenever associated with elevated indices of inflammation should set off suspicion of KD and further permit cardiovascular examination. This would contribute to distinguishing KD from other diseases with similar clinical signs in order to accelerate appropriate treatment.","['Zhang J', 'Tuokan T', 'Shi Y']",2018,39,4,Am J Forensic Med Pathol,"Zhang J, et al.

29909092,"Impact of meteorological factors on scarlet fever in Jiangsu province, China.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the relationships between meteorological factors and the incidence of scarlet fever in different populations for scientific prevention strategies.
STUDY DESIGN: An ecological study was conducted.
METHODS: The seasonal index was used to detect the seasonal pattern of scarlet fever. A generalized additive model was conducted to estimate the impact of meteorological factors on scarlet fever in different age groups in Jiangsu province.
RESULTS: Among the 15,873 cases, the vast majority of cases (91.84%) occurred in the population between 3 and 14 years old, with an average annual incidence rate of 14.51 per 100,000, and 2.81 per 100,000 in the age group ≤2 years old. In the generalized additive model, the risk of scarlet fever increased gradually with the temperature rising in both age groups. Interestingly, with the monthly mean temperature above 20 °C, the risk of scarlet fever presented a declining trend in those aged 3-14 years, while it kept stable in the age group ≤2 years. The temperature range only showed a positive effect in the population aged 3-14 years when it was above 9 °C.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the different effects of meteorological factors on scarlet fever in different populations. Surveillance and targeted preventions in the population aged 3-14 years should be enhanced during March-June and November to the following January. Meanwhile, the health education of the guardians was the key to reducing the disease in the age group ≤2 years.","['Zhang Q', 'Liu W', 'Ma W', 'Zhang L', 'Shi Y', 'Wu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhou M']",2018,161,,Public Health,"Zhang Q, et al.

29858148,Resurgence of scarlet fever in China: a 13-year population-based surveillance study.,"BACKGROUND: A re-emergence of scarlet fever has been noted in Hong Kong, South Korea, and England, UK, since 2008. China also had a sudden increase in the incidence of the disease in 2011. In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological changes before and after the upsurge. We also aimed to explore the reasons for the upsurge in disease in 2011, the epidemiological factors that contributed to it, and assess how these could be managed to prevent future epidemics.
METHODS: In this observational study, we extracted the epidemiological data for all cases of scarlet fever between 2004 and 2016 in China from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center, the official website of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. These data had been collected from 31 provinces and regions in China and included geographical, seasonal, and patient demographic information. We used descriptive statistical methods and joinpoint regression to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and annual percentage change in incidence of the upsurge of disease across China.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2016, 502 723 cases of scarlet fever, with ten fatalities, were reported in China, resulting in an annualised average incidence of 2·8807 per 100 000 people. The annual average incidence increased from 1·457 per 100 000 people in 2004 to 4·7638 per 100 000 people in 2011 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3·27, 95% CI 3·22-3·32; p<0·0001), peaking in 2015 (5·0092 per 100 000 people). The annual incidence after the 2011 upsurge of scarlet fever, between 2011 and 2016, was twice the average annual incidence reported between 2004 and 2010 (4·0125 vs 1·9105 per 100 000 people; IRR 2·07, 95% CI 2·06-2·09; p<0·0001). Most cases were distributed in the north, northeast, and northwest of the country. Semi-annual patterns were observed in May-June and November-December. The median age at onset of disease was 6 years, with the annual highest incidence observed in children aged 6 years (49·4675 per 100 000 people). The incidence among boys and men was 1·54 greater than that among girls and women before the upsurge, and 1·51 times greater after the upsurge (p<0·0001 for both). The median time from disease onset to reporting of the disease was shorter after the upsurge in disease than before (3 days vs 4 days; p=0·001).
INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological study of scarlet fever worldwide. The patterns of infection across the country were similar before and after the 2011 upsurge, but the incidence of disease was substantially higher after 2011. Prevention and control strategies being implemented in response to this threat include improving disease surveillance and emergency response systems. In particular, the school absenteeism and symptom monitoring and early-warning system will contribute to the early diagnosis and report of the scarlet fever. This approach will help combat scarlet fever and other childhood infectious diseases in China.

29788999,The first case of multiple pulmonary granulomas with amyloid deposition in a dental technician; a rare manifestation as an occupational lung disease.,"BACKGROUND: Occupational lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, are one of the health problems of dental workers that have been receiving increasing interest. Pulmonary amyloidosis is a heterogenous group of diseases, and can be classified into primary (idiopathic) and secondary (associated with various inflammatory diseases, hereditary, or neoplastic). To date, the development of pulmonary amyloidosis in dental workers has not been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Japanese female presented with chest discomfort and low-grade fever that has persisted for 2 months. She was a dental technician but did not regularly wear a dust mask in the workplace. Chest X ray and computed tomography revealed multiple well-defined nodules in both lungs and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography revealed abnormal FDG uptake in the same lesions with a maximal standardized uptake value (SUV [max]) of 5.6. We next performed thoracoscopic partial resection of the lesions in the right upper and middle lobes. The histological examination of the specimens revealed granuloma formation with foreign body-type giant cells and amyloid deposition that was confirmed by Congo red staining and direct fast scarlet (DFS) staining that produce apple-green birefringence under crossed polarized light. Because there were no other causes underlying the pulmonary amyloidosis, we performed electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) of the specimens and the result showed silica deposition in the lesions. Based on these results, we finally diagnosed the patient with pulmonary granulomas with amyloid deposition caused by chronic silica exposure. Afterward, her symptoms were improved and the disease has not progressed for 2 years since proper measures against additional occupational exposure were implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case presented three important clinical insights: First, occupational exposure to silica in a dental workplace could be associated with the development of amyloid deposition in lung. Second, EPMA was useful to reveal the etiology of amyloid deposition in the lungs. Last, proper protection against silica is important to prevent further progression of the disease. In conclusion, our case suggested that occupational exposure to silica should be considered when amyloid deposition of unknown etiology is found in the lungs of working or retired adults.","['Hirano T', 'Numakura T', 'Moriyama H', 'Saito R', 'Shishikura Y', 'Shiihara J', 'Sugiura H', 'Ichinose M']",2018,18,1,BMC Pulm Med,"Hirano T, et al.

29753299,Homeopathic Prevention and Management of Epidemic Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Homeopathy has been used to treat epidemic diseases since the time of Hahnemann, who used Belladonna to treat scarlet fever. Since then, several approaches using homeopathy for epidemic diseases have been proposed, including individualization, combination remedies, genus epidemicus, and isopathy.
METHODS: The homeopathic research literature was searched to find examples of each of these approaches and to evaluate which were effective.
RESULTS: There is good experimental evidence for each of these approaches. While individualization is the gold standard, it is impractical to use on a widespread basis. Combination remedies can be effective but must be based on the symptoms of a given epidemic in a specific location. Treatment with genus epidemicus can also be successful if based on data from many practitioners. Finally, isopathy shows promise and might be more readily accepted by mainstream medicine due to its similarity to vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Several different homeopathic methods can be used to treat epidemic diseases. The challenge for the future is to refine these approaches and to build on the knowledge base with additional rigorous trials. If and when conventional medicine runs out of options for treating epidemic diseases, homeopathy could be seen as an attractive alternative, but only if there is viable experimental evidence of its success.",['Jacobs J'],2018,107,3,Homeopathy,Jacobs J.

29637751,Investigation of Scarlet Fever Outbreak in a Kindergarten.,"BACKGROUND: Scarlet fever is caused by a group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. On April 3, 2017, an outbreak among children in a kindergarten was reported to the local health department. An epidemiologic investigation was conducted to identify the possible transmission route of this outbreak and to recommend appropriate control measures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using questionnaires including age, sex, the classroom attended at a kindergarten, and date and type of symptoms developed. A case-patient is defined as a child having sore throat, fever, skin rash, or strawberry tongue with or without laboratory confirmation of GAS infection between March 28 and April 28, 2017.
RESULTS: The index case-patients developed symptoms on March 28, 2017, and this outbreak persisted over a period of 16 days. The outbreak affected 21 out of 158 children (13.3%) in the kindergarten, with the mean age of 4.2 (range 3-5) years; 12 (57.1%) of them were boys. The common symptoms reported were fever (71.4%), sore throat (71.4%), reddened tonsil (57.1%), and skin rash (52.4%). The epidemiologic analysis showed that children attending one of the classrooms in the kindergarten were 14.12 times affected than the other classrooms (relative risk, 14.12; 95% confidence interval, 4.99-33.93; P <0.01). All case-patients were recommended to stay away from the kindergarten and its social activities for >24 hours after starting appropriate antibiotic treatment, and all the children in the kindergarten were instructed to keep strict personal hygiene practices.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the outbreak likely affected from the index case-patients who attended to one of the classrooms in the kindergarten. This highlights the importance of immediate notification of outbreak to prevent large number of patients.","['Ryu S', 'Chun BC']",2018,50,1,Infect Chemother,Ryu S and Chun BC.

To characterise the epidemiology of Lancefield Group A, C and G β-haemolytic streptococcus (GAS, GCS and GGS, respectively) in children, we conducted a 2-year prospective study of 307 school children between 7 and 11 years old. GGS and GAS were commonly identified organisms both for silent streptococcal colonisation and symptomatic sore throat, while GCS was uncommonly found. Streptococcal culture positivity at the time of clinical pharyngitis was estimated to reflect true streptococcal pharyngitis in only 26% of instances, with the frequency varying from 54% for children rarely colonised to 1% for children frequently colonised. Numerous GAS emm types were identified, including several types previously associated with severe pharyngitis (e.g. emm types 1, 3 and 28). No severe complications were seen in any child. These data suggest that the clinical diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis is likely to remain difficult and that treatment decisions will remain clouded by uncertainty. There remains a need for organism-specific rapid point-of-care streptococcal diagnostic tests and tests that can distinguish between streptococcal colonisation and disease.","['Jose JJM', 'Brahmadathan KN', 'Abraham VJ', 'Huang CY', 'Morens D', 'Hoe NP', 'Follmann DA', 'Krause RM']",2018,146,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Jose JJM, et al.

29342444,Scarlet Fever Epidemic in China Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes Serotype M12: Epidemiologic and Molecular Analysis.,"From 2011, Hong Kong and mainland China have witnessed a sharp increase in reported cases, with subsequent reports of epidemic scarlet fever in North Asia and the United Kingdom. Here we examine epidemiological data and investigate the genomic context of the predominantly serotype M12 Streptococcus pyogenes scarlet fever isolates from mainland China. Incident case data was obtained from the Chinese Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System. The relative risk of scarlet fever in recent outbreak years 2011-2016 was calculated using the median age-standardised incidence rate, compared to years 2003-2010 prior this outbreak. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 32 emm12 scarlet fever isolates and 13 emm12 non-scarlet fever isolates collected from different geographic regions of China, and compared with 203 published emm12 S. pyogenes genomes predominantly from scarlet fever outbreaks in Hong Kong (n=134) and the United Kingdom (n=63). We found during the outbreak period (2011-2016), the median age-standardised incidence in China was 4.14/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.11-4.18), 2.62-fold higher (95% CI 2.57-2.66) than that of 1.58/100,000 (95% CI 1.56-1.61) during the baseline period prior to the outbreak (2003-2010). Highest incidence was reported for children 5years of age (80.5/100,000). Streptococcal toxin encoding prophage φHKU.vir and φHKU.ssa in addition to the macrolide and tetracycline resistant ICE-emm12 and ICE-HKU397 elements were found amongst mainland China multi-clonal emm12 isolates suggesting a role in selection and expansion of scarlet fever lineages in China. Global dissemination of toxin encoded prophage has played a role in the expansion of scarlet fever emm12 clones. These findings emphasize the role of comprehensive surveillance approaches for monitoring of epidemic human disease.","['You Y', 'Davies MR', 'Protani M', 'McIntyre L', 'Walker MJ', 'Zhang J']",2018,28,,EBioMedicine,"You Y, et al.

The CIDARS plays an important role in and has been integrated into the routine outbreak monitoring efforts of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) at all levels in China. In the CIDARS, thresholds are determined using the ""Mean+2SD‟ in the early stage which have limitations. This study compared the performance of optimized thresholds defined using the ""Mean +2SD‟ method to the performance of 5 novel algorithms to select optimal ""Outbreak Gold Standard (OGS)‟ and corresponding thresholds for outbreak detection. Data for infectious disease were organized by calendar week and year. The ""Mean+2SD‟, C1, C2, moving average (MA), seasonal model (SM), and cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithms were applied. Outbreak signals for the predicted value (Px) were calculated using a percentile-based moving window. When the outbreak signals generated by an algorithm were in line with a Px generated outbreak signal for each week, this Px was then defined as the optimized threshold for that algorithm. In this study, six infectious diseases were selected and classified into TYPE A (chickenpox and mumps), TYPE B (influenza and rubella) and TYPE C [hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and scarlet fever].

29191628,"Resurgence of scarlet fever in England, 2014-16: a population-based surveillance study.","BACKGROUND: After decades of decreasing scarlet fever incidence, a dramatic increase was seen in England beginning in 2014. Investigations were launched to assess clinical and epidemiological patterns and identify potential causes.
METHODS: In this population-based surveillance study, we analysed statutory scarlet fever notifications held by Public Health England from 1911 to 2016 in England and Wales to identify periods of sudden escalation of scarlet fever. Characteristics of cases and outbreaks in England including frequency of complications and hospital admissions were assessed and compared with the pre-upsurge period. Isolates from throat swabs were obtained and were emm typed.
FINDINGS: Data were retrieved for our analysis between Jan 1, 1911, and Dec 31, 2016. Population rates of scarlet fever increased by a factor of three between 2013 and 2014 from 8·2 to 27·2 per 100 000 (rate ratio [RR] 3·34, 95% CI 3·23-3·45; p<0·0001); further increases were observed in 2015 (30·6 per 100 000) and in 2016 (33·2 per 100 000), which reached the highest number of cases (19 206) and rate of scarlet fever notifcation since 1967. The median age of cases in 2014 was 4 years (IQR 3-7) with an incidence of 186 per 100 000 children under age 10 years. All parts of England saw an increase in incidence, with 620 outbreaks reported in 2016. Hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97% between 2013 and 2016; one in 40 cases were admitted for management of the condition or potential complications. Analysis of strains (n=303) identified a diversity of emm types with emm3 (43%), emm12 (15%), emm1 (11%), and emm4 (9%) being the most common. Longitudinal analysis identified 4-yearly periodicity in population incidence of scarlet fever but of consistently lower magnitude than the current escalation.
INTERPRETATION: England is experiencing an unprecedented rise in scarlet fever with the highest incidence for nearly 50 years. Reasons for this escalation are unclear and identifying these remains a public health priority.

The main purpose of this study was to depict the spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of scarlet fever in Jiangsu Province, China in order to develop and implement effective scientific prevention and control strategies.
METHODS: Smoothed map was used to demonstrate the spatial distribution of scarlet fever in Jiangsu Province. In addition, a retrospective space-time analysis based on a discrete Poisson model was utilized to detect clusters of scarlet fever from 2005 to 2015.
RESULTS: During the years 2005-2015, a total of 15,873 scarlet fever cases occurred in Jiangsu Province, with an average annual incidence rate of 1.87 per 100,000. A majority of the cases (83.67%) occurred in children aged 3 to 9 years. Each year, two seasonal incidence peaks were observed, the higher occurring between March and July, the lower between November and the following January. The incidence in the southern regions of the province was generally higher than that in the northern regions. Seven clusters, all of which occurred during incidence peaks, were detected via space-time scan statistical analysis. The most likely cluster and one of the secondary clusters were detected in the southern and northern high endemic regions, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of scarlet fever in Jiangsu Province had a marked seasonality variation and was relatively endemic in some regions. Children aged 3 to 9 years were the major victims of this disease, and kindergartens and primary schools were the focus of surveillance and control. Targeted strategies and measures should be taken to reduce the incidence.","['Zhang Q', 'Liu W', 'Ma W', 'Shi Y', 'Wu Y', 'Li Y', 'Liang S', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhou M']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhang Q, et al.

Early warning threshold is crucial for outbreak detection in the CIDARS, but CDCs at all level are currently using thresholds recommended by the China CDC, and these recommended thresholds have recognized limitations. Our study therefore seeks to explore an operational method to select the proper early warning threshold according to the epidemic features of local infectious diseases.
METHODS: The data used in this study were extracted from the web-based Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), and data for infectious disease cases were organized by calendar week (1-52) and year (2009-2015) in Excel format; Px was calculated using a percentile-based moving window (moving window [5 week*5 year], x), where x represents one of 12 centiles (0.40, 0.45, 0.50….0.95). Outbreak signals for the 12 Px were calculated using the moving percentile method (MPM) based on data from the CIDARS. When the outbreak signals generated by the 'mean + 2SD' gold standard were in line with a Px generated outbreak signal for each week during the year of 2014, this Px was then defined as the proper threshold for the infectious disease. Finally, the performance of new selected thresholds for each infectious disease was evaluated by simulated outbreak signals based on 2015 data.
RESULTS: Six infectious diseases were selected in this study (chickenpox, mumps, hand foot and mouth diseases (HFMD), scarlet fever, influenza and rubella). Proper thresholds for chickenpox (P75), mumps (P80), influenza (P75), rubella (P45), HFMD (P75), and scarlet fever (P80) were identified. The selected proper thresholds for these 6 infectious diseases could detect almost all simulated outbreaks within a shorter time period compared to thresholds recommended by the China CDC.
CONCLUSIONS: It is beneficial to select the proper early warning threshold to detect infectious disease aberrations based on characteristics and epidemic features of local diseases in the CIDARS.","['Wang R', 'Jiang Y', 'Michael E', 'Zhao G']",2017,17,1,BMC Public Health,"Wang R, et al.

A number of group A streptococcus vaccine candidates have been developed, but only one 26-valent recombinant M protein vaccine has entered clinical trials. Differing from the design of a 26-valent recombinant M protein vaccine, we provide here a vaccination using the polyvalence epitope recombinant FSBM protein (rFSBM), which contains four different epitopes, including the fibronectin-binding repeats domain of streptococcal fibronectin binding protein Sfb1, the C-terminal immunogenic segment of streptolysin S, the C3-binding motif of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, and the C-terminal conserved segment of M protein. Vaccination with the rFSBM protein successfully prevented mortality and skin lesions caused by several emm strains of GAS infection. Anti-FSBM antibodies collected from the rFSBM-immunized mice were able to opsonize at least six emm strains and can neutralize the hemolytic activity of streptolysin S. Furthermore, the internalization of GAS into nonphagocytic cells is also reduced by anti-FSBM serum. These findings suggest that rFSBM can be applied as a vaccine candidate to prevent different emm strains of GAS infection.","['Kuo CF', 'Tsao N', 'Hsieh IC', 'Lin YS', 'Wu JJ', 'Hung YT']",2017,12,3,PLoS One,"Kuo CF, et al.

28283023,Genome analysis following a national increase in Scarlet Fever in England 2014.,"BACKGROUND: During a substantial elevation in scarlet fever (SF) notifications in 2014 a national genomic study was undertaken of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococci, GAS) isolates from patients with SF with comparison to isolates from patients with invasive disease (iGAS) to test the hypotheses that the increase in SF was due to either the introduction of one or more new/emerging strains in the population in England or the transmission of a known genetic element through the population of GAS by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) resulting in infections with an increased likelihood of causing SF. Isolates were collected to provide geographical representation, for approximately 5% SF isolates from each region from 1
RESULTS: 555 isolates were analysed, 303 from patients with SF and 252 from patients with iGAS. Isolates from patients with SF were of multiple distinct emm sequence types and phylogenetic lineages. Prior to data normalisation, emm3 was the predominant type (accounting for 42.9% of SF isolates, 130/303 95%CI 37.5-48.5; 14.7% higher than the percentage of emm3 isolates found in the iGAS isolates). Post-normalisation emm types, 4 and 12, were found to be over-represented in patients with SF versus iGAS (p < 0.001). A single gene, ssa, was over-represented in isolates from patients with SF. No single phage was found to be over represented in SF vs iGAS. However, a ""meta-ssa"" phage defined by the presence of :315.2, SPsP6, MGAS10750.3 or HK360ssa, was found to be over represented. The HKU360.vir phage was not detected yet the HKU360.ssa phage was present in 43/63 emm12 isolates but not found to be over-represented in isolates from patients with SF.

28073056,Effects of meteorological factors on incidence of scarlet fever during different periods in different districts of China.,"OBJECTIVE: To reveal the difference of meteorological effect on scarlet fever in Beijing and Hong Kong, China, during different periods among 2004-2014.
METHODS: The data of monthly incidence of scarlet fever and meteorological variables from 2004 to 2014 in Beijing and Hong Kong were collected from Chinese science data center of public health, meteorological data website and Hong Kong observatory website. The whole study period was separated into two periods by the outbreak year 2011 (Jan 2004-Dec 2010 and Jan 2011-Dec 2014). A generalized additive Poisson model was conducted to estimate the effect of meteorological variables on monthly incidence of scarlet fever during two periods in Beijing and Hong Kong, China.
RESULTS: Incidence of scarlet fever in two districts were compared and found the average incidence during period of 2004-2010 were significantly different (Z=203.973, P<0.001) while average incidence became generally equal during 2011-2014 (Z=2.125, P>0.05). There was also significant difference in meteorological variables between Beijing and Hong Kong during whole study period, except air pressure (Z=0.165, P=0.869). After fitting GAM model, it could be found monthly mean temperature showed a negative effect (RR=0.962, 95%CI: 0.933, 0.992) on scarlet fever in Hong Kong during the period of 2004-2010. By comparison, for data in Beijing during the period of 2011-2014, the RRs of monthly mean temperature range growing 1°C and monthly sunshine duration growing 1h was equal to 1.196(1.022, 1.399) and 1.006(1.001, 1.012), respectively. The changes of meteorological effect on scarlet fever over time were not significant both in Beijing and Hong Kong.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that meteorological variables were important factors for incidence of scarlet fever during different period in Beijing and Hong Kong.

28051168,Mechanisms of Yersinia YopO kinase substrate specificity.,"Yersinia bacteria cause a range of human diseases, including yersiniosis, Far East scarlet-like fever and the plague. Yersiniae modulate and evade host immune defences through injection of Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into phagocytic cells. One of the Yops, YopO (also known as YpkA) obstructs phagocytosis through disrupting actin filament regulation processes - inhibiting polymerization-promoting signaling through sequestration of Rac/Rho family GTPases and by using monomeric actin as bait to recruit and phosphorylate host actin-regulating proteins. Here we set out to identify mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation by YopO that would clarify its effects on cytoskeleton disruption. We report the MgADP structure of Yersinia enterocolitica YopO in complex with actin, which reveals its active site architecture. Using a proteome-wide kinase-interacting substrate screening (KISS) method, we identified that YopO phosphorylates a wide range of actin-modulating proteins and located their phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. Using artificial substrates we clarified YopO's substrate length requirements and its phosphorylation consensus sequence. These findings provide fresh insight into the mechanism of the YopO kinase and demonstrate that YopO executes a specific strategy targeting actin-modulating proteins, across multiple functionalities, to compete for control of their native phospho-signaling, thus hampering the cytoskeletal processes required for macrophage phagocytosis.","['Lee WL', 'Singaravelu P', 'Wee S', 'Xue B', 'Ang KC', 'Gunaratne J', 'Grimes JM', 'Swaminathan K', 'Robinson RC']",2017,7,,Sci Rep,"Lee WL, et al.

Meanwhile, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the annual growth of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) would decelerate below 7% after many years of soaring. Under such circumstances, this study aimed to answer what will happen to the incidence rates of infectious diseases in China if Chinese GDP growth remained below 7% in the next five years. Firstly, time plots and cross-correlation matrices were presented to illustrate the characteristics of data. Then, the multivariate time series (MTS) models were proposed to explore the dynamic relationship between incidence rates and GDP. Three kinds of MTS models, i.e., vector auto-regressive (VAR) model for original series, VAR model for differenced series and error-correction model (ECM), were considered in this study. The rank of error-correction term was taken as an indicator for model selection. Finally, our results suggested that four kinds of infectious diseases (epidemic hemorrhagic fever, pertussis, scarlet fever and syphilis) might need attention in China because their incidence rates have increased since the year 2010.","['Zhang T', 'Yin F', 'Zhou T', 'Zhang XY', 'Li XS']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Zhang T, et al.

AIM: To demonstrate the scope of data with the RCGP Annual Report 2014-2015 (May 2014 to April 2015) by describing disparities in the presentation of six common conditions included in the report.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a report of respiratory and communicable disease incidence from a primary care sentinel network in England.
METHOD: Incidence rates and demographic profiles are described for common cold, acute otitis media, pneumonia, influenza-like illness, herpes zoster, and scarlet fever. The impact of age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation on the diagnosis of each condition is explored using a multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: With the exception of herpes zoster, all conditions followed a seasonal pattern. Apart from pneumonia and scarlet fever, the odds of presenting with any of the selected conditions were greater for females (P<0.001). Older people had a greater probability of a pneumonia diagnosis (≥75 years, odds ratio [OR] 6.37; P<0.001). Common cold and influenza-like illness were more likely in people from ethnic minorities than white people, while the converse was true for acute otitis media and herpes zoster. There were higher odds of acute otitis media and herpes zoster diagnosis among the less deprived (least deprived quintile, OR 1.32 and 1.48, respectively; P<0.001).

27874935,"Effect of administration of Streptococcus salivarius K12 on the occurrence of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis, scarlet fever and acute otitis media in 3 years old children.","OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus salivarius K12 (BLIS K12) is a probiotic strain strongly antagonistic to the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans. Shown to colonize the oral cavity and to be safe for human use, BLIS K12 has previously been reported to reduce pharyngo-tonsillitis episodes in children or adults known to have experienced recurrent streptococcal infection. The present study was focussed upon evaluating the role of BLIS K12 in the control of streptococcal disease and acute otitis media in children attending the first year of kindergarten.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: By randomization, 222 enrolled children attending the first year of kindergarten were divided into a treated group (N = 111) receiving for 6 months a daily treatment with BLIS K12 (Bactoblis®) and a control group (N = 111) who were monitored as untreated controls. During the 6 months of treatment and 3 months of follow-up, the children were evaluated for treatment tolerance, and for episodes of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis, scarlet fever and acute otitis media.
RESULTS: During the 6-month trial (N = 111 per group) the incidence of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis, scarlet fever and acute otitis media was approximately 16%, 9% and 44% respectively in the treated group and 48%, 4% and 80% in the control group. During the 3-months follow-up (N = 29 per group) the corresponding rates of infection were 15%, 0% and 12% in the treated group and 26%, 6% and 36% in the controls. No apparent side effects were detected in the treated group either during treatment or follow-up. All of the enrolled children completed the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The daily administration of BLIS K12 to children attending their first year of kindergarten was associated with a significant reduction in episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis and acute otitis media.

Less is known about the dynamics of other childhood diseases, particularly outside Europe and the United States. In this paper, we leverage a unique dataset to examine the epidemiology of six childhood infections - measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, scarlet fever and pertussis - across 32 states in Mexico from 1985 to 2007. This dataset provides us with a spatio-temporal probe into the dynamics of six common childhood infections, and allows us to compare them in the same setting over the same time period. We examine three key epidemiological characteristics of these infections - the age profile of infections, spatio-temporal dynamics, and seasonality in transmission - and compare them with predictions from existing theory and past findings. Our analysis reveals interesting epidemiological differences between the six pathogens, and variations across space. We find signatures of term-time forcing (reduced transmission during the summer) for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and scarlet fever; for pertussis, a lack of term-time forcing could not be rejected.","['Mahmud AS', 'Metcalf CJ', 'Grenfell BT']",2017,145,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Mahmud AS, et al.

However, the incidence of varicella in Korea has tripled over the last decade. We conducted a community based 1:1 matched case-control study to assess the effectiveness of one MAV strain-based vaccine and three Oka strain-based vaccines licensed for use in Korea. All cases were children in Seoul, Korea with varicella who were reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System in Seoul during 2013. The controls were age-matched children with mumps or scarlet fever but no history of varicella. We included 537 cases and 537 controls. The overall effectiveness of one dose of varicella vaccination was 13% (95% confidence interval [CI], -17.3-35.6). Of the four licensed varicella vaccines, only one was highly effective (88.9%; 95% CI, 52.1-97.4).

29967859,Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome in Child. A Case Report and a Review from Literature.,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is the medical term used to define a skin condition induced by the exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The disorder is also known as Ritter disease, bullous impetigo, neonatal pemphigus, or staphylococcal scarlet fever. The disease especially affects infants and small children, but has also been described in adults. Prompt therapy with proper antibiotics and supportive treatment has led to a decrease in the mortality rate. The current case report describes the clinical progress of a patient with generalized erythema and fever, followed by the appearance of bullous lesions with tendency to rupture under the smallest pressure, and with extended areas of denudation. The patient aged four years and six months was admitted to our clinic to establish the aetiology and treatment of a generalized bullous exanthema, followed by a skin denudation associated with fever and impaired general status. Based on clinical and paraclinical examinations a diagnosis of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome was established which responded favourably to antibiotic treatment, hydro-electrolytic re-equilibration, and adequate local hygiene. Staphylococcal infection can represent a problem of significant pathological importance sometimes requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving paediatricians, dermatologists, infectious diseases specialists, and plastic surgeons.","['Grama A', 'Mărginean OC', 'Meliț LE', 'Georgescu AM']",2016,2,4,J Crit Care Med (Targu Mures),"Grama A, et al.

27779834,Scarlet fever in Poland in 2014.,"OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2014.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation was performed by reviewing surveillance data published in the bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2014” as well as in previous bulletins, and unpublished data collected under Statistical survey program of official statistics. These data relate to cases of scarlet fever registered by health sanitary inspection on the basis of statutory notification of scarlet fever reported by physicians.
RESULTS: In 2014, annual, incidence rate of scarlet fever in Poland was about 9% lower in comparison to previous year. There were 22 855 cases all over the country and the incidence was 59.5 per 100,000 population; depending on the voivodeship ranged from 19.5 in podkarpackie to 93.2 in pomorskie. The highest incidence was noted among 4-year-old children (981.4) and 5-year-old children (971.0). However the incidence among children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 95.7% of all cases. The incidence among men (67.2) was higher by 28.5% than incidence among women (52.3). Incidence rate in urban areas, in any size town, was higher than in rural areas. Overall incidence in urban areas was 66.4; in rural areas - 49.0. 1,11% of patients were hospitalized. There were no reported deaths related to scarlet fever.
SUMMARY: In the surveillance of scarlet fever it is necessary to ensure that the collected data will be valid and reliable. Very low specificity of this surveillance may not only impinge on the assessment of epidemiological situation of this disease in Poland but also overshadow the situation of other diseases, including diseases under elimination program (rubella, measles). This is one of the greatest challenges facing sanitary inspection in the coming years.","['Staszewska-Jakubik E', 'Czarkowski MP', 'Kondej B']",2016,70,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Staszewska-Jakubik E, et al.

27566251,"Estimated burden of group a streptococcal pharyngitis among children in Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND: Burden of Group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is scarce in developing countries, still unknown in China. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of clinical cases of pharyngitis and GAS culture-positive pharyngitis, and their outpatient visits among children aged 0-14 years in Beijing, the capital of China.
METHODS: Multiplier model was used to estimate the numbers of pharyngitis cases, based on reported numbers of clinical cases and GAS culture-positive rates from GAS surveillances in Beijing, consultation rate, population coverage of GAS surveillances, sampling success rate, and test sensitivity of GAS culture from previous studies, surveys and surveillances.
RESULTS: An average of 29804.6 (95 % CI: 28333.2-31276.0) clinical cases of pharyngitis per 100,000 person-years occurred among children aged 0-14 years, resulting in correspondingly 19519.0 (95 % CI: 18516.7-20521.2) outpatient visits per 100,000 person-years from 2012 to 2014 in Beijing. On average, there were 2685.1 (95 % CI: 2039.6-3330.6) GAS culture-positive cases of pharyngitis and 1652.7 (95 % CI: 1256.5-2049.0) outpatient visits per 100,000 person-years during the same period. The estimated burden of GAS pharyngitis was significantly higher than that of scarlet fever. Children aged 5-14 years had a higher burden of GAS pharyngitis than those aged 0-4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggests that GAS pharyngitis is very common in children in China.

27504182,The association between varicella (chickenpox) and group A streptococcus infections in historical perspective.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the research is to investigate the historical relationship between varicella and Streptococcus pyogenes infections. In the past few decades, varicella has been identified as a risk factor for invasive group A streptococcus infections. The question is whether this relationship also existed between varicella and scarlet fever in the historical era.
METHODS: The analysis begins with a search of historical medical reports on the relationship between varicella and scarlet fever epidemics in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as in more recent empirical studies. Correlations and cross-correlations between varicella and scarlet fever are analyzed using weekly public health case reports from 1924 to 1932 for Boston, Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia. Regression models are used to estimate the relationship between varicella and scarlet fever after controlling for seasonal forcing.
RESULTS: Historical records give limited support for a causal relationship between varicella and scarlet fever but indicate that these diseases often occurred close in time to each other. Likewise, statistical analysis shows that varicella and scarlet fever epidemics are closely aligned with each other, and varicella has a strong relationship with scarlet fever. The relationship is stronger than reported in any previous research on the two diseases.
CONCLUSION: The close correspondence of the two diseases likely depends on multiple factors, including seasonal forcing, a causal relationship, and co-infections. The results raise questions about whether this close relationship might have had a synergistic effect or a role in the evolution of S. pyogenes from the virulent, high incidence epidemics of the 19th century to the relatively benign scarlet fever of the 1950s.",['Coleman S'],2016,4,,SAGE Open Med,Coleman S.

27464420,[The Cause of Death of Taira no Kiyomori: A Possible Connection with the Death of Fujiwara no Kunitsuna].,"Taira no Kiyomori was struck by an unimaginable fever and died in the spring of Jishō Year 5 (1181). In the coup d'état of Jishō Year 3 (1179), Kiyomori ended the Go-shirakawa cloistered government through military force and established the Takakura cloistered government as a puppet regime in the following year. The regime lasted only a short while, however, as the retired Takakura Emperor passed away within less than a year. Kiyomori's death immediately followed the restoration of the Go-shirakawa cloistered government. The cause of Kiyomori's death has previously been discussed in the fields of literature and medicine and has been diagnosed variously as malaria, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, or meningitis contracted from complications of influenza, scarlatina fulminans (scarlet fever), and so on. However, considering the fact that Kiyomori--who was anxious about restoring relations with the retired Go-shirakawa Emperor as well as subjugation by the forces of the Minamoto clan, which were growing daily in strength--and his close aide Fujiwara no Kunitsuna simultaneously fell ill and died one after the other, it is speculated that both figures had streptococcal infection. It is, therefore, surmised that, during the clan's twilight years, Taira tactics were determined through secret discussions between Kiyomori and Kunitsuna.",['Akatani M'],2016,62,1,Nihon Ishigaku Zasshi,Akatani M.

27464318,Group A Streptococcal Infections Are Associated With Increased Risk of Pediatric Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Taiwanese Population-Based Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the association between group A streptococcal (GAS) infections and the risks of developing tic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: We conducted a follow-up cohort study in 2014 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort consisted of patients younger than 18 years with newly diagnosed GAS infection (ICD-9-CM codes 034 [streptococcal sore throat and scarlet fever] and 482.31 [pneumonia due to Streptococcus, group A]) from 2001 to 2010. All patients having GAS infection codes between 1996 and 2000 were excluded. We assessed the patients' risks of developing tic disorders, OCD, and ADHD (ICD-9-CM codes 300.3 [obsessive-compulsive disorders], 301.4 [obsessive-compulsive personality disorder], 307.2 [tic disorder, unspecified], and 314 [attention deficit disorder]) and compared these risks with those of a control cohort. The primary outcomes of this study were the overall neuropsychiatric disorder occurrence and the occurrence of separate subtypes.
RESULTS: We examined 2,596 patients and 25,960 controls. The incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders in the GAS infection cohort (60.42 per 10,000 person-years) was significantly higher than that in the comparison cohort (49.32 per 10,000 person-years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49). The largest increased risk was for tic disorders (HR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02-2.62). Patients hospitalized for GAS infection had a 1.96-fold higher risk of neuropsychiatric disorders than did people without GAS infection (HR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.23-3.12), and there was no difference in risk between outpatients with GAS infection and people without GAS infection (HR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.92-1.41). Patients with moderate or high frequencies of GAS infection-related clinic visits had much higher risks of developing a neuropsychiatric disorder and, specifically, tic disorders and ADHD (all P values for trend < .05). These risks were not increased in patients with a low frequency of clinic visits.

27198935,The Role of Childhood Infections and Immunizations on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.,"BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare, highly malignant tumor arising from primitive mesenchymal cells that differentiate into skeletal muscle. Relatively little is known about RMS susceptibility. Based on growing evidence regarding the role of early immunologic challenges on RMS development, we evaluated the role of infections and immunizations on this clinically significant pediatric malignancy.
PROCEDURE: RMS cases (n = 322) were enrolled from the third trial coordinated by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group. Population-based controls (n = 322) were pair matched to cases on race, sex, and age. The following immunizations were assessed: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT); measles, mumps, and rubella; and oral polio vaccine. We also evaluated if immunizations were complete versus incomplete. We examined selected infections including chickenpox, mumps, pneumonia, scarlet fever, rubella, rubeola, pertussis, mononucleosis, and lung infections. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each exposure, adjusted for maternal education and total annual income.
RESULTS: Incomplete immunization schedules (OR = 5.30, 95% CI: 2.47-11.33) and incomplete DPT immunization (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.06-2.29) were positively associated with childhood RMS. However, infections did not appear to be associated with childhood RMS.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study of RMS to date demonstrating a possible protective effect of immunizations against the development of childhood RMS. Further studies are needed to validate our findings. Our findings add to the growing body of literature, suggesting a protective role of routine vaccinations in childhood cancer and specifically in childhood RMS.","['Sankaran H', 'Danysh HE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Okcu MF', 'Skapek SX', 'Hawkins DS', 'Spector LG', 'Erhardt EB', 'Grufferman S', 'Lupo PJ']",2016,63,9,Pediatr Blood Cancer,"Sankaran H, et al.

Initially described in the convalescence of scarlet fever, the incidence of acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) has decreased worldwide, particularly in developed countries where it is now rare and is limited to adult patients who have debilitating conditions. In developing countries, the annual burden of APSGN remains at a level of least 9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from the scarlet fever cases diagnosed in 36 hospitals in Beijing to isolate the GAS strains from May to July, betgween 2011 and 2014. Genotyping of emm gene was performed with PCR and N-terminal gene fragments of M protein were sequenced. Data of all the scarlet fever cases in Beijing that reported through the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System (NNIDSS) , were gathered and analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the collected 2 161 nasopharyngeal swabs, 762 GAS strains were identified (35.3%). In addition, 7 emm types were detected, in which emm12 accounted for 69.4% (529/762) , emm1 accounted for 29.8% (227/762) , and other five types (emm 11, 22, 75, 89, and 128) accounted for 0.8% (6/762) , respctively. Compared with the emm types detected between 2011 and 2014, emm12, emm1 and other types accounted for 82.2% (295/359) , 16.7% (60/359) and 1.1% (4/359, including emm11, 22 and 89) in 2011 respectively.emm12, emm1 and emm75 accounted for 77.3% (123/163) , 23.9% (39/163) and 0.6% (1/163) respectively in 2012. emm12 and emm1 accounted for 50.7% (38/75) and 49.3% (37/75) in 2013 while emm12, emm1 and emm128 accounted for 44.2% (73/165) , 55.2% (91/165) and 0.6% (1/165) respectively in 2014. The differences of the constitution of emm types from 2011 to 2014 appeared statistically significant (P<0.001). In 2011 and 2012, major type appeared as emm12, but in 2014, emm1 became predominant. A total of 6 152 cases were reported in 2011, while 2 908, 2 048 and 3 918 cases were reported in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Age specific differences were noticed in the distribution of emm types GAS strains in 2011, with the number of emm12 strains detected higher in 1-5 year olds than in age group > 5 years (P<0.05). There were area specific differences in distribution of emm types of GAS strains seen in 2011 and 2013. In 2011, the number of emm1 strains detected in urban area was higher than in suburb area (P<0.05). However, in 2013, the number of emm1 strains detected in suburb area was seen higher than in urban area (P< 0.05).
CONCLUSION: GAS with emm12 and GAS emm1 appeared interchangeably predominant in Beijing from 2011 to 2014.

METHODS: A total of 259 GAS strains were isolated from pediatric patients clinically who diagnosed with scarlet fever and pharyngitis from 36 hospitals in Beijing from May to July, 2014.The Superantigens genes of strains were performed by Real-time PCR (speA, speB, speC, speF, speG, speH, speI, speJ, speK, speL, speM, smeZ, ssa). PCR amplification of GAS strain M protein N gene segments were carried ort; products after sequencing comparison were analyzed to determine the GAS types of emm. The differences in distributions of superantigen genes and emm types of GAS isolates were compared between subgroups.
RESULTS: Among the 259 GAS strains, the detection rates of 13 superantigens were as the following: speA 48.6% (126), speB 99.2% (257), speC 99.2% (257), speF 98.8% (256), speG 98.5% (255), speH 43.6% (113), speI 46.3% (120), speJ 49.0% (127), smeZ 99.2% (257) and ssa 98.5% (255), respectively, however, speK, speL, and speM were not found. Eleven superantigen gene profiles in all were observed (A-K). The percentage of emm1 strains harbored spe A and speJ were 94.2% (113/120), 95.0% (114/120), respectively, which were significantly higher than those of emm12 strains (5.6% (7/124), 5.6% (7/124), respectively; χ(2) = 191.20, 194.80, P < 0.001). The percentage of emm12 strains harbored speH and speI were 83.9% (104/124), 88.7% (110/124), respectively, which were significantly higher than those of emm1 strains (3.3% (4/120), 4.2% (5/120), respectively; χ(2) = 160.30, 174.90, P < 0.001).The superantigen genotypes of GAS strains and emm types, which were isolated from scarlet fever and pharyngitis cases, were not significant different (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The GSA strains isolated in Beijing pediatric patients in 2014, the relevance ratio of speB, speC, speF, smeZ, speG, ssa were higher than others, while speK, speL, and speM were no detected in any GAS strains.

26819435,"[To Discern the Medical Thoughts of Heo Joon, the Best Physician in Korean History--An Analysis of Disease Experiences and Treatment Cases in the Treasured Mirror of Eastern Medicine].","Heo Joon is one of the best-known physicians of the Chosun Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty (1392~1910) of Korea. He had served King Seonjo () during his practice, and has produced many publications on medicine. Then, how did he actually treat the patients? So far, other than the case when he treated Gwanghaegun's smallpox, it is not clearly known how and when he attended and treated the ill. In his most famous book, the Treasured Mirror of Eastern Medicine, he details the physiopathological mechanisms, diagnoses, treatments or prescriptions, and treatment cases, however, it is not clear if they're from his own clinical experiences. Nevertheless, based on the written method, the original information is reconstituted according to its respective editors of the TMEM, a particular case being included may be considered as an agreement and acceptance of an actual treatment executed. This research analyzes what type of medicinal theory that the main writer Heo Joon employed in his real treatments, as well as how he diagnosed and treated diseases. After analyzing the complete series of the TMEM, we found a total of 301 clinical cases. Here, one may wonder, why does the Section of Inner and External Bodily Elements, that deal with diseases and the structure of the body, have far outnumber cases than the Section of Miscellaneous Disorders? Why does the TMEM introduce the various types of disease experiences and treatment cases, medical cases, simple treatments, nurturing life, materia medica, and also include supernatural phenomena? Why does the TMEM include the experiences and cases from the book published in the Song, Jin, Yuan dynasty of China, moreover in the Ming Dynasty of its time. These questions can be answered to the extent that Heo Joon and the others who participated in completing the book sought to justify the new clinical medicine practices, and because it had to be acceptable to the Confucius beliefs which dominated the society, and also because the book came to light in a time when tensions between the pre-existing Chosun medicine and the newly introduced Chinese medicine were evident. Among the clinical cases in the TMEM, there are only 41 cases that can be considered as Medical Cases which include the pathology and treatment mechanism. After analyzing these mechanisms, we were able to discover that they cover not only the theories of the 4 great physicians of Jin-Yuan Dynasty, but also the theories of the Danxi's Medical Current, a big trend in the Early Ming Dynasty, and some of the most recent clinical cases that had been just reported at the time. However, Heo Joon did not lean towards a particular theory of medicine; rather, he insisted on establishing a classical medicine based on the traditional medicinal scriptures such as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon or Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica, and had created his own Body-Viscera medicine, as Shin Dongwon's recent research. Moreover, he successfully secured his own right to be a clinical physician by customizing the amount of medication in prescriptions for the people of Chosun. Heo Joon was one of the chief physicians for the Royal Family of the Chosun Dynasty. Despite the tendency of traditional medicine to lean towards Taoism or Fangshu, for him the most important thing was the actual treatment of diseases. As a result, Heo Joon successfully treated smallpox by utilizing traditional medicinal methods, by breaking the taboo of not using medication on such diseases, as well as he was able to treat an unknown disease, scarlet fever, by discovering the pathological mechanism of the illness. Also he made bold decisions on altering existing prescriptions to treat diseases more efficiently. The TMEM consists of not only justified methods that integrate the different and scattered medicinal and clinical practices, which many insisted their originality, but also was backed with Heo Joon's such credible and endeavored clinical medicine.",['Oh C'],2015,24,3,Uisahak,"Oh C.

METHODS: A spatiotemporal analysis was conducted at the district/county level in the Beijing region based on the reported cases of scarlet fever during the study period. Moran's autocorrelation coefficient was used to examine the spatial autocorrelation of scarlet fever, whereas the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic was used to determine the hotspot incidence of scarlet fever. Likewise, the space-time scan statistic was used to detect the space-time clusters, including the relative risk of scarlet fever incidence across all settings.
RESULTS: A total of 26,860 scarlet fever cases were reported in Beijing during the study period (2005-2014). The average annual incidence of scarlet fever was 14.25 per 100,000 population (range, 6.76 to 32.03 per 100,000). The incidence among males was higher than that among females, and more than two-thirds of scarlet fever cases (83.8%) were among children 3-8 years old. The seasonal incidence peaks occurred from March to July. A higher relative risk area was mainly in the city and urban districts of Beijing. The most likely space-time clusters and secondary clusters were detected to be diversely distributed in every study year.
CONCLUSIONS: The spatiotemporal patterns of scarlet fever were relatively unsteady in Beijing from 2005 to 2014. The at-risk population was mainly scattered in urban settings and dense districts with high population, indicating a positive relationship between population density and increased risk of scarlet fever exposure. Children under 15 years of age were the most susceptible to scarlet fever.","['Mahara G', 'Wang C', 'Huo D', 'Xu Q', 'Huang F', 'Tao L', 'Guo J', 'Cao K', 'Long L', 'Chhetri JK', 'Gao Q', 'Wang W', 'Wang Q', 'Guo X']",2016,13,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Mahara G, et al.

26585817,Scarlet fever: A not so typical exanthematous pharyngotonsillitis (based on 171 cases).,"AIM: To describe the age, signs and clinical symptoms of children with scarlet fever at the present time, and to check whether they are equivalent to those with traditional streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
STUDY DESIGN: An observational, retrospective study was conducted on the clinical records of 5500 children aged from 0 to 15 years attending a primary health care center. A record was made of the percentage of the cases in which signs and symptoms appear and the Centor score was calculated. Microbiological diagnosis of the disease was made using the rapid antigen-detection test or traditional culture.
RESULTS: A total of 171 out of 252 scarlet fever diagnoses were microbiologically verified in 158 patients. The median age was 3.8 years (interquartile range: 2.91-4.78), with the majority (57%) under the age of 4 years. There was fever in 89% of the processes (95% CI: 84-94%), with a temperature of >38°C in 73% (95% CI: 65-80%), enlarged lymph nodes in 70% (95% CI: 58-82%), absence of cough in 73% (95% CI: 65-80%), and tonsillar exudate in only 24% (95% CI: 17-31%). The Centor score (n=105) was ≤2 points in 86% (95% CI: 79-92%). The only difference regarding age is that episodes in patients under the age of 4 years old have significantly higher fever (>38°C) than the older ones (80% versus 63%. OR 3.13; 95% CI: 1.46-6.71).
CONCLUSION: Scarlet fever pharyngotonsillitis differs from the traditional streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, and its evaluation using clinical prediction rules such as Centor or McIsaac is questionable. The main diagnostic key must certainly be rash, regardless of patient age.","['García-Vera C', 'de Dios Javierre B', 'Castán Larraz B', 'Arana Navarro T', 'Cenarro Guerrero T', 'Ruiz Pastora R', 'Sánchez Gimeno J']",2016,34,7,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"García-Vera C, et al.

26545015,Infectious diseases are associated with carotid intima media thickness in adolescence.,"OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory risk factors in childhood, e.g. obesity, impact on carotid artery intima media thickness (CIMT), an early indicator of atherosclerosis. Little is known on potential infectious origins in childhood. We investigated the association between number of reported different childhood infectious diseases and CIMT in adolescence.
STUDY DESIGN: 288 SAPALDIA offspring (8-21years) underwent a clinical examination in 2010-2011: anthropometry, blood pressure, CIMT, blood draw (cardiovascular biomarkers, cotinine). Offspring and parents gave information on individuals' and family health, child's vaccination status, infectious diseases and other early life factors. Life-time prevalence of bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, otitis, mononucleosis, meningitis, appendicitis, and scarlet fever were investigated, separately, and as cumulative infectious disease score. Multilevel adjusted linear regression analysis on the association between subjects' CIMT average and infectious diseases score was performed, stratifying by sex.
RESULTS: Youth (mean age 14.8 yrs; 53% female) reported on average 1.3 of the listed infectious diseases; 22% boys and 15% girls reported ≥3 infectious diseases (p = 0.136). Two-thirds were vaccinated according to recommendations (boys 56%, girls 61.5%, p = 0.567). Sex-stratified analyses yielded significantly increased CIMT in boys with ≥3 infectious diseases vs. none (0.046 mm, 95%CI 0.024; 0.068). In girls, the effect was of same direction but statistically non-significant (0.011 mm, 95%CI -0.015; 0.036).
CONCLUSION: The SAPALDIA Youth study complements current evidence on infectious origins of atherosclerosis in adults. The larger effects observed in boys may relate to a higher vulnerability of the vasculature and/or to infectious pathogens. Our data are suggestive of an early impact of childhood infectious diseases on vascular health.","['Dratva J', 'Caviezel S', 'Schaffner E', 'Bettschart R', 'Kuenzli N', 'Schindler C', 'Schmidt-Trucksäss A', 'Stolz D', 'Zemp E', 'Probst-Hensch N']",2015,243,2,Atherosclerosis,"Dratva J, et al.

26522788,Transfer of scarlet fever-associated elements into the group A Streptococcus M1T1 clone.,"The group A Streptococcus (GAS) M1T1 clone emerged in the 1980s as a leading cause of epidemic invasive infections worldwide, including necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements has played a central role in the evolution of the M1T1 clone, with bacteriophage-encoded determinants DNase Sda1 and superantigen SpeA2 contributing to enhanced virulence and colonization respectively. Outbreaks of scarlet fever in Hong Kong and China in 2011, caused primarily by emm12 GAS, led to our investigation of the next most common cause of scarlet fever, emm1 GAS. Genomic analysis of 18 emm1 isolates from Hong Kong and 16 emm1 isolates from mainland China revealed the presence of mobile genetic elements associated with the expansion of emm12 scarlet fever clones in the M1T1 genomic background. These mobile genetic elements confer expression of superantigens SSA and SpeC, and resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. Horizontal transfer of mobile DNA conferring multi-drug resistance and expression of a new superantigen repertoire in the M1T1 clone should trigger heightened public health awareness for the global dissemination of these genetic elements.","['Ben Zakour NL', 'Davies MR', 'You Y', 'Chen JH', 'Forde BM', 'Stanton-Cook M', 'Yang R', 'Cui Y', 'Barnett TC', 'Venturini C', 'Ong CL', 'Tse H', 'Dougan G', 'Zhang J', 'Yuen KY', 'Beatson SA', 'Walker MJ']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Ben Zakour NL, et al.

26313273,"[Carriage of Streptococcus pyogenes in primary school children: M-protein types, pyrogenic toxin genes, and investigation of the clonal relationships between the isolates].","M-protein and pyrogenic toxins are the most important virulence factors of Streptococcus pyogenes, and they play significant role in the pathophysiology of acute rheumatoid fever and scarlet fever, respectively. In this study, the pharyngeal carriage of S.pyogenes of the primary school children, clonal relationship of the strains, M-protein types, and the presence of pyrogenic toxin genes were aimed to be investigated. A total of 668 throat cultures obtained from children (age range: 6-16 years) in two primary schools in our region, were included in the study. The clonal relationships of the isolated group A streptococci (GAS) strains were investigated by DiversiLab assay (BioMérieux, France), and the clonal relatedness was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. M-protein (emm) typing was performed by DNA sequencing as suggested by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The genes encoding pyrogenic toxins, speA and speC, were investigated by an in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. S.pyogenes was isolated from 134 (20.05%) of the throat samples. The GAS carriage rate of the students aged ≥10 was statistically higher than those 7-9 years age group (%22 vs %16.4, p<0.05). The M protein gene could be characterized only among 123 isolates by DNA sequencing, and 20 different emm types were detected. The most frequent emm type was emm1 (n=38, 30.9%) followed by emm12 (n=18, 14.6%), emm89 (n=10, 8.1%), emm118 (n=9, 7.3%), and emm4 (n=7, 5.7%). Pyrogenic toxin genes were found in 25 (18.6%) of the isolates, including speA in 11 isolates (8.2%) and speC in 12 isolates (8.9%) and both genes were detected in 2 isolates (1.5%). Sixty-two different Rep (Repetitive extragenic palindromic)-PCR profiles were detected in 134 S.pyogenes isolates by DiversiLab method. Thirteen different clusters were formed by a total of clonally related 36 isolates revealing a strain clustering ratio of 26.9%. Clonal relationship of all isolates in the same cluster was confirmed by PFGE method. In this study, relatively high percentage of GAS carriage was observed among primary school children in our region. The coverage rate of the 30-valent vaccine was determined to be over 90% with respect to M-protein types. Since the pyrogenic toxin-encoding genes were found in one fifth of the isolates from the studied subjects, we concluded that the carrier population may also have high risk for scarlet fever. We also concluded that, the clonal relationship ratio determined among the isolates may be a risk in school transmission of GAS.","['Otlu B', 'Karakurt C', 'Bayındır Y', 'Kayabaş Ü', 'Yakupoğulları Y', 'Gözükara Bağ H']",2015,49,3,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Otlu B, et al.

26280141,Common Skin Rashes in Children.,"Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the ""slapped cheek"" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.","['Allmon A', 'Deane K', 'Martin KL']",2015,92,3,Am Fam Physician,"Allmon A, et al.

26233076,Scarlet fever in Poland in 2013.,"OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2013 in comparison with previous years. MATERIALS AND MATHODS. The evaluation was performed by reviewing surveillance data published in the bulletin, ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2013"" (Warsaw 2014, NIPH-NIH, CSI) and also in bulletins from previous years, and unpublished data collected under Statistical survey program of official statistics.
RESULTS: In 2013 did not change the general view of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland. Analysed data did not indicate the possibility of shortening an epidemic cycle of scarlet fever, nor suggest growing rate of epidemic curve or increase of average annual incidence which was observed in last twenty years. In 2013, in the country a total of 25 115 cases were registered with corresponding incidence 65.2 per 100,000 population (in voivodeships: from 22.9 in Łódzkie to 111.1 in Pomorskie). The highest incidence was notified in 5-year-old (949.2) and 4-year-old children (916.6), and the cases among children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 87.0% of all cases. The incidence among men (78.8) was higher over 50% than incidence among women (52.5). The incidence was higher in urban areas than in rural areas and was 68.7 (in rural area 59.9). 1.04% of patients were hospitalized. No deaths related to this disease were reported.
SUMMARY: A sudden increasing incidence among men, especially in the 15-19 age group and growing proportion of cases among adults in comparison to the notified in previous years, according to authors' opinion, can be associated with compensatory epidemic of rubella (!). It is estimated, that about 10% scarlet fever cases reported to surveillance in a year are misclassified and could be unrecognized cases of rubella. Therefore, it is important to enhance specificity of epidemiological surveillance of scarlet fever. Additionally, it will give a better opportunity to monitor and supervise measles and rubella elimination program.","['Czarkowski MP', 'Staszewska E', 'Kondej B']",2015,69,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Czarkowski MP, et al.

25973933,Comparative epidemiology of Streptococcus pyogenes emm-types causing invasive and noninvasive infections in French children by use of high-resolution melting-polymerase chain reaction.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyze the epidemiology of Group A streptococci (GAS) emm-types causing invasive and noninvasive infections in French children.
METHODS: From September 2009 to May 2011, we analyzed GAS isolates from 585 pharyngitis, 125 invasive infections and, for the first time in France, 32 healthy carriers. M protein gene (emm) typing of the isolates was carried out by a new rapid technique, combining 3 multiplex-polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) coupled to high-resolution melting (HRM) curves, able to detect 13 major emm-types (emm 1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 28, 75, 77, 87, 89 and 102).
RESULTS: GAS belonging to emm-type 1 were more frequently found among invasive infections than among pharyngitis (24.0% vs. 11.5%, P < 0.001); emm 4 and 89 were more common in pharyngitis than in invasive infections (emm-type 4, 17.4% vs. 6.4%, P = 0.002 and emm-type 89, 9.9% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.006, respectively) and emm 3 and 4 were more common in cases of pharyngitis associated with scarlet fever (21.6% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001 and 29.3% vs. 14.5%, P < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HRM method enables the rapid emm-typing of a large number of isolates in epidemiological studies.

25885601,Concurrent peritonsillar abscess and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis complicating acute streptococcal tonsillitis in a young healthy adult: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for 5-15% and 20-30% of acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis in adults and children, respectively. It not only causes acute illness but also can give rise to local suppurative complications such as peritonsillar abscess as well as trigger the postinfectious syndromes of glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. Here, we report a case of a young healthy adult in whom both peritonsillar abscess and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis developed as a complication of acute streptococcal tonsillitis. To the best of our knowledge, such a coincidence of poststreptococcal sequelae has not been reported previously.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old previously healthy woman was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis by her family doctor and treated empirically with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125 mg) twice daily for 5 days. Four days after completing antibiotic therapy, peritonsillar abscess of left tonsil developed. Needle aspiration followed by incision and drainage were performed by otolaryngologist at the Emergency Department. Next, the patient was discharged home on a 10-day course of cefuroxime and metronidazole. The symptoms of peritonsillar abscess were subsiding during treatment, however on the last day of antibiotic therapy, swelling and pain of the left ankle appeared. Five days later the patient was consulted by rheumatologist. Cultures of throat swabs and abscess aspirate collected 2 weeks before revealed the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer was evaluated and proved to be 412 IU/ml (normal 0-200 IU/ml). The level of C-reactive protein was 13,0 mg/L (normal <5,0 mg/L). There was no known cardiac involvement. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis was diagnosed. Left ankle arthralgia persisted for about 5-6 weeks. Six months after the presentation at the Emergency Department, the patient was well, with ASO titer reaching 262 IU/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that appropriate choice of antibiotic, proper dose as well as duration of therapy of acute GAS pharyngitis/tonsillitis are crucial to prevent poststreptococcal sequelae.","['Mazur E', 'Czerwińska E', 'Grochowalska A', 'Kozioł-Montewka M']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Mazur E, et al.

25723402,Preventive effect of Ligularia fischerion inhibition of nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages depending on cooking method.,"BACKGROUND: Ligularia fischeri (common name Gomchwi) is known for its pharmaceutical properties and used in the treatment of jaundice, scarlet-fever, rheumatoidal arthritis, and hepatic diseases; however, little is known about its anti-inflammatory effect. In this study the influence of blanching and pan-frying on the anti-inflammatory activity of Ligularia fischeri (LF) was evaluated.
RESULTS: Fresh LF and cooked LF showed no significant effect on the viability of macrophages after 24 h incubation. Fresh LF was found to be the most potent inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) production at 100 μg/ml, while pan-fried LF showed little inhibitory effect on lipoloysaccharide (LPS) stimulated murine machrophage RAW264.7 cells. In contrast with its effect on NO production, pan-fried LF showed significant attenuation of the expression of inducible nitiric oxide synthase (iNOS) compared with fresh LF. In the cooking method of LF, PGE2 production was not affected in the LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. In LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, pretreatment by fresh and cooked LF increased COX2 mRNA expression. The 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid content of blanching and pan-frying LF increased by 4.92 and 9.7 fold with blanching and pan-frying respectively in comparison with uncooked LF.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the cooking method, Ligularia fischeri exhibited potent inhibition of NO production through expression of iNOS in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.","['Park HS', 'Choi HY', 'Kim GH']",2014,47,1,Biol Res,"Park HS, et al.

Drawing on the notifications of communicable diseases collated by the General Register Office (GRO), we establish pre-war (baseline) disease rates for the 1470 districts. For the war years, techniques of binary logistic regression analysis are used to assess the associations between (a) above-baseline ('raised') disease rates in evacuation, neutral and reception districts and (b) the major phases of the evacuation scheme. The analysis demonstrates that the evacuation was temporally associated with distinct national and regional effects on notified levels of disease activity. These effects were most pronounced in the early years of the dispersal (1939-1941) and corresponded with initial levels of evacuation-related population change at the regional and district scales.","['Smallman-Raynor MR', 'Cliff AD']",2015,143,14,Epidemiol Infect,"Smallman-Raynor MR and Cliff AD.

25653857,Bacterial infections in childhood: A risk factor for gastrointestinal and other diseases?,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence for post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) in adults, but little is known about PI-IBS in children. The nationwide representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) assessed children's health.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We identified 643 children (50.1% males) in the KiGGS cohort (N = 15,878, 51% males) with a history of Salmonella infection. The number was validated comparing this group with the known infection statistics from the Robert Koch-Institute registry. We compared this group to the remaining KiGGS cohort (n = 12,951) with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, pain and quality of life. To check for specificity, we repeated the comparisons with a group with a history of scarlet fever.
RESULTS: Infection statistics predicted 504 cases of Salmonella infection in the KiGGS cohort, indicating high validity of the data. In children between 3 and 10 years with a history of Salmonella infection, significantly more abdominal pain (31.7% versus 21.9%, p < 0.001) and headache (27.2% versus 15.1%, p < 0.001) were reported. This group showed lower quality of life (p < 0.001). Comparison to a group of scarlet fever-infected children revealed poor specificity of the data.
CONCLUSION: Differences found between children with and without Salmonella infection reveal the role of gastrointestinal infection in the development of post-infectious abdominal problems, but poor specificity may point toward a psychosocial (""somatization"") rather than a Salmonella-specific mechanism.","['Schwille-Kiuntke J', 'Unverdorben A', 'Weimer K', 'Schlarb AA', 'Gulewitsch MD', 'Ellert U', 'Enck P']",2015,3,1,United European Gastroenterol J,"Schwille-Kiuntke J, et al.

METHODS: 72 strains of GAS were isolated from throat swabs of children with scarlet fever or asymptomatic carriers of GAS. All the strains were typed by emm typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), super-antigen (SAg) genes detections and pulsed-field gel electrophoreses (PFGE).
RESULTS: Among the 72 strains, emm1 (41.67%) and emm12 (56.94%) were the most common emm types. Two ST types were found, including ST28 (43.06%) and ST36 (56.94%). Additionally, emm1 was also found correlated to ST28, while emm12 was associated with ST36. Eight super-antigen genes were detected, including smeZ (100.00%), ssa (100.00%), speG (97.22%), speC (95.83%), speL (54.17%), speJ (41.67%), speA (38.89%) and speH (38.89%), while speK, speM, speL were not found (0%). Both speA and speJ genes were detected primarily in emm1 strains (all P < 0.05), while speH and speI genes were not detected in emm 1 strains (all P < 0.05).

Recently, we identified two mobile genetic elements that were closely associated with emm12 outbreak isolates: the integrative and conjugative element ICE-emm12, encoding genes for tetracycline and macrolide resistance, and prophage ΦHKU.vir, encoding the superantigens SSA and SpeC, as well as the DNase Spd1 (ref. 4). Here we sequenced the genomes of 141 emm12 isolates, including 132 isolated in Hong Kong between 2005 and 2011. We found that the introduction of several ICE-emm12 variants, ΦHKU.vir and a new prophage, ΦHKU.ssa, occurred in three distinct emm12 lineages late in the twentieth century. Acquisition of ssa and transposable elements encoding multidrug resistance genes triggered the expansion of scarlet fever-associated emm12 lineages in Hong Kong. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant ssa-harboring scarlet fever strains should prompt heightened surveillance within China and abroad for the dissemination of these mobile genetic elements.","['Davies MR', 'Holden MT', 'Coupland P', 'Chen JH', 'Venturini C', 'Barnett TC', 'Zakour NL', 'Tse H', 'Dougan G', 'Yuen KY', 'Walker MJ']",2015,47,1,Nat Genet,"Davies MR, et al.

25225919,The effect of childhood infection on hearing function at age 61 to 63 years in the newcastle thousand families study.,"OBJECTIVES: It is known that childhood hearing function can become impaired after the occurrence of specific infections. However, evidence on the effect of common childhood infections on adult hearing function is limited. The objective of the study was to identify whether associations exist between the occurrence of common childhood infections in a UK birth cohort and hearing function across different frequencies at age 61 to 63 years.
DESIGN: The Newcastle Thousand Families study is a birth cohort of all individuals born in May and June 1947 to mothers resident in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. Of the original cohort members who had an audiometry test at age 61 to 63 years, 333 had data available on infections during their first year of life and 296 on infections up to their fifth year of life. These data were analyzed using linear regression in relation to adult hearing function across differing frequencies in isolation.
RESULTS: After adjustment for sex, overcrowding in the first year, having had an ear operation, and having worked in a loud environment, significant negative associations were identified between adult hearing and tonsillitis at 250 Hz (p = 0.013), 1 kHz (p = 0.018), 6 kHz (p = 0.012), and 8 kHz (p = 0.033); otorrhea at 4 kHz (p = 0.005), 6 kHz (p = 0.003), and 8 kHz (p = 0.002); bronchitis (two or more episodes) at 2 kHz (p = 0.001), 3 kHz (p = 0.005), 4 kHz (p = 0.009), 6 kHz (p < 0.001), and 8 kHz (p < 0.001); and the total number of severe respiratory infections in the first year at 2 kHz (p = 0.037), 3 kHz (p = 0.049), 4 kHz (p = 0.030), 6 kHz (p < 0.001), and 8 kHz (p = 0.006). That is, individuals who had tonsillitis, bronchitis (twice or more), otorrhea, or a severe respiratory infection (twice or more) in their first year of life were more likely to have impaired adult hearing function than those who did not have any infections in early life.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of some, but not all, childhood infections appears to have an effect on adult hearing function across different frequencies. Reducing the incidence of infectious diseases in early life may reduce subsequent incidence of hearing impairment among adults. However, further research in modern cohorts is needed to clarify the links between infectious childhood diseases and adult hearing function.","['Pearson F', 'Mann KD', 'Rees A', 'Davis A', 'Pearce MS']",2015,36,2,Ear Hear,"Pearson F, et al.

25135501,Scarlet fever in Poland in 2012.,"OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation was performed by analysing surveillance data published in the bulletin, ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012"" (Warsaw 2013, NIPH-NIH, CSI) and also in bulletins from previous years, and unpublished data collected under Statistical survey program of official statistics.
RESULTS: In the last 15-20 years in Poland has been observed more than 2-fold lengthening of scarlet fever epidemic cycle, slowdown in the decline and slower growth rate in epidemic curve and decrease in average annual incidence. In 2012, in the country a total of 25 421 cases were registered and incidence was 66.0 per 100 000 population (in voivodeships: from 25.8 in łódzkie to 114.2 in pomorskie). The highest incidence was notified in 5-year-old (1094.7) and 6-year-old children (877.3), however, the incidence among children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 95.6% of all cases. The incidence of men (74.8) was higher by almost 30% than the incidence of women (57.6). The incidence was higher in urban areas than in rural areas and was 72.7 (in rural area 55.7). 0.9% of patients were hospitalized. No deaths related to the disease were reported.
SUMMARY: Distinct changes in the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in recent decades are related to, i.a., aging of the Polish population and decline in the number of children, group particularly vulnerable to infection. In order to improve accuracy of surveillance data, it is recommended significantly increase percentage of cases in which clinical diagnosis will be confirmed by the result of bacteriological examination.","['Staszewska E', 'Kondej B', 'Czarkowski MP']",2014,68,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Staszewska E, et al.

25072049,Comorbidity of infectious diseases and anxiety disorders in adults and its association with quality of life: a community study.,"OBJECTIVE: Infectious diseases and anxiety disorders are common and both are associated with substantial burden to individual, families, and society. A better understanding of their association may be helpful in explicating possible etiological mechanisms related to both. The goal of the current study was to investigate the relationship between specific infectious diseases and anxiety disorders among adults in the community, and to examine whether the co-occurrence of the two is associated with poorer quality of life compared to subjects with one or neither condition.
METHODS: We used data from the 1998 German Mental Health survey with 4181 subjects aged 18-65. Various infectious diseases (lifetime) and health-related quality of life were assessed via self-report questionnaires and anxiety disorders (past 12-months) were diagnosed using M-CIDI interviews. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between infectious diseases and anxiety disorders; a linear model adjusted for sex was used to examine whether comorbidity of infectious diseases and anxiety disorders was associated with quality of life.
RESULTS: Whooping cough [odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.36-2.09], scarlet fever (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02-1.68), and diphtheria (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.21-2.64) were associated with increased prevalence of any anxiety disorder. Subjects with both infectious diseases and anxiety disorders reported lower levels of both mental and physical quality of life, compared with subjects with only one or neither condition.
CONCLUSION: Extending prior research, this study suggests a relationship between specific infectious diseases and anxiety disorders in an adult community sample. Research targeting etiological mechanisms related to the interplay between infectious diseases and anxiety disorders is warranted.","['Witthauer C', 'Gloster AT', 'Meyer AH', 'Goodwin RD', 'Lieb R']",2014,2,,Front Public Health,"Witthauer C, et al.

25008823,"Erythromycin-resistant genes in group A β-haemolytic Streptococci in Chengdu, Southwestern China.","CONTEXT: The management of Group A β-haemolytic Streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes or GAS) infection include the use of penicillins, cephalosporins or macrolides for treatment. A general increase in macrolides resistance in GAS has been observed in recent years. Differences in rates of resistance to these agents have existed according to geographical location and investigators.
AIMS: To investigate the antibiotic pattern and erythromycin-resistant genes of GAS isolates associated with acute tonsillitis and scarlet fever in Chengdu, southwestern China.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: To assess the macrolide resistance, phenotype, and genotypic characterization of GAS isolated from throat swabs of children suffering from different acute tonsillitis or scarlet fever between 2004 and 2011 in the city of Chengdu, located in the southwestern region of China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration with seven antibiotics was performed on 127 GAS isolates. Resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant GAS isolates were determined by the double-disk test. Their macrolide-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermTR) were amplified by PCR.
RESULTS: A total of 98.4% (125/127) of the isolates exhibited resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin G and cefotaxime. Moreover, 113 ermB-positive isolates demonstrating the cMLS phenotype of erythromycin resistance were predominant (90.4%) and these isolates showed high-level resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin (MIC 90>256 μg/ml); 12 (9.6%) isolates demonstrating the MLS phenotype of erythromycin resistance carried the mefA gene, which showed low-level resistance to both erythromycin (MIC 90=8 μg/ml) and clindamycin (MIC 90=0.5 μg/ml); and none of the isolates exhibited the M phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The main phenotype is cMLS, and the ermB gene code is the main resistance mechanism against macrolides in GAS. Penicillin is the most beneficial for treating GAS infection, and is still used as first-line treatment. And macrolide antibiotics are not recommended for treatment of GAS infection in children because of the high rates of antimicrobial resistance in mainland China.","['Zhou W', 'Jiang YM', 'Wang HJ', 'Kuang LH', 'Hu ZQ', 'Shi H', 'Shu M', 'Wa CM']",2014,32,3,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Zhou W, et al.

24969448,[Analysis of effect on infectious diseases outbreak detection performance by classifying provinces for moving percentile method].,"OBJECTIVE: Providing evidences for further modification of China Infectious Diseases Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS) via analyzing the outbreak detection performance of Moving Percentile Method (MPM) by optimizing thresholds in different provinces.
METHODS: We collected the amount of MPM signals, response results of signals in CIDARS, cases data in nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System, and outbreaks data in Public Health Emergency Reporting System of 16 infectious diseases in 31 provinces in Chinese mainland from January 2011 to October 2013. The threshold with the optimal sensitivity, the shortest time to detect outbreak and the least number of signals was considered as the best threshold of each disease in Chinese mainland and in each province.
RESULTS: Among all the 16 diseases, the optimal thresholds of 10 diseases, including dysentery, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid and paratyphoid, meningococcal meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, scarlet fever, leptospirosis, hepatitis, typhus in country level were the 90(th) percentile (P90), which was the same as provincial level for those diseases.For the other 6 diseases, including other infectious diarrhea, influenza, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, mumps, rubella and epidemic hemorrhagic fever, the nationwide optimal thresholds were the 80th percentile (P80), which was different from that by provinces for each disease. For these 6 diseases, the number of signals generated by MPM with the optimal threshold for each province was decreased by 23.71% (45 557), 15.59% (6 124), 14.07% (1 870), 9.44% (13 881), 8.65% (1 294) and 6.03% (313) respectively, comparing to the national optimal threshold, while the sensitivity and time to detection of CIDARS were still the same.
CONCLUSION: Optimizing the threshold by different diseases and provinces for MPM in CIDARS could reduce the number of signals while maintaining the same sensitivity and time to detection.","['Zhang H', 'Sun Q', 'Lai S', 'Ren X', 'Zhou D', 'Ye X', 'Zeng L', 'Yu J', 'Wang L', 'Yu H', 'Li Z', 'Lyu W', 'Lan Y', 'Yang W']",2014,48,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Zhang H, et al.

METHODS: The application performance for outbreak detection of temporal model and temporal-spatial model simultaneously running among 208 pilot counties in 20 provinces from 2011 to 2013 was compared; the 16 infectious diseases were divided into two classes according to the disease incidence level; cases data in nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System was combined with outbreaks reported to Public Health Emergency Reporting System, by adopting the index of the number of signals, sensitivity, false alarm rate and time for detection.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of temporal model and temporal-spatial model for 16 diseases was 96.23% (153/159) and 90.57% (144/159) respectively, without significant difference (Z = -1.604, P = 0.109), and the false alarm rate of temporal model (1.57%, 57 068/3 643 279) was significantly higher than that of temporal-spatial model (0.64%, 23 341/3 643 279) (Z = -3.408, P = 0.001), while the median time for detection of these two models was not significantly different, which was 3.0 days and 1.0 day respectively (Z = -1.334, P = 0.182).For 6 diseases of type I which represent the lower incidence, including epidemic hemorrhagic fever,Japanese encephalitis, dengue, meningococcal meningitis, typhus, leptospirosis, the sensitivity was 100% for both models (8/8, 8/8), and the false alarm rate of both temporal model and temporal-spatial model was 0.07% (954/1 367 437, 900/1 367 437), with the median time for detection being 2.5 days and 3.0 days respectively. The number of signals generated by temporal-spatial model was reduced by 2.29% compared with that of temporal model.For 10 diseases of type II which represent the higher incidence, including mumps, dysentery, scarlet fever, influenza, rubella, hepatitis E, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, hepatitis A, typhoid and paratyphoid, and other infectious diarrhea, the sensitivity of temporal model was 96.03% (145/151), and the sensitivity of temporal-spatial model was 90.07% (136/151), the number of signals generated by temporal-spatial model was reduced by 59.36% compared with that of temporal model. Compared to temporal model, temporal-spatial model reduced both the number of signals and the false alarm rate of all the type II diseases;and the median of outbreak detection time of temporal model and temporal-spatial model was 3.0 days and 1.0 day, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the temporal-spatial model had better outbreak detection performance, but the performance of two different models varies for infectious diseases with different incidence levels, and the adjustment and optimization of the temporal model and temporal-spatial model should be conducted according to specific infectious disease in CIDARS.","['Lai S', 'Liao Y', 'Zhang H', 'Li X', 'Ren X', 'Li F', 'Yu J', 'Wang L', 'Yu H', 'Lan Y', 'Li Z', 'Wang J', 'Yang W']",2014,48,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Lai S, et al.

24875883,Bacterial superantigens promote acute nasopharyngeal infection by Streptococcus pyogenes in a human MHC Class II-dependent manner.,"Establishing the genetic determinants of niche adaptation by microbial pathogens to specific hosts is important for the management and control of infectious disease. Streptococcus pyogenes is a globally prominent human-specific bacterial pathogen that secretes superantigens (SAgs) as 'trademark' virulence factors. SAgs function to force the activation of T lymphocytes through direct binding to lateral surfaces of T cell receptors and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) molecules. S. pyogenes invariably encodes multiple SAgs, often within putative mobile genetic elements, and although SAgs are documented virulence factors for diseases such as scarlet fever and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), how these exotoxins contribute to the fitness and evolution of S. pyogenes is unknown. Here we show that acute infection in the nasopharynx is dependent upon both bacterial SAgs and host MHC-II molecules. S. pyogenes was rapidly cleared from the nasal cavity of wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice, whereas infection was enhanced up to ∼10,000-fold in B6 mice that express human MHC-II. This phenotype required the SpeA superantigen, and vaccination with an MHC -II binding mutant toxoid of SpeA dramatically inhibited infection. Our findings indicate that streptococcal SAgs are critical for the establishment of nasopharyngeal infection, thus providing an explanation as to why S. pyogenes produces these potent toxins. This work also highlights that SAg redundancy exists to avoid host anti-SAg humoral immune responses and to potentially overcome host MHC-II polymorphisms.","['Kasper KJ', 'Zeppa JJ', 'Wakabayashi AT', 'Xu SX', 'Mazzuca DM', 'Welch I', 'Baroja ML', 'Kotb M', 'Cairns E', 'Cleary PP', 'Haeryfar SM', 'McCormick JK']",2014,10,5,PLoS Pathog,"Kasper KJ, et al.

24685039,[Case classification in measles surveillance system under the Two-level Logistic Model].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence rates of Rash and Febrile Illnesses (RFIs) including measles, rubella, scarlet fever, exanthema subitum and the differences among measles and other RFIs to tentatively formulate the logistic regression model through clinical manifestation.
METHODS: All the suspected cases of measles, rubella, scarlet fever, exanthema subitum reported by the county/prefecture lever hospitals at four counties were collected during March 2011 to February 2012. When setting laboratory confirmed measles as dependent variable and existed symptoms as independent variable, a logistic regression model was formulated and optimal operational point (OOP)chosen, according to the ROC curve.
RESULTS: A total number of 551 cases were collected but the consistency of measles diagnosis between clinical and laboratory was not satisfied, with Kappa value = 0.349, same to the diagnosis of rubella. As for the result from the two-lever logistic regression model, symptoms that related to the confirmation of measles would include cough (OR = 5.75), conjunctivitis (OR = 3.00), Koplik spot (OR = 7.52), lymphadenectasis(OR = 0.07), rash after fever (OR = 0.07). The area under ROC curve was 0.97 and the optimal operational point was 0.249.
CONCLUSION: A logistic regression model was formulated using the clinical symptoms which was resulted in better performance on prediction. As the sample size of this survey was small, the expansion on the scale of investigation and laboratory testings were needed before the types and components of measles-related RFIs be clarified.","['Li H', 'Ao R', 'Peng L', 'Li D', 'Zhang J']",2014,35,1,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Li H, et al.

METHODS: A total of 199 strains of GAS were collected from 36 hospitals in Beijing between May and July, 2012. All strains were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ten antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, tigecycline, vancomycin, linezolid and streptogramin) were detected by VITEK-2 compact with GPS-67 test kit. The genes encoding macrolides resistance (ermA, ermB and mefA ) were amplified and tested by PCR. The macrolides resistant phenotype of group A streptococcus was detected by double disc test (D-test).
RESULTS: Among 199 strains of GAS collected in this study, 101(50.8%) were from suburbs and the other 98(49.2%) were from urban areas. 111(55.8%) strains were collected from scarlet fever patients while the other 88(44.2%) were from oropharyngeal infection cases. All the strains were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin, and the percentage of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were 96.5% (192/199), 95.5% (190/199) and 92.0% (183/199), respectively. All strains were susceptible to levofloxacin, tigecycline, vancomycin, linezolid and streptogramin. The rates of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were different in different districts, however, the difference in it between ages and clinical diagnosis did not show statistical significance (P > 0.05) . The detected rate of drug resistance gene ermB was 98.5% (196/199). The gene ermA was only detected out in 5 strains and the gene mefA was not detected out. 199 strains showed A macrolides resistant phenotype cMLS, while the phenotype iMLS was not found in this study.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the high level of clindamycin resistance in group A streptococcus collected from children in Beijing, 2012. The macrolides resistance of group A streptococcus was highly prevalent in Beijing, and the dominant phenotype was cMLS mediated by gene ermB.","['Peng XM', 'Yang P', 'Liu S', 'Li J', 'Zhang DT', 'Liu YM', 'Liang HJ', 'Cui SJ', 'Wu SS', 'Wang QY']",2013,47,11,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Peng XM, et al.

METHODS: Seventy-four Streptococcal pyogenes involved in an outbreak of scarlet fever were isolated from pediatric patients in the areas with high incidence in China from May to August of 2011. Emm genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), superantigen (SAg) genes and antimicrobial susceptibility profiling were analyzed for these isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 4 different emm types were identified. Emm12 was the most prevalent type which contained four predominating PFGE patterns corresponding to four different virulence and superantigen profiles. Emm12 (79.7%) and emm1 (14.9%) accounted for approximately 94% of all the isolates. The speA gene was all negative in emm12 isolates and positive in emm1 isolates. All strains were resistant to erythromycin, and 89.4% of them were resistant to erythromycin, tracycline, and clindamycin simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: Several highly diversified clones with a high macrolide resistance rate comprise a predominant proportion of circulating strains, though no new emm type was found in this outbreak.

24168973,"Scarlet fever is caused by a limited number of Streptococcus pyogenes lineages and is associated with the exotoxin genes ssa, speA and speC.","BACKGROUND: Several outbreaks of scarlet fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes were recently reported. Scarlet fever is historically considered a toxin-mediated disease, dependent on the production of the exotoxins SpeA and SpeC, but a strict association between scarlet fever and these exotoxins is not always detected. The aims of this study were to characterize the scarlet fever bacterial isolates recovered from patients in a Lisbon hospital and to identify any distinctive characteristics of such isolates.
METHODS: We characterized a collection of 303 pharyngeal S. pyogenes collected between 2002 and 2008. One-hundred and one were isolated from scarlet fever patients and 202 were associated to a diagnosis of tonsillo-pharyngitis. Isolates were characterized by T and emm typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiling and superantigen gene profiling.
RESULTS: The diversity of the scarlet fever isolates was lower than that of the pharyngitis isolates. Specific lineages of emm87, emm4 and emm3 were overrepresented in scarlet fever isolates but only 1 pulsed field gel electrophoresis major lineage was significantly associated with scarlet fever. Multivariate analysis indicated associations of ssa, speA and speC with scarlet fever.
CONCLUSIONS: In nonoutbreak conditions, scarlet fever is caused by a number of distinct genetic lineages. The lower diversity of these isolates and the association with specific exotoxin genes indicates that some lineages are more prone to cause this presentation than others even in nonoutbreak conditions.","['Silva-Costa C', 'Carriço JA', 'Ramirez M', 'Melo-Cristino J']",2014,33,3,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Silva-Costa C, et al.

24094501,The trend of macrolide resistance and emm types of group A streptococci from children at a medical center in southern Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common pathogen in children. Macrolide resistance in GAS has been described worldwide. The aims of this study are to analyze macrolide resistance of GAS isolates in southern Taiwan and to clarify the relationship of emm typing and macrolide resistance in the past decade.
METHODS: All GAS isolated from patients younger than 18 years at a single tertiary center in southern Taiwan were collected from 2000 to 2012. Antibiotics susceptibility to erythromycin, azithromycin, and clindamycin were determined by agar dilution method, and were interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. emm typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 301 isolates were collected during the period of 13 years. Scarlet fever (38.5%) and acute pharyngitis (32.2%) were the most common diagnosis. Decreased resistance rate of erythromycin from 53.1% in 2000 to 0% in 2010 was found, but it increased rapidly to 65% in 2011. The resistance rate of azithromycin was the lowest (4.2%) in 2005, but was higher than 15% after 2006. The involvement of the erythromycin resistance genes were mefA (53.1%), ermB (35.9%), and ermTR (10.9%). The resistance of clindamycin also increased since 2011. emm12 was the most common serotype and accounted for 44.9% of all isolates. Compared with the non-emm12 group, resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and clindamycin were more frequently detected in the emm12 group.
CONCLUSION: Increased resistance of GAS to macrolide and clindamycin was found in recent years. emm12 was the main serotype for macrolide resistance.","['Chuang PK', 'Wang SM', 'Lin HC', 'Cho YH', 'Ma YJ', 'Ho TS', 'Shen CF', 'Liu CC']",2015,48,2,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Chuang PK, et al.

24040717,Scarlet fever in Poland in 2011.,"OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2011 MATERIALS AND MATHODS: The evaluation was performed by analysing the data published in the bulletin, ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2011"" (Warsaw 2012, NIPH-NIH, CSI) and also in bulletins from previous years.
RESULTS: Since 2004 in Poland has been observed epidemic increase in the number of scarlet fever cases. However, the growth rate is significantly slower and incidence is considerably lower than in previous epidemic periods. In 2011, in the country a total of 18 267 cases were registered and incidence was 47.4 per 100,000 population (in provinces: from 23.4 in Łódzkie to 68.0 in Slaskie). The highest incidence was notified in 5-year-old and 6-year-old children (782.4), whereas the incidence of children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 96.9% of all cases. The incidence of men 53.7 by almost 30% was higher than the incidence of women (41.6). The incidence was higher in urban areas than in rural areas and was 53.3 (in rural area 38.3). 1.1% of patients were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.
SUMMARY: An impact on the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in the last two decades have i.a. demographic changes--decline in the population of children, i.e. in group which is particularly vulnerable to infection.

24018301,Molecular analysis of a novel Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain containing virulence protein of Y. pseudotuberculosis among Far East scarlet-like fever serotype I strains.,"Pathogenicity of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is determined by an arsenal of virulence factors. Particularly, the Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) and the Type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded on the pYV virulence plasmid are required for Yersinia pathogenicity. A specific group of Y. pseudotuberculosis, responsible for the clinical syndrome described as Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), is known to have an altered virulence gene cluster. Far East strains cause unique clinical symptoms for which the pYV virulence plasmid plays apparently a rather secondary role. Here, we characterize a previously unknown protein of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I strains (TcpYI) which can be found particularly among the FESLF strain group. The TcpYI protein shares considerable sequence homology to members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family. Bacterial TIR domain containing proteins (Tcps) interact with the innate immune system by TIR-TIR interactions and subvert host defenses via individual, multifaceted mechanisms. In terms of virulence, it appears that the TcpYI protein of Y. pseudotuberculosis displays its own virulence phenotype compared to the previously characterized bacterial Tcps. Our results clearly demonstrate that TcpYI increases the intracellular survival of the respective strains in vitro. Furthermore, we show here that the intracellular survival benefit of the wild-type strain correlates with an increase in tcpYI gene expression inside murine macrophages. In support of this, we found that TcpYI enhances the survival inside the spleens of mice in a mouse model of peritonitis. Our results may point toward involvement of the TcpYI protein in inhibition of phagocytosis, particularly in distinct Y. pseudotuberculosis strains of the FESLF strain group where the pYV virulence plasmid is absent.","['Nörenberg D', 'Wieser A', 'Magistro G', 'Hoffmann C', 'Meyer C', 'Messerer M', 'Schubert S']",2013,303,8,Int J Med Microbiol,"Nörenberg D, et al.

23978807,Factors influencing the indication for tonsillectomy: a historical overview and current concepts.,"Tonsil surgery has been performed for more than 3,000 years. During the 19th century when anesthesia became available, techniques were refined and the number of procedures performed increased. Repeated throat infections often causing big tonsils was the reason why parents asked for the procedure. During the preantibiotic era, scarlet fever was feared since potential heart or kidney complications were life-threatening. The technique used before 1900 was tonsillotomy since neither a fingernail, snare nor the later 'guillotine' were used extracapsularly. Bleeding was small and the surgery ambulatory. Extracapsular tonsillectomy developed around the turn of the 20th century with the purpose of avoiding remnants - the 'focal infection theory' was prevailing. The whole tonsil was now extirpated with good visibility of the tonsillar area in a deeply anesthetized patient. During the first half of the 20th century, the two methods competed, but by 1950, total tonsillectomy had become the only 'correct' tonsil surgery. The indication was still recurrent infections. The risk for serious bleeding increased; therefore large clinics arose where patients remained for at least a week after tonsillectomy. When oral penicillin for children became available during the 1960s, the threat of throat infection decreased and the number of tonsillectomies declined. The awareness of obstructive problems in children rose at the same time when obstructive sleep apnea syndrome became a disease for adults (1970s). Tonsillotomy was revived during the 1990s and is today used increasingly in many countries. The indication is mainly obstructive sleep apnea syndromeor sleep-disordered breathing, especially in small children. Total tonsillectomy is still preferred for recurrent infections, which include periodic fever/adenitis/pharyngitis/aphthous ulcer syndrome and recurrent peritonsillitis.","['Hultcrantz E', 'Ericsson E']",2013,75,3,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,Hultcrantz E and Ericsson E.

By utilising historical data, it is possible to assess what factors may have increased hearing problems in children in the past, and this may be used to inform current public health policies to protect children against hearing loss and in turn reduce the long-term burden on individuals and services that may possible evolve. The aim of this study was to investigate which factors in early life significantly impacted on hearing level in childhood using existing data from the Newcastle Thousand Families Study, a 1947 birth cohort.
METHODS: Data on early life factors, including growth, socio-economic status and illness, and hearing at age 14 years were collated for a representative subset of individuals from the cohort (n = 147). Factors were assessed using linear regression analysis to identify associations with hearing thresholds.
RESULTS: Males were found to have lower hearing thresholds at 250 Hz, 500 Hz and 1 kHz. Main analyses showed no associations between hearing thresholds and early life growth or socio-economic indicators. An increasing number of ear infections from birth to age 13 years was associated with hearing thresholds at 250Hz (p = 0.04) and 500Hz (p = 0.03), which remained true for females (p = 0.050), but not males (p = 0.213) in sex-specific analysis. Scarlet fever and bronchitis were associated with hearing thresholds at 8 kHz. After adjustment for all significant predictors at each frequency, results remained unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no associations between childhood hearing thresholds and early life growth and socio-economic status.

23788594,Immune complex binding Streptococcus pyogenes type M12/emm12 in experimental glomerulonephritis.,"In a rabbit model, we have previously reported evidence for a pathogenic role of streptococcal IgG Fc-binding proteins (IgGFcBP) in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). These proteins, of the M protein family, were shown to trigger anti-IgG production and enhance renal deposition of IgG and/or immune complexes (ICs), with resulting activation of complement and cytokine cascades. In the present study, type M12/emm12, group A streptococci (GAS) were found often to bind artificial ICs, viz. peroxidase-anti-peroxidase rabbit IgG (PAP) or tetanus toxoid-anti-tetanus human IgG (TAT), rather than monomeric IgG. Animals injected with each of four IC binding clinical isolates (from patients with scarlet fever or PSGN) showed pronounced inflammatory and degenerative glomerular changes, morphologically similar to human PSGN, with membrane thickening and IgG and complement C3 deposition, as well as secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α by mesangial and endothelial cells. In contrast, non-binding strains (two from asymptomatic carriers and one from a PSGN case) failed to trigger any renal changes. Only the IC binding strains induced elevated titres of anti-IgG. Though the streptococcal binding component(s) has not been demonstrated, the selective binding of ICs by type M12/emm12 strains appears important for the well-known, marked nephritogenic potential of this GAS type.","['Burova L', 'Pigarevsky P', 'Duplik N', 'Snegova V', 'Suvorov A', 'Schalen C', 'Totolian A']",2013,62,Pt 9,J Med Microbiol,"Burova L, et al.

23746087,Spectral analysis based on fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of surveillance data: the case of scarlet fever in China.,"Many infectious diseases exhibit repetitive or regular behaviour over time. Time-domain approaches, such as the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, are often utilized to examine the cyclical behaviour of such diseases. The limitations for time-domain approaches include over-differencing and over-fitting; furthermore, the use of these approaches is inappropriate when the assumption of linearity may not hold. In this study, we implemented a simple and efficient procedure based on the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) approach to evaluate the epidemic dynamic of scarlet fever incidence (2004-2010) in China. This method demonstrated good internal and external validities and overcame some shortcomings of time-domain approaches. The procedure also elucidated the cycling behaviour in terms of environmental factors. We concluded that, under appropriate circumstances of data structure, spectral analysis based on the FFT approach may be applicable for the study of oscillating diseases.","['Zhang T', 'Yang M', 'Xiao X', 'Feng Z', 'Li C', 'Zhou Z', 'Ren Q', 'Li X']",2014,142,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Zhang T, et al.

During 2011, a scarlet fever epidemic characterized by peak monthly incidence rates 2.9-6.7 times higher than those in 2006-2010 occurred in Beijing, China. During the epidemic, hospital-based enhanced surveillance for scarlet fever and pharyngitis was conducted to determine characteristics of circulating GAS strains. The surveillance identified 3,359 clinical cases of scarlet fever or pharyngitis. GAS was isolated from 647 of the patients; 76.4% of the strains were type emm12, and 17.1% were emm1. Almost all isolates harbored superantigens speC and ssa. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and resistance rates were 96.1% to erythromycin, 93.7% to tetracycline, and 79.4% to clindamycin. Because emm12 type GAS is not the predominant type in other countries, wider surveillance for the possible spread of emm12 type GAS from China to other countries is warranted.","['Yang P', 'Peng X', 'Zhang D', 'Wu S', 'Liu Y', 'Cui S', 'Lu G', 'Duan W', 'Shi W', 'Liu S', 'Li J', 'Wang Q']",2013,19,6,Emerg Infect Dis,"Yang P, et al.

METHODS: Based on the monthly scarlet fever data from 1970 to 2004, Complex Morlet wavelet was adopted to analyze the annual incidence and the incidence of six climatic factors in the past 35 years. Its association with the cycles of FEP-SCF was explored. The features of heavenly stems and earthly branches in the year that the wave peak corresponded and their correlations with doctrine of FEPSCF were analyzed.
RESULTS: The annual incidence of scarlet fever and the incidence of FEPSCF had two main cycles, i.e., 5 years and 28 years. The 5-year primary cycle was consistent with 5-year cycle of FEPSCF theory. The high incidence year of 5-year primary cycle was Jinyun.
CONCLUSIONS: The cycle of five evolutive phases was consistent with the onset cycle of scarlet fever. The quasi-periodic phenomenon and multi-cycle superimposed phenomenon of FEPSCF theory existed in the incidence of scarlet fever.","['Fu BZ', 'Tang QL', 'Huang L', 'He J']",2013,33,3,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,"Fu BZ, et al.

23639381,Molecular characterization of Group A streptococcal isolates causing scarlet fever and pharyngitis among young children: a retrospective study from a northern Taiwan medical center.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Little information is available on the differences in frequency of pyrogenic exotoxin genes between strains of group A streptococci that cause scarlet fever and those that cause pharyngotonsillitis in children in Taiwan. This study retrospectively monitored the presence of pyrogenic exotoxin genes, the emm typing, and the susceptibility of macrolide drugs in Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from children diagnosed with scarlet fever and pharyngotonsillitis in northern Taiwan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolates of S. pyogenes were recovered from children with scarlet fever (n = 21) and acute pharyngotonsillitis (n = 29) during 2000-2011. The isolates were characterized according to the presence of spe genes and emm typing. Antibiograms were determined by the disk diffusion method and agar dilution test. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of erm genes in isolates that showed nonsusceptibility to erythromycin. All isolates underwent additional genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: In isolates from patients with scarlet fever, the frequencies of pyrogenic exotoxin genes were 9.5% for speA, 81.0% for speB, 4.8% for speC, and 71.4% for speF. In isolates from patients with pharyngotonsillitis, the frequencies were 17.2% for speA, 72.4% for speB, 13.8% for speC, and 69.0% for speF. There were no significant differences in frequencies of the exotoxin genes between the two groups of isolates. Eight emm sequence types were identified from all group A streptococci isolates. The most common types were emm12 followed by emm1 and emm4. The erythromycin resistant rate was 4/50 (8%). The ermB gene was detected in only one isolate from a patient with pharyngotonsillitis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis had a total of three sets of clustered strains, which showed >80% homology and belonged to the same emm type.
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in frequencies of the spe genes between S. pyogenes isolates from patients with scarlet fever and patients with pharyngotonsillitis. The most common emm type was emm12. Low erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes was observed.","['Wu PC', 'Lo WT', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang CC']",2014,47,4,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Wu PC, et al.

23446443,Skin findings of Staphylococcus aureus toxin-mediated infection in relation to toxin encoding genes.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and toxic shock syndrome are associated with exfoliatins and superantigens, respectively; and are easy to distinguish in their usual presentation. However, there is confusion about the mild forms of these 2 staphylococcal diseases. These mild forms are both designated as ""staphylococcal scarlet fever"" despite differences in their pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Our study aimed to distinguish between the clinical characteristics of the rash associated with exfoliatins and the rash associated with superantigens.
METHODS: Patients were selected from the French National Reference Center for Staphylococci. We retrospectively compared the clinical characteristics of patients with a generalized rash during Staphylococcus aureus infection. Patients who met the criteria of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or toxic shock syndrome were excluded. The patients were classified into 2 groups depending on the presence of a gene coding for exfoliatin or for superantigenic toxin.
RESULTS: We included 13 cases with exfoliatin and 9 with superantigens. The patients of the exfoliatin group were more likely to have facial involvement, fold involvement and a superficial focus of infection. In the second group, S. aureus was isolated from a deeper focus in 8 of 9 patients.
CONCLUSION: Mild forms of S. aureus toxin-mediated infection affect the pediatric population. Examination made it possible to distinguish an exanthema associated with an exfoliatin from one associated with a superantigen. This early clinical distinction results in differences in management.","['Courjon J', 'Hubiche T', 'Phan A', 'Tristan A', 'Bès M', 'Vandenesch F', 'Etienne J', 'Del Giudice P', 'Gillet Y']",2013,32,7,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Courjon J, et al.

23397325,Systemic antibiotic use among children and adolescents in Germany: a population-based study.,"UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to comprehensively describe antibiotic use among children and young adolescents in Germany. Outpatient prescriptions of systemic antibiotics to children (<15 years) were analysed using data from four German statutory health insurances for the years 2004 to 2006. Annual prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions was determined using the average number of insured children during the respective year as reference population. Annual antibiotic prescription rates were calculated per 1,000 person years. Both figures were stratified by age (0-4, 5-9 and 10-14 years) and sex. Frequent indications for prescribing were analysed. Annual prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions rose from 35.68 % [95 % confidence intervals (CI), 35.62-35.75] in 2004 to 37.79 % [95 % CI, 37.72-37.86] in 2006. Prescription rates slightly increased by 6.01 % from 668.54 [95 % CI, 667.34-669.72] antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 person years in 2004 to 708.71 [95 % CI, 707.47-709.95] in 2006. In 2006, prescriptions of broad-spectrum penicillins (25.09 %), second-generation cephalosporins (18.11 %) and narrow-spectrum penicillins (16.45 %) were most frequent. The most common indication for antibiotic prescribing was tonsillitis followed by bronchitis, otitis media, acute upper respiratory infections and scarlet fever.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to other northern European countries, paediatric prescription rates are high in Germany. This and the frequent prescribing of broad spectrum agents for the treatment of mostly viral self-limiting conditions indicate limited adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines in antibiotic prescribing in the German outpatient setting.","['Holstiege J', 'Garbe E']",2013,172,6,Eur J Pediatr,Holstiege J and Garbe E.

METHODS: During May to July in 2011, a total of 3315 patients who were diagnosed scarlet fever or pharyngeal infection by doctors in pediatric outpatient and emergency units of 36 hospitals, were selected as subjects. Their throat swab samples were collected and isolated the strains of GAS. Gene emm was then amplified and sequenced by PCR method, and the differences in types of gene emm between different populations and diseases were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 633 strains of GAS were isolated from the 3315 throat swab samples, 610 strains out of which were gene emm positive and were recruited in the study. Out of the 610 recruited strains, 448 (73.4%) were isolated from scarlet fever patients, the other 162 (26.6%) were isolated from pharyngeal infection patients; 397 (65.1%) were from urban, the other 213 (34.9%) were from suburb; 240 (39.4%) were from patients aging between 1 - 5 years old, the other 369(60.6%) were from patients aging 6 - 18 years old. A total of 8 types of gene emm (scarlet fever: 6 types, pharyngeal infection: 4 types) and 21 subtypes of gene emn (scarlet fever: 16 subtypes, pharyngeal infection: 10 subtypes) were identified. Three new subtypes were found in the study, naming emm1.63, emm12.62 and st5144.20. Among them, emm1.63 was found both in scarlet fever and pharyngeal infection patients, while emm12.62 and st5144. 20 were only found in pharyngeal infection patients. Among all the types of gene-emm, emm12 accounted for the highest percentage as 80.5% (491/610) and then followed by emm1 (18.0% (110/610)). Among all the subtypes, the dominant subtype was emm12.00, accounting for 69.0% (421/610), following by emm1.00 (16.9% (103/610)) and emm12.19 (6.1% (37/610)). All the above types and subtypes of gene emm were the most prevalent strains in scarlet fever patients and pharyngeal infection patients. Significant differences in the distribution of prevalent strains were observed among various aging patients and regions. The constituent ratios of emm1, emm1.00 and emm12.19 were higher in patients from suburb (emm1: 22.1% (47/213), emm1.00: 19.2% (40/213), emm12.19: 8.0% (17/213)) than those in urban areas (emm1: 15.9% (63/397), emm1.00: 15.6% (62/397), emm12.19: 5.0% (20/397)). The difference showed statistical significance (P < 0.05). The constituent ratio of emm1.00 was higher among patients aging 6-18 years old (19.2% (71/369)) than those aging 1 - 5 years old (13.3% (32/240)). The difference also showed statistical significance (χ(2) = 8.45, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Among the types of gene emm in GAS isolated from children in Beijing in year 2011, the most prevalent two were emm12 and emm1, and the most prevalent emm subtypes were emm12.00, emm1.00 and emm12.19. A significant difference in their distribution between various aging patients and isolated places can be obviously found.","['Li J', 'Liu S', 'Peng XM', 'Yang P', 'Zhang DT', 'Wu SS', 'Liang HJ', 'Cui SJ', 'Duan W', 'Lu GL', 'Wang QY']",2012,46,12,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Li J, et al.

23305889,MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based identification of group A Streptococcus isolated from areas of the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak in china.,"There was a dramatic increase in scarlet fever cases in China from March to July 2011. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the only pathogen known to cause scarlet fever. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to Biotyper system was used for GAS identification in 2011. A local reference database (LRD) was constructed, evaluated and used to identify GAS isolates. The 75 GAS strains used to evaluate the LRD were all identified correctly. Of the 157 suspected β-hemolytic strains isolated from 298 throat swab samples, 127 (100%) and 120 (94.5%) of the isolates were identified as GAS by the MALDI-TOF MS system and the conventional bacitracin sensitivity test method, respectively. All 202 (100%) isolates were identified at the species level by searching the LRD, while 182 (90.1%) were identified by searching the original reference database (ORD). There were statistically significant differences with a high degree of credibility at species level (χ(2)=6.052, P<0.05 between the LRD and ORD). The test turnaround time was shortened 36-48h, and the cost of each sample is one-tenth of the cost of conventional methods. Establishing a domestic database is the most effective way to improve the identification efficiency using a MALDI-TOF MS system. MALDI-TOF MS is a viable alternative to conventional methods and may aid in the diagnosis and surveillance of GAS.","['Xiao D', 'You Y', 'Bi Z', 'Wang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu B', 'Song Y', 'Zhang H', 'Kou Z', 'Yan X', 'Zhang M', 'Jin L', 'Jiang X', 'Su P', 'Bi Z', 'Luo F', 'Zhang J']",2013,14,,Infect Genet Evol,"Xiao D, et al.

23275159,Structure and activity of the Streptococcus pyogenes family GH1 6-phospho-β-glucosidase SPy1599.,"The group A streptococcus Streptococcus pyogenes is the causative agent of a wide spectrum of invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis, scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome. In the context of its carbohydrate chemistry, it is interesting that S. pyogenes (in this work strain M1 GAS SF370) displays a spectrum of oligosaccharide-processing enzymes that are located in close proximity on the genome but that the in vivo function of these proteins remains unknown. These proteins include different sugar transporters (SPy1593 and SPy1595), both GH125 α-1,6- and GH38 α-1,3-mannosidases (SPy1603 and SPy1604), a GH84 β-hexosaminidase (SPy1600) and a putative GH2 β-galactosidase (SPy1586), as well as SPy1599, a family GH1 `putative β-glucosidase'. Here, the solution of the three-dimensional structure of SPy1599 in a number of crystal forms complicated by unusual crystallographic twinning is reported. The structure is a classical (β/α)(8)-barrel, consistent with CAZy family GH1 and other members of the GH-A clan. SPy1599 has been annotated in sequence depositions as a β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), but no such activity could be found; instead, three-dimensional structural overlaps with other enzymes of known function suggested that SPy1599 contains a phosphate-binding pocket in the active site and has possible 6-phospho-β-glycosidase activity. Subsequent kinetic analysis indeed showed that SPy1599 has 6-phospho-β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.86) activity. These data suggest that SPy1599 is involved in the intracellular degradation of 6-phosphoglycosides, which are likely to originate from import through one of the organism's many phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransfer systems (PEP-PTSs).","['Stepper J', 'Dabin J', 'Eklof JM', 'Thongpoo P', 'Kongsaeree P', 'Taylor EJ', 'Turkenburg JP', 'Brumer H', 'Davies GJ']",2013,69,Pt 1,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Stepper J, et al.

METHODS: The case-control study, conducted in Belgrade during the period 2001-2005, comprised 110 subjects diagnosed for the first time as PD cases, and 220 controls chosen among patients with degenerative joint disease and some diseases of the digestive tract.
RESULTS: According to logistic regression analysis, PD was significantly related to mumps [odds ratio adjusted on occupation and family history of PD (aOR) = 7.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.77-16.36], scarlet fever (aOR = 12.18, 95% CI = 1.97-75.19), influenza (aOR = 8.01, 95% CI = 4.61-13.92), whooping cough (aOR = 19.90, 95% CI = 2.07-190.66) and herpes simplex infections (aOR = 11.52, 95% CI = 2.25-58.89). Tuberculosis, measles and chicken pox were not associated with PD. Other infectious diseases we asked for were not reported (12 diseases), or were too rare (four diseases) to be analysed.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained are in line with the suggestion that some infectious diseases may play a role in the development of PD.","['Vlajinac H', 'Dzoljic E', 'Maksimovic J', 'Marinkovic J', 'Sipetic S', 'Kostic V']",2013,123,5,Int J Neurosci,"Vlajinac H, et al.

23242849,Group a streptococcal diseases and their global burden.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes has been recognised as an important human pathogen since early days of modern microbiology, and it remains among the top ten causes of mortality from an infectious disease. Clinical manifestations attributable to this organism are perhaps the most diverse of any single human pathogen. These encompass invasive GAS infections, with high mortality rates despite effective antimicrobials, toxin-mediated diseases including scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, the autoimmune sequelae of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis with potential for long-term disability, and nuisance manifestations of superficial skin and pharyngeal infection, which continue to consume a sizable proportion of healthcare resources. Although an historical perspective indicates major overall reductions in GAS infection rates in the modern era, chiefly as a result of widespread improvements in socioeconomic circumstances, this pathogen remains as a leading infectious cause of global morbidity and mortality. More than 18 million people globally are estimated to suffer from serious GAS disease. This burden disproportionally affects least affluent populations, and is a major cause of illness and death among children and young adults, including pregnant women, in low-resource settings. We review GAS transmission characteristics and prevention strategies, historical and geographical trends and report on the estimated global burden disease attributable to GAS. The lack of systematic reporting makes accurate estimation of rates difficult. This highlights the need to support improved surveillance and epidemiological research in low-resource settings, in order to enable better assessment of national and global disease burdens, target control strategies appropriately and assess the success of control interventions.","['Ralph AP', 'Carapetis JR']",2013,368,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Ralph AP and Carapetis JR.

23226687,Hunger for iron: the alternative siderophore iron scavenging systems in highly virulent Yersinia.,"Low molecular weight siderophores are used by many living organisms to scavenge scarcely available ferric iron. Presence of at least a single siderophore-based iron acquisition system is usually acknowledged as a virulence-associated trait and a pre-requisite to become an efficient and successful pathogen. Currently, it is assumed that yersiniabactin (Ybt) is the solely functional endogenous siderophore iron uptake system in highly virulent Yersinia (Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica biotype 1B). Genes responsible for biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of the yersiniabactin (ybt) production are clustered on a mobile genetic element, the High-Pathogenicity Island (HPI) that is responsible for broad dissemination of the ybt genes in Enterobacteriaceae. However, the ybt gene cluster is absent from nearly half of Y. pseudotuberculosis O3 isolates and epidemic Y. pseudotuberculosis O1 isolates responsible for the Far East Scarlet-like Fever. Several potential siderophore-mediated iron uptake gene clusters are documented in Yersinia genomes, however, neither of them have been proven to be functional. It has been suggested that at least two siderophores alternative to Ybt may operate in the highly virulent Yersinia pestis/Y. pseudotuberculosis group, and are referred to as pseudochelin (Pch) and yersiniachelin (Ych). Furthermore, most sporadic Y. pseudotuberculosis O1 strains possess gene clusters encoding all three iron scavenging systems. Thus, the Ybt system appears not to be the sole endogenous siderophore iron uptake system in the highly virulent yersiniae and may be efficiently substituted and/or supplemented by alternative iron siderophore scavenging systems.","['Rakin A', 'Schneider L', 'Podladchikova O']",2012,2,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Rakin A, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was based mainly on data published in the bulletin, ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010"" (Warsaw 2011, NIPH-NIH , CSI).
RESULTS: Since 2004, Poland is observed epidemic growth in the number of scarlet fever cases. However, incidence level is much lower than in previous epidemic periods. There were 13,940 cases registered in 2010 in total and the incidence was 36.5 per 100,000 population ranging from 18.1 in łódzkie voivodeship to 47.5 in mazowieckie voivodeship. Cases among children and adolescents of less than 15 years of age accounted for 97.0% of all cases. The highest incidence was observed among 4 years old children (603.1) and 5 years old children (624.9). Incidence in men (41.8) markedly exceeded the incidence in women (31.6) and incidence in urban areas (41.3) and in rural areas (29.0). Approximately 1.2% of all cases were hospitalized. Due to scarlet fever there were no deaths in Poland in 2010.
SUMMARY: Favourable epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland is largely a result of demographic changes--reducing the involvement of children in society. In terms of disease prevention and control is necessary to increase the proportion of cases in which clinical diagnosis is confirmed by the result of bacteriological tests.","['Staszewska E', 'Kondej B', 'Czarkowski MP']",2012,66,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Staszewska E, et al.

26038416,Streptococcus pyogenes and re-emergence of scarlet fever as a public health problem.,"Explosive outbreaks of infectious diseases occasionally occur without immediately obvious epidemiological or microbiological explanations. Plague, cholera and Streptococcus pyogenes infection are some of the epidemic-prone bacterial infections. Besides epidemiological and conventional microbiological methods, the next-generation gene sequencing technology permits prompt detection of genomic and transcriptomic profiles associated with invasive phenotypes. Horizontal gene transfer due to mobile genetic elements carrying virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance, or mutations associated with the two component CovRS operon are important bacterial factors conferring survival advantage or invasiveness. The high incidence of scarlet fever in children less than 10 years old suggests that the lack of protective immunity is an important host factor. A high population density, overcrowded living environment and a low yearly rainfall are environmental factors contributing to outbreak development. Inappropriate antibiotic use is not only ineffective for treatment, but may actually drive an epidemic caused by drug-resistant strains and worsen patient outcomes by increasing the bacterial density at the site of infection and inducing toxin production. Surveillance of severe S. pyogenes infection is important because it can complicate concurrent chickenpox and influenza. Concomitant outbreaks of these two latter infections with a highly virulent and drug-resistant S. pyogenes strain can be disastrous.","['Wong SS', 'Yuen KY']",2012,1,7,Emerg Microbes Infect,Wong SS and Yuen KY.

22615319,Molecular characterization of the 2011 Hong Kong scarlet fever outbreak.,"A scarlet fever outbreak occurred in Hong Kong in 2011. The majority of cases resulted in the isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes emm12 with multiple antibiotic resistances. Phylogenetic analysis of 22 emm12 scarlet fever outbreak isolates, 7 temporally and geographically matched emm12 non-scarlet fever isolates, and 18 emm12 strains isolated during 2005-2010 indicated the outbreak was multiclonal. Genome sequencing of 2 nonclonal scarlet fever isolates (HKU16 and HKU30), coupled with diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assays, identified 2 mobile genetic elements distributed across the major lineages: a 64.9-kb integrative and conjugative element encoding tetracycline and macrolide resistance and a 46.4-kb prophage encoding superantigens SSA and SpeC and the DNase Spd1. Phenotypic comparison of HKU16 and HKU30 with the S. pyogenes M1T1 strain 5448 revealed that HKU16 displays increased adherence to HEp-2 human epithelial cells, whereas HKU16, HKU30, and 5448 exhibit equivalent resistance to neutrophils and virulence in a humanized plasminogen murine model. However, in contrast to M1T1, the virulence of HKU16 and HKU30 was not associated with covRS mutation. The multiclonal nature of the emm12 scarlet fever isolates suggests that factors such as mobile genetic elements, environmental factors, and host immune status may have contributed to the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak.","['Tse H', 'Bao JY', 'Davies MR', 'Maamary P', 'Tsoi HW', 'Tong AH', 'Ho TC', 'Lin CH', 'Gillen CM', 'Barnett TC', 'Chen JH', 'Lee M', 'Yam WC', 'Wong CK', 'Ong CL', 'Chan YW', 'Wu CW', 'Ng T', 'Lim WW', 'Tsang TH', 'Tse CW', 'Dougan G', 'Walker MJ', 'Lok S', 'Yuen KY']",2012,206,3,J Infect Dis,"Tse H, et al.

Investigation of the epidemiology could enhance our understanding of the factors related to the outbreak.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the demographic and seasonal characteristics of children with scarlet fever and the outcome. During the peak month of the 2011 outbreak, 45 GAS isolates recovered from pediatric patients and 13 (43.3%) GAS isolates recovered from 30 asymptomatic student contacts were characterized by emm typing, superantigen profiles, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotypes, mutilocus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: The 2011 outbreak of scarlet fever started in April and peaked in May and June. Boys outnumbered girls (65.1% versus 34.9%). Preschool and primary school children accounted for 96% of cases. No severe outcome was found. emm1, emm12 and emm75 were identified among 58 GAS isolates, and 53 (91.4%) isolates belonged to emm12, st36.

The McIsaac sore throat score is a clinical prediction score used to improve the detection rate of GAS pharyngitis. We evaluated the validity of the McIsaac sore throat score in Southern Taiwan and compared our findings to those of other studies.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed chart records from children aged 3 to 15 years old who complained of fever and sore throat. They had throat cultures collected at the outpatient pediatric clinic of Fooyin University Hospital, located in Pingtung County, Taiwan during the period between January 2007 and January 2010. Clinical characteristics were reviewed, and sore throat score was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 342 throat cultures met the inclusion criteria of sore throat and fever. The positive rate of GAS was 4.1%. Culture-positive cases were associated with higher odds for a skin rash [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 14.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.63-46.40, p < 0.001), lower odds for cough (AOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.85, p = 0.030) and having a runny nose (AOR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.99, p = 0.048). The most common physical sign was scarlet fever rash (AOR: 57.35, 95% CI: 15.45-212.98, p < 0.001).

22318812,"Kawasaki disease: laboratory findings and an immunopathogenesis on the premise of a ""protein homeostasis system"".","Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limited systemic inflammatory illness, and coronary artery lesions (CALs) are a major complication determining the prognosis of the disease. Epidemiologic studies in Asian children suggest that the etiologic agent(s) of KD may be associated with environmental changes. Laboratory findings are useful for the diagnosis of incomplete KD, and they can guide the next-step in treatment of initial intravenous immunoglobulin non-responders. CALs seem to develop in the early stages of the disease before a peak in inflammation. Therefore early treatment, before the peak in inflammation, is mandatory to reduce the risk of CAL progression and severity of CALs. The immunopathogenesis of KD is more likely that of acute rheumatic fever than scarlet fever. A hypothetical pathogenesis of KD is proposed under the premise of a ""protein homeostasis system""; where innate and adaptive immune cells control pathogenic proteins that are toxic to host cells at a molecular level. After an infection of unknown KD pathogen(s), the pathogenic proteins produced from an unknown focus, spread and bind to endothelial cells of coronary arteries as main target cells. To control the action of pathogenic proteins and/or substances from the injured cells, immune cells are activated. Initially, non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies are involved in this reaction, while hyperactivated immune cells produce various cytokines, leading to a cytokine imbalance associated with further endothelial cell injury. After the emergence of specific T cells and specific antibodies against the pathogenic proteins, tissue injury ceases and a repair reaction begins with the immune cells.","['Lee KY', 'Rhim JW', 'Kang JH']",2012,53,2,Yonsei Med J,"Lee KY, et al.

21910730,Respiratory alkalosis in children with febrile seizures.,"PURPOSE: Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common type of convulsive events in children. FS are suggested to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying FS remain unclear. Using an animal model of experimental FS, it was demonstrated that hyperthermia causes respiratory alkalosis with consequent brain alkalosis and seizures. Here we examine the acid-base status of children who were admitted to the hospital for FS. Children who were admitted because of gastroenteritis (GE), a condition known to promote acidosis, were examined to investigate a possible protective effect of acidosis against FS.
METHODS: We enrolled 433 age-matched children with similar levels of fever from two groups presented to the emergency department. One group was admitted for FS (n = 213) and the other for GE (n = 220). In the FS group, the etiology of fever was respiratory tract infection (74.2%), otitis media (7%), GE (7%), tonsillitis (4.2%), scarlet fever (2.3%) chickenpox (1.4%), urinary tract infection (1.4%), postvaccination reaction (0.9%), or unidentified (1.4%). In all patients, capillary pH and blood Pco(2) were measured immediately on admission to the hospital.
KEY FINDINGS: Respiratory alkalosis was found in children with FS (pH 7.46 ± 0.04, [mean ± standard deviation] Pco(2) 29.5 ± 5.5 mmHg), whereas a metabolic acidosis was seen in all children admitted for GE (pH 7.31 ± 0.03, Pco(2) 37.7 ± 4.3 mmHg; p < 0.001 for both parameters). No FS were observed in the latter group. A subgroup (n = 15; 7%) of the patients with FS had GE and, notably, their blood pH was more alkaline (pH 7.44 ± 0.04) than in the GE-admitted group. During the enrollment period, eight of the patients were admitted on separate occasions because of FS or GE. Consistent with the view that generation of FS requires a genetic susceptibility in addition to acute seizure triggering factors, each of these patients had an alkalotic blood pH when admitted because of FS, whereas they had an acidotic pH (and no FS) when admitted because of GE (pH 7.47 ± 0.05 vs. pH 7.33 ± 0.03, p < 0.005).
SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that FS are associated with a systemic respiratory alkalosis, irrespective of the severity of the underlying infection as indicated by the level of fever. The lack of FS in GE patients is attributable to low pH, which also explains the fact that children with a susceptibility to FS do not have seizures when they have GE-induced fever that is associated with acidosis. The present demonstration of a close link between FS and respiratory alkalosis may pave the way for further clinical studies and attempts to design novel therapies for the treatment of FS by controlling the systemic acid-base status.","['Schuchmann S', 'Hauck S', 'Henning S', 'Grüters-Kieslich A', 'Vanhatalo S', 'Schmitz D', 'Kaila K']",2011,52,11,Epilepsia,"Schuchmann S, et al.

21894070,[A history of malaria in modern Korea 1876-1945].,"Although it is not certain when malaria began to appear in Korea, malaria is believed to have been an endemic disease from ancient times. It was Dr. H. N. Allen (1858-1932) who made the first description and diagnosis of malaria in terms of Western medicine. In his first year report (1885) of Korean Government Hospital he mentioned malaria as the most prevalent disease. Very effective anti-malarial drug quinine was imported and it made great contribution in treating malaria. After Japan had annexed Korea in 1910, policies for public health system were fundamentally revised. Japan assumed control of Korean medical institutions and built high-quality Western hospitals for the health care of Japanese residents. The infectious diseases which were under special surveillance were cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, typhus, scarlet fever, smallpox, and paratyphoid fever. Among chronic infectious diseases tuberculosis and leprosy were those under special control. Malaria, however, was not one of these specially controlled infectious diseases although it was widely spread throughout the peninsula. But serious studies on malaria were carried out by Japanese medical scientists. In particular, a Japanese parasitologist Kobayasi Harujiro(1884-1969) carried out extensive studies on human parasites, including malaria, in Korea. According to his study, most of the malaria in Korea turned out to be tertian fever. In spite of its high prevalence, malaria did not draw much attention from the colonial authorities and no serious measure was taken since tertian fever is a mild form of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax and is not so much fatal as tropical malaria caused by P. falciparum. And tertian malaria was easily controlled by taking quinine. Although the majority of malaria in Korea was tertian fever, other types were not absent. Quartan fever was not rarely reported in 1930s. The attitude of colonial authorities toward malaria in Korea was contrasted with that in Taiwan. After Japan had set out to colonize Taiwan as a result of Sino-Japanese war, malaria in Taiwan was a big obstacle to the colonization process. Therefore, a lot of medical scientists were asked to engage the malaria research in order to handle health problems in colonized countries caused by malaria. Unlike the situation in Taiwan, malaria in Korea did not cause a serious health problem as in Taiwan. However, its risk was not negligible. In 1933 there were almost 130,000 malaria patients in Korea and 1,800 patients among them died of malaria. The Japanese Government General took measures to control malaria especially during the 1930s and the number of patients decreased. However, as Japan engaged in the World War II, the general hygienic state of the society worsened and the number of malarial patients increased. The worsened situation remains the same after Liberation (1945) and during the Korean war (1950-53).",['Yeo I'],2011,20,1,Uisahak,Yeo I. [A history of malaria in modern Korea 1876-1945].

21855727,Cutaneous signs of systemic disease.,"Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.","['Patel LM', 'Lambert PJ', 'Gagna CE', 'Maghari A', 'Lambert WC']",2011,29,5,Clin Dermatol,"Patel LM, et al.

21569724,[Comparison on the different thresholds on the 'moving percentile method' for outbreak detection].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the different thresholds of 'moving percentile method' for outbreak detection in the China Infectious Diseases Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS).
METHODS: The thresholds of P(50), P(60), P(70), P(80) and P(90) were respectively adopted as the candidates of early warning thresholds on the moving percentile method. Aberration was detected through the reported cases of 19 notifiable infectious diseases nationwide from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010. Number of outbreaks and time to detection were recorded and the amount of signals acted as the indicators for determining the optimal threshold of moving percentile method in CIDARS.
RESULTS: The optimal threshold for bacillary and amebic dysentery was P(50). For non-cholera infectious diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid, and epidemic mumps, it was P(60). As for hepatitis A, influenza and rubella, the threshold was P(70), but for epidemic encephalitis B it was P(80). For the following diseases as scarlet fever, typhoid and paratyphoid, hepatitis E, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, malaria, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, meningococcal meningitis, leptospirosis, dengue fever, epidemic endemic typhus, hepatitis C and measles, it was P(90). When adopting the adjusted optimal threshold for 19 infectious diseases respectively, 64 840 (12.20%) signals had a decrease, comparing to the adoption of the former defaulted threshold (P(50)) during the 2 years. However, it did not reduce the number of outbreaks being detected as well as the time to detection, in the two year period.
CONCLUSION: The optimal thresholds of moving percentile method for different kinds of diseases were different. Adoption of the right optimal threshold for a specific disease could further optimize the performance of outbreak detection for CIDARS.","['Sun Q', 'Lai SJ', 'Li ZJ', 'Lan YJ', 'Zhang HL', 'Zhao D', 'Jin LM', 'Yang WZ']",2011,32,5,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Sun Q, et al.

21048104,Superantigen-induced proliferation of human CD4+CD25- T cells is followed by a switch to a functional regulatory phenotype.,"Bacterial superantigens are potent T cell activators. In humans they cause toxic shock and scarlet fever, and they are implicated in Kawasaki's disease, autoimmunity, atopy, and sepsis. Their function remains unknown, but it may be to impair host immune responses increasing bacterial carriage and transmission. Regulatory (CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) T cells (Tregs) play a role in controlling inflammatory responses to infection. Approximately 2% of circulating T cells are naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs). Conventional Ag stimulation of naive FOXP3(-) T cells induces Ag-specific Tregs. Polyclonal T cell activation has been shown to produce non-Ag-specific Tregs. Because superantigens are unique among microbial virulence factors in their ability to trigger polyclonal T cell activation, we wanted to determine whether superantigen stimulation of T cells could induce non-Ag-specific Tregs. We assessed the effect of superantigen stimulation of human T cells on activation, regulatory markers, and cytokine production by flow cytometry and T cell suppression assays. Stimulation of PBMCs with staphylococcal exotoxin A and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L resulted in dose-dependent FOXP3 expression. Characterization of this response for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin K/L confirmed its Vβ specificity, that CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells arose from CD25(-) T cells and required APCs. These cells had increased CTLA-4 and CD127 expression, typical of the recently described activated converted Treg-like cells, and exhibited functional suppressor activity comparable to nTregs. Superantigen-stimulated CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T cells expressed IL-10 at lower superantigen concentrations than was required to trigger IFN-γ production. This study provides a mechanism for bacterial evasion of the immune response through the superantigen induction of Tregs.","['Taylor AL', 'Llewelyn MJ']",2010,185,11,J Immunol,Taylor AL and Llewelyn MJ.

Differences in prescription rates between physician groups have only rarely been examined. We compared the prescription of antibiotics for systemic use in children between pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs).
METHOD: Data source was the statutory health insurance sample AOK Hesse/KV Hesse. Overall, 47,033 insured children in 2006 between 2 and 17 years of age were included in the analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for an antibiotic prescription were calculated by logistic regression adjusted for confounders, comparing pediatricians with GPs. Diagnosis-specific models were constructed.
RESULTS: GPs and pediatricians prescribed 79.3% of all antibiotics in 2006 (40.6% and 38.7%, respectively). Significantly decreased ORs for an antibiotic prescription were observed for pediatricians, with OR (95% CI) of 0.46 (0.43-0.49), 0.40 (0.30-0.54) and 0.40 (0.30-0.53) for respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections and nonsuppurative otitis media, respectively. No significant associations were observed assessing scarlet fever, pneumonia and suppurative otitis media, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, pediatricians were associated with a lower antibiotic prescription rate regarding diagnoses where antibiotic therapy is not clearly indicated. However, in diagnoses where antibiotic therapy is clearly indicated, no differences in prescription rates between pediatricians and GPs were observed. Further studies are warranted to gain insight into different treatment strategies between different groups of medical practitioners.","['Abbas S', 'Ihle P', 'Heymans L', 'Küpper-Nybelen J', 'Schubert I']",2010,135,37,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Abbas S, et al.

The aim of the study was to describe clinical and molecular characteristics of mucoid strains causing this outbreak and to compare them with a sample of non-mucoid S. pyogenes isolates obtained during the same period of time.
METHODS: All S. pyogenes isolates with a mucoid colony morphology (n = 132), 10% of non-mucoid (n = 144) and all invasive S. pyogenes isolates (n = 7) obtained in 2009 were included. Characterization was performed by T-agglutination, emm typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing.
RESULTS: One clone characterized as emm3.1/ST15 comprised 98.5% (n = 130) of all mucoid isolates. Subjects of all ages were affected. Main clinical manifestations were pharyngitis and scarlet fever, but this clone also caused invasive disease: two cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, one arthritis, and one celullitis with a fatal outcome. Mucoid isolates were more prone to cause invasive disease than non-mucoid isolates (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although no acute rheumatic fever cases were detected, the most worrisome characteristics of this clone were the success for causing invasive disease and the merge of two virulent features: the serotype, emm3, and capsule hyper-production, expressed as a mucoid morphology.","['Tamayo E', 'Montes M', 'García-Medina G', 'García-Arenzana JM', 'Pérez-Trallero E']",2010,10,,BMC Infect Dis,"Tamayo E, et al.

Nevertheless, the past decades have witnessed a worldwide resurgence in invasive disease and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The objective of the present study is to evaluate the genetic diversity, virulence gene distribution (spe, sme and ssa genes) and susceptibility pattern of 10 S. pyogenes isolates causing invasive disease and STSS. The isolates were recovered from blood cultures of hospitalized patients at Hospital Santamarina and Nueva Clínica Chacabuco, Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina between 12/2000-04/2005. Two pulse field gel electrophoretic patterns predominated. The most frequent one included 5 characteristic isolates of emm1-T1 type, toxin gene profile speA, speB, speF, speG and smeZ. The second pattern included 2 characteristic isolates of emm3-TNT type (speB, speF, speG). The other 3 isolates corresponded to types emm49-TNT (speB, speC, speF, speG), emm75-T25 (speB, speF, speG) and emm83-TNT (speB, speF, speG, ssa, smeZ). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and rifampicin. The data from the present study demonstrated genetic diversity among the strains. Types emm1 and emm3 were prevalent in invasive disease.

20364476,[Variability of the INV gene fragment encoding a functionally important domain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin].,"A total of 84 Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were studied. The isolates were obtained in Russian Federation in 1967-2008. The majority of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates (n = 55) were of clinical origin and were isolated from feces of patients with the clinically and serologically proved diagnosis of pseudotuberculosis/Far East scarlet-like fever. These isolates included 18 isolates obtained from 3 outbreaks. Nine isolates were isolated from the internal organs of wild rodents. Other isolates were obtained from environmental sources. Ten Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonged to the serovar III and the other isolates belonged to the serovar I. The sequences of 600 b.p. fragment of the inv gene that encodes 667 through 866 invasin amino acids were determined for all isolates. Totally, 3 allelic variants were found. The most abundant allele 1 was found in 76 isolates. The allele 1 is represented in the database Genbank by the strain IP31758 isolated in the Far East of Russia (Eppinger et al., 2007). The allele 2 differed from allele 1 in 3 positions: G,2299N, O2300N, and O2302N. Substitutions in positions 2299 and 2302 were non-synonymous and resulted in amino acid substitutions Ser768 Thr and Val769 Ala. Six isolates carried allele 2. Allele 3 was found in two isolates different from allele 2 by a synonymous substitution G2324O. This allele is similar to the sequence found in Y. pestis strains, represented in the GenBank. The allelic distribution was not serovar specific: Y. pseudotuberculosis of serovar III and majority of serovar I isolates carried allele 1. The analysis of the allelic distribution among subpopulations formed on the base of a source of isolation revealed a statistically significant difference in spreading of alleles among clinical and wild rodent isolates (p < 0.05). Allele 1 prevailed over clinical isolates (95%), while allele 1 and allele 2 were disseminated equally among rodent isolates (55 % and 45 %, respectively).","['Adgamov RR', 'Timchenko NF', 'Allenov AV', 'Ermolaeva SA']",2010,,1,Mol Gen Mikrobiol Virusol,"Adgamov RR, et al.

Because Victorian epidemiologists first recognized the milk-borne route in outbreaks of typhoid fever, these investigations served as a model for later studies of milk-borne scarlet fever, diphtheria, and perhaps tuberculosis. By focusing on epidemiological practices conducted by Medical Inspectors at the Medical Department of the Local Government Board and Medical Officers of Health, I show that Victorian epidemiology was committed to field-based, observational methods that defined the professional nature of the discipline and its theories and practices. Epidemiological investigations of milk-borne typhoid heated up several important public health debates in the second half of the nineteenth century, and demonstrate how Victorian epidemiology was not solely wedded to examining population studies using statistical methods, as historians have typically argued, but also relied on observational case-tracing in individuals, animals, and even environments.",['Steere-Williams J'],2010,65,4,J Hist Med Allied Sci,Steere-Williams J.

The characteristic clinical features of Kawasaki's disease are fever> or =102 degrees F for> or =5 days accompanied by a bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis/conjunctival suffusion, erythematous rash, cervical adenopathy, pharyngeal erythema, and swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet. Kawasaki's disease primarily affects children and is rare in adults. In children, Kawasaki's disease is more likely to be associated with aseptic meningitis, coronary artery aneurysms, and thrombocytosis. In adult Kawasaki's disease, unilateral cervical adenopathy, arthritis, conjunctival suffusion/conjunctivitis, and elevated serum transaminases (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) are more likely. Kawasaki's disease in adults may be mimicked by other acute infections with fever and rash, that is, group A streptococcal scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF). Because there are no specific tests for Kawasaki's disease, diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and the syndromic approach. In addition to rash and fever, scarlet fever is characterized by circumoral pallor, oropharyngeal edema, Pastia's lines, and peripheral eosinophilia, but not conjunctival suffusion, splenomegaly, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, thrombocytosis, or an elevated SGOT/SGPT. In TSS, in addition to rash and fever, there is conjunctival suffusion, oropharyngeal erythema, and edema of the dorsum of the hands/feet, an elevated SGOT/SGPT, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with TSS do not have cervical adenopathy or splenomegaly. RMSF presents with fever and a maculopapular rash that becomes petechial, first appearing on the wrists/ankles after 3 to 5 days. RMSF is accompanied by a prominent headache, periorbital edema, conjunctival suffusion, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, an elevated SGOT/SGPT, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, but not oropharyngeal erythema. We present a case of adult Kawasaki's disease with myocarditis and splenomegaly. The patient's myocarditis rapidly resolved, and he did not develop coronary artery aneurysms. In addition to splenomegaly, this case of adult Kawasaki's disease is remarkable because the patient had highly elevated serum ferritin levels of 944-1303 ng/mL; (normal<189 ng/mL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of adult Kawasaki's disease with highly elevated serum ferritin levels. This is also the first report of splenomegaly in adult Kawasaki's disease. We conclude that Kawasaki's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in adult patients with rash/fever for> or =5 days with conjunctival suffusion, cervical adenopathy, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, thrombocytosis and otherwise unexplained highly elevated ferritin levels.","['Cunha BA', 'Pherez FM', 'Alexiadis V', 'Gagos M', 'Strollo S']",2010,39,2,Heart Lung,"Cunha BA, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials contained in the 1996-2007 annual official statistical records (forms Nos. 12, 14, 16-BH, C-51, of the State Committee for Statistics) were analyzed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An average of 3.1 million (207.1 per 10,000 population) cases of SGA infection were annually notified in Russia. In the latter, the average annual rates of the incidence and prevalence of SGA infection (other than scarlet fever) in all age groups were much greater than those in Moscow. The average annual incidence of rheumatism was 5.1 and 6.0 per 10,000 in the RF and Moscow, respectively. The cases and days of temporary disability in Moscow were 2-3 times lower than those in the RF. The incidence and prevalence of other forms of SGA infection among the RF population significantly increased from 1 to 4%. In Moscow, there was a significant reduction in the incidence and prevalence of renal diseases, a decrease in the incidence of chronic rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, and sinusitis and in their prevalence. The prevalence of chronic tonsillitis, adenoiditis and paratonsillar abscesses tended to increase while their incidence showed no significant changes.

20036064,Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) antibody levels in Japanese children.,"Children with burns have a greater risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) than adults. This risk is thought to be associated with colonisation by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus in children with insufficient antibody titers. The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because, in the early stages, its signs and symptoms resemble those of other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly, the mortality rate is high. This study was designed to determine the titers of TSST-1 serum antibody in Japanese children, in order to prevent TSS and facilitate its early diagnosis. Between May 2006 and May 2007, we studied 119 patients who were treated in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of Kanazawa Medical University Hospital. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test the level of the IgG antibody to TSST-1 in the patients' serum samples. The percentage of cases testing for TSST-1 antibody in the patients under 6 months old was 78.6%, and it was lowest (21.3%) in the age group from 6 to 12 months old. The group of patients older than 41 years showed the highest rate of positivity (100.0%) for TSST-1 antibody. Higher titers of TSST-1 antibody were found within the first 6 months after birth, and lower titers were found between 6 months and 2 years old. The titers began to increase again after age three. The high morbidity of TSS in children around 2 years of age was proven to be related to changes in the titers of TSST-1 antibody. Infants under 6 months old are protected from TSS because of the high level of TSST-1 antibody they receive from their mother. Children are at risk of developing staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome when their immune system is immature and they have no protective circulating anti-TSS antibodies.","['Quan L', 'Morita R', 'Kawakami S']",2010,36,5,Burns,"Quan L, et al.

When controlled for the potential confounding effects of school, year and season, multivariate negative binomial regression revealed a positive association between the level of appendicitis activity and the recorded rate of mumps (beta=0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.24, P<0.001). Non-significant associations were identified between appendicitis and the other sample infectious diseases.

19947304,[Streptococcus pyogenes--much more than the aetiological agent of scarlet fever].,"The grampositive bacterium S. pyogenes (beta-haemolytic group A Streptococcus) is a natural colonizer of the human oropharynx mucous membrane and one of the most common agents of infectious diseases in humans. S. pyogenes causes the widest range of disease in humans among all bacterial pathogens. It is responsible for various skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa and erysipelas, and localized mucous membrane infections of the oropharynx (e. g. tonsillitis and pharyngitis). Betahaemolytic group A Streptococcus causes also invasive diseases such as sepses including puerperal sepsis. Additionally, S. pyogenes induces toxin-mediated syndromes, i. e. scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). STSS and NF are severe, frequently fatal diseases that have emerged in Europe and Northern America during the last two decades. Finally, some immunpathological diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis also result from S. pyogenes infections. Most scientists recommend penicillins (benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicllin) as drugs of first choice for treatment of Streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever. Erysipelas and some other skin infections should be treated with benzylpenicillin. Intensive care measurements are needed for treatment of severe toxin-mediated S. pyogenes diseases. These measurements include the elimination of internal bacterial foci, concomitant application of clindamycin and benzylpenicillin and suitable treatment of shock symptoms. Management of immunpathological diseases requires antiphlogistical therapy. Because of the wide distribution of S. pyogenes in the general population and the lack of an effective vaccine, possibilities for prevention allowing a suitable protection for diseases due to S. pyogenes are very limited.",['Stock I'],2009,32,11,Med Monatsschr Pharm,Stock I.

Notifiable diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To seek evidence for a possible infectious origin of the type 1 epidemic of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Faroe Islands. This began in 1943 coincident with their British military occupation throughout World War II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained from the Danish National Health Service were assessed for all notifiable diseases in the Faroe Islands reported from 1900 to 1977.
RESULTS: Among 38 disorders, selective increases were found for acute infectious gastroenteritis (AIGE) and paradysentery, with outbreaks in late 1940 and in 1943 shortly after the introduction and later marked influx, respectively, of British troops. Five other infections showed elevated numbers in 1941 and 1942.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a temporal association of AIGE and paradysentery in the Faroe Islands with the first arrival and later marked augmentation of British forces stationed there during the war. Rises in the incidence of other diseases in 1941-1942 seem more likely a consequence of increased foreign commercial travel by Faroese at that time.","['Wallin MT', 'Heltberg A', 'Kurtzke JF']",2010,122,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Wallin MT, et al.

With that, vaccines are among the environmental factors implicated as triggers for the development of inflammatory myopathies. The sporadic reports on vaccine-induced inflammatory myopathies include cases of hepatitis B virus, bacillus Calmette-Guérin, tetanus, influenza, smallpox, polio, diphtheria, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, combination of diphtheria with scarlet fever and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus with polio vaccines. However, a significant increase in the incidence of dermatomyositis or polymyositis after any massive vaccination campaign has not been reported in the literature. In study patients with inflammatory myopathies, no recent immunization was recorded in any of the patients. Moreover, after the 1976 mass flu vaccination, no increase in the incidence of inflammatory myopathies was observed. Although rare, macrophagic myofasciitis has been reported following vaccination and is attributed to the aluminium hydroxide used as an adjuvant in some vaccines. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to identify potential environmental factors, including vaccines, as potential triggers for inflammatory myopathies.","['Orbach H', 'Tanay A']",2009,18,13,Lupus,Orbach H and Tanay A.

19759483,A case of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes in a previously healthy woman.,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes is a well-known cause of a variety of clinical infections including local symptoms such as tonsillopharyngitis, cervical lymphadenitis, otitis media, cellulites, erysipelas, as well as more severe diseases such as scarlet fever, osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, and toxic shock syndrome. However, acute bacterial meningitis caused by this pathogen is unusual.
OBJECTIVE: We report a case of group A streptococcus (GAS) meningitis in a previously healthy woman with a dramatically rapid course and fatal outcome.
CASE: A 41-year-old previously healthy woman presented a history of fever, headache, vomiting, and sore throat of three days' duration. Neurological examination revealed diminished consciousness and neck rigidity. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was turbid with 10,000 leukocytes/mm(3). Direct examination of CSF showed Gram-positive cocci in chains, and cultures yielded S. pyogenes. Blood cultures yielded growth of S. pyogenes. The patient was treated initially with ceftriaxone (4 g/day) and the control CSF examination was not changed on the third day, so vancomycin (2 g/day) was added to the treatment; however, she died on the fourth day of the treatment.
CONCLUSION: S. pyogenes meningitis is uncommon and the incidence seems to be persistently low; nevertheless, clinicians should be aware that sporadic cases may occur and may have a fulminant course with a relevant neurological sequel.","['Ulug M', 'Ulug NC', 'Celen MK', 'Geyik MF', 'Ayaz C']",2009,3,3,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Ulug M, et al.

19740885,Seasonality and comparative dynamics of six childhood infections in pre-vaccination Copenhagen.,"Seasonal variation in infection transmission is a key determinant of epidemic dynamics of acute infections. For measles, the best-understood strongly immunizing directly transmitted childhood infection, the perception is that term-time forcing is the main driver of seasonality in developed countries. The degree to which this holds true across other acute immunizing childhood infections is not clear. Here, we identify seasonal transmission patterns using a unique long-term dataset with weekly incidence of six infections including measles. Data on age-incidence allow us to quantify the mean age of infection. Results indicate correspondence between dips in transmission and school holidays for some infections, but there are puzzling discrepancies, despite close correspondence between average age of infection and age of schooling. Theoretical predictions of the relationship between amplitude of seasonality and basic reproductive rate of infections that should result from term-time forcing are also not upheld. We conclude that where yearly trajectories of susceptible numbers are perturbed, e.g. via waning of immunity, seasonality is unlikely to be entirely driven by term-time forcing. For the three bacterial infections, pertussis, scarlet fever and diphtheria, there is additionally a strong increase in transmission during the late summer before the end of school vacations.","['Metcalf CJ', 'Bjørnstad ON', 'Grenfell BT', 'Andreasen V']",2009,276,1676,Proc Biol Sci,"Metcalf CJ, et al.

19725782,Panton-Valentine leukocidin is associated with exacerbated skin manifestations and inflammatory response in children with community-associated staphylococcal scarlet fever.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal scarlet fever (SSF), a rare disease, was first described in 1900. The clinical features and outcomes in children with SSF caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive and PVL-negative Staphylococcus aureus strains have not been compared prospectively.
METHODS: The demographic data, selected clinical features, laboratory values, and outcomes for 49 consecutive children with community-acquired S. aureus SSF prospectively identified during an 11-year period were collected for analysis.
RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.88, and the median age of the patients was 37 months. Cutaneous abscesses predominated among children with SSF. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) caused SSF in 26 and 23 children, respectively. Twenty-four isolates had results that were positive for PVL (5 MSSA and 19 MRSA isolates), and 25 had results that were negative for PVL (21 MSSA and 4 MRSA isolates). Polymerase chain reaction revealed that most (92%) contained only staphylococcal enterotoxin B (23 MSSA and 22 MRSA isolates). By multivariate analysis, children with PVL-positive isolates had significantly larger abscess sizes, higher white blood cell counts, higher C-reactive protein levels, and longer durations of fever, generalized scarlatiniform rashes, and hospital stays. Most (17 isolates; 89%) of the 19 PVL-positive MRSA isolates carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec V(T) and all were multilocus sequence type 59.
CONCLUSION: SSF caused by PVL-positive S. aureus strains were associated with more-exacerbated skin manifestations and a greater systemic inflammatory response, compared with those cases caused by PVL-negative S. aureus. Clinical improvement after incision and drainage was achieved for most children with SSF caused by PVL-positive MRSA strains, despite treatment with an ineffective antibiotic.","['Lo WT', 'Tang CS', 'Chen SJ', 'Huang CF', 'Tseng MH', 'Wang CC']",2009,49,7,Clin Infect Dis,"Lo WT, et al.

19687711,Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: consequence of treatment of an emerging pathogen.,"We report a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-Sx) therapy for presumed community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. Although the association between SJS/TEN and the sulfonamide class of antibiotics is well established, the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has left practitioners with limited regimens to effectively treat skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the outpatient setting. In the case of SSTIs, alternative treatment of these infections should be considered, especially when the bacterial pathogen is unknown. Future investigations evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and monitoring the incidence of SJS/TEN in the era of CA-MRSA are necessary to reduce unnecessary use of sulfonamide drugs. The potential development of SJS/TEN, a severe life-threatening illness, emphasizes the need for judicious use of TMP-Sx and close monitoring and follow-up for patients who were given TMP-Sx for SSTIs.","['Mistry RD', 'Schwab SH', 'Treat JR']",2009,25,8,Pediatr Emerg Care,"Mistry RD, et al.

19687494,The death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: an epidemiologic perspective.,"The early death of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart on 5 December 1791 has fascinated the world for more than 2 centuries. It has been suggested that his final illness was caused by poisoning, renal failure, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, trichinosis, and many other conditions. The official daily register of deaths in Mozart's Vienna was evaluated to provide an epidemiologic framework into which the observations of contemporary witnesses of his death can be integrated. All recorded deaths in Vienna during November and December 1791 and January 1792 were analyzed, together with the corresponding periods in 1790 to 1791 and 1792 to 1793. The deaths of 5011 adults (3442 men, 1569 women) were recorded over these periods. The mean ages of death were 45.5 years (SD, 18.5) for men and 54.5 years (SD, 19.9) for women. Tuberculosis and related conditions accounted for the highest number of deaths; cachexia and malnutrition ranked second, and edema was the third most common cause. According to eyewitness accounts, the hallmark of Mozart's final disease was severe edema. Deaths from edema were markedly increased among younger men in the weeks surrounding Mozart's death compared with the previous and following years. This minor epidemic may have originated in the military hospital. Our analysis is consistent with Mozart's last illness and death being due to a streptococcal infection leading to an acute nephritic syndrome caused by poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever, which represents the same underlying disease from an etiologic perspective, is a less likely possibility.","['Zegers RH', 'Weigl A', 'Steptoe A']",2009,151,4,Ann Intern Med,"Zegers RH, et al.

19638655,Kawasaki disease - an Indian perspective.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) was first reported from Japan in 1967 by a young pediatrician, Tomisaku Kawasaki, while working at the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo. Soon therafter, Marian Melish independently reported children with a similar clinical profile from Hawaii in the United States. KD has now been reported from all parts of the world, including several centers in India. Based on the epidemiology and clinical features, an infectious etiology has been suspected for long but no definitive causative agent has been implicated so far. Like many other vasculitides, the diagnosis of this condition is based on the recognition of a temporal sequence of clinical features, none of which is pathognomonic in isolation. KD is believed to be the commonest vasculitic disorder of children. Incidence rates as high as 60-150 per 100,000 children below 5 years of age have been reported from several countries. In India (as also perhaps in many other developing countries), however, majority of children with KD continue to remain undiagnosed probably because of the lack of awareness amongst pediatricians. The clinical features of KD can be confused with other common conditions like scarlet fever and the Stevens Johnson syndrome, if the clinician is not careful. Development of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) is the hallmark of KD and accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Prompt recognition of the disease and early initiation of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) results in significant reduction in the occurrence of CAA. It is, therefore, imperative for the pediatrician to diagnose and treat KD expeditiously. KD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all febrile illnesses in young children where the fever persists for more than 5-7 days.","['Singh S', 'Kawasaki T']",2009,46,7,Indian Pediatr,Singh S and Kawasaki T.

19583510,Gene transcript abundance profiles distinguish Kawasaki disease from adenovirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Acute Kawasaki disease (KD) is difficult to distinguish from other illnesses that involve acute rash or fever, in part because the etiologic agent(s) and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized. As a result, diagnosis and critical therapies may be delayed.
METHODS: We used DNA microarrays to identify possible diagnostic features of KD. We compared gene expression patterns in the blood of 23 children with acute KD and 18 age-matched febrile children with 3 illnesses that resemble KD.
RESULTS: Genes associated with platelet and neutrophil activation were expressed at higher levels in patients with KD than in patients with acute adenovirus infections or systemic adverse drug reactions, but levels in patients with KD were not higher than those in patients with scarlet fever. Genes associated with B cell activation were also expressed at higher levels in patients with KD than in control subjects. A striking absence of interferon-stimulated gene expression in patients with KD was confirmed in an independent cohort of patients with KD. Using a set of 38 gene transcripts, we successfully predicted the diagnosis for 21 of 23 patients with KD and 7 of 8 patients with adenovirus infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into the molecular features that distinguish KD from other febrile illnesses and support the feasibility of developing novel diagnostic reagents for KD based on the host response.","['Popper SJ', 'Watson VE', 'Shimizu C', 'Kanegaye JT', 'Burns JC', 'Relman DA']",2009,200,4,J Infect Dis,"Popper SJ, et al.

Their increased prevalence was the result of deteriorating sanitary and living conditions of the city population. The spread of epidemic infectious diseases was enhanced by marching troops, migration of civilians and war prisoners, return of large groups of displaced people and demobilized soldiers after regaining independence in November 1918. Additionally, unfavorable epidemiological situation in Lvov deteriorated at the time of the war with Ukrainians (November 1918-April 1919) and Bolsheviks (July-August 1920). The control of infectious diseases was in the hands of regional local physicians who referred patients to hospitals, isolated homes, bath and disinfection institutions, and conducted vaccinations against smallpox.

19488647,[Epidemiological characteristics of Lyme-like disease in children].,"BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence, age distribution, seasonality and clinical characteristics of Lyme-simile disease in Brazilians less than 15 years of age. METHODS. From July, 1998 to November, 2000, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 333 patients with skin rash and fever. Paired blood samples were collected for identification of the pathogens. Only 193 samples which were negative for other pathogens (Parvovirus B19 Human, Herpesvirus 6 Human, Measles, Rubella, Dengue, Scarlet fever and Enterovirus), were tested for borreliosis by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Western-blotting. Other clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and climatic variables were studied.
RESULTS: Prevalence of the disease was 6.2%(12/193). Of the variables studied, there was predominance in: <6 years old (83.2%); females (66.7%); being from the city of Franco da Rocha (58.3 %); and a summer/fall seasonality. The duration of care was 4 days. Signs and symptoms with statistical significance were itching; absence of lip notch and ocular pain; irritability and good clinical condition. Other clinical data presented were: pruritus (90%), irritability (80%) and fever (38 masculineC) (58.3%) with a duration of 1 to 3 days. Erythema was maculo-papular (40%), urticaria-like (25%) and scarlatiniform (16.7%), occurring predominately on the trunk (60%). There were no primary clinical evidences of Lyme-simile disease in the patients under study. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis as opposed to the laboratory diagnosis was zero. There was no initial clinical suspicion of the disease in the 10 cases studied and followed up for two years that showed no evidence of cardiologic or neurological complications. This is the first study of Lyme-simile in Brazilian children.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of Lyme-simile disease was low, and it was not remembered at the initial diagnosis of those with skin rash.

19486515,Association of the shuffling of Streptococcus pyogenes clones and the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 in central Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: The number of scarlet fever occurrences reported between 2000 and 2006 fluctuated considerably in central Taiwan and throughout the nation. Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central Taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. National weekly report data were collected for investigating epidemiological trends.
RESULTS: A total of 23 emm types were identified in 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates. The five most prevalent emm types were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%). PFGE analysis with SmaI suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. There were two large emm12 clones, one with DNA resistant to cleavage by SmaI. Each prevalent emm clone had major PFGE strain(s) and many minor strains. Most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. Even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2-3 years before declining. The large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. In 2003, the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred between late-February and mid-June in Taiwan.
CONCLUSION: The occurrences of scarlet fever in central Taiwan in 2000-2006 were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for 96.8% of the isolates collected. Most of the S. pyogenes strains (as defined by PFGE genotypes) emerged and lasted for only a few years. The fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the SARS outbreak in 2003.","['Chiou CS', 'Wang YW', 'Chen PL', 'Wang WL', 'Wu PF', 'Wei HL']",2009,9,,BMC Microbiol,"Chiou CS, et al.

Their incidence resulted not only from bad living conditions of the population but also from poor personal and environmental hygiene and lack of access to bacteriologically healthy drinking water. The Polish-Bolshevik war (1919-1920) as well as repatriation of war prisoners and the Polish population from Russia (its territory was a reservoir of numerous infectious diseases) and the return of large groups of displaced people contributed to spread of epidemics. Morbidity rate of acute infectious diseases was the highest in the big Polish cities, especially in Warsaw, Lodz, Lvov, Cracow and Vilnius. The Bureau of Chief Emergency Commissar for fighting against epidemics, which closely cooperated with other Polish sanitary institutions and international organisations, rendered the greatest service to the control of infectious diseases.

The year 1925 saw the founding of I.G. Farben (Interessen-Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG), a conglomerate of companies that would monopolize the country's chemical production and come to own all its major pharmaceutical industries. During the World War II, I.G. Farben participated in numerous operations associated with the criminal activities of the Nazi executive, including the use of slave labour in plants built close to concentration camps, such as that at Auschwitz. With regard to medical and pharmacological research projects, I.G. Farben became involved in experimental programmes using patients from the Nazi regime's euthanasia programmes and healthy subjects recruited without their consent from concentration camps, on whom various pharmacological substances were tested, including sulfamide and arsenical derivatives and other preparations whose composition is not precisely known (B-1012, B-1034, 3382 or Rutenol, 3582 or Acridine), generally in relation to the treatment of infectious diseases, such as typhus, erysipelas, scarlet fever or paratyphoid diarrhoea. Furthermore, I.G. Farben played a decisive role in the German army's chemical warfare programme, contributing to the development of the first two neurotoxic substances, later known as 'nerve agents', tabun and sarin. Some of these activities came to light as a result of the one the famous Nuremberg Trials in 1947, which saw 24 executives and scientists from I.G. Farben brought to justice for, among other offences, the use of slave labour in the concentration camps and forced experimentation with drugs on prisoners.","['López-Muñoz F', 'García-García P', 'Alamo C']",2009,34,1,J Clin Pharm Ther,"López-Muñoz F, et al.

19066896,An SEIQR model for childhood diseases.,"It has been shown that the inclusion of an isolated class in the classical SIR model for childhood diseases can be responsible for self-sustained oscillations. Hence, the recurrent outbreaks of such diseases can be caused by autonomous, deterministic factors. We extend the model to include a latent class (i.e. individuals who are infected with the disease, but are not yet able to pass the disease to others) and study the resulting dynamics. The existence of Hopf bifurcations is shown for the model, as well as a homoclinic bifurcation for a perturbation to the model. For historical data on scarlet fever in England, our model agrees with the epidemiological data much more closely than the model without the latent class. For other childhood diseases, our model suggests that isolation is unlikely to be a major factor in sustained oscillations.","['Gerberry DJ', 'Milner FA']",2009,59,4,J Math Biol,Gerberry DJ and Milner FA.

18983979,A novel streptococcal leucine zipper protein (Lzp) binds to human immunoglobulins.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important pathogen that causes pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. To survive within its host, S. pyogenes has developed several immune evasion mechanisms. Here, we identified a novel gene encoding a 66-kDa protein with many leucine zipper motifs, that we call streptococcal leucine zipper protein (Lzp). Lzp was expressed on the bacterial cell surface, and some was detected in the culture medium. Lzp was expressed by all the S. pyogenes strains we tested, but not by group B streptococcal strains. Western blotting and Biacore assay demonstrated that recombinant Lzp bound to human IgA, IgG, IgM, and Lzp. In addition, native-PAGE analysis suggested that the Lzp molecule formed dimer and trimer conformations. Thus, Lzp is a novel immunoglobulin-binding protein that may play a role in helping S. pyogenes escape detection by the host immune system.","['Okamoto S', 'Terao Y', 'Hasuike K', 'Hamada S', 'Kawabata S']",2008,377,4,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Okamoto S, et al.

We report a patient in whom scarlet fever was associated with hypertrophic gastritis and multiple organ failure. A 62-year-old woman presented with septic shock and multiple organ failure. Bacteriological survey was negative. Abdominal tomodensitometry showed an hypertrophic gastritis. Histological analysis demonstrated a non specific gastritis without any tumoral sign. Cefotaxime and amoxicillin led to improvement and hypertrophic gastritis progressively resolved. A sandpaper rash over the body with finger desquamation, elevation of antistreptolysin O and a recent contact with an infected grandson led to the diagnosis of scarlet fever. Due to antibiotic prescription, scarlet fever is now uncommon. Although classical, ENT or gastroenteritis presentations may be puzzling for the diagnosis of scarlet fever.

18724258,Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection: a case-control study among privately insured children.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether antecedent streptococcal infection(s) increase the risk of subsequent diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome (TS), other tic disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or major depressive disorder (MDD) in a national sample of privately insured children.
METHOD: Using health insurance claims data, we compared the prior year's occurrence of streptococcal infection in children ages 4 to 13 years with OCD, TS, or tic disorder newly diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2004 to that of a cohort of matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to determine the association of prior streptococcal sore throat or scarlet fever with a diagnosis of OCD, TS, or tic disorder. We repeated the analyses for two other infectious diseases (otitis media and sinusitis) and one noninfectious condition (migraine). We also investigated the potential specificity of this association by performing similar analyses focused on newly diagnosed ADHD and newly diagnosed MDD.
RESULTS: Subjects with newly diagnosed OCD, TS, or tic disorder were more likely than controls to have had a diagnosis of streptococcal infection in the previous year (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.29-2.15). Prior streptococcal infection was also associated with incident diagnoses of ADHD (odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.35) and MDD (odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.30).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide epidemiologic evidence that some pediatric-onset neuropsychiatric disorders, including OCD, tic disorders, ADHD, and MDD, may be temporally related to prior streptococcal infections. Whether this is the result of a nonspecific stress response or secondary to an activation of the immune system remains to be determined.","['Leslie DL', 'Kozma L', 'Martin A', 'Landeros A', 'Katsovich L', 'King RA', 'Leckman JF']",2008,47,10,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,"Leslie DL, et al.

18691162,Characteristics of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from Chinese children with scarlet fever.,"AIM: To analyse the characteristics of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from Chinese children with scarlet fever.
METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration with nine antibiotics was performed on 145 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates acquired from Beijing and Shanghai in 2007. Their macrolide-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermA- a subclass of ermTR), superantigens (speA and speC), and en-coding mature M protein gene (emm gene) were amplified by PCR.
RESULTS: A total of 97.9% of the isolates exhibited resistance to the macrolides, while 96.6% manifested resistance to tetracycline. All isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, penicillin, cefradine, and ofloxacin. Moreover, 94.5% exhibited a cMLSB phenotype, while 90.3% had the ermB gene. Five emm types (emm1.0, emm4.0, emm12.0, emm22.0 and st5240) were discovered, of which 9.7% carried the superantigen speA, 35.9% carried the speC, 42.8% carried both speA and speC and 11.7% carried neither speA nor speC. Finally, 85.5% of emm1.0 and 15.5% of emm12.0 isolates carried speA, while 79.0% of emm1.0 and 75.9% of emm12.0 isolates carried speC.

18666608,[On the development of the infectology service in Novi Sad].,"INTRODUCTION: Infectious diseases are a part of the history of this region. Devastating epidemics of plague, smallpox, and cholera were frequent during the 18th and the 19th centuries. Other infectious diseases were a serious problem as well: alimentary tract infections, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough. Geographic position, climate, migrations, as well as the tradition and lack of medical staff and medications, affected the frequency and outcome of infections.
THE HISTORY OF THE TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Patients with infectious diseases were first treated at home. Later, a hospital in Visarion street was opened as an isolation facility and a hospital for homeless patients. The development of science and the education of medical personnel exerted the greatest influence on the control and later treatment of infectious diseases. These measures resulted in the establishment of the first specialized medical institutions in Novi Sad during the cholera outbreak in 1884. After that, temporary pediatric units were organized for the treatment of scarlet fever, diphtheria and smallpox. A ward for infectious diseases was founded in the The Great City Hospital in the second half of the 19th century (1892). The 20th century was a period of control and eradication of infectious diseases in Vojvodina (smallpox, malaria, diphtheria, polio).
MODERN INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Nowdays, major infectious deseases include respiratory, alimentary and parasitic infections. However, new diseases are being registered as well - hemorrhagic fevers, Lyme disease, HIV infection. The Infectologic Service in Novi Sad was developed from an Infectology Departement as part of the Departement of Internal Diseases in the new Provincial Hospital (1909) to the independent Departement for Infectious Diseases (1945). Today, Clinic of lnfectious Diseases is an integral part of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina.
DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The Department of Infectious Diseases of the Faculty of Medicine in Novi Sad was founded in 1960. Undergraduate studies started in 1963/64 for students of medicine and in 1978/79 jor dentistry students. Today. the faculty of the Department takes part in undergraduate studies of medicine, dentistry, health care, as well as in graduate programs. The faculty members are also taking part in specialization programs at the Faculty of Medicine. Infectious disease physicians are involved in the activities of the Infectology Section (founded in 1979) of the Society of Physicians of Vojvodine of the Medical Society of Serbia. The first president of the Infectology Section was Dr. Vera Mudrić, professor, infectologists, whereas Dr. Grozdana Canak, professor, was the vice-president from 2000-2004. The Infectology Section collaborates with various national and international societies for infectious diseases.","['Canak G', 'Vukadinov J', 'Brkić S', 'Svarc D', 'Ruzić M', 'Kovacević N', 'Fabri M', 'Jovanović J', 'Klasnja B', 'Cvjetković D', 'Doder R', 'Sević S', 'Turkulov V', 'Stefan-Mikić S', 'Knezević K', 'Aleksić-Dordević M', 'Preveden T']",2007,60,11-12,Med Pregl,"Canak G, et al.

He graduated from secondary school in Susak and studied medicine in Innsbruck, Graz, Vienna and Prague, where he received diploma in general practice in 1921. He started his career in Zagreb, then moved to Vrbovsko, KriZevci, Osijek, and Zlatar as district physician. Meanwhile, at the Institute of Epidemiology he specialised in bacteriology, epidemiology, serology, hygiene, and medical chemistry. He successfully organised anti-typhus campaigns and mass vaccinations against scarlet fever and diphtheria, and established local healthcare stations. After a brief stay in Zagreb, in WW2 he was transferred to Bosnia, returned to Zagreb, and since 1946 until his death he had lived in his native Rijeka, where he started an infectious diseases department that later grew into the School of Medicine clinic.

METHODS: Swabs from the throats of the patients and asymptomatic control were cultured on blood agar plates individually. Biochemical identification of all isolates was performed with a VITEX automated system. Antibiotic susceptibility was examined by using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. emm gene and extracellular pyrogenic exotoxins of each isolate were amplified by using polymerase chain reaction and subjected to DNA sequencing. Sequence differences between the isolated and the highly similar reference sequences were compared on BLAST. Bioinformatics was used to predict protein structures.
RESULTS: Beta-haemolytic group A streptococci (GAS) emm75 were identified from 10 of 13 available patients. The isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, cefatriaxone, ofloxacin, linezolid and quinupristin. All of the isolates carried pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA) and cysteine protease (speB). Isolated speA was phylogenetically different from 30 highly similar references on BLAST. Differences in the primary sequence of the deduced protein were 14.37-20.12% between the speA and each of 11 references. Secondary protein structure of the speA was different from the references at the N-terminal.

We report these enterotoxins as causative agents of 2 cases of neonatal intractable diarrhea with enteropathy.
METHODS: We used a note review for this study. Stool culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxin, duodenal biopsy specimens for H&E, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and electron microscopy were used.
RESULTS: Infant 1 had diarrhea from age 2 weeks and was referred at age 5 weeks with weight less than the 0.4th percentile. Infant 2 was referred at age 7 weeks with 4 weeks' of diarrhea, weight less than the 0.4th percentile. Both infants were severely malnourished. Elemental feeds were not tolerated and total parenteral nutrition was required. S aureus producing staphylococcal enterotoxin G and staphylococcal enterotoxin I was isolated in stools from both infants. Clinical improvement occurred after intravenous flucloxacillin and parenteral nutrition. Histology showed subtotal villous atrophy (H&E) with abnormal brush border (periodic acid-Schiff).

17784789,"The complete genome sequence of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP31758, the causative agent of Far East scarlet-like fever.","The first reported Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF) epidemic swept the Pacific coastal region of Russia in the late 1950s. Symptoms of the severe infection included erythematous skin rash and desquamation, exanthema, hyperhemic tongue, and a toxic shock syndrome. The term FESLF was coined for the infection because it shares clinical presentations with scarlet fever caused by group A streptococci. The causative agent was later identified as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, although the range of morbidities was vastly different from classical pseudotuberculosis symptoms. To understand the origin and emergence of the peculiar clinical features of FESLF, we have sequenced the genome of the FESLF-causing strain Y. pseudotuberculosis IP31758 and compared it with that of another Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, IP32953, which causes classical gastrointestinal symptoms. The unique gene pool of Y pseudotuberculosis IP31758 accounts for more than 260 strain-specific genes and introduces individual physiological capabilities and virulence determinants, with a significant proportion horizontally acquired that likely originated from Enterobacteriaceae and other soil-dwelling bacteria that persist in the same ecological niche. The mobile genome pool includes two novel plasmids phylogenetically unrelated to all currently reported Yersinia plasmids. An icm/dot type IVB secretion system, shared only with the intracellular persisting pathogens of the order Legionellales, was found on the larger plasmid and could contribute to scarlatinoid fever symptoms in patients due to the introduction of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive capabilities. We determined the common and unique traits resulting from genome evolution and speciation within the genus Yersinia and drew a more accurate species border between Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis. In contrast to the lack of genetic diversity observed in the evolutionary young descending Y. pestis lineage, the population genetics of Y. pseudotuberculosis is more heterogenous. Both Y. pseudotuberculosis strains IP31758 and the previously sequenced Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 have evolved by the acquisition of specific plasmids and by the horizontal acquisition and incorporation of different genetic information into the chromosome, which all together or independently seems to potentially impact the phenotypic adaptation of these two strains.","['Eppinger M', 'Rosovitz MJ', 'Fricke WF', 'Rasko DA', 'Kokorina G', 'Fayolle C', 'Lindler LE', 'Carniel E', 'Ravel J']",2007,3,8,PLoS Genet,"Eppinger M, et al.

17719644,Report and analysis of a scarlet fever outbreak among adults through food-borne transmission in China.,"BACKGROUND: Scarlet fever is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS). The clinical syndrome has receded in recent years, but occasionally explosive outbreaks do occur likely due to the emergence of GAS with virulence factors peculiar to this syndrome.
METHODS: Following the notification of an unexpectedly large number of scarlet fever cases amongst adults associated with a school in Ningbo, China, in June 2006, the epidemiological and clinical features of the outbreak were investigated. Logistic regression was conducted to investigate the risk factors of the outbreak and its transmission route.
RESULTS: Forty five individuals suffered scarlet fever with an attack rate of 4.98% (45/904). There was a single peak in the epidemic curve, with the majority of the cases occurring during the first two days of the outbreak. The median age of cases was 35.5 years (range 17-65). Most patients had fever (43/45), sore throat (40/45), scarlatinoid rash (39/45) and strawberry-like tongue (30/45). In laboratory detection, 45 cases' throat swabs samples were collected and GAS were isolated from 8 throat swabs samples. All of the cases, except for 2, had eaten the Plain Boiled Chicken (PBC) for lunch on June 6th, and teaching staff and students who had not eaten the PBC were not affected by the epidemic. Logistic regression analysis indicated that PBC was a key risk factor (OR=21.0, P<0.05). The chef of the school refectory was responsible for washing, braising, cutting, and distributing the PBC, and was identified as the likely source.

17557271,Sequence and expression of NAPlr is conserved among group A streptococci isolated from patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and non-APSGN.,"BACKGROUND: The relation of nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr) as a nephritogenic antigen in group A streptococci (GAS), to acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and the potential of specific strains to cause APSGN are not fully understood. It would be helpful to determine whether certain GAS strains from APSGN patients specifically express NAPlr and whether strains from non-APSGN patients express lower levels or an altered form of NAPlr.
METHODS: The sequence and levels of expression of NAPlr were assayed for strains of GAS isolated from patients with APSGN, pharyngitis, scarlet fever or toxic shock-like syndrome. Findings were evaluated with respect to naplr gene sequence, expression level of NAPlr, serotype and disease type.
RESULTS: In GAS strains from both APSGN and non-APSGN patients, the naplr gene showed few or no nucleotide alterations, and both types of GAS strains expressed NAPlr in vitro. There were no obvious differences in naplr gene sequence, expression of NAPlr, serotype or disease type between the GAS strains. In addition, groups C and G streptococci also carried a conserved naplr gene and expressed NAPlr in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: These groups of streptococci that express NAPlr should be associated with APSGN, and this association may be independent of serotype or disease type.","['Fujino M', 'Yamakami K', 'Oda T', 'Omasu F', 'Murai T', 'Yoshizawa N']",2007,20,3,J Nephrol,"Fujino M, et al.

The annual prevalence rates among acute diseases vary widely. Children and adolescents are most frequently affected by acute (infectious) respiratory conditions. 88.5 % of the surveyed children and adolescents experienced at least one episode of common cold within the last 12 months. Among the other acute respiratory infections, bronchitis and tonsillitis were the most frequently encountered conditions with 19.9 % and 18.5 %, respectively. The 12-month prevalence of otitis media and pseudocroup was 11 % and 6.6 %, respectively. 1.5 % of the children and adolescents experienced an episode of pneumonia. Apart from respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections were very frequently stated as reasons for acute illness. Furthermore, 12.8 % of the children and adolescents experienced a herpetic infection, 7.8 % a conjunctivitis and 4.8 % a urinary tract infection. Lifetime prevalence rates of infectious diseases were as follows: pertussis 8.7 %, measles 7.4 %, mumps 4.0 %, rubella 8.5 %, varicella 70.6 %, scarlet fever 23.5 %. The various chronic somatic diseases in children and adolescents had different lifetime prevalence rates. Most frequently, children and adolescents were affected by obstructive bronchitis (13.3 %), neurodermatitis/atopic eczema (13.2 %) and hay fever (10.7 %). Scoliosis and asthma had been diagnosed by a doctor in 5.2 % and 4.7 % of subjects aged 0-17 years, respectively.

The twentieth century saw dramatic declines in the incidence of childhood diseases; the prevalence of measles, haemophilus influenzae type B, diphtheria, rubella and tetanus are at all time lows (CDC, 2006). Indeed, many pediatric nurses have never seen any of these diseases, something that would certainly have startled their predecessors just a few generations ago. Before the mid- twentieth century, caring for children with communicable diseases represented the cornerstone of pediatric nursing practice. Now that the incidence has decreased among American children, it is easy to forget about these diseases that once decimated whole communities. This article tries to peel back the mists of history by studying children's health in one rural New England town during the days of the early republic in the 1830s.","['Radikas R', 'Connolly C']",2007,33,1,Pediatr Nurs,Radikas R and Connolly C.

Over the years, molecular mimicry between streptococcal products and renal components, autoimmune reactivity and several streptococcal antigens have been extensively studied. Recent investigations assign a critical role to both in situ formation and deposition of circulating immune complexes that would trigger a variety of effector mechanisms. Glomerular plasmin-binding activity of streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase may play a role in nephritogenicity and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B and its zymogen precursor may be the long-sought nephritogenic antigen.","['Rodríguez-Iturbe B', 'Batsford S']",2007,71,11,Kidney Int,Rodríguez-Iturbe B and Batsford S.

17333866,[Mortality in Nuremberg in the 19th century (about 1800 to 1913)].,"Before the middle of the 19th century urban life was hazardous, life expectancy in big cities was shorter than in the countryside, it was half as high as it is today. Cities used to be called ""the graves of mankind""; they were unhygienic, since their inhabitants lived under crowded, unhealthy conditions. In German cities infant mortality was extremely high, one out of three new-born children died within its first year. In most big cities more people died in any given year than were born. In 1806, when the Imperial City of Nuremberg was absorbed by the Kingdom of Bavaria, it had 25 000 inhabitants, fewer than around the year 1600. In the following decades Nuremberg grew quickly, up to 50000 in 1846 and 100000 in 1881, 330000 in 1910. Its population was living extremely crowded within the medieval city-walls, up to 58 000 (1885) in the old parts of the city, more than twice as many as in 1806. Mortality was bound to increase, as more and more people moved to Nuremberg. Mortality rose from 25.5 per thousand in the 1820's to 29.4 in the 1850's and 32.8 in the 1860's. This increase of population was mainly due to migration from outside, from the countryside. New industries settled down in Nuremberg and provided new jobs, the new factories produced lots of smoke and dangerous dust. The general living conditions of the workers were poor, people were much smaller than nowadays. During the industrialisation labor was backbreaking, working hours were extremely long, and annual working hours were more than twice as long as today. New and better legislation was written by the Northern German Confederation, founded in 1867. Now the magistrate of Nuremberg recognised that something had to be done. In the following years physicians began to collect information as to morbidity and mortality in various parts of Nuremberg. Very many people still died of infectious diseases, esp. of tubercolosis, typhoid fever, diphtheria, pertussis, scarlet fever and other infectious diseases. There were many cases of bronchitis and deadly pneumonia. Even suicide was an important cause of death. In 1886 mortality at Nuremberg peaked for the last time above 30. Nuremberg had fewer doctors than other big cities in Germany. The city-fathers noticed that the public wells and the drinking water were dirty--they were getting more and more contaminated as time went by. It proved extremely difficult to provide this fast growing population with ""free goods"" like clean water and air. In the 1870's Nuremberg began to build a new water supply and a modern municipal sewer system. Cases of typhoid fever declined quickly thereafter. The magistrate did not provide new apartment-houses, but it took care that the new houses were more hygienic, with toilets and other necessary facilities. After 1880 new vaccinations were developed by modern medicine, these and other methods of preventive medicin proved to be more important for prolonging human lifes than therapeutic medicine. In the 1880's a steep rise of income can be registered, it brought more and better food, more meat, and better living and working conditions--and fewer working-hours per year. At the eve of World War I, Nuremberg was one of the ten or twelve biggest cities in Germany, an industrialized city with a hard-working population, people with little education and income. Urban mortality in Nuremberg declined rather slowly. In 1867 35.7 percent of all deceased persons were infants, less than one year old, in 1913 that percentage had declined to 30.7. In 1867 only 9.3 per cent of the deceased were older than 70, in 1913 the elderly constituted 14.2 per cent. Very many people still died in their forties or fifties.",['Vasold M'],2006,25,,Wurzbg Medizinhist Mitt,Vasold M. [Mortality in Nuremberg in the 19th century (about 1800 to 1913)].

Information on medical conditions, medications, and medical radiation was obtained by in-person interviews. We calculated odds ratios (OR) as measures of relative risks using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A reduced multiple myeloma risk was found among women who had used antilipid statin therapy [OR, 0.4; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.2-0.8] or estrogen replacement therapy (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.99) or who had a medical history of allergy (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), scarlet fever (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9), or bursitis (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7). An increased risk of multiple myeloma was found among women who used prednisone (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.4), insulin (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-9.0), or gout medication (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.2-38.0).
CONCLUSIONS: If our results are confirmed, mechanistic studies examining how prior use of insulin, prednisone, and, perhaps, gout medication might promote increased occurrence of multiple myeloma and how antilipid statins, estrogen replacement therapy, and certain medical conditions might protect against multiple myeloma may provide insights to the as yet unknown etiology of multiple myeloma.","['Landgren O', 'Zhang Y', 'Zahm SH', 'Inskip P', 'Zheng T', 'Baris D']",2006,15,12,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Landgren O, et al.

16780845,Dual role of infections as risk factors for coronary heart disease.,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to explore whether exposure to microbial agents determines the prevalence of acute coronary events.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (N=335) and their paired controls were investigated. The subjects answered a questionnaire about their childhood contagious diseases: varicella, scarlet fever, measles, rubella, mononucleosis and mumps. Blood samples were taken for bacterial and viral serology. The odds ratio for CHD was highest in the upper quartile of the enterovirus (EV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Chlamydia pneumoniae HSP60 IgG antibody titers (1.86, p=0.001, 1.57, p<0.048 and 1.70, p=0.016, respectively). The antibody titers increased cumulatively the risk for CHD (odds ratios 1.89, 2.24, 3.92 and p-values <0.001, 0.001 and 0.047). Childhood contagious diseases (n=6) had a protecting effect against CHD (odds ratio 0.86, p=0.013). The risk for acute coronary events decreased significantly with increasing number of childhood contagious diseases (p=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Infections have a dual role in the genesis of CHD. EV, HSV and C. pneumoniae heat shock protein 60 IgG antibodies are associated with increased risk for CHD. Protection from infections usually suffered during the childhood before the era of MMR vaccination may predispose the individual to CHD.","['Pesonen E', 'Andsberg E', 'Ohlin H', 'Puolakkainen M', 'Rautelin H', 'Sarna S', 'Persson K']",2007,192,2,Atherosclerosis,"Pesonen E, et al.

16729431,"[The characteristics of staphylococcal enterotoxins produced by strains isolated from mastitic cows, including epidemiological aspects].","Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are big heterogenic group of exotoxins, rather differential in respect of their nucleotide and amino-acid homology, as well as the location of their genes, molecular weight and iso-electric point value. SEs were identified in 1959 as the extra-cellular proteins produced by some Staphylococcus aureus strains. These enterotoxins are known as the pyrogenic toxins and this group contains also other staphylococcal toxins (staphylococcal toxic-shock syndrome toxin--TSST-1, A and B exfoliative toxins and streptococcal scarlet fever toxin). Twenty one serological types of staphylococcal enterotoxins are distinguished. All of them are structurally and functionally similar to the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1). SEs are thermo-stabile proteins, resistant to many proteolytic enzymes (pepsin, trypsine, chymotrypsine, renine and papain), but this resistance depends on the temperature and pH. Staphylococcal enterotoxin-encoding genes are located as well in the chromosomal DNA, as on the pathogenicity island, in phages, transposones and plasmids. Enterotoxins are staphylococcal virulence factors responsible for food poisonings in humans. These proteins are also isolated from cows with mastitis. In various countries, the percentage of enterotoxin-producing S. aureus strains ranges from 5 to 60%, depending on the enterotoxine type. The variability and prevalence of enterotoxins produced by staphylococci isolated from mastitic cows is very important clinical and epidemiological problem. The analysis of enterotoxins interrelations, their structure, properties and occurrence, will provide better revealing their role in the emerging, development and spreading of human and animal diseases. Classical enterotoxins, as well as the new types of these proteins, are variable element of staphylococcal virulence that connects the occurence of mastitis with human food poisonings.","['Nawrotek P', 'Borkowski J', 'Boroń-Kaczmarska A', 'Furowicz AJ']",2005,59,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Nawrotek P, et al.

M12 was detected in the largest number of patients, followed by M6, M4, M3, and M1. T-typing was also conducted for Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from healthy schoolchildren in three different parts of the 20-year period between 1977 and 1998. T12 was detected in the largest number of children, followed by T28, T1, T4, and T6. These results suggested that strains of similar types are prevalent in scarlet fever patients and healthy carriers, that these strains become prevalent at intervals of several years, and that they are detected every year, albeit in a small number of persons, indicating that they are endemic. Isolated strains were typed by M-typing and T-typing. The results of typing were identical in more than 90% of cases. Comparison of major Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated in Tokyo and three other major cities abroad showed that M12 was detected in the largest number of persons in Tokyo and New York and that major types were similar in the four cities.","['Iimura T', 'Kashiwagi Y', 'Endo M', 'Amano Y']",2006,12,2,J Infect Chemother,"Iimura T, et al.

It occurs sporadically in modern society and infection is readily treated with antibiotics. We report on a scarlet fever outbreak in children attending a primary school in Perth, Western Australia, in late 2003. A total of 13 cases were identified over a five week period. Six of the cases were pre-primary children (ages 4 to 5) from the same class of 26 children (attack rate 23.1%). Three of the remaining seven cases were older siblings of pre-primary cases who developed scarlet fever after their younger siblings. Screening of the children and teachers from the two pre-primary classes at the school yielded 12 positive pharyngeal swabs for group A Streptococcus. Emm-typing of the screening isolates indicated that a common strain was circulating within the outbreak pre-primary class, with four of six isolates identified as emm-type 3. The overall group A Streptococcus carriage rate in screened students in this class was 31.6 per cent and the carriage rate for emm-type 3 was 21.1 per cent. Carriers were treated with oral penicillin V to eradicate carriage and control the outbreak. No further cases of scarlet fever were reported after the treatment of pharyngeal carriers. Outbreaks of scarlet fever still occur in young children and identification and treatment of carriers may still be valuable.","['Feeney KT', 'Dowse GK', 'Keil AD', 'Mackaay C', 'McLellan D']",2005,29,4,Commun Dis Intell Q Rep,"Feeney KT, et al.

16314578,Structure of a group A streptococcal phage-encoded virulence factor reveals a catalytically active triple-stranded beta-helix.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes severe invasive infections including scarlet fever, pharyngitis (streptococcal sore throat), skin infections, necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), septicemia, erysipelas, cellulitis, acute rheumatic fever, and toxic shock. The conversion from nonpathogenic to toxigenic strains of S. pyogenes is frequently mediated by bacteriophage infection. One of the key bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors is a putative ""hyaluronidase,"" HylP1, a phage tail-fiber protein responsible for the digestion of the S. pyogenes hyaluronan capsule during phage infection. Here we demonstrate that HylP1 is a hyaluronate lyase. The 3D structure, at 1.8-angstroms resolution, reveals an unusual triple-stranded beta-helical structure and provides insight into the structural basis for phage tail assembly and the role of phage tail proteins in virulence. Unlike the triple-stranded beta-helix assemblies of the bacteriophage T4 injection machinery and the tailspike endosialidase of the Escherichia coli K1 bacteriophage K1F, HylP1 possesses three copies of the active center on the triple-helical fiber itself without the need for an accessory catalytic domain. The triple-stranded beta-helix is not simply a structural scaffold, as previously envisaged; it is harnessed to provide a 200-angstroms-long substrate-binding groove for the optimal reduction in hyaluronan viscosity to aid phage penetration of the capsule.","['Smith NL', 'Taylor EJ', 'Lindsay AM', 'Charnock SJ', 'Turkenburg JP', 'Dodson EJ', 'Davies GJ', 'Black GW']",2005,102,49,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Smith NL, et al.

16160490,Salzmann's nodular degeneration of the cornea: a review and case series.,"Salzmann's nodular degeneration is a rare, noninflammatory, slowly progressive, degenerative condition. Bluish-white nodules raised above the surface of the cornea characterize it. It has usually developed in corneas with a history of phlyctenulosis, trachoma, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, measles, scarlet fever, and various other viral diseases. However, today the majority of cases have been seen without recognized previous keratitis. It is composed of dense irregularly arranged collagen tissue with hyalinization between epithelium and Bowman's layer or beyond. Manual removal, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with or without the use of topical mitomycin-C, lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty have been used in the treatment of this disease. Salzmann's nodular degeneration does not seem to consist of one clinical entity. In some cases, elevated and pannus-like tissue can be separated easily from the corneal surface leaving Bowman's layer almost untouched. In these eyes, subsequent PTK may be necessary to smooth the surface. Recurrences are rare in these eyes. In contrast, some eyes (often with major peripheral vascularization) are left with deep defects in Bowman's layer and superficial stroma after difficult mechanical removal of nodules. In these eyes, multiple masking/laser ablation procedures are mandatory to acquire a homogenous surface. In our experience, the required laser ablation depth is significantly greater and the best-corrected visual acuity to be expected is reduced in contrast to the eyes with easy removal of the nodules. In these eyes recurrences seem to occur more frequently after treatment. Of 35 eyes documented to have Salzmann's nodular degeneration during the last 15 years in our department, 22 needed PTK treatment. Visual acuity increased from 0.4 to 0.7 on average. As a routine, laser ablation should be combined with previous conventional removal of nodules and excessive pannus tissue. By doing so, lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty techniques are hardly ever required in those eyes.","['Das S', 'Link B', 'Seitz B']",2005,24,7,Cornea,"Das S, et al.

However, studies demonstrating an inverse association between asthma and infectious diseases are scarce and possess conflicting results. To explore the relationship between asthma and scarlet fever, an ecological analysis of their national trends was carried out. Association of both diseases in their annual (1996-2003), seasonal (by month) and geographic (by state) trends was evaluated using the Spearman's correlation coefficient (r(S)). Results showed a strong inverse association between asthma and scarlet fever in all settings. Thus, annual incidence rates of both diseases showed an r(S)=-0.93 (P=0.0009). Seasonal patterns showed a higher proportion of new asthma cases from September to January, while the number of scarlet fever cases increased from March to June (r(S)=-0.84, P=0.0006, 1-month lag). Among the 32 Mexican states, the higher the incidence of scarlet fever the lower the incidence of asthma (r(S)=-0.47, P=0.007).

The hallmarks of rheumatic fever include arthritis, carditis, cutaneous disease, chorea, and subsequent acquired valvular disease. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders encompass a subgroup of illnesses involving the basal ganglia in children with obsessive-compulsive disorders, tic disorders, dystonia, chorea encephalitis, and dystonic choreoathetosis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most frequently encountered in children between two and six years of age with a recent history of pharyngitis and a rash in the setting of poor personal hygiene during the winter months. The clinical examination of a patient with possible poststreptococcal complications should begin with an evaluation for signs of inflammation (i.e., complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection. Antistreptolysin O titers should be obtained to confirm a recent invasive streptococcal infection.

The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because in the early stages the signs and symptoms resemble other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly it has a high mortality. The South West Regional Paediatric Burns Unit at Frenchay Hospital admits 150-200 burns per year. We have designed a protocol to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of TSS. We report our experience over a 3-year period in which almost one quarter of cases of TSS were admitted from home or another hospital. During this period all children with TSS survived and none needed ventilatory support. Typical cases presented within 2 days of thermal injury, in a child under 2 years old with a burn of less than 10% of body surface area (BSA).","['White MC', 'Thornton K', 'Young AE']",2005,31,2,Burns,"White MC, et al.

15575353,Childhood infections and risk of wheezing and allergic sensitisation at age 7-8 years.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood atopic disease has been associated with exposure to infections early in life. There is however considerable controversy on this issue, since evidence exists for both protective and adverse effects of infections. Aim of this study was to investigate the association between childhood infections and the occurrence of wheeze and allergic sensitisation in 7-8-year-old Dutch and German children.
METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted among German and Dutch children participating in a large longitudinal study on respiratory health. Parents of 510 7-8-year-old children with respiratory complaints and an equal number of children without respiratory complaints were asked to complete a questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for specific serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) analysis. Data on childhood infections were collected through records of the participating Municipal Health Services.
RESULTS: No association was found between recent wheeze and any of the childhood infections investigated. For scarlet fever infection an increased risk of allergic sensitisation (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.40-5.72) and sensitisation against grasses (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.35-6.69) at the age of 7-8 years was found. Varicella infection tended towards increased risk of sensitisation against grasses (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 0.99-3.58). For allergic sensitisation and sensitisation against grasses the odds ratios increased with increasing number of infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not lend support to the suggestion that childhood infection protects against wheezing or allergic sensitisation at age 7-8 years. Scarlet fever or varicella infection presented an increased risk of allergic sensitisation.","['Mommers M', 'Swaen GM', 'Weishoff-Houben M', 'Creemers H', 'Freund H', 'Dott W', 'van Schayck CP']",2004,19,10,Eur J Epidemiol,"Mommers M, et al.

15371288,Childhood infections and risk of multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis has been hypothesized to be the result from an aberrant immune response possibly triggered by delayed exposure to a common childhood infection. Because the vast majority of previous studies testing this hypothesis have been based on a history of childhood infections recalled years to decades later in adulthood, we investigated whether age at six common childhood infections was associated with risk of multiple sclerosis, using information recalled in the childhood of a historical cohort of school children in Denmark. Cases included all individuals with multiple sclerosis in the country born between 1940 and 1975, who had attended school in the capital, Copenhagen. Controls were age- and sex-matched peers. School health records were obtained for all subjects. The records contained information on measles, pertussis, scarlet fever, birth order, sibship size, social class of the father, school years, and name of school and attended school classes for children born since 1940 (n(cases) = 455, n(controls) = 1801). For children born since 1950, the records also contained information on rubella, varicella and mumps (n(cases) = 182, n(controls) = 690). Neither age at infection with measles, rubella, varicella, mumps, pertussis and scarlet fever (upper age limit, 14 years) nor the cumulative number of these infections between the ages of 10 and 14 years was associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis. In addition, the risk of multiple sclerosis was not associated with birth order or social class. No clustering of multiple sclerosis in school classes was observed. Our findings suggest that measles, rubella, mumps, varicella, pertussis and scarlet fever, even if acquired late in childhood, are not associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis later in life.","['Bager P', 'Nielsen NM', 'Bihrmann K', 'Frisch M', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Wohlfart J', 'Koch-Henriksen N', 'Melbye M', 'Westergaard T']",2004,127,Pt 11,Brain,"Bager P, et al.

The protocols for Vir and PFGE typing were standardized. A database of the DNA fingerprints for the isolates was established. Nine emm or emm-like genes, 19 Vir patterns, and 26 SmaI PFGE patterns were detected among the isolates. Among the three typing methods, PFGE was the most discriminatory. However, it could not completely replace Vir typing because some isolates with identical PFGE patterns could be further differentiated into several Vir patterns. The prevalent emm types were emm4 (n = 81 isolates [45%]), emm12 (n = 64 [36%]), emm1 (n = 14 [8%]), and emm22 (n = 13 [7%]). Some emm type isolates could be further differentiated into several emm-Vir-PFGE genotypes; however, only one genotype in each emm group was usually predominant. DNA from nine isolates was resistant to SmaI digestion. Further PFGE analysis with SgrAI showed that the SmaI digestion-resistant strains could be derived from indigenous strains by horizontal transfer of exogenous genetic material. The emergence of the new strains could have resulted in an increase in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan since 2000. The emm sequences, Vir, and PFGE pattern database will serve as a basis for information for the long-term evolutionary study of local S. pyogenes strains.","['Chiou CS', 'Liao TL', 'Wang TH', 'Chang HL', 'Liao JC', 'Li CC']",2004,42,9,J Clin Microbiol,"Chiou CS, et al.

15330977,Taking advantage of the positive side-effects of smallpox vaccination.,"From the introduction of smallpox vaccination approximately 200 years ago right up to its discontinuation (1980), reports by physicians and scientists about positive side-effects such as healing of chronic skin rashes, reduced susceptibility to various infectious diseases, e.g. measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough, and even the prophylactic use of the vaccination, e.g. against syphilis, were published again and again. Comparison with the period after cessation of vaccination confirms the experiences of the above vaccinators. As early as 1956, targeted research on these observations led to evidence of the 'ring-zone phenomenon', i.e. the production of soluble antiviral substances in infected chicken embryos and cell cultures. With the help of modern immunological and bioengineering methods, it was later possible to demonstrate that these effects are based on the activation of lymphoreticular cells and the regulatory effect of certain cytokines within the context of the non-specific immune system. These findings led to the development of paramunization with paraspecific vaccines from highly attenuated animal pox viruses. During attenuation, deletions in the virus DNA occur. Attenuated animal pox strains are therefore suited for the production of vector vaccines. The fact that these vector vaccines demonstrate an especially high level of paraspecific efficacy and lack harmful effects is likewise the result of the attenuated animal pox viruses. Optimum regulation of the entire immune system leads to increased paramunity already in the first few days after vaccination and to enhanced antigen recognition and thus accelerated commencement of specific immunity.",['Mayr A'],2004,51,5,J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,Mayr A.

15232184,Epidemiology of diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes in Serbia during a nine-year period (1991-1999).,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus - GAS) is an important human pathogen which causes a variety of diseases, including tonsillopharyngitis, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. It is important to understand the changes in epidemiology of the diseases caused by the pathogen for improved control of such infections. Hence, the aim of the present study was to carry out an epidemiological analysis of GAS infections in Serbia in a 9-yr period (1991-1999) and evaluation of susceptibility of GAS isolates obtained during the same period to penicillin and erythromycin.
METHODS: Occurrence of tonsillopharyngitis, scarlatina and rheumatic fever was analyzed and GAS carrier status in healthy children was examined over a 9-yr period from 1991 to 1999. Susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin was determined for 1657 GAS isolates obtained from patients diagnosed with pharyngitis or scarlet fever and 512 isolates from healthy carriers. M-type antigen was also determined in these isolates.
RESULTS: The average incidences of tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever were 76.2 and 30.8 per cent respectively. A total of 166 cases of rheumatic fever were registered. Per cent of carriers varied from 5.5 to 11.4 per cent over the study period. Predominating M serotypes among GAS isolates tested were M1, M3, M4, M6, M11, M12 and M18, depending on the source of clinical material and period of isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to penicillin in all isolates tested and resistance to erythromycin in 2.41 per cent of the isolates.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Although the fluctuations in incidence were noted during the nine-year period, the incidence of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis is low but with a steady raise in Serbia. No significant changes in the incidence of scarlet fever and rheumatic fever were noted. Susceptibility to penicillin remained unchanged, but the number or erythromycin resistant strains have increased.","['Ranin L', 'Opavski N', 'Djukic S', 'Mijac V']",2004,119 Suppl,,Indian J Med Res,"Ranin L, et al.

In the aspect of modern medical history, there are papers dealing with the developement of TCM, the introduction of western medicine into China, with some specific researches in these fields. Medical biographies include Tan Yun-xian, Quan Shao-qing, Du Chong-ming etc. Papers on medical works deal with the ancient unearthed literature lost yet spread and extant abroad, medical classics, canons on material medica, cold-pathogenic diseases, and formularies. While papers on history of medical culture discuss basically the influence of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and I-discipline on Chinese medicine.

15174317,[Present-day Clinical characteristics of scarlatina].,"AIM: To study present-day clinical manifestations of scarlatina.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors have reviewed 138 case histories of children with scarlatina treated outpatiently and 51 case histories of hospitalized scarlatina children as well as social and age characteristics of 1657 children and 108 adults hospitalized in the infectious hospital N 1 in 1962-2001. Official data on scarlatina morbidity in Moscow and Russia for 1991-2001 are presented. Antibiotic sensitivity of 414 cultures of group A streptococci (GAS) isolated in 1987-1995 and 1996-2001 was investigated.
RESULTS: Overall and seasonal scarlatina morbidities in 7-14-year-olds appeared to rise significantly. In the majority of cases scarlatina took a mild course but in the adults clinical picture of the disease was rather severe. GAS demonstrated high sensitivity (about 100%) to betalactamic antibiotics. The percentage of erythromycin-resistant streptococcal cultures increased more than 9-fold and reached 1.9% (1996-2001). There is a marked trend to a proportional increase of GAS cultures resistant to tetracycline and gentamycin.

15149028,Superantigens: structure-function relationships.,"Superantigens are a class of highly potent immuno-stimulatory molecules produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These toxins possess the unique ability to interact simultaneously with MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors, forming a trimolecular complex that induces profound T-cell proliferation. The resultant massive cytokine release causes epithelial damage and leads to capillary leak and hypotension. The staphylococcal superantigens are designated staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C (and antigenic variants), D, E, and the recently discovered enterotoxins G to Q, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. The streptococcal superantigens include the pyrogenic exotoxins A (and antigenic variants), C, G-J, SMEZ, and SSA. Superantigens are implicated in several diseases including toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever and food poisoning; and their function appears primarily to debilitate the host sufficiently to permit the causation of disease. Structural studies over the last 10 years have provided a great deal of information regarding the complex interactions of these molecules with their receptors. This, combined with the wealth of new information from genomics initiatives, have shown that, despite their common molecular architecture, superantigens are able to crosslink MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors by a variety of subtly different ways through the use of various structural regions within each toxin.","['Baker MD', 'Acharya KR']",2004,293,7-8,Int J Med Microbiol,Baker MD and Acharya KR.

15141141,Prior medical conditions and medication use and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Connecticut United States women.,"OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the role of prior medical conditions and medication use in the etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), we analyzed the data from a population-based case-control study of NHL in Connecticut women.
METHODS: A total of 601 histologically confirmed incident cases of NHL and 717 population-based controls were included in this study. In-person interviews were administered using standardized, structured questionnaires to collect information on medical conditions and medication use.
RESULTS: An increased risk was found among women who had a history of autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis), anemia, eczema, or psoriasis. An increased risk was also observed among women who had used steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranquilizers. A reduced risk was found for women who had scarlet fever or who had used estrogen replacement therapy, aspirin, medications for non-insulin dependent diabetes, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Risk associated with past medical history appeared to vary based on NHL subtypes, but the results were based on small number of exposed subjects.
CONCLUSION: A relationship between certain prior medical conditions and medication use and risk of NHL was observed in this study. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.","['Zhang Y', 'Holford TR', 'Leaderer B', 'Zahm SH', 'Boyle P', 'Morton LM', 'Zhang B', 'Zou K', 'Flynn S', 'Tallini G', 'Owens PH', 'Zheng T']",2004,15,4,Cancer Causes Control,"Zhang Y, et al.

15058018,[The probability of Kawasaki diseases in young patients with cardiac disorders--retrospective studies].,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in some countries. In Poland the diagnosis of KD is still rarely reported. KD is an acute systemic febrile illness of unknown aetiology, predominantly affecting children under five years of age. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms and late cardiac complications.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to find out whether Kawasaki disease in childhood was the cause of cardiac disorders in young patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 50 patients (ranging in age from 20 to 47 years; 34 males and 16 females) diagnosed in 1 Cardiac Department within one year. The patients were divided into three groups: group I--patients with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure; group II--patients with cardiac arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities; group III--patients with congestive cardiomyopathy.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients had rubella in childhood and in this group one person was under 5 years of age. Nineteen patients suffered from measles and in this group there were two persons under 5 years of age. Twenty-three persons in the study group confirmed acute febrile illness under 5 years of age lasting over 5 days. No cardiac symptoms occurred during the childhood febrile or exanthema illnesses. Five criteria (symptoms of Kawasaki disease) were fulfilled by 4 persons, 4 criteria--by 4 persons, 3 criteria--by 1 person, 2 criteria--by 3 persons, 1 criterion--by 6 persons. Nobody in the study population had signs of measles, rubella or scarlet fever. Nobody had coronary artery abnormalities detected by echocardiography. Twenty-six of 50 persons had coronary angiography--no coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Completing a more precise past history with the help of patient's parents was often impossible (death, distant place of residence). The verification of diagnosis on the basis of the obtained data is impossible. The most reliable data about diseases affecting children under 5 years of age would have been produced by additional investigations. They would have facilitated the retrospective recognition of the Kawasaki disease.","['Pośnik-Urbańska A', 'Szymanowska Z', 'Kawecka-Jaszcz K']",2003,60,12,Przegl Lek,"Pośnik-Urbańska A, et al.

14688562,Improving diagnostic testing and reducing overuse of antibiotics for children with pharyngitis: a useful role for the electronic medical record.,"BACKGROUND: Because of rising resistance to antibiotics, appropriate use of antibiotics is an important measure of quality of care. The purpose of this study was to use an electronic medical record (EMR) to assess use of diagnostic testing and of antibiotics for pharyngitis in a pediatric outpatient setting and to target areas for improvement.
METHODS: Using data retrieved from the EMR, we analyzed visits from March 1, 2001 to February 28, 2002 for children 3 to 18 years old diagnosed with pharyngitis. We determined the proportion of episodes with a diagnostic test for group A streptococci, the proportion for which a prescription for an antibiotic was dispensed and factors that predicted prescribing and testing.
RESULTS: Of 391 episodes of pharyngitis, a test was ordered for 303 (78%). Antibiotics were prescribed for 90 (23%); for 76 of 90 (84%) a test was ordered. Clinicians were less likely to order tests late in the week [relative risk (RR), 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66, 0.87)], more likely to order tests for patients with an exudate (RR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1, 1.3) and more likely to prescribe an antibiotic for patients with an exudate (RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1, 2.1). When prescribing an antibiotic clinicians were less likely to order tests late in the week (RR 0.1; 95% CI 0.02, 0.5) and for patients diagnosed with scarlet fever (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01, 0.4).
CONCLUSION: Using data from the EMR, we could assess adherence to the guidelines for antibiotic use and identify areas to target for improving diagnostic testing and reducing overuse of antibiotics in our clinic.","['Benin AL', 'Vitkauskas G', 'Thornquist E', 'Shiffman RN', 'Concato J', 'Krumholz HM', 'Shapiro ED']",2003,22,12,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Benin AL, et al.

DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.
SETTING: 43 family practices in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 156 children aged 4-15 who had a sore throat for less than seven days and at least two of the four Centor criteria (history of fever, absence of cough, swollen tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and tonsillar exudate). Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to penicillin for seven days, penicillin for three days followed by placebo for four days, or placebo for seven days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of symptoms, mean consumption of analgesics, number of days of absence from school, occurrence of streptococcal sequelae, eradication of the initial pathogen, and recurrences of sore throat after six months.
RESULTS: Penicillin treatment was not more beneficial than placebo in resolving symptoms of sore throat, neither in the total group nor in the 96 children with group A streptococci. In the groups randomised to seven days of penicillin, three days of penicillin, or placebo, one, two, and eight children, respectively, experienced a streptococcal sequela.

14632104,Acute bacterial skin infections in pediatric medicine: current issues in presentation and treatment.,"Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative débridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.",['Hedrick J'],2003,5 Suppl 1,,Paediatr Drugs,Hedrick J.

14575615,[The relationship between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and acute infections in children].,"The morbidity of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in children develops not evenly. Epidemiological leaps are periodically registered. This character of dynamics suggests the existence of environmental factors having the influence on the IDDM morbidity. One of these environmental factors is viral infection. We have set ourselves as an object to analyze the relationship between the primary morbidity of IDDM and some infectious diseases in children, to build up the prognostic models for the dynamics of IDDM morbidity and to evaluate their quality. Statistic analysis of the relationship between the primary morbidity of chicken pox, scarlet fever, measles, mumps, viral hepatitis, acute intestinal infectious diseases (AIID), acute upper respiratory infections (AURI) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in children of Grodno region covering the period from 1980 to 2001 years has been performed. It has been established, that morbidity rate of IDDM reliably positively correlated with morbidity of AURJ and AIID (accordingly r=0.62; and p=0.02 and r=0.46; p=0.04) and negatively with the scarlet fever and mumps morbidity (accordingly r=-0.55; p=0.008 and r=-0.53; p=0.01). But cluster analysis has shown, that really only indices of AURI and AIID morbidity were connected and formed one cluster. Morbidity rate of IDDM in children in the current year is most closely connected with AURI and AIID frequency in the previous year, but frequency of the above-mentioned infections registered in the same year influences less on diabetes morbidity, not mentioning the infections of 2-years standing which practically have no influence. If the increase in AURI morbidity accounts for 10% as compared to the previous year one may prognosticate with high reliability an increase of primary morbidity of IDDM by 7.7% on the average during the same year, and by 8.3% in the following year. For AIID these indices account for 3.5% and 4.4% correspondingly. In the increase of the morbidity rate of AIID the morbidity rate of IDDM reduces.","['Uloha AI', 'Lialikau SA']",2003,9,2,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw,Uloha AI and Lialikau SA.

In recent years an increased morbidity was more pronounced in Moscow than in the Russian Federation as a whole. Children formed the greater part of scarlet fever patients, the cases of scarlet fever among children in Moscow occurring more often than, on the average, in Russia. As before, annual morbidity among children attending children's institutions was higher 3- to 4-fold than among children brought up at home. This difference was most sharply pronounced among young children during the first two years of their life. In contrast to morbidity observed during previous 20-30 years, a drop in morbidity among children during the first two years of their life was registered, while morbidity level among children aged 3-6 years and 7-14 years increased. Scarlet fever morbidity had a pronounced seasonal (autumn-winter) pattern.

12843830,[Kawasaki's disease with eruptive pustular and guttate psoriasis].,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki's disease may have numerous atypical forms and these must be recognized in order to avoid delay of treatment. We report a case of psoriasis, first pustular and then guttate, occurring during Kawasaki's disease, and discuss a common pathophysiological mechanism.
CASE-REPORT: A 3 year-old boy was seen for a febrile exanthema suggestive of Kawasaki disease (bilateral conjunctivitis, red and fissured lips, palmoplantar erythema, scarlet fever-like rash and perineal desquamation) associated with pustular lesions. A biopsy specimen of a pustular area showed histological features consistent with the diagnosis of pustular psoriasis. No coronary abnormality was found. The child was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (2 g/kg) and oral aspirin (60 mg/kg/d). All the symptoms disappeared and immediate follow-up was marked by the appearance of guttate psoriasis.
DISCUSSION: Onset of psoriatic lesions during Kawasaki disease has been reported in 12 cases, either in acute phase or in immediate follow-up. Coronary complications have been found in 4 of 5 cases with acute psoriasis, suggesting a severe prognosis for this association. The hypothesis of a common pathophysiological mechanism is discussed with the intervention of a bacterial toxin acting as a superantigen and resulting in an strong activation of T-cells that leads to keratinocyte activation. The psoriatic lesions could hence be considered as a form of Köbner's phenomenon.","['Boralevi F', 'Barat P', 'Lepreux S', 'Stockman AL', 'Taïeb A', 'Léauté-Labrèze C']",2003,130,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Boralevi F, et al.

12843042,Major outbreak of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by Streptococcus mitis.,"Severe illness caused by viridans streptococci rarely occurs in immunocompetent hosts. Between December 1990 and May 1991, thousands of patients in the YangZi River Delta area of Jiangsu Province, China, suffered from scarlet fever-like pharyngitis. Fewer cases occurred in subsequent years with the same seasonality. Approximately half of the cases developed complications characteristic of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). Throat cultures yielded predominant growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. All cases admitted to Haian People's Hospital were investigated. Clinical specimens were collected, medical records were reviewed, and bacterial isolates were identified phenotypically and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Proteins were purified from culture supernatants by extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and fast-protein liquid chromatography. Biological activities of protein components were determined by subcutaneous inoculation into rabbits. A total of 178 cases of non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal scarlet fever-like pharyngitis were studied. In 88 (79.3%) of 111 patients, oropharyngeal swab cultures grew morphologically identical alpha-hemolytic streptococci. A protein in culture supernatants was pyrogenic in rabbits, was mitogenic for splenocytes, and enhanced rabbit susceptibility to endotoxin challenge. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 34-kDa protein showed no homology with known Streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxins. The organism was identified as Streptococcus mitis based on biochemical and 16S rRNA sequence analyses. Representative outbreak isolates from 1990 to 1995 displayed identical PFGE patterns. This TSLS outbreak in southeastern China was caused by a toxigenic clone of S. mitis. An apparently novel toxin may explain the unusual virulence of this organism.","['Lu HZ', 'Weng XH', 'Zhu B', 'Li H', 'Yin YK', 'Zhang YX', 'Haas DW', 'Tang YW']",2003,41,7,J Clin Microbiol,"Lu HZ, et al.

12726763,Mobile genetic elements and bacterial toxinoses: the superantigen-encoding pathogenicity islands of Staphylococcus aureus.,"It is a remarkable observation that virtually all bacterial toxins associated with specific clinical conditions (toxinoses) are encoded by mobile (and therefore variable) genetic elements. Remarkably, these rarely, if ever, carry determinants of antibiotic resistance. Examples are the toxins responsible for diphtheria, anthrax, tetanus, botulism, cholera, toxic shock, scarlet fever, exfoliative dermatitis, food poisoning, travelers' diarrhea, shigella dysentery, necrotizing pneumonia, and others. A recently discovered example of this phenomenon is the family of related staphylococcal pathogenicity islands encoding superantigens (SAgs). These are 15-20kb elements that occupy constant positions in the chromosomes of toxigenic strains, and are characterized by certain phage-related features, namely genes encoding integrases, helicases, and terminases, and the presence of flanking direct repeats. The prototype, SaPI1 of Staphylococcus aureus, encodes TSST-1 plus two newly described SAgs, SEK and SEL. Other members of the family encode enterotoxins B (SaPI3) and C (SaPI4), plus at least two other SAgs each. SaPI1 and SaPI2, also encoding TSST-1, are excised and induced to replicate by certain staphylococcal phages, and are then encapsidated at high efficiency into phage-like infectious particles with heads about 1/3 the size of the helper phage heads, commensurate with the sizes of the respective genomes. This results in transfer frequencies of the order of 10(8)/ml, and is presumably responsible for the spread of these elements as well as for their acquisition in the first place. In the absence of a helper phage, these two islands are highly stable; neither excision, loss, or transfer occurs at detectable frequency. Several general implications of this phenomenon will be discussed. One is that the determinants of these toxins have been imported from other species and therefore are not components of the basic genome of the extant producing organisms. This raises the question of the biological (adaptive?) roles of these toxins. Another is that the toxin-carrying units can spread among different (though probably related) species. An interesting question is that of the biological basis for the separation of toxin and resistance determinants.",['Novick RP'],2003,49,2,Plasmid,Novick RP.

We therefore assessed prescription patterns by office-based physicians to analyse antibiotic consumption in early childhood. A total of 331 children < 6 years were eligible for inclusion. The number of antibiotic prescriptions, consumed daily doses, number of treatment courses, types of antibiotics and diagnoses for prescribing were determined. The prevalence of systemic antibiotic treatment was 42.9%. Antibiotic consumption was highest between 2 and 3 years of age (55.8%). The percentage of children receiving one, two or three courses of antibiotic treatment was 49.3, 28.2 and 16.2%, respectively. Acute otitis media (32.2%), upper respiratory tract infections (18.9%), tonsillitis (15.9%) and acute bronchitis (15.4%) were principal indications for treatment. Macrolides were most frequently prescribed (48.1%), followed by penicillin V (21.3%), broad-spectrum penicillins (14.3%), sulfonamides (10.5%) and cephalosporins (5.8%). Antibiotics not recommended for particular indication were selected in 5-43% of cases. The considerable prescription of systemic antibiotics to children in many European countries is also the case in Germany. A noteworthy trend emerged for suboptimal prescribing with second-line antibiotics. As such treatment may be associated with the development of bacterial resistance, improved guidelines for antibiotic treatment should be drawn up and enforced.","['Schindler C', 'Krappweis J', 'Morgenstern I', 'Kirch W']",2003,12,2,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,"Schindler C, et al.

12630338,[Incidence and distribution of Streptococcus pyogenes type M in patients treated at the Dr. Fran Mihaljević Infectious Disease Clinic in Zagreb from 1990 to 1996].,"AIM: The aim of this study was to estimate the changes in the appearance and distribution of M types of Streptococcus pyogenes in different cultures from 78 patients treated during the 1990-1996 period at the Dr. Fran Mihaljević University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolates were characterized by the T-agglutination pattern and M type and/or opacity factor type using the standards recommended by two World Health Organization Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on streptococci from Minneapolis and Prague.
RESULTS: In this study, 19% (15/79) of isolates were recovered from normally sterile sites, 26.6% (21/79) came from skin and 54.4% (43/79) from throat swabs. In one patient isolates from the skin and blood culture were analyzed. Of all, 92.4% (73/79) of the isolates were typed by T-agglutination pattern and 73.5% (58/79) by M protein and/or OF typing. The results of M typing showed 14 M types: M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M11, M12, M28, M57, M58, M60, M75, M76 and M78. The most commonly isolated types were M1 and M3 (13.8%, 8/58 each), followed by M28 found in 12.1% (7/58), and M6 and M12 in 10.3% (6/58) each. These five M types accounted for 60.3% (35/58) of all isolates. Analysis to changes in the distribution of M1 and M3 types during the 1990-1991 and 1992-1993 periods revealed a significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 isolates in the former (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.018). A significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 isolates was also recorded in the 1990-1991, than in 1994-1996 period. (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, P = 0.021). It was investigated whether Streptococcus pyogenes M1 and M3 types were associated with toxic and invasive infection. There were 28.2% (22/78) of patients with toxic and invasive infection: 31.9% (7/22) of them with the diagnosis of scarlet fever, whereas 68.1% (15/22) of the strains were obtained from normally sterile sites. There were 45.5% (10/22) of M1 and M3 types from patients with toxic and invasive infections. Types M6, M28 and M76 were found in an equal proportion of 9.1% (2/22), and M4, M12 and M 60 of 4.5% (1/22) each. In three strains, M type could not be identified (T8/25 SOR+, T25 SOR+ and T11 SOR+). M1 and M3 types were isolated from 10.3% (6/56) of patients with other streptococcal infections. A significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 types was recorded in patients with toxic and invasive infections than in those with other streptococcal infections (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.004). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess whether the increased proportion of streptococcal M types 1 and 3 was associated with the 1990-1991 period, or with the infection characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the distribution of M types 1 and 3 were found to be significantly associated only with toxic and invasive infections (odds ratio 4.35, p = 0.025). Odds ratio suggests that patients with toxic and invasive infections had a 4.35--fold increased risk of infections caused by types M1 and M3 found in patients with other streptococcal infections. The increased proportion of M types 1 and 3 during the 1990-1991 period was more significantly associated with the characteristics of infection than with the study period.","['Bejuk D', 'Begovac J']",2002,56,3,Acta Med Croatica,Bejuk D and Begovac J.

Erythema markedly appeared on the neck, axillary, antecubital, and popliteal fossae. However, other skin signs of scarlet fever such as red strawberry tongue and linear petechial eruption did not appear. Before his visit to our clinic, he had been diagnosed as pharyngitis and treated with cefaclor 750 mg daily for six days. However, the symptoms did not improve. Oral prednisolone of 20 mg daily rapidly improved all the symptoms. Pharyngeal culture grew Streptococcus pyogenes that was sensitive to cefaclor. Laboratory findings showed elevated serum levels of antibody against streptolysin O. Together with the distribution of erythema, culture of Streptococcal pyogenes, and elevated anti-streptolysin O titer, the diagnosis of baboon syndrome associated with streptococcal infection was made.

12540577,Infection by Streptococcus pyogenes induces the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand expression in mouse osteoblastic cells.,"Group A Streptococcus pyogenes is known to induce nongonococcal septic arthritis in addition to pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and poststreptococcal sequelae. However, little is known about the interaction between S. pyogenes and bone cells. We report here that S. pyogenes strain JRS4 (M6) attached to and invaded mouse primary osteoblasts. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection of osteoblasts stimulated expression of mRNA for the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Western blot analysis followed by ligand precipitation with the receptor activator of NF-kappaB receptor showed that there was an increase in RANKL protein in infected osteoblasts. Production of interleukin-6 was also stimulated, but no production of interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed. Stimulation of RANKL production was not observed in osteoblasts stimulated with heat-inactivated S. pyogenes, suggesting that an active interaction of S. pyogenes with osteoblasts is essential for this phenomenon. A Western blot analysis performed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated signal transduction proteins demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection induces phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. A specific inhibitor of this kinase, SB203580, inhibited RANKL production by infected osteoblasts. These results suggest that infection of osteoblasts by S. pyogenes stimulates RANKL production and may trigger bone destruction in infected bone tissue.","['Okahashi N', 'Sakurai A', 'Nakagawa I', 'Fujiwara T', 'Kawabata S', 'Amano A', 'Hamada S']",2003,71,2,Infect Immun,"Okahashi N, et al.

12489283,Evolving microbes and re-emerging streptococcal disease.,"Microbes will evolve and the epidemics they cause will continue to occur in the future as they have in the past. Microbes emerge from the evolutionary stream as a result of genetic events and selective pressures that favor new over old. It is nature's way. Microbes and vectors swim in the evolutionary stream, and they swim much faster than humans. Bacteria reproduce every 30 minutes and, for them, a millennium is compressed into a fortnight. They are ""fleet afoot,"" and the pace of research must keep up with them or they will overtake. Microbes were here on Earth 2 billion years before humans arrived, learning every trick of the trade for survival, and they are likely to be here 2 billion years after we depart. Current research on the rise and decline of epidemics is broadly based and includes evolutionary and population genetics of host-microbe relationships. Within this context, the 19th century pandemic of scarlet fever has been described. The possibility is raised that the GAS, which currently cause STSS, possess some of the virulence factors that caused pandemic scarlet fever. Furthermore, the GAS isolated during the recent outbreaks of ARF in certain locales in the United States have the virulence properties of the GAS frequently isolated in the first half of the 20th century. Finally, it is suggested that the strategy to confront emerging infectious diseases should be the study of infectious diseases from all points of view.

12432905,Safer and healthier foods.,"During the early 20th century, contaminated food, milk, and water caused many foodborne infections, including typhoid fever, tuberculosis, botulism, and scarlet fever. In 1906, Upton Sinclair described in his novel The Jungle the unwholesome working environment in the Chicago meat-packing industry and the unsanitary conditions under which food was produced. Public awareness dramatically increased and led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Once the sources and characteristics of foodborne diseases were identified--long before vaccines or antibiotics--they could be controlled by handwashing, sanitation, refrigeration, pasteurization, and pesticide application. Healthier animal care, feeding, and processing also improved food supply safety. In 1900, the incidence of typhoid fever was approximately 100 per 100,000 population; by 1920, it had decreased to 33.8, and by 1950, to 1.7 (Figure 1). During the 1940s, studies of autopsied muscle samples showed that 16% of persons in the United States had trichinellosis; 300-400 cases were diagnosed every year, and 10-20 deaths occurred. Since then, the rate of infection has declined markedly; from 1991 through 1996, three deaths and an average of 38 cases per year were reported.",['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'],1999,48,40,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

12419616,"The fundamental contribution of phages to GAS evolution, genome diversification and strain emergence.","The human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes many different diseases including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, and the post-infection sequelae glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. The frequency and severity of GAS infections increased in the 1980s and 1990s, but the cause of this increase is unknown. Recently, genome sequencing of serotype M1, M3 and M18 strains revealed many new proven or putative virulence factors that are encoded by phages or phage-like elements. Importantly, these genetic elements account for an unexpectedly large proportion of the difference in gene content between the three strains. These new genome-sequencing studies have provided evidence that temporally and geographically distinct epidemics, and the complex array of GAS clinical presentations, might be related in part to the acquisition or evolution of phage-encoded virulence factors. We anticipate that new phage-encoded virulence factors will be identified by sequencing the genomes of additional GAS strains, including organisms non-randomly associated with particular clinical syndromes.","['Banks DJ', 'Beres SB', 'Musser JM']",2002,10,11,Trends Microbiol,"Banks DJ, et al.

METHODS & RESULTS: Isolates recovered from pharyngitis (52) and rheumatic fever (RF)/ rheumatic heart disease (RHD) (8) patients were analysed for the presence of toxin genes, speA, speB and speF, by PCR. The specificity of the products was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern hybridization. Among the 60 isolates studied, the incidence of speA, speB and speF were 5(8.3%), 56(93.3%) and 53(88.3%), respectively. The expression of these genes was established in representative isolates by RT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analysis of frequency of the speA, speB and speF genes, among pharyngitis and RF/RHD associated isolates, showed higher incidence in RF/RHD (25%, 100%,100%) as compared to pharyngitis patients (5.8%, 92.3%, 86.5%), respectively. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY: The presence of the speA gene, which is usually associated with scarlet fever or toxic shock-like syndrome, within few Indian isolates may be indicative of new virulent strains circulating within the Indian community. High distribution of toxin genes among RF/RHD compared to pharyngitis isolates indicate their possible role in increased virulence.","['Nandi S', 'Chakraborti A', 'Bakshi DK', 'Rani A', 'Kumar R', 'Ganguly NK']",2002,35,3,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Nandi S, et al.

Dermatophytoses caused by Trichophyton or species of Microsporum affect either hair-bearing skin (scalp) (tinea capitis) or non-hair-bearing skin of the face, trunk, neck and limbs (tinea corporis). In babies, infections with the yeast fungus, Candida albicans, often develops from diaper rash. In addition to measles, rubella and varicella, viral dermatoses in children include herpes simplex or infections with Papillomavirus. Characteristic cutaneous alterations may also be caused by parasites, such as the scabies (itch) mite, and the head louse.",['Pfützner W'],2002,144,25,MMW Fortschr Med,"Pfützner W.

12082350,[Innovation in nineteenth century healthcare: disinfection stations].,"The possibility of limiting and preventing epidemics by cleansing everything that could be touched by patients, was an intuitive thought well before microbial discoveries. In accordance with the ""miasmas theory"", morbid substances were emanated from the bodies of the patients. A step forward took place in the 19th century with Pasteur and Koch's discoveries and progress in chemical disinfectants. The law was slow to adapt: in Italy only in 1888 was a Code drawn up to establish some ""Disinfection Stations"", places for the sterilisation of infectious material from patients' homes. Later, a similar home service was started for everything that was not transportable. Thus, in the case of cholera, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus, tuberculosis, etc. it became possible to sterilise everything with which patients came into contact.",['Pistacchio E'],2001,9,1,Infez Med,Pistacchio E.

12037265,Diphtheria and hearing loss.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if infectious diseases usually experienced in childhood have an effect on hearing ability later in life.
METHODS: The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (N = 3,753) is a population-based study of age-related hearing loss in adults aged 48 to 92 years in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. As part of this study, infectious disease history was obtained and hearing was tested using pure-tone audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz greater than 25 decibels hearing level in either ear.
RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, only a history of diphtheria (n = 37) was associated with hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 7.36). There was no relationship between hearing loss and history of chickenpox, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rheumatic fever, rubella, or scarlet fever. Only two participants with a history of diphtheria and hearing loss reported having a hearing loss before age 20.
CONCLUSIONS: Diphtheria in childhood may have consequences for hearing that do not become apparent until later in life. A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway. These data may have important implications for areas facing a resurgence of diphtheria cases.","['Schubert CR', 'Cruickshanks KJ', 'Wiley TL', 'Klein R', 'Klein BE', 'Tweed TS']",2001,116,4,Public Health Rep,"Schubert CR, et al.

11980459,Skin and soft tissue infection.,"Abstract. Normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. The most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). Skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. This article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. Impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by S. aureus and / or Group A streptoccus. In mild and localized impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin should be used. Folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by S. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. These conditions can be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by S. aureus of phase group II. Intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. Erysipelas and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or S. aureus requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. Gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.","['Sharma S', 'Verma KK']",2001,68 Suppl 3,,Indian J Pediatr,Sharma S and Verma KK.

11924823,Skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.,"The skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. Skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. Environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. Resident gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium sp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. In order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. Bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. Epidermal infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. Dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. The pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. Moreover, S. aureus and S. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Bartonella sp., Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and Vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.","['Chiller K', 'Selkin BA', 'Murakawa GJ']",2001,6,3,J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc,"Chiller K, et al.

11917108,Genome sequence and comparative microarray analysis of serotype M18 group A Streptococcus strains associated with acute rheumatic fever outbreaks.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a sequelae of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection, is the most common cause of preventable childhood heart disease worldwide. The molecular basis of ARF and the subsequent rheumatic heart disease are poorly understood. Serotype M18 GAS strains have been associated for decades with ARF outbreaks in the U.S. As a first step toward gaining new insight into ARF pathogenesis, we sequenced the genome of strain MGAS8232, a serotype M18 organism isolated from a patient with ARF. The genome is a circular chromosome of 1,895,017 bp, and it shares 1.7 Mb of closely related genetic material with strain SF370 (a sequenced serotype M1 strain). Strain MGAS8232 has 178 ORFs absent in SF370. Phages, phage-like elements, and insertion sequences are the major sources of variation between the genomes. The genomes of strain MGAS8232 and SF370 encode many of the same proven or putative virulence factors. Importantly, strain MGAS8232 has genes encoding many additional secreted proteins involved in human-GAS interactions, including streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin) and two uncharacterized pyrogenic exotoxin homologues, all phage-associated. DNA microarray analysis of 36 serotype M18 strains from diverse localities showed that most regions of variation were phages or phage-like elements. Two epidemics of ARF occurring 12 years apart in Salt Lake City, UT, were caused by serotype M18 strains that were genetically identical, or nearly so. Our analysis provides a critical foundation for accelerated research into ARF pathogenesis and a molecular framework to study the plasticity of GAS genomes.","['Smoot JC', 'Barbian KD', 'Van Gompel JJ', 'Smoot LM', 'Chaussee MS', 'Sylva GL', 'Sturdevant DE', 'Ricklefs SM', 'Porcella SF', 'Parkins LD', 'Beres SB', 'Campbell DS', 'Smith TM', 'Zhang Q', 'Kapur V', 'Daly JA', 'Veasy LG', 'Musser JM']",2002,99,7,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Smoot JC, et al.

11883441,[Vilnius Medical Association: the first half-century (1805-1850)].,"Vilnius Medical Association, oldest scientific medical association in Poland and in the Russian Empire, was founded for the purposes of self-development in 1805 on the initiative of an Austrian professor of pathology and detailed therapy, Józef Frank (1771-1842). From its beginnings, the association acted for the good of society and science, independently of political conditions and with varying intensity. Apart from doctors, it also included pharmacists who contributed towards raising the standard of pharmacy in Lithuania. The first half-century of its existence constitutes the most fruitful period of activity as it was supported by professors of the then Medical Department of Vilnius University. At that time the Association established its regulations, founded the Library, and published ""Pamietnik Wileńskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego"" (Journal of Vilnius Medical Association, 1818 and 1821), ""Pamietnik Farmaceutyczny"" (Pharmaceutical Journal, 1820 and 1821), ""Dziennik Medycyny Chirurgii i Farmacji"" (Journal of Medicine, Surgery and Pharmacy, 1820, 1823, and 1830), as well as ""Collectanea Medico Chirurgica"", 1838. It also began gathering and analysing data for medical statistics, as well as developing Polish medical and chemical nomenclature. The Association re-organised shipments of medicines from pharmacies. It endeavoured to raise the standard of medical knowledge in the Vilnius area, combated epidemics of plague, cholera, scarlet fever, smallpox, typhus, diphteria, dysentery and monitored occurrences of plica. It also established the first Institute of Vaccination against Smallpox in Vilnius (1809); carried out scientific research on health resorts at Druskienniki, Birsztany and Stokliszki; promoted hygiene and examined the health of the inhabitants of Vilnius and the surrounding area as well as endorsed authority decisions related to the location of temporary military hospitals. At its meetings, members of the Association discussed their own medical cases as well as methods of treatment, presented the most recent reports in the medical literature, combated obsolete theories and scientific systems and established cooperation with other scientific associations in the country as well as abroad.

11582925,[Clinical aspects of streptococcal and staphylococcal toxinic diseases].,"Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce a lot of toxins, some of them responsible for specific diseases. Staphylococcal food poisoning is due to ingestion of enterotoxin containing food. Seven toxins have been isolated so far. Generalized exfoliative syndrome is related to exfoliatin. Young children are particularly affected. The disease consists in a cutaneous exfoliation usually limited with a favourable outcome. The mucus membranes are not involved. The nose or pharynx are the most usual portal of entry. Staphylococcus aureus is not grown from the bullae. Severe extensive forms have been observed particularly in neonates (Ritter's disease). Bullous impetigo is also due to exfoliatin. It consists in the presence of a restricted number of cloudy bullae, from which staphylococcus can be grown. It is a mild disease with a favourable outcome within a few days. Scarlet fever is related to the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins. The classic form of the disease is presently rare. This disease may be related to staphylococcus as a complication of arthritis, osteomyelitis or wound super-infection. Bacteremia is usual. Staphylococcal scarlet fever is not related to exfoliatin as previously believed, but to enterotoxins or TSST-1, so it seems to be an abortive form of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is defined as a multi organ failure syndrome with a rapid onset, fever, rash followed by desquamation, vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, conjunctivitis and strawberry tongue. The disease is related to an infection or colonisation with a toxin (TSST-1) producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterotoxins (mainly C) may be involved. The disease may occur in childhood, sometimes after superinfection of varicella. The mortality is low (5%) and mainly due to ARDS or cardiac problems. Erythrogenic toxins produced by Streptococcus pyogenes are involved in a streptococcal form of toxic shock syndrome with a quite similar presentation. In most cases however, a cutaneous or soft tissue infection is at the origin. Necrotizing fasciitis complicating varicella is a classic cause in children. Bacteremia is often observed. The mortality rate is as high as 60%. The streptococcal strains involved in north america use to produce the toxin erythrogenic A, the european cases seem to be more related to strains secreting the B toxin with a dysregulation of the mechanisms which control the secretion of the toxin. Staphylococcus strains producing the Panton and Valentine leucocidin are responsible for chronic or relapsing furonculosis and above all for a very severe necrotizing pneumonia observed in children and young adults presenting as an acute respiratory distress syndrome with leucopenia, hemoptysis and shock carrying a heavy mortality rate. Besides these specific diseases, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins may be involved in some syndromes of unknown origin, in which the intervention of superantigens seems very likely. Kawasaki syndrome is among them as strains producing staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins have been grown from patients with Kawasaki syndrome. In the same way, the intervention of toxins is suspected in the determination of sudden infant death syndrome and atopic eczema.",['Floret D'],2001,8 Suppl 4,,Arch Pediatr,Floret D.

11433095,Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome in a very low birth weight premature infant.,"Exfoliative skin diseases are rare in neonates. When caused by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, scalded-skin diseases such as staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), bullous impetigo, and staphylococcal scarlet fever may develop. These diseases might cause significant complications and mortality. SSSS is caused by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins A or B, which split the granular layer of the skin, induce proteolysis, and might exhibit superantigen activities, such as epidermolysis and lymphocyte mitogenicity. We describe a 1378-g premature male infant who was born at 29 weeks' gestation and developed SSSS on day 3 of life, with no clinical signs of neonatal sepsis. After cultures from the lesion and bloodstream were obtained, intravenous cloxacillin therapy was started. Infection control measures were implemented instantly and included isolation of the infected infant, personnel handwashing with hexachlorophene, and placement of exposed neonates into a cohort. The initial lesion expanded and additional lesions appeared, but 12 hours after initiation of antibacterial therapy, the lesions ceased to proliferate. Cultures from scalded-skin lesions grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the bloodstream culture was sterile. The lesions resolved completely within 6 days, and the infant's subsequent course was uneventful. No similar skin lesions were noticed in other infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.

11418146,Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. It produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever, and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics. Whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism.
METHODS: Whole genome sequences of two related S aureus strains (N315 and Mu50) were determined by shot-gun random sequencing. N315 is a meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) strain isolated in 1982, and Mu50 is an MRSA strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997. The open reading frames were identified by use of GAMBLER and GLIMMER programs, and annotation of each was done with a BLAST homology search, motif analysis, and protein localisation prediction.
FINDINGS: The Staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes, many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer. Most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island. Three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome: a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family, exotoxin islands, and enterotoxin islands. In the latter two pathogenicity islands, clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors. The analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors.
INTERPRETATION: The remarkable ability of S aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer. Repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why S aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds, eliciting severe immune reactions. Investigation of many newly identified gene products, including the 70 putative virulence factors, will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by S aureus.","['Kuroda M', 'Ohta T', 'Uchiyama I', 'Baba T', 'Yuzawa H', 'Kobayashi I', 'Cui L', 'Oguchi A', 'Aoki K', 'Nagai Y', 'Lian J', 'Ito T', 'Kanamori M', 'Matsumaru H', 'Maruyama A', 'Murakami H', 'Hosoyama A', 'Mizutani-Ui Y', 'Takahashi NK', 'Sawano T', 'Inoue R', 'Kaito C', 'Sekimizu K', 'Hirakawa H', 'Kuhara S', 'Goto S', 'Yabuzaki J', 'Kanehisa M', 'Yamashita A', 'Oshima K', 'Furuya K', 'Yoshino C', 'Shiba T', 'Hattori M', 'Ogasawara N', 'Hayashi H', 'Hiramatsu K']",2001,357,9264,Lancet,"Kuroda M, et al.

11388614,Neopterin production and tryptophan degradation in humans infected by Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes may cause tonsillitis, scarlet fever and so-called ""streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome"" (STSS). These streptococci produce exotoxins which are implicated as superantigens in the pathogenesis of STSS and scarlet fever. Using human peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells in vitro, such toxins were shown to induce neopterin production and degradation of the amino acid tryptophan to metabolites such as kynurenine by activating indoleamine (2,3)-dioxygenase via interferon-gamma. We investigated the sera of seven patients with streptococcal tonsillitis and of four patients with STSS. Those with STSS showed higher serum neopterin concentrations (median: 152 nmol/l; 95th percentile in healthy controls: 8.7 nmol/l) than those with tonsillitis (median: 12 nmol/l). Similarly, kynurenine to tryptophan ratios were increased in tonsillitis and extremely high in patients with STSS. Highly increased neopterin production and tryptophan degradation in patients with STSS suggest an association between a high degree of T cell activation and the severity of the disease manifestation.","['Murr C', 'Gerlach D', 'Widner B', 'Dierich MP', 'Fuchs D']",2001,189,3,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Murr C, et al.

11369867,Structural features of a zinc binding site in the superantigen strepococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA1): implications for MHC class II recognition.,"Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) is produced by Streptococcus pyogenes, and has been associated with severe infections such as scarlet fever and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS). In this study, the crystal structure of SpeA1 (the product of speA allele 1) in the presence of 2.5 mM zinc was determined at 2.8 A resolution. The protein crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2, with four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The final structure has a crystallographic R-factor of 21.4% for 7,031 protein atoms, 143 water molecules, and 4 zinc atoms (one zinc atom per molecule). Four protein ligands-Glu 33, Asp 77, His 106, and His 110-form a zinc binding site that is similar to the one observed in a related superantigen, staphylococcoal enterotoxin C2. Mutant toxin forms substituting Ala for each of the zinc binding residues were generated. The affinity of these mutants for zinc ion confirms the composition of this metal binding site. The implications of zinc binding to SpeA1 for MHC class II recognition are explored using a molecular modeling approach. The results indicate that, despite their common overall architecture, superantigens appear to have multiple ways of complex formation with MHC class II molecules.","['Baker M', 'Gutman DM', 'Papageorgiou AC', 'Collins CM', 'Acharya KR']",2001,10,6,Protein Sci,"Baker M, et al.

We collected the available evidence for a wide range of infections and infestations and produced evidence-based guidelines for their control in schools and preschools.
METHODS: A thorough MEDLINE literature search was conducted on the incubation period, period of infectiousness and effectiveness of exclusion for 41 infections. The quality of the information obtained was indicated by levels of evidence. The information was used to produce guidelines on exclusion, and the recommendations were graded according to the levels of evidence available. Grades A, B and C represented strongly, reasonably and poorly evidence-based recommendations, respectively.
RESULTS: The quality of data obtained was highly variable. Information on incubation periods was obtained for all 41 infections and was generally of good quality. Information on periods of infectiousness and effectiveness of exclusion was of a lesser quality and was found for only 11 and 4 conditions, respectively. There were 3 Grade A, 17 Grade B and 21 Grade C recommendations on exclusion. Examples of exclusion periods include: 5 days for chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and scarlet fever; and 24 h from the cessation of diarrhea for most gastrointestinal diseases In contrast to existing guidelines exclusion was not recommended for school age children with hepatitis A.
CONCLUSIONS: We have been able to present the best available data on the incubation periods and periods of infectiousness of 41 childhood infections.

This research consisted of 5,866 strains of scarlet fever-patients (scarlet fever-strains), 450 of child-patients (child-strains), 141 of adult-patients (adult-strains) and 409 strains of the indistinct. The results were summarized as follows: 1. Total of 6,866 strains were classified to sixteen kinds of T-types such as T12 (44.1%), T4 (21.7%), T1 (9.2%), T6 (4.4%), T3 (2.8%), T22 (2.1%), T18 (1.9%), T28 (1.6%) & others. This pattern of type distribution, three prevailing types of T12/T4/T1, have been reported in other areas generally. But original increase of isolation rates of strains of some T-types as T6, for example, also appeared in Sapporo. 2. Long-term observations demonstrated that the isolation rates of individual T-type, especially T4 or T1, had been forming a small epidemic-wave having a 4 to 8 year-interval and these of type T3 or type T6 on the other hand were repeating sudden prevalence every several years. 3. The isolation rates of type T12 or type T4 in scarlet fever-strains, were significantly higher than in child-strains or adult-strains. It was shown that Type T1 was distributed widely irrespective of patient-group and age-group. It was also characteristic to be distributed to many T-types in adult-strains.","['Takizawa Y', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Olibera M', 'Takahashi S']",2001,75,3,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Takizawa Y, et al.

AIM: To analyze the complexity and attractant topological resemblance of seven infectious diseases in Chile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The annual incidence of measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, meningococcal meningitis, diphtheria, typhoid fever and poliomyelitis was obtained from the annual reports of diseases. Correlation dimensions and the largest Lyapunov series exponents were estimated. The resemblance among their attractants was assessed by Hausdorff distance. The measures were performed both before and after seasonal filtering.
RESULTS: All series showed a dynamics near low dimensional chaos. The correlation dimensions ranged between 2.12 and 2.76. The correlation dimensions did not change after seasonal differentiation. Apart from one, all disease dynamics had large Lyapunov exponents, near 0.6 Bits/year. These decreased if series were differentiated. Before differentiation, the topological resemblance was mainly caused by the seasonal component of the dynamics but thereafter, the resemblance increased. In spite of different transmission mechanisms and etiologies, all analyzed infectious diseases conformed a truly single group, during cluster analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that beneath the dynamics of infectious diseases, obscured by seasonal environmental factors, lays a very consistent nonlinear agent-susceptible host dynamics.","['Canals M', 'Labra F']",1999,127,9,Rev Med Chil,Canals M and Labra F.

Questionnaire information about the cases was collected from parents and general practitioners per telephone. Throat specimens were taken, before and after treatment, for culturing and specific typing of streptococci was performed to determine transmission. Within a period of one month, 21 schoolchildren in a class of 29 pupils, with a mean age of 5 years, presented with symptoms caused by streptococcal infection (attack rate: 72%). Eight had scarlet fever, 5 suffered from impetigo and 8 had pharyngitis. A further 6 children, outside of this class, had complaints of scarlet fever, impetigo or pharyngitis. For 90% (26/29) of the schoolchildren a throat culture was established. Twelve positive cultures of the same strain of beta-haemolytic group A streptococcus, T4M4 exotoxin C gene positive, were found. The advice given was to treat all positive children for 3 days with azithromycin to prevent complications and further spreading of the disease. After two weeks only one child, that had not taken the antibiotics, still had a positive throat culture. No further cases or complications were reported.
DISCUSSION: The pattern of the outbreak was typical of a person-to-person transmission. This was confirmed by typing of the isolates. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of mandatory notification of infectious clusters by institutions, such as schools, as introduced in the new Dutch Infectious Disease Act.

Time-series analysis of the results shows that there were two distinct phases to the disease (i) 1848-1880: regular epidemics (wavelength = 3.7 years) consistent with the system being driven by an oscillation in the transmission coefficient (deltabeta) at its resonant frequency, probably associated with dry conditions in winter (ii) 1880-1900: an undriven SEIR system with a falling endemic level and decaying epidemics. This period was associated with improved nutritive levels. There is also evidence from time-series analysis that raised wheat prices in pregnancy caused increased susceptibility in the subsequent children.

This role, together with the ubiquity of diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, have prompted structural analyses of SPEA by several groups. Papageorgiou et al. (1999) have recently reported the structure of SPEA crystallized in the absence of zinc. Zinc has been shown to be important in the ability of some staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins to stimulate proliferation of CD4+ T-cells. Since cadmium is more electron dense than zinc and typically binds interchangeably, we grew crystals in the presence of 10 mM CdCl2. Crystals have been obtained in three space groups, and the structure in the P2(1)2(1)2(1) crystal form has been refined to 1.9 A resolution. The structural analysis revealed an identical tetramer as well as a novel tetrahedral cluster of cadmium in all three crystal forms on a disulfide loop encompassing residues 87-98. No cadmium was bound at the site homologous to the zinc site in staphylococcal enterotoxins C (SECs) despite the high structural homology between SPEA and SECs. Subsequent soaking of crystals grown in the presence of cadmium in 10 mM ZnCl2 showed that zinc binds in this site (indicating it can discriminate between zinc and cadmium ions) using the three ligands (Asp77, His106, and His110) homologous to the SECs plus a fourth ligand (Glu33).","['Earhart CA', 'Vath GM', 'Roggiani M', 'Schlievert PM', 'Ohlendorf DH']",2000,9,9,Protein Sci,"Earhart CA, et al.

We report on two patients with scarlet fever associated with hepatitis. The patients (boys aged 6 and 7 years) both presented with a scarlatiniform rash, dark urine and light-colored stools. Laboratory studies revealed elevated liver transaminases and negative antibody tests against hepatitis viruses A, B and C, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Both patients were treated with antibiotics and recovered completely within a few days. Although the association between scarlet fever and hepatitis has been known for many decades, the pathogenesis is still unknown. Physicians treating patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be aware of possible hepatic involvement.","['Girisch M', 'Heininger U']",2000,28,4,Infection,Girisch M and Heininger U.

10920183,Kawasaki disease: A brief history.,"Tomisaku Kawasaki published the first English-language report of 50 patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) in 1974. Since that time, KD has become the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in North America and Japan. Although an infectious agent is suspected, the cause remains unknown. However, significant progress has been made toward understanding the natural history of the disease and therapeutic interventions have been developed that halt the immune-mediated destruction of the arterial wall. We present a brief history of KD, review progress in research on the disease, and suggest avenues for future study. Kawasaki saw his first case of KD in January 1961 and published his first report in Japanese in 1967. Whether cases existed in Japan before that time is currently under study. The most significant controversy in the 1960s in Japan was whether the rash and fever sign/symptom complex described by Kawasaki was connected to subsequent cardiac complications in a number of cases. Pathologist Noboru Tanaka and pediatrician Takajiro Yamamoto disputed the early assertion of Kawasaki that KD was a self-limited illness with no sequelae. This controversy was resolved in 1970 when the first Japanese nationwide survey of KD documented 10 autopsy cases of sudden cardiac death after KD. By the time of the first English-language publication by Kawasaki in 1974, the link between KD and coronary artery vasculitis was well-established. KD was independently recognized as a new and distinct condition in the early 1970s by pediatricians Marian Melish and Raquel Hicks at the University of Hawaii. In 1973, at the same Hawaiian hospital, pathologist Eunice Larson, in consultation with Benjamin Landing at Los Angeles Children's Hospital, retrospectively diagnosed a 1971 autopsy case as KD. The similarity between KD and infantile periarteritis nodosa (IPN) was apparent to these pathologists, as it had been to Tanaka earlier. What remains unknown is the reason for the simultaneous recognition of this disease around the world in the 1960s and 1970s. There are several possible explanations. KD may have been a new disease that emerged in Japan and emanated to the Western World through Hawaii, where the disease is prevalent among Asian children. Alternatively, KD and IPN may be part of the spectrum of the same disease and clinically mild KD masqueraded as other diseases, such as scarlet fever in the preantibiotic era. Case reports of IPN from Western Europe extend back to at least the 19th century, but, thus far, cases of IPN have not been discovered in Japan before World War II. Perhaps the factors responsible for KD were introduced into Japan after the World War II and then reemerged in a more virulent form that subsequently spread through the industrialized Western world. It is also possible that improvements in health care and, in particular, the use of antibiotics to treat infections caused by organisms including toxin-producing bacteria reduced the burden of rash/fever illness and allowed KD to be recognized as a distinct clinical entity. Itsuzo Shigematsu, Hiroshi Yanagawa, and colleagues have conducted 14 nationwide surveys in Japan. These have indicated that: 1) KD occurred initially in nationwide epidemics but now occurs in regional outbreaks; 2) there are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 new cases each year; 3) current estimates of incidence rates are 120 to 150 cases per 100,000 children <5 years old; 4) KD is 1.5 times more common in males and 85% of cases occur in children <5 years old; and 5) the recurrence rate is low (4%). In 1978, David Morens at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a case definition based on Kawasaki's original criteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a computerized database in 1984, and a passive reporting system currently exists in 22 states. Regional investigations and national surveys suggest an annual incidence of 4 to 15 cases per 100 000 children <5 years o","['Burns JC', 'Kushner HI', 'Bastian JF', 'Shike H', 'Shimizu C', 'Matsubara T', 'Turner CL']",2000,106,2,Pediatrics,"Burns JC, et al.

The district physicians' reports give us an insight into health and living conditions in this district in the last half of the 19th century. This paper is based on a study of all statistical data and physicians' comments concerning the Sandnes district for the 1866-1900 period. The incidence of various diseases is estimated. Mental illness seems to have been more frequent in Sandness than in the rest of the county. In the physicians' reports, this was explained by the dominance of religious Puritanism in the district. The incidence of other disease, such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis and scarlet fever, did not differ essentially between Sandnes and the county as a whole. The living conditions in the district were rather good during the whole period, though the physicians' reports provide interesting insight in changes from one year to another.","['Helgaland T', 'Rosvold EO']",1999,119,30,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,Helgaland T and Rosvold EO.

10759357,Group A streptococci in the 1990s.,"The last decade has witnessed a remarkable change in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal infections. There has been a marked increase globally in the reporting of invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococci. Many of these cases were deep-seated infections associated with shock and multi-organ failure and are defined as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. In addition, reports of streptococcal sequelae, in particular, acute rheumatic fever, have re-emerged and remain a serious health threat in developed countries. It appears that these infections are related to the type distributions of the organism among the general population, with the re-emergence of more 'virulent' strains, such as the M1 serotype which in earlier decades was primarily seen in cases of either superficial disease or scarlet fever. Population-based surveillance studies have clearly indicated the importance and relevance of type identification for epidemiological purposes. There have also been suggestions that certain extracellular products and toxins play a major role in the so-called 'increased virulence' of the organism; these include cell surface molecules such as the M protein, opacity factor, the hyaluronic acid capsule, C5a peptidase and streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC), in addition to secreted proteins, pyrogenic exotoxins, cysteine proteinase, streptolysins O and S, hyaluronidase, streptokinase and other enzymes. All these factors, and events during the last decade, strongly emphasize the need for a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of group A streptococcal infections.",['Efstratiou A'],2000,45 Suppl,,J Antimicrob Chemother,Efstratiou A.

METHODS: Incidence data of notifiable communicable diseases during 1975 to 1996 were collected. Time series of measles and scarlet fever incidence during 1975 to 1995, 1980 to 1995, 1985 to 1995 and 1990 to 1995 were established. Correlation analysis was conducted between monthly cumulative percentage and predictive ratio of increase to decrease in incidence rate at the best cut-off point. Prediction was studied based on the constructed extrapolation model.
RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed that 98.3% (232/236) of the coefficients of correlation were negative (R < 0), indicating further the existence of Zeng-Ding phenomenon in disease epidemic. There was significant difference in coefficients of correlation between the four time series, which accounted for 63.8%, 54.2%, 44.1% and 35.0%, respectively; and for 73.3%, 56.7%, 36.7% and 36.7%, respectively, in measles, and for 53.6%, 51.8%, 51.7% and 33.3%, respectively, in scarlet fever. It showed that Zeng-Ding phenomenon correlated with the time series and the kinds of diseases. Prediction from extrapolation model showed that there was significant difference in predictive agreement between two time series of 1975 to 1995 (65.5%) and 1985 to 1995 (37.0%) with chi 2 of 4.54 and P < 0.05, indicating a trend that predictive agreement increased with prolonging of time series, and a trend that predictive agreement for scarlet fever increased with decreasing of coefficients of correlation.

11099582,Annual summary of vital statistics: trends in the health of Americans during the 20th century.,"The overall improvement in the health of Americans over the 20th century is best exemplified by dramatic changes in 2 trends: 1) the age-adjusted death rate declined by about 74%, while 2) life expectancy increased 56%. Leading causes of death shifted from infectious to chronic diseases. In 1900, infectious respiratory diseases accounted for nearly a quarter of all deaths. In 1998, the 10 leading causes of death in the United States were, respectively, heart disease and cancer followed by stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accidents (unintentional injuries), pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, suicide, kidney diseases, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Together these leading causes accounted for 84% of all deaths. The size and composition of the American population is fundamentally affected by the fertility rate and the number of births. From the beginning of the century there was a steady decline in the fertility rate to a low point in 1936. The postwar baby boom peaked in 1957, when 123 of every 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years gave birth. Thereafter, fertility rates began a steady decline. Trends in the number of births parallel the trends in the fertility rate. Beginning in 1936 and continuing to 1956, there was precipitous decline in maternal mortality from 582 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1935 to 40 in 1956. Since 1950 the maternal mortality ratio dropped by 90% to 7.1 in 1998. The infant mortality rate has shown an exponential decline during the 20th century. In 1915, approximately 100 white infants per 1000 live births died in the first year of life; the rate for black infants was almost twice as high. In 1998, the infant mortality rate was 7.2 overall, 6.0 for white infants, and 14.3 for black infants. For children older than 1 year of age, the overall decline in mortality during the 20th century has been spectacular. In 1900, >3 in 100 children died between their first and 20th birthday; today, <2 in 1000 die. At the beginning of the 20th century, the leading causes of child mortality were infectious diseases, including diarrheal diseases, diphtheria, measles, pneumonia and influenza, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, and whooping cough. Between 1900 and 1998, the percentage of child deaths attributable to infectious diseases declined from 61.6% to 2%. Accidents accounted for 6.3% of child deaths in 1900, but 43.9% in 1998. Between 1900 and 1998, the death rate from accidents, now usually called unintentional injuries, declined two-thirds, from 47. 5 to 15.9 deaths per 100 000. The child dependency ratio far exceeded the elderly dependency ratio during most of the 20th century, particularly during the first 70 years. The elderly ratio has gained incrementally since then and the large increase expected beginning in 2010 indicates that the difference in the 2 ratios will become considerably less by 2030. The challenge for the 21st century is how to balance the needs of children with the growing demands for a large aging population of elderly persons.","['Guyer B', 'Freedman MA', 'Strobino DM', 'Sondik EJ']",2000,106,6,Pediatrics,"Guyer B, et al.

To obtain clues to understanding the pathogenesis of STSS, we investigated the expression of several pathogenic factors in ten group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates from ten patients with STSS in Japan, in comparison with ten GAS isolates from children with scarlet fever. The ten scarlet fever-derived GAS isolates were equally low in lethality and anti-phagocytic activity in mice and in the production of streptolysin O (SLO), and equally high in production of superantigenic exotoxins (SAGTs) and cysteine proteinase. By comparison, the ten STSS-derived GAS isolates were heterogeneous in the expression of the above pathogenic factors, which ranged from low to high values. Most of the ten STSS-derived isolates were higher in lethality and anti-phagocytic activity and production of SLO, and lower in the production of SAGTs and cysteine proteinase than the ten scarlet fever-derived isolates. The results suggest that the lethality and anti-phagocytic activity examined in mice and SLO may be involved mainly in the development of most of the ten STSS cases.","['Shiseki M', 'Miwa K', 'Nemoto Y', 'Kato H', 'Suzuki J', 'Sekiya K', 'Murai T', 'Kikuchi T', 'Yamashita N', 'Totsuka K', 'Ooe K', 'Shimizu Y', 'Uchiyama T']",1999,27,4,Microb Pathog,"Shiseki M, et al.

Since the association of these two infections is reported in literature more and more frequently, the possible causes and precautionary measures are analysed.","['La Placa G', 'Andreotti M', 'Arlati S', 'Petroni F', 'Pugliese S']",1998,50,10,Minerva Pediatr,"La Placa G, et al.

9824838,Febrile infectious childhood diseases in the history of cancer patients and matched controls.,"The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that febrile infectious childhood diseases (FICDs) are associated with a lower cancer risk in adulthood, since biographical considerations are of great importance in anthroposophic medicine. Cancer patients and control patients of 35 anthroposophic general practitioners in Switzerland were matched with respect to gender, age and physician. All patients completed a questionnaire on their FICD. We collected 424 cases; of these we could analyze 379 matched pairs. The study consistently revealed a lower cancer risk for patients with a history of FICD. The strongest associations were found between patients with non-breast cancers and rubella respectively chickenpox. A strong association was also found with the overall number of FICD both 'classical' (measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, scarlet-fever and chickenpox) and 'other'. None of these associations was apparent for patients with breast cancer. Unexpectedly, we found that cancer was diagnosed significantly earlier in life in cancer patients with a history of FICD compared to those without FICD. Our retrospective study showed a significant association between FICD and the risk of developing cancer. The number of FICD decreased the cancer risk, in particular for non-breast cancers. The relationship with tumor site seems to be important also, but can only be addressed in a larger study.","['Albonico HU', 'Bräker HU', 'Hüsler J']",1998,51,4,Med Hypotheses,"Albonico HU, et al.

9759385,[Implications of bacterial protein toxins in infectious and food-borne diseases].,"Among the 315 protein toxins elicited by gram positive and gram negative bacteria so far characterized, about 50 toxins are currently considered as totally or partially, responsible of the pathological manifestations and/or lethality resulting from host infection or intoxication (contaminated food) by relevant toxinogenic bacteria. A certain number of criteria are required for the assessment of indisputable involvement of a toxin or an array of toxins (from the same bacteria) in infectious diseases: 1) The bacterial microorganism clearly identified as the pathogenic agent of the disease produces component(s) considered as toxin(s); 2) The administration to appropriate animal(s) of the toxin(s) separated from the relevant bacteria or produced by genetic engineering from a heterologous tox+ recombinant bacterial strain produces symptoms and pathophysiological disorders that mimic those observed in the natural disease or at least those elicited in experimental animals by the cognate toxin-producing bacteria; 3) The in vitro incubation of the isolated toxin(s) with appropriate animal organs, tissues or cells elicits certain pathophysiological, biochemical or metabolic manifestions observed in the host infected with the relevant toxinogenic bacteria; 4) Toxin concentration in the organism of the host infected by the toxinogenic bacteria should be compatible with the characteristics of the relevant disease. The toxins of pathogenic interest exhibit a variety of effects in bacterial diseases. Bacteria that colonize a wound or mucosal surface but do not invade target cells can produce toxins that act locally or enter the bloodstream and attack internal organs (e.g. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Vibrio cholerae, ...). Bacteria growing in a wound can produce toxins that destroy host tissue and kill phagocytes in the immediate vicinity of the bacteria, thus facilitating bacterial growth and spread. On the basis of the above mentioned criteria, the following bacterial diseases among many others are toxin-associated (toxinoses): diphtheria, tetanus, botulism, whooping cough, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome, cholera, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, gas gangrene, B. fragilis diarrhea, anthrax, pseudomembranous colitis.",['Alouf J'],1998,192,3,C R Seances Soc Biol Fil,Alouf J.

9734606,Immunohistochemical and serological evidence for the role of streptococcal proteinase in acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated the preferential secretion of streptococcal proteinase or streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB) by nephritic strains of Group A streptococci isolated from the skin or throat of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).
METHODS: To further explore the possible role of SPEB in APSGN, we performed ELISA studies to detect anti-SPEB antibodies in the sera of patients with APSGN, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), scarlet fever (SF) and normal children. Using ELISA, anti-SPEB titers on acute and convalescent APSGN sera were measured to determine immunity to APSGN. We also performed immunofluorescence studies on APSGN and non-APSGN kidney biopsies to probe for the presence and localization of SPEB.
RESULTS: Our data show that anti-SPEB antibodies are present in APSGN sera and antibody titers are significantly higher than in ARF, SF and normal sera. Anti-SPEB titers tend to rise acutely and decrease with time but do not reach baseline after one year. When kidney biopsies were probed with rabbit anti-SPEB antibody, 12 of 18 (67%) of the APSGN cases were positive while only 4 of 25 (16%) of the non-APSGN cases were positive.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we were able to demonstrate unique reactivity to SPEB in human sera and kidney biopsies of APSGN suggesting a significant role of this toxin in the pathogenesis of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.","['Cu GA', 'Mezzano S', 'Bannan JD', 'Zabriskie JB']",1998,54,3,Kidney Int,"Cu GA, et al.

9648121,Multiple sclerosis and infectious childhood diseases.,"To examine a possible relationship between infectious diseases and multiple sclerosis (MS) an enquiry was carried out among 606 MS patients in Switzerland. The data concerning their infectious childhood diseases were compared with epidemiological data for the normal Swiss population obtained from the Swiss Federal Health Office and from the Institute of Medical Statistics. The mean age of the MS patients was 50.7 years and the mean age at onset of multiple sclerosis was 33.8 years, significantly earlier in women (33.2 years) than in men (35.4 years, p < 0.05). In 18.8% multiple members of the family were affected. In comparison with persons of the control population, MS patients had measles infection at a later age (6.4 vs. 7.5 years). The curve of the age at which several infectious childhood diseases occurred was shifted to higher ages for MS patients (p < 0.005) compared to normal controls for mumps (80.2% for MS vs. 64.1% for controls in the age group 5-14 years), rubella (64.3% for MS vs. 48.4% for controls in the age group 5-14 years) and varicella (81.9% for MS vs. 39.0% for controls in the age group 5-19 years). For pertussis, however, there were more cases among those who later developed MS in the age group 1-9 years, which was earlier than in controls (86.0 vs. 56.7%). These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis may be associated with acquiring certain infectious childhood diseases at a later stage in comparison to normal controls.","['Bachmann S', 'Kesselring J']",1998,17,3,Neuroepidemiology,Bachmann S and Kesselring J.

9513217,Kawasaki disease: a dangerous acute childhood illness.,"Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness most commonly seen in children under the age of 5. It is characterized by fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, oropharyngeal mucosal changes, and erythema of the hands and feet followed by desquamation. However, a child with Kawasaki disease may not exhibit all of these symptoms. The disease resembles many other childhood illnesses, such as measles and scarlet fever, and misdiagnosis is common. Left untreated, Kawasaki disease has potential life-threatening consequences; 20% to 25% of children develop coronary artery aneurysms as a result. Although no specific laboratory tests exist that identify Kawasaki disease definitively, there are clinical and laboratory findings that guide diagnosis and treatment. Treatment includes the hospitalization of the child and subsequent administration of high doses of aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin. With recovery, aspirin doses are reduced and the child may be monitored at home with outpatient follow-up. It is imperative that the health care provider be aware of the symptoms of Kawasaki disease in order to make the diagnosis and treat the child before cardiac sequelae ensue.","['Rubin B', 'Cotton DM']",1998,23,2,Nurse Pract,"Rubin B and Cotton DM.

All strains isolated from patients with generalized exfoliative syndrome or bullous impetigo produced ETA and/or ETB and caused a Nikolsky's sign when injected subcutaneously into newborn mice. In contrast, exfoliative toxin was detected in an S. aureus strain from only one of 17 case of staphylococcal scarlet fever; the 16 other S. aureus strains produced TSST-1 and/or an enterotoxin. In conclusion, enterotoxins or TSST-1 are more frequently associated with staphylococcal scarlet fever than are exfoliative toxins. Hence staphylococcal scarlet fever may well represent an abortive form of toxic shock syndrome rather than a milder form of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.","['Lina G', 'Gillet Y', 'Vandenesch F', 'Jones ME', 'Floret D', 'Etienne J']",1997,25,6,Clin Infect Dis,"Lina G, et al.

9389241,An epidemic of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis in Armenia.,"AIM: To evaluate the presentation and course of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis (APGN), which has increased dramatically in Armenia after serious deterioration in the living conditions.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study, based on case notes, of a large homogeneous group of patients hospitalised for APGN at one centre over a five year period (1992-6).
PATIENTS: 474 patients aged < 16 years with a diagnosis of APGN.
RESULTS: The annual number of patients increased tenfold from 19 (average 1992/3) to 196 in 1995. Sixty two per cent were in the age group 4-9 years and 65% were boys. Upper respiratory infections, scarlet fever, and skin infections preceded APGN in 51%, 23%, and 13%, respectively. All patients had haematuria (93% gross), 84% had oedema, and 72% had hypertension. C3 was initially decreased in 95% of the patients examined. Renal function was impaired (serum creatinine > 100 mumol/l) in 29%. Four patients with renal failure had crescentic glomerulonephritis at biopsy; of these, three required temporary haemodialysis. Main extrarenal complications were heart failure (10%) and convulsions (3%). One patient died and five (3%) did not recover completely.
CONCLUSIONS: APGN in children is associated with considerable initial morbidity, and long term outcome is not uniformly benign.

9353057,Exclusion of bioactive contaminations in Streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin A preparations by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli.,"The streptococcal erythrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) belongs to the family of bacterial superantigens and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. Concerning its biological activity, mainly T-cell-stimulatory properties, conflicting data exist. In this study, we show that most of the SPEA preparations used so far contain biologically active contaminations. Natural SPEA from the culture supernatant of Streptococcus pyogenes NY-5 and recombinant SPEA purified from the culture filtrate of S. sanguis are strongly contaminated with DNases. We show that natural SPEA induces more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) than recombinant SPEA, but we also show that DNases are able to induce TNF-alpha. In commercial SPEA preparations, we identified a highly active protease, which was shown not to be SPEB. To exclude these contaminations, we overexpressed SPEA cloned in the effective high-level expression vector pIN-III-ompA2 in Escherichia coli. The expressed SPEA shows the same amino acid composition as natural SPEA, whereas functional studies reported so far were carried out with toxins containing an incorrect amino terminus. We describe the rapid purification of lipopolysaccharide-, DNase-, and protease-free SPEA in two steps from the host's periplasm and its structural characterization by circular dichroism. Our results represent for the first time the production in E. coli of recombinant SPEA with the authentic N-terminal sequence and a proven superantigenic activity. Collectively, our results indicate that immunological studies of superantigens require highly purified substances free of biologically active contaminations.","['Fagin U', 'Hahn U', 'Grötzinger J', 'Fleischer B', 'Gerlach D', 'Buck F', 'Wollmer A', 'Kirchner H', 'Rink L']",1997,65,11,Infect Immun,"Fagin U, et al.

Classical scarlet fever is rare now, but other severe streptococcal infections have become more frequent, such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The scarlatiniform exanthem and the shock observed in this disease are due to a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. Exfoliative toxins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus are responsible for the tender erythema and cutaneous scaling characteristic of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome of infancy. The so-called staphylococcal scarlet fever is probably an attenuated variant of this disease.

9253700,Outbreak of scarlet fever at a hospital day care centre: analysis of strain relatedness with phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.,"An outbreak of scarlet fever involving 12 children occurred at a hospital day care centre from February to March 1996. Twenty-five throat isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS, group A streptococcus) available from 24 children, including 10 children with scarlet fever and 14 asymptomatic carriers, and one asymptomatic staff member were studied for the presence of genes encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin types A (speA), B (speB), and C (speC) and for protease activity. Antimicrobial susceptibilities using the E-test, cluster analysis by cellular fatty acid composition and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns by means of arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction (APPCR) of the isolates were performed to investigate the outbreak. Only one isolate from an asymptomatic child possessed the speA gene. All isolates possessed the speB gene and 24 (96%) isolates were positive for the speC gene. There was no difference in protease activity between isolates from children with scarlet fever and from asymptomatic carriers. Thirteen isolates (10 recovered from children with scarlet fever, two from asymptomatic children, and one from the staff member) were considered to be the same strain according to the identical antimicrobial susceptibility profile and RAPD patterns and were also considered to be similar by cluster analysis of fatty acid composition. These findings suggest that the outbreak was caused by a unique clone of GAS.

AIM: To study the seasonal patterns of seven human infectious diseases in Chile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Series of monthly cases of measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, meningitis, diphtheria, typhoid fever and poliomyelitis were obtained from yearly reports of infectious disease of the Ministry of Health. Descriptive statistical parameters and multivariate methods were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: Diseases that have an enteric mode of transmission predominate in summer, independent of the type of agent (viral or bacterial) or presence of carriers. Diseases with a respiratory mode of transmission have two different patterns. Those without carriers (measles and whooping cough) predominate in spring and those with carriers (scarlet fever, diphtheria and meningitis) have a winter predominance.
CONCLUSIONS: This work confirms the seasonal variation of enteric and respiratory infectious diseases and defines patterns that can be useful for future studies.",['Canals M'],1997,125,4,Rev Med Chil,Canals M.

9157138,Determination of anti-streptolysin O antibody titer by a new passive agglutination method using sensitized toraysphere particles.,"We developed a new method for determining the anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer on the basis of a passive agglutination reaction. This new method uses Toraysphere particles sensitized with streptolysin O. This method was used to measure the ASO titer in 130 serum samples (from 31 patients with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, 26 patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, 5 patients with scarlet fever, 29 patients with non-group A streptococcal pharyngitis, 20 healthy children, and 19 healthy adults). The results were compared with those obtained simultaneously by two conventional methods, the Rantz-Randall and the NA-Latex-ASL methods. The results obtained by the Toraysphere method showed an excellent correlation with those obtained by each conventional method (correlation coefficients, 0.932 for the Rantz-Randall method and 0.913 for the NA-Latex-ASL method). The performance of each method was evaluated with respect to the clinical and microbiological diagnoses for each patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the Toraysphere method were 76, 84, 81, and 79%, respectively. The corresponding values for the Rantz-Randall method were 48, 78, 67, and 62%, respectively, while those for the NA-Latex-ASL method were 60, 82, 76, and 69%, respectively. Because the Toraysphere method is simple and reproducible, has a short reaction time, and has a clear-cut endpoint for the analysis, we recommend it for routine use in determining the ASO titer in the clinical microbiology laboratory.","['Kodama T', 'Ichiyama S', 'Morishita Y', 'Fukatsu T', 'Shimokata K', 'Nakashima N']",1997,35,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Kodama T, et al.

The Weekly Abstract of Sanitary Reports was the official disease surveillance report of the US Public Health Service and its predecessors, and began to publish urban mortality statistics on a regular basis in 1888. Here, the authors describe the first 25 years of continuous reporting (1888-1912), when the Reports contained not only disease data for US cities, but also records sent back by US consuls based in some 250 cities in many parts of the world.
METHODS: The content of the weekly editions of the Reports was systematically sampled and analysed using graphical techniques and the simple statistical method of running means.
RESULTS: Relatively complete weekly series of mortality from all causes, and six infectious diseases (diphtheria, enteric or typhoid fever, measles, scarlet fever, tuberculosis and whooping cough) were identified for a total of 100 cities world-wide.
CONCLUSION: Reporting coverage for these cities is sufficiently complete that multivariate analysis should be possible to obtain a comparative picture of mortality for many parts of the world. Despite limitations of the data, sources of the type described in this paper form an important comparative database for studying international patterns of mortality.","['Cliff AD', 'Haggett P', 'Smallman-Raynor M', 'Stroup DF', 'Williamson GD']",1997,19,1,J Public Health Med,"Cliff AD, et al.

9310113,Decrease in the concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in the sera of patients with Kawasaki disease.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is one of the most important forms of vasculitis, and is characterized by the initiation of a proinflammatory cytokine cascade. To further characterize the immunological profile of KD, we measured the serum levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) as a regulatory cytokine. We determined the concentration of TGF-beta 1 in the sera of the patients with KD, anaphylactoid purpura (AP), and scarlet fever, using a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The serum levels of TGF-beta 1 were decreased in patients with KD, but not in patients with AP or scarlet fever during the acute stage. We found an inverse correlation between TGF-beta 1 and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor levels in KD patients during the acute and subacute stage. Decreased levels of TGF-beta 1, in particular to suppress TNF alpha (TNF-alpha) production, is an important part of the regulatory system of increased TNF-alpha production which cause vasculitis.","['Matsubara T', 'Umezawa Y', 'Tsuru S', 'Motohashi T', 'Yabuta K', 'Furukawa S']",1997,26,4,Scand J Rheumatol,"Matsubara T, et al.

A house on the bastion Katten (Norwegian for ""the cat"") on the Fredriksberg fortress was adapted and made a provisional smallpox hospital. Later on it also served as a cholera hospital during a minor cholera epidemic in 1873, and as an isolation hospital for patients suffering from scarlet fever. The hospital housed only five to seven patients and two nurses. The doctor and hospital orderlies were isolated in an adjacent house. The Board of Health presented several plans for enlarging the hospital. Only in 1891 was the hospital on Katten replaced by a new and larger isolation hospital in another part of the city (Sandviken). At first, the Board of Health introduced rigid isolation regulations which were difficult to satisfy. When the pathogenic bacteria were discovered and the spread of infection was better understood, the view on isolation and other measures became more rational.",['Oeding P'],1996,116,30,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,Oeding P.

8972674,The dynamics of scarlet fever epidemics in England and Wales in the 19th century.,"There was a marked rise in scarlet fever mortality in England and Wales in the mid-nineteenth century and spectral analysis of the registration details, 1847-80, shows that the interepidemic interval was 5-6 years, but after 1880 the endemic level fell and the fatal epidemics disappeared. The dynamics of the scarlet fever epidemics can be represented by a linearized mathematical model and because the system is lightly damped, it could be driven by an oscillation in susceptibility. Epidemics were significantly correlated with dry conditions in spring/summer (P < 0.001), suggesting that these produced a low amplitude oscillation in susceptibility which drove the system. Epidemics also correlated (P < 0.001) with an oscillation in wheat prices but at a lag of 3 years, suggesting that malnutrition during pregnancy caused increased susceptibility in the subsequent children which interacted synergistically with seasonal dry conditions. Scarlet fever mortality was sharply reduced after 1880 in parallel with falling wheat prices suggesting that the remarkable period of high scarlet fever mortality (1840-80) was dependent on poor nutritive levels during that time.","['Duncan CJ', 'Duncan SR', 'Scott S']",1996,117,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Duncan CJ, et al.

Ninety persons at institutions for mentally retarded (73% residents) had infections due to the epidemic strain. Pharyngitis and scarlatina were the most common infections. Six patients died, five having a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. During the outbreak an intensive surveillance was carried out together with improved infection control measures and prompt culturing of residents and employees before antimicrobial treatment. The primary outbreak was confined but a secondary outbreak could not be prevented. This was probably due to difficulties in implementing proper isolation precautions in this setting.","['Kristensen B', 'Egelund B', 'Meyer M', 'Henrichsen J', 'Jepsen OB', 'Sievers CJ', 'Lundstedt C']",1996,158,12,Ugeskr Laeger,"Kristensen B, et al.

An anatomopathological case report].,"In 1967 Kawasaki studied 50 cases with the same features as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, further reported throughout Japan with the eponym of Kawasaki's disease. It is frequent in Japan and in USA, whereas in Europe it is sporadic and often misinterpreted. It presents as an acute fever, attended by irritation of the skin and oral mucosa, with swelling of cervical lymph nodes, easily misdiagnosed as scarlet fever, Stevens Johnson syndrome, or infantile exanthema or allergy. After the acute phase, Kawasaki's disease becomes chronic and sudden death is possible even if many years have elapsed. In the chronic phase, coronaritis, coronary aneurysms, marked stenosis and/or occlusive thrombosis are often present. Cardiac Lesions were classified from stage I to IV according to the duration of illness at death. The present work deals with the case of a 17 year old man, dying from undiagnosed coronary artery chronic Kawasaki disease. The patient had been hospitalized for Wolff-Parkinson-white syndrome; ten months after discharge he died suddenly, while performing gymnastics at school. Occluding thrombosis of cylindrical aneurysm of both coronary arteries, from undiagnosed Kawasaki arteritis, was found and the young boy succumbed to hyperacute infarction. The heart was fixed in buffered formalin 10% and embedded in paraffin. Histological examination of the cardiac conduction system has been carried out on serial sections, with the technique usually adopted by one of the present authors (L. Rossi). Hema-toxylin-eosin (H-E) and trichromic (Hei-denhein-azan) stainings have routinely employed.","['Nappo A', 'Rossi L', 'Matturri L']",1996,44,3,Minerva Cardioangiol,"Nappo A, et al.

8701648,[The hydrophobicity of Streptococcus pyogenes as a possible marker of its virulence].,"The hydrophobicity of 366 S. pyogenes cultures isolated from the pharynx of tonsillitis and scarlet fever patients and healthy children, as well as museum strain of type M29, was studied. The study revealed that the hydrophobicity of cultures isolated from scarlet fever patients exceeded that of cultures isolated from healthy carriers and tonsillitis patients. Among S. pyogenes cultures isolated in cases of prolonged carriership a considerable proportion of highly hydrophobic cultures was detected, which was probably indicative of an important role played by the hydrophobicity of streptococci in retaining them on the barrier epithelium. This was confirmed by the presence of correlation between the hydrophobicity of culture of S. pyogenes, type M29, and its adhesion to the fibronectin receptor and HEp-2 cells. For S. pyogenes of type M6, epidemic in the group of children under observation during the period of 1987-1988, the values characterizing its hydrophobicity were registered which significantly exceeded average hydrophobicity values. At the period of a rise in morbidity S. pyogenes cultures were characterized by significantly higher hydrophobicity. The variability of the hydrophobicity index and its relationship with the dissociation of cultures were established. The hydrophobicity index may be used as one of the virulence markers of S. pyogenes strains.","['Dmitrieva NF', 'Briko NI', 'Vylegzhanina ES', 'Kondrakova OA', 'Eshchina AS', 'Lisitsyna AB', 'Beliakov VD']",1996,,2,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Dmitrieva NF, et al.

Thus an infectious diseases ward was opened in 1945 at 4 Arkońska Str. Its organiser was dr Elzbieta Buk. Despite of lack of both medical staff and equipment as well as medicines in its first month of operation the ward had 160 patients. Mostly they suffered from typhus, diphtheria, dysentery and typhoid. Mortality was high: 37 patients died. Till the end of 1945 674 patients were treated, most in September. The patients were mostly Germans, Poles, Russians, Ukranians, Belorussians and occasionally French. The most frequent was typhus though there were cases of malaria and rabies. Typhoid TB, dysentery and diphtheria were also observed. In 1946/47 more wards were opened dealing with lung, skin, venereal and children's diseases. The last one directed by Dr Krystyna Stawiarska hod its scarlet fever and diphtheria sections and simultaneously an analytical and a bacteriological labs were set up and due to Dr Stanislae Swierczyśski determination they enabled basic diagnostics.

Although the epidemiology of KD suggests an infectious agent, the cause still remains unknown. Intense immune activation during the acute disease has been well documented. Quantitative determination of soluble CD23 in serum can serve as an index of macrophage/monocyte or B-cell activation. To further characterize the immunological profile in KD, we investigated whether soluble CD23 levels in serum increase during the acute disease. In addition, we compared soluble CD23 levels in 33 patients with acute KD with levels in ten patients each with measles, rubella, infectious mononucleosis, and scarlet fever to determine if marked elevations in soluble CD23 were unique to acute KD. Patients with KD, rubella and infectious mononucleosis, but not patients with measles or scarlet fever, had increased soluble CD23 levels in serum during the acute stage, as compared to age-matched control subjects (P < 0.01). These data suggest infection with Epstein-Barr virus and rubella and acute KD are all characterized by B-cell and macrophage/monocyte activation.","['Matsubara T', 'Furukawa S', 'Motohashi T', 'Okumura K', 'Yabuta K']",1995,154,10,Eur J Pediatr,"Matsubara T, et al.

7602798,[Immunological investigations on pathogenesis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome].,"Staphylococcal exfoliative toxin (ET) is an extracellular product of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) which includes Ritter's disease, bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scarlet fever, and has been regarded as the causative agent of SSSS. The ET has not only a splitting effect at the granular layer of skin in human and mice but also an immunogenicity to human and mice. Using experimental animals and clinical specimens of patients with or without SSSS, the immunological investigation were performed and following results were obtained. 1) When some inbred and congenic resistant strains of mice were immunized with serotype A ET (ETA), they were divided into the high anti-ETA antibody producers (high responders) and the low responders. The gene controlling antibody response to ETA in mice is located in the I-A subregion in the major histocompatible complex (H-2 complex), and its function seems to be at least related to antigen recognition at the T-lymphocyte level. 2) Neonatal mice are generally susceptible to ETA regardless of their H-2 haplo-type. However, the neonatal mice born to a high-responder mother immunized with ETA were resistant to the subcutaneous challenge of ETA, but those born to an immunized low-responder mother were susceptible to the challenge. 3) The relationship between susceptibility and immune response to ETA in some mammalians could be divided into three groups: the possession of resistant skin and high production of antibody to ETA (rabbits and rats); the possession of resistant skin and low production of antibody to ETA (golden hamsters and guinea pigs); the possession of sensitive skin and various titers of antibody to ETA (humans and mice). 4) The incidence of ET producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus in various clinical specimens obtained from patients without SSSS was 12% (50 out of 418 strains) in our epidemiological investigation. The percentages of antibody to ETA in sera obtained from healthy males and females were 23% and 29%, respectively. Eventually, ET-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus seem to be spread out wider than the microbiological result obtained from clinical specimens. 5) The mitogenic responses of lymphocytes isolated from patients with the first impetigo could be measured by using PHA, and the five-of them were in the low range, whereas lymphocytes from patients with recurrent impetigo were in the normal range on this survey. Maybe this results suggest the T lymphocyte functions of some patients with impetigo are deteriorated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Machida K'],1995,43,6,Rinsho Byori,Machida K.

8578753,[Effect of major epidemics on cultural awareness].,"Mankind has been stricken with ""major"" epidemic diseases throughout its history. The most serious among them immediately threaten man's life e.g. plague, cholera, smallpox, typhus, and dysentery, besides, there are others which take a slower course e.g. lues, leprosy, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and malaria. Yet, the ""lesser"" epidemic diseases like diphtheria, scarlet fever, mumps, pneumococcosis, influenza, and most recently AIDS may also turn into ""major"" ones. Originally, man exclusively depended on his genetic makeup for protection, and being particularly prone to attacks of disease he was subject to natural selection. Thus, only one human species survived, the homo sapiens. Interbreeding achieved biologic adaptation and created a balanced genetic polymorphism. Advancing in his degree of civilization, man formed groups, developed clothing, fire, houses, and tools, and his increasing cultural awareness allowed him to migrate from the tropical climates to more temperate, and less disease-infested zones. Immigration and wars, and the accompanying infections jeopardized and diminished entire populations and eradicated highly developed cultures like that of the American Indians. The plague, coming from Asia, and lues, from America, as well as cholera, influenza, and smallpox spread around the whole globe. Fear and terror led to irrational conclusions and triggered persecutions. The attitude of accepting disease as a God-sent fate (Hiob), or a God-sent punishment suppressed reasonable measures against disease. The necessary official measures have increasingly restricted liberty, and this patronizing treatment needs to be opposed with a higher sense of responsibility.

7826100,Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: After decades marked by a decrease in the incidence and severity of scarlet fever and streptococcal soft-tissue infections, invasive infections with group A streptococci have reemerged as a global public health problem. Sporadic outbreaks of a rapidly progressive disorder characterized by fever, shock, desquamating rash, and multiorgan system failure often associated with severe suppurative soft-tissue infection have recently been recognized in young, otherwise-healthy adults. Referred to as streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, this acute, progressive, often fatal illness appears to be related to an overall change in the virulence of group A streptococci and the reappearance of highly mucoid exotoxin-producing strains. However, the relationship between virulence factors, epidemiological features, and precise pathogenesis of these infections remains unclear.
OBSERVATIONS: The 80% incidence of soft-tissue involvement in streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome and the high frequency of progression to necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, or even death are unprecedented. The type and extent of tissue injury, systemic toxicity, and multiorgan system failure associated with this syndrome appear to be mediated by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins via the induction of biologically potent endogenous cytokines. The observed increase in the incidence and severity of invasive group A streptococcal infections coincides with the resurgence of genetically related, highly virulent strains of Staphylococcus pyogenes that express an invasive phenotype and carry a specific gene for pyrogenic exotoxin A.
CONCLUSIONS: The changing spectrum of invasive group A streptococcal infections has prompted a reexamination of the microorganism and its diverse clinical manifestations. A clonal basis for increased virulence expression is supported epidemiologically. As the incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome appears to be increasing, it is imperative that clinicians become familiar with the presentation of this syndrome so they can diagnose and treat it in a timely and effective manner.","['Wolf JE', 'Rabinowitz LG']",1995,131,1,Arch Dermatol,Wolf JE and Rabinowitz LG.

7734831,Isolation and characterization of a mitogen characteristic of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes).,"It has been supposed for many years that group A streptococci may elaborate more than the three well known erythrogenic toxins A, B or C (ETA, ETB, ETC). The analysis of the culture supernatant of streptococcal strain 27297 carrying neither genes for ETA nor ETC revealed mitogenic activity at pH 7.3 in isoelectric focusing. This mitogen of strain 27297 was purified by hydrophobic adsorption to Phenyl-Sepharose following FPLC chromatography on a Mono S column resulting in two proteins with mitogenic activity called AX and BX, respectively. Both differed in only one aminoterminal residue. The mitogenic activity of BX lacking one aminoterminal arginine was found to be about 100 times higher than that of AX. The aminoterminus of BX does not correspond to a predictable cleavage site for signal peptidase. We assume that BX was produced after translation by cleavage of the mature protein or the AX molecule with streptococcal proteinase (ETB) or an arginylaminopeptidase which is detectable on whole cells. The purified proteins BX and AX showed molecular weights of about 27 kDa in SDS electrophoresis and isoelectric points of 8.3 (AX) and 7.3 (BX) in isoelectric focusing, respectively. Both proteins were produced by practically all group A strains tested but not by groups B, C, G or H streptococci. Therefore, AX or BX seem to be proteins characteristic of group A streptococci.","['Gerlach D', 'Günther E', 'Köhler W', 'Vettermann S', 'Fleischer B', 'Schmidt KH']",1995,282,1,Zentralbl Bakteriol,"Gerlach D, et al.

7729468,Invasive streptococci.,"Before the introduction of antibiotics, serious infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield Group A streptococci) were common. Before World War II, this bacterium was responsible for as many as 50% of postpartum deaths and was the major cause of death in patients with burns. Also common were the sequelae of streptococcal infections-rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. With the use of penicillin, however, Streptococcus pyogenes was believed to be virtually eliminated as a pathogen. The organism was consigned to the history books, but not for long. In the mid-1980s, focal resurgences of rheumatic fever began to be reported from different areas in the USA, such as Salt Lake City, Utah. In such communities, where increases in cases of rheumatic fever had been reported, the serotypes M-1, 3, 5, 6 and 18 were isolated which, on culture, produced characteristic mucoid colonies. At the same time, reports of increases in invasive streptococcal disease began to surface in both the USA and Europe. Two syndromes were described; invasive streptococcal infection, occurring in previously healthy children and adults, commonly associated with septicaemia resulting from a deep focus of infection such as bone or lung; and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, involving a cutaneous focus, accompanied by necrotizing or bullous soft tissue changes. Septicaemia is rare in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, but the most characteristic feature is one of rapidly progressing multi-organ failure. A high proportion of the strains of Streptococcus pyogenes associated with this condition are serotype M-1, and fatality rates approaching 50% have been reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Spencer RC'],1995,14 Suppl 1,,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,Spencer RC.

7718212,Superantigens and their role in infectious disease.,"Although the exact mechanisms by which superantigens may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases are unknown, it seems increasingly likely that they have a role in the induction and pathogenesis of disease. The studies described here demonstrate that in several different diseases either bacterial or viral superantigens can be isolated from patients. There is also a preferential expansion of particular V beta T-cell subsets, which is a common feature of superantigen stimulation. From the work that has been done to date it can be hypothesized that superantigens may act in several ways. They may stimulate and activate T cells that are autoreactive and lead to the induction or exacerbation of autoimmune disease, as in RA. Alternatively, they may lead to the depletion of T-cell subsets based on V beta expression, thereby resulting in the severe reduction in lymphocytes in certain immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS. But perhaps the most likely contribution of superantigens to disease pathogenesis is seen indirectly by their effect on the immune system-particularly the stimulation of large numbers of T lymphocytes expressing the same V beta domain. Thus it is likely that the direct effect of various T-cell-derived inflammatory mediators (i.e., interleukins and other cytokines) released by these activated T lymphocytes is the primary cause of disease pathology via response to superantigen stimulation. In addition to the diseases discussed here, there are a number of other diseases in which a potential role for superantigens is being studied. These include autoimmune diseases seen after group A streptococcal infections in which the streptococcal M protein has been postulated to act as a superantigen such as scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Other diseases being studied include psoriasis, lupus-like disease, and lymphoproliferative diseases (reviewed in Kotzin et al.). In the coming years the exact role of superantigens and the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to disease should be more clearly defined. Our understanding of these molecules could also lead to new therapies for the treatment of these diseases.","['Schafer R', 'Sheil JM']",1995,10,,Adv Pediatr Infect Dis,Schafer R and Sheil JM.

MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively.

In clinical studies, ceftibuten (generally 400 mg/day in adults or 9 mg/kg/day in children, administered once daily) was effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated or complicated urinary tract infections, demonstrating an efficacy similar to that of cefaclor (1500 mg/day), and similar or superior to that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; 8/40 mg/kg/day) in children. The majority of patients with acute or chronic lower respiratory tract infections responded to treatment with ceftibuten, and response rates were similar to those achieved with cefaclor (750 or 1500 mg/day). Ceftibuten 9 mg/kg/day was at least as effective as cefaclor and as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (both 40 mg/kg/day) in children with acute otitis media, and was superior to phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V; 25 mg/kg/day) in children and adolescents with streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever caused by Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci.

DESIGN: Inception cohort.
SETTING: The study was undertaken among farmworkers living in five local authority areas in the catchment of Hereford and Preston Public Health Laboratories, England.
PARTICIPANTS: A quota sample of 404 people on 255 agricultural holdings took part. The holdings were selected at random from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food register. Altogether 58% of eligible subjects approached agreed to participate.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The sample had the same sex distribution as the 1991 census for those giving their occupation as agriculture. The mean age was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (44.6 years v 42.2 years) than that of those giving their occupation as agriculture, forestry or fishing in the census, although the modal range (45-59 years) was the same. At enrollment interviews, subjects individually reported contact with up to nine animal species (mode 4) out of 26 reported in all. Based on the numbers contacted and the frequency and intimacy of contact, scores on a ranked ordinal scale from 0-5 were constructed for each species and frequencies for each score were plotted. Subjects also reported past operations and serious illness. A history of pneumonia was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with a pigeon loft on the farm (relative risk (RR) 7.3) and attending farrowing pigs (RR 6.6), and one of leptospirosis with a rat problem on the farm (RR 28.1). Cattle contact was associated with a significantly lower likelihood (protective) of glandular fever (RR 0.19) and rheumatic or scarlet fever (RR 0.12). These effects were significantly related to rankings of the extent of exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to recruit a representative sample of farmworkers and measure their animal exposures in great detail. Among these exposures, associations with plausible risk factors for pneumonia and leptospirosis and apparently protective factors for glandular fever, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever have been demonstrated, which further show a relationship between the extent of exposure and response. These findings can be tested further by examining the relationship of exposures to serological evidence of illness or by further prospective follow up of this and similarly well characterised cohorts, or both.","['Thomas DR', 'Salmon RL', 'Kench SM', 'Meadows D', 'Coleman TJ', 'Morgan-Capner P', 'Morgan KL']",1994,48,2,J Epidemiol Community Health,"Thomas DR, et al.

8151676,Small-fragment restriction endonuclease analysis in epidemiological mapping of group A streptococci.,"The usefulness of small-fragment restriction endonuclease digest analysis (SF-REA) of group A streptococcal DNA with EcoRI, as a supplement to the more conventional T serotyping, was assessed for epidemiological characterisation. One hundred and thirty-five clinical isolates from 1988-1990 were examined. SF-REA provided characteristic fingerprints of all isolates, whereas eight isolates were non-typable by T serotyping. Generally, there was a striking correlation between the results obtained with the two techniques. Furthermore, SF-REA reliably classified the eight T-non-typable isolates and occasionally revealed subgroups within the T serotypes. In addition, SF-REA was useful for the clarification of discrepancies between serotyping results from two different reference laboratories. No obvious correlation was observed between the DNA fingerprints and the clinical manifestations of infection or the geographical origin of the group A streptococcal isolates. SF-REA is a valuable supplement to T typing in epidemiological studies and frequently appears to be a more efficient tool for strain differentiation.","['Mylvaganam H', 'Bjorvatn B', 'Hofstad T', 'Hjetland R', 'Hoiby EA', 'Holm SE']",1994,40,4,J Med Microbiol,"Mylvaganam H, et al.

Five cases were administrated with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 3 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations in these cases reached their peaks at 2 hours after administration with an average level of 1.23 +/- 0.34 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.04 +/- 0.04 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.60 +/- 0.38 hours. Urinary recovery rates of CDTR in the first 8 hours after administration of CDTR-PI averaged 14.9 +/- 0.9%. Five cases were administered with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 6 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations with the drug after meal reached their peaks at 1 hour after administration with an average level of 2.62 +/- 0.42 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.21 +/- 0.11 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.58 +/- 0.31 hours.

The RAPD test uses arbitrarily chosen DNA oligomers of 10 nucleotides to prime DNA synthesis from genomic sites to which they are accidentally matched or almost matched. Most 10-nucleotide primers yielded strain-specific arrays. Ten Y. pseudotuberculosis type strains were distinguishable from each other by analyzing the RAPD arrays produced by using primers with a 50% G+C content. The RAPD patterns of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were found to be constant regardless of the presence or absence of the large plasmid. RAPD tests were subsequently used to identify 30 clinical isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis that were collected as the causative agent of an outbreak of Izumi fever, a disease showing clinical symptoms characteristic of atypical scarlet fever, in Japan. The RAPD arrays from all of the isolates yielded common patterns that were unique to each primer used. Since those 30 isolates belonged to serotype 5a and the restriction digest patterns of their large plasmids were all the same, the results of the RAPD tests confirmed the view that those isolates were from a single source and indicated that the RAPD test can be practically applied to survey transmission of the bacterium in humans.","['Makino S', 'Okada Y', 'Maruyama T', 'Kaneko S', 'Sasakawa C']",1994,32,1,J Clin Microbiol,"Makino S, et al.

The patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. Neither Staphylococcus aureus nor group A streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group B streptococci. The group B streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production of TSS toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. However, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. This toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. The purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. When given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused TSS-like symptoms ending in death. Three additional group B streptococcal strains from patients with TSLS were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.","['Schlievert PM', 'Gocke JE', 'Deringer JR']",1993,17,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Schlievert PM, et al.

We found that less than 50% of the scarlet fever-associated strains possessed the speA gene as compared to 25% of the general group. Only 5 to 30% of these strains secreted the toxin under experimental conditions in very low quantities. Among strains isolated from TSLS, 67% appeared to contain the speA gene. The amount of ETA secreted into the medium was also extremely low. Southern hybridization patterns proved to be the same with an speA-specific probe in all three groups of streptococcal isolates (HaeIII, HindIII). Increased occurrence of the speA gene among scarlet fever and TSLS-associated strains does not seem to be sufficient to support the hypothesis that ETA may have a causative role in both diseases since a considerable number of strains in these groups did not possess the speA gene.","['Reichardt W', 'Müller-Alouf H', 'Köhler W']",1993,279,2,Zentralbl Bakteriol,"Reichardt W, et al.

They include pyrogenic toxins (streptococcal scarlet fever toxins of serotypes A, B, and C, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and staphylococcal enterotoxin serotypes A, B, Cn, D, E, and G), streptococcal M protein, staphylococcal exfoliative toxin, and recently identified pyrogenic toxins made by groups B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus sanguis. Pyrogenic toxin superantigens cause acute toxic shock syndrome and are associated with toxic shock-like syndromes. Superantigens cause symptoms via release of immune cytokines. These proteins should be considered potential causes of illnesses such as rheumatic fever, arthritis, Kawasaki syndrome, atopic dermatitis, and guttate psoriasis because of their potent immune system-altering capacity.",['Schlievert PM'],1993,167,5,J Infect Dis,Schlievert PM.

8450222,"Stimulation of human T cells by streptococcal ""superantigen"" erythrogenic toxins (scarlet fever toxins).","The pyrogenic (erythrogenic) exotoxins A and C (SPEA and SPEC) of Streptococcus pyogenes belong to the family of mitogenic toxins of which the staphylococcal enterotoxins are the prototypes. The erythrogenic toxin B (SPEB) is a proteinase precursor. All SPE have been reported to be superantigens. Here we have analyzed the human T cell response to these toxins. We used highly purified preparations of SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC from different S. pyogenes strains. These toxins were apparently homogenous in SDS-PAGE, IEF, and HPLC. In addition, recombinant SPEA and SPEC were produced in Escherichia coli. In cultures of PBMC, all three toxins expanded preferentially a fraction of T cells. Using mAb against V beta 2, -5, -6, -8, and -12, we investigated the phenotype of the stimulated cells. Natural SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC strongly stimulated V beta 8+ T cells, whereas recombinant SPEA and SPEC did not. Both natural and recombinant SPEA stimulated V beta 12+ cells and both natural and recombinant SPEC stimulated V beta 2+ cells. In accordance with these findings, a human V beta 8+ line responded to all three toxins derived from S. pyogenes but not to the recombinant proteins. An antiserum against natural SPEC neutralized specifically the V beta 2-stimulating activity of SPEC and the V beta 8-stimulating activity of all three toxins, but had no effect on the response to other superantigens. This shows that trace amounts of a potent novel V beta 8-stimulating activity not identical to SPEA and SPEC are responsible for the stimulation of V beta 8+ T cells by natural SPEA and SPEC reported previously. In a preliminary screening of S. pyogenes strains from patients, we found that this novel superantigen appears to be more widely distributed than SPEA and SPEC. Furthermore, we present evidence that also the superantigenic properties of SPEB are due to contaminations with this V beta 8 stimulator. The response to SPEB usually required 1000 times higher concentrations than to SPEA or SPEC. Antisera to SPEC but not to SPEB inhibited the response of PBMC and V beta 8+ Jurkat cells to SPEB. Furthermore, more stringent purification of SPEB yielded SPEB preparations devoid of mitogenic activity. These results indicate that the mitogenicity that is commonly attributed to SPEB is due to minute contaminations of the V beta 8 stimulator. These results raise two important caveats for the work with these highly potent T cell mitogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Braun MA', 'Gerlach D', 'Hartwig UF', 'Ozegowski JH', 'Romagné F', 'Carrel S', 'Köhler W', 'Fleischer B']",1993,150,6,J Immunol,"Braun MA, et al.

8444235,Probable role of Streptococcus pyogenes in Kawasaki disease.,"Over the past 25 years, the clinical course of Kawasaki disease has been defined, the prevalence and nature of the cardiovascular effects widely understood, and pathological changes in the most severe cases well described. However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this puzzling disease have remained unclear, thus specific therapy is not yet available. Because of some close clinical similarities between this disease and streptococcal scarlet fever, particular attention has been paid to the possible role of Streptococcus pyogenes as an aetiological agent in this illness. Until now, however, group A beta-haemolytic streptococci have never been consistently isolated from any patients; in addition, the titre of anti-streptolysin 0 is not raised, and lack of response to antibiotics is a feature of this disease. Our long series of investigations over more than 10 years, which will be covered in the present review, were performed in an attempt at elucidating causative agent(s) of Kawasaki disease. This has led to our firm belief in the probable role of S. pyogenes in the pathogenesis of this disease, despite the lack of fulfillment of Koch's postulates, on the basis of the following findings. Patients with Kawasaki disease recovering from the acute, febrile phase of the illness exhibited an exaggerated cell-mediated reactivity, as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test, to group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, their pyrogenic exotoxin and streptolysin 0 as well as to several mammalian muscle cell extracts which are allegedly related antigenically to the cell wall and/or cytoplasmic membrane of S. pyogenes. Protoplast-like ""spherical bodies"" varying in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 microns, and devoid of cell walls, were detected in the buffy coats of peripheral blood from patients with this disease, and stained distinctly by immuno-electron microscopy using, as a primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum to S. pyogenes- derived protoplasts, and followed by absorption with protoplasts from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Newborn mice infected with S. pyogenes having no capacity to confer cell-mediated immunity even in adult murine hosts, and reinfected 4-6 weeks later with another strain of the same species of bacteria which is able to elicit cellular immunity, showed a lack of humoral response to streptococcal antigens, leaving intact cell-mediated immunity.

8350770,Development and evaluation of capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for detection of immunoglobulin G and M antibodies to group A streptococcal antigens.,"Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies to group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens, streptolysin O, streptokinase, and group A carbohydrate. The sensitivities and the specificities of the IgM capture ELISAs to each GAS antigen were high enough to distinguish the patients with GAS infections (diagnosed as GAS pharyngitis or scarlet fever) from the control groups (healthy people and patients with pharyngitis from whom GAS could not be isolated). On the other hand, the specificities of the IgG capture ELISAs were not very effective in diagnosis of GAS infections. When the capture ELISA and an indirect ELISA detecting IgM antibodies to group A carbohydrate were compared, false-positive reactions due to rheumatoid factor occurred in the indirect ELISA, but did not occur in the capture ELISA. These results indicate that the capture ELISA works better than the indirect ELISA in detecting the IgM antibody, and that the IgM capture ELISA to GAS antigen provides a rapid and highly reliable serodiagnosis for GAS infections employing only a single serum.","['Hayashi S', 'Yokota K', 'Takizawa Y', 'Tomizawa I', 'Nejime T', 'Oguma K']",1993,37,4,Microbiol Immunol,"Hayashi S, et al.

8338269,[Fatal streptococcus A shock after thoracic surgery].,"A 23-year-old man with relapsing pneumothorax underwent surgical removal of left apical lung bullae and pleural rubbing down. Forty-eight hours later, he suddenly developed a state of shock together with tachypnoea, oliguria, and a scarlet-like erythema of the face and trunk. Haemodynamic and other investigations led to the diagnosis of septic shock, although no portal of entry could be found. Despite antibiotics (vancomycin, gentamycin and pefloxacine) and symptomatic treatment, the patient's condition continued to worsen. He had a fever (40 degrees C) with abdominal tenderness. Exploratory laparotomy failed to disclose a septic foyer. On aspiration of the left thoracic cavity, a large pyothorax was found and 600 mls of pus were drained. Gram-positive cocci were found on staining and pefloxacine was replaced by mezlocillin. Nevertheless, the patient died within 24 h. Blood and pus cultures confirmed that the infection was due to a pyrogenic penicillin-sensitive group A Streptococcus. Similar cases have been described recently. Group A Streptococcus is suspected to cause severe infections with multiple organ failure, termed ""toxic shock-like syndrome"". The clinical similarity between the streptococcal and staphylococcal shocks calls for a precise bacteriological diagnosis, and treatment with antibiotics active on both germs.","['Theissen O', 'Ocquidant P', 'Loeb JP', 'Unternaehrer S']",1993,12,1,Ann Fr Anesth Reanim,"Theissen O, et al.

The aim was to reassess the diagnostic value of the dermatological manifestations. A modification of the extremities was observed in 28 patients (23 had early inflammatory lesions, 25 had late desquamation). Exanthema was constant, polymorphous and most often urticaria-like. Vesicles, pustules or purpura were noted during the course of the eruption in 7 patients. A perineal eruption was observed in 17 cases and was found of good diagnostic value even though not pathognomonic. Cheilitis was the most frequent of buccopharyngeal modifications (93 p. 100). Conjunctival hyperemia was noted in 26 patients. Eight children had cardiovascular complications. Among these cases, the modification of the extremities seemed to be more pronounced and stomatitis and arthritis were apparently more frequent. Most of all, the inflammatory syndrome was significantly more severe as concerns CRP and polymorphonuclear leukocytes counts. Dermatological examination often rules out other diagnoses, such as measles, scarlet fever and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. However, a complete etiological workup remains mandatory.","['Ducos MH', 'Taïeb A', 'Sarlangue J', 'Perel Y', 'Pedespan JM', 'Hehunstre JP', 'Jimenez M', 'Maleville J']",1993,120,9,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Ducos MH, et al.

In Norway this increase was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in acute rheumatic fever. This study investigated the occurrence of scarlet fever and acute rheumatic fever in a rural district (approximately 15,000 inhabitants) of western Norway during the years 1862-1884. Four epidemics of severe scarlet fever occurred during this period. The local doctor treated 1,155 patients (96% children), of whom 154 (13.3%) died. Acute glomerulonephritis with subsequent kidney failure seems to have been a major cause of death. During the same period 76 patients (96% adults) were treated for acute rheumatic fever. These cases were not related to the severe epidemics of scarlet fever. It is probable that different, co-circulating strains of streptococci caused the infections, which were followed by glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. It is possible that rheumatic fever was caused by the strain that induced the more benign ""Angina tonsillaris"".",['Sandvik H'],1992,112,30,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,Sandvik H.

These included reference strains, representative M and T type strains, and strains associated with scarlet fever and pharyngitis collected between 1940 to 1991 and included strains from patients with severe invasive streptococcal infections. PCR amplicons were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and specificity was established by restriction fragment analysis. The frequency of occurrence for each target gene among all strains tested was 33.6% for speA, 99.3% for speB, 28.9% for speC, and 100% for slo. Strains of non-group A streptococci, recognized toxigenic bacterial pathogens, and pneumolysin-producing Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were negative for all targeted gene sequences. Detection limits in the PCR were found to be 100 pg of total nucleic acids for the speB and speC genes and 1 ng for the speA and slo genes. Isolates associated with scarlet fever, pharyngitis, and severe invasive infections showed statistically significant differences in the presence of speA, with scarlet fever strains having the highest association (81.3%), severe infections the next highest association (42.9%), and pharyngitis the lowest association (18.4%). Although no significant differences were observed in speC frequencies in isolated associated with the three disease categories, a genotype of speB slo was significantly higher in isolates associated with pharyngitis (54.1%) than in strains associated with scarlet fever (18.8%) or severe invasive disease (23.8%). Streptolysin O targets were present in all the isolates tested, and only a single strain (T-11-M-11) was devoid of targeted speB sequences, thereby demonstrating that neither speB nor slo is associated with any particular clinical presentation.","['Tyler SD', 'Johnson WM', 'Huang JC', 'Ashton FE', 'Wang G', 'Low DE', 'Rozee KR']",1992,30,12,J Clin Microbiol,"Tyler SD, et al.

METHODS: We saw four children aged 3 2/12 to 11 4/12 years with a cerebral infarction at our hospital. Three children were followed up until 6 months after the infarction. The case reports are presented. On the background of the literature, the etiology and diagnostic possibilities and requirements are discussed.
RESULTS: As the underlying cause, we saw a hemolytic-uremic syndrome in one case, and a (post-)infectious vasculitis following measles resp. scarlet fever in two cases. CCT, NMR, and transcranial Doppler sonography are the diagnostic methods of choice, although none of these by itself is able to diagnose this disorder with any certainty. Therapeutic measures are restricted to the causative disease. The prognosis is good quoad vitam, although serious regarding neurologic sequelae.

1500078,[Epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infection].,"The appearance of the ""streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome"" led to a growing interest in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group-A-streptococci). Since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. Contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. Erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever.

A new manifestation of invasive streptococcal infection, termed streptococcal toxic shocklike syndrome, is also presented. Many changes in the epidemiology of streptococcal infections during the 1980s can be traced to the reemergence of more virulent strains of the organism. The impact of this natural occurrence is discussed. Therapeutic recommendations are presented for each disease, and the value of rapid streptococcal tests is reviewed.","['Barnett BO', 'Frieden IJ']",1992,11,1,Semin Dermatol,Barnett BO and Frieden IJ.

1346879,Clonal basis for resurgence of serious Streptococcus pyogenes disease in the 1980s.,"During the 1980s there was a resurgence of serious Streptococcus pyogenes infections with complications, including rheumatic fever, sepsis, severe soft-tissue invasion, and toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS). We have investigated the suggested association between expression of a scarlet fever toxin, SPE A, and systemic toxicity, and the possibility that a new highly virulent clone of S pyogenes has emerged and spread world wide. We studied serotype M1 strains, the serotype most commonly associated with serious complications. 19 isolates from patients with sepsis, with or without TSLS, and 48 from patients with uncomplicated pharyngitis or superficial skin infection were subjected to restriction-enzyme digestion and electrophoresis; 56 isolates (19 serious, 37 uncomplicated disease) were then examined by hybridisation to an speA gene probe. 17 (90%) of the 19 serious-disease isolates had a characteristic (""invasive"", I) restriction-fragment profile and were positive for the speA gene. Significantly lower proportions of the isolates from patients with uncomplicated disease had the I profile (21/48 [44%]; p = 0.0035) and speA (20/37 [54%]; p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that the strains from patients with serious disease are a unique clone, which became the predominant cause of severe streptococcal infections in the United States and elsewhere in the late 1980s.","['Cleary PP', 'Kaplan EL', 'Handley JP', 'Wlazlo A', 'Kim MH', 'Hauser AR', 'Schlievert PM']",1992,339,8792,Lancet,"Cleary PP, et al.

1571445,Severe streptococcal infections in historical perspective.,"The recent unexplained increase in severe streptococcal diseases in the United States and Great Britain is compared to the 1825-1885 pandemic of fatal scarlet fever. Although scarlet fever may not be representative of all severe streptococcal disease, it was the only one reliably identified in the 19th century. The epidemiology of scarlet fever during the 19th century pandemic suggests the following features of the disease; cocirculation of both virulent and less-virulent streptococcal strains eliciting cross-immunity; circulation of hyperendemic prevalent strains in urban centers of developed nations, with periodic spillovers to rural areas and developing nations; and protection of infants from infection (but not from fatal disease once infection occurred) by the transfer of maternal antibodies via the placenta, breast milk, or both. The 19th century data suggest that efforts to prevent severe streptococcal diseases should begin with better characterization of the epidemiology of streptococcal disease, a task entailing identification of streptococcal virulence factors and measurement of their distribution among isolates from individuals with streptococcal diseases and in open populations.","['Katz AR', 'Morens DM']",1992,14,1,Clin Infect Dis,Katz AR and Morens DM.

1571429,Invasive group A streptococcus infections.,"The late 1980s have witnessed the emergence of severe group A streptococcus (GAS) infection; shock, bacteremia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome are common features, and death has been associated with this infection in 30% of patients. Such infections have now been described in all parts of the United States, Europe, and Australia and have occurred predominantly in otherwise healthy adolescents and adults. The characteristic clinical and laboratory features of the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome include deep-seated infection associated with shock and multiorgan failure. Strains of GAS isolated from patients with invasive disease have been predominantly M types 1 and 3, which produce pyrogenic exotoxin A or B or both. In this report, the clinical and demographic features of streptococcal bacteremia, myositis, and necrotizing fasciitis will be presented and compared with those of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Current concepts of the pathogenesis of invasive streptococcal infection will also be presented in terms of the interaction between virulence factors of GAS and host defense mechanisms. Finally, new concepts for future treatment of serious streptococcal infections will be proposed.",['Stevens DL'],1992,14,1,Clin Infect Dis,Stevens DL. Invasive group A streptococcus infections.

1465577,Outbreaks of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in children: correlation of serotype T4 with scarlet fever.,"We evaluated the clinical features of 121 children who had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis during 2 outbreaks in the Chikuhou district, Fukuoka, Japan, with respect to T types. During the first outbreak (November 1989-February 1990), T12 (50%) and T22 (27%) were the dominant T types isolated. During the second outbreak (January-April 1991), 64% of the typable strains were T4. Pus on the tonsils was less common and strawberry tongue more common in patients with eruptions than in those without. Skin eruptions were much more common in the patients infected with T4 than with other T types (p < 0.001). Despite a 10-day regimen of amoxicillin, 12/69 patients (17.4%) had evidence of GABHS on repeat cultures. The results suggest that T4 may be associated with a high incidence of scarlet fever. Serotyping should be performed to identify disease carriers and patterns of GABHS infection.","['Ohga S', 'Okada K', 'Mitsui K', 'Aoki T', 'Ueda K']",1992,24,5,Scand J Infect Dis,"Ohga S, et al.

1789905,Scarlet fever and types of erythrogenic toxins produced by the infecting streptococcal strains.,"Group A streptococcal strains were isolated from the throats of 46 children suffering from scarlet fever. For detection of erythrogenic toxins (ETs), the culture supernatants were concentrated 100 times by ethanol precipitation and solubilisation in acetate buffer. ELISA was used to identify ETA and double immunodiffusion to identify ETB and ETC. The presence of the ETA gene was detected by a specific DNA probe. ETA (alone or in combination with ETB and/or ETC) was found in 51.9% of the strains, ETB (alone or in combination with ETA and/or ETC) in 76.9% and ETC (in combination with ETA and ETB) in 28.9%. Only 5.8% of strains did not produce any detectable ET. In SDS-PAGE, supernatants of ETB-producing strains showed a pronounced band in either the region of the proteinase zymogen or the active proteinase. There was no correlation between the type of erythrogenic toxin and the serological M or T type of the producing strain. The mitogenic potency of culture supernatants did not differ significantly irrespective of the toxin type(s) present. Culture supernatants of strains without a detectable amount of the known ETs were highly mitogenic, indicating the production of other streptococcal mitogens. A correlation with clinical symptoms was determined with regard to exanthema and fever. Strains producing two or three toxins caused a more intense exanthema. Patient temperature was higher (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) when the infecting strain produced ETB. The toxin-producing patterns of the strains of this study were compared with those isolated during the last epidemic outbreak of scarlet fever in East Germany.","['Knöll H', 'Srámek J', 'Vrbová K', 'Gerlach D', 'Reichardt W', 'Köhler W']",1991,276,1,Zentralbl Bakteriol,"Knöll H, et al.

1940804,Characterization and clonal distribution of four alleles of the speA gene encoding pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin) in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes strains producing pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin) have recently caused episodes of streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS). We exploited knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among exotoxin A-producing patient strains provided by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to select strains for comparative sequencing of toxin genes. Our analysis identified four alleles of speA in natural populations, one of which (speA1) occurs in many distinct clonal lineages and is probably old. Two other alleles (speA2 and speA3), characterized solely by single amino acid substitutions, were each identified in single clones that together have caused the majority of TSLS episodes. It is unlikely that these alleles have had a long association with S. pyogenes clones. A fourth allele (speA4) also is present in a single phylogenetic lineage and is 9% divergent from the other three toxin alleles. An absence of synonomous (silent) nucleotide changes in speA2 and speA3 is unusual and suggests that the allelic variation is not selectively neutral, which implies that the toxins are not functionally equivalent. These results may be important in helping to understand the recent increase in frequency and severity of disease caused by S. pyogenes.","['Nelson K', 'Schlievert PM', 'Selander RK', 'Musser JM']",1991,174,5,J Exp Med,"Nelson K, et al.

Forty-seven (92%) cases were community-acquired and 16 (32%) had underlying disease. Primary foci of infection, defined as a sites of inflammation that precedes bacteremia, included pharyngitis in 15 and erysipelas/cellulitis in 16 patients. Six patients had no focus of infection. Shock was recorded in 4 patients, all of whom died. Seven patients had a rash, in 5 the rash was typical of scarlet fever. Of the 6 children who died 4 were previously healthy and they all died within 24 hours following admission, and were sick at least 48 hours before admission to our hospital.

1951267,"The ""fourth disease"" of childhood: reevaluation of a nonexistent disease.","Observed and described between 1884 and 1900, ""fourth disease"" (Dukes disease) followed measles, scarlet fever, and rubella as the fourth clinically characterized childhood exanthem. Like rubella (""third disease"") and erythema infectiosum (""fifth disease""), accepted by the medical community at about the same time, the existence of fourth disease was initially controversial. Over the following decades descriptions of hundreds of cases, outbreaks, and laboratory studies were published in the indexed medical literature. Unlike rubella and fifth disease, however, fourth disease was not subsequently proven to exist by either epidemiologic criteria or isolation of an etiologic agent. By the 1930s, it was infrequently recognized and by the 1960s had been dropped from textbooks. In this study, the authors use epidemiologic methods to reevaluate published data on English schoolchildren from 1892 to 1900 upon which the original fourth disease claim of Dukes was based. The authors conclude that fourth disease never existed. Reinterpretation of the original data suggests that cases can be completely explained as misdiagnosed rubella and scarlet fever. Misidentification of fourth disease is attributed to failures in the critical abilities of the medical and scientific communities at the time. The implications of erroneously identifying a nonexistent disease suggest that modern scientific approaches to disease identification are sound.","['Morens DM', 'Katz AR']",1991,134,6,Am J Epidemiol,"Morens DM and Katz AR.

1919136,[A dying clinical diagnosis of scarlet fever--the last sixteen years survey].,"11,119 patients with scarlet fever admitted in the last sixteen years, from 1973 to 1988, to Sapporo City General Hospital, were studied statistically on symptoms and laboratory findings. The results were summarized as follows: 1. Annual number of patients have reduced suddenly since 1981, and become zero in 1989. The patients increased in number during the winter season. Eighty two percent of the cases were between 3 and 8 years of age, and the average age was 5.8 year-old. 2. Cases of above-38 degrees C temperature were seen in about 81.4%, and from 2 to 5 days-duration of temperature were seen in 86.6% of the patients in the year 1976. Cases of above-moderate rash were observed in 68.2%, sever redness of throat in 29.9%, strawberry tongue in 86.3% and angular stomatitis in 37.7% of the patients. In recent statistical analysis (1982-1988), we found, however, a tendency that patients having stronger symptoms were being introduced to our hospital. 3. The higher rates of cases showing elevated ASD titer were seen in the elder patients and in the winter. C-reactive protein (CRP) titers were mostly in the range of (-) to (greater than or equal to 6+), having 2.4 + on an average. 4. Patients who developed into overt nephritis were not seen. Cases of microscopic hematuria (greater than or equal to 3 red cells/f in urine sediments), however, were observed in 1.1% (125/11,119). Sever complications were hardly seen. 5. Reappearance of beta-hemolytic streptococci (on a week after discharge) were found in 3.1% (241/7,877). 6. Reinfection or relapse cases of scarlet fever were found in 6.7% (642/9,585).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Takizawa Y', 'Tomizawa I', 'Itoh K']",1991,65,8,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Takizawa Y, et al.

1919113,[A 23-year longitudinal study on the antibiotic sensitivities of group A streptococci from the scarlet fever patients--1956-1978].,"Among the group A streptococci isolated during the period 1956 to 1978 from the pharynx and the nostril of the scarlet fever patients quarantined in the Tokyo Metropolitan Toshima Hospital within 1 week of hospitalization, 1,586 strains of types 4, 6 and 12, the most prevalent serotypes, were estimated for their sensitivities to various antibiotics. Among the sensitivities, those to tetracycline (TC), chloramphenicol (CP) and erythromycin (EM), these being in close relation to prevalent serotypes, are to be reported. The first appearance of TC-resistant strain was seen in one strain (type 6) isolated in 1959, and, in 1964, the resistant strain increased in proportion in accordance with the prevalence of type 4. The resistant strain decreased a little in 1968 and in 1969, increased again from 1970, exceeded over 90% from 1973, and reached 100% in 1978. The first appearance of CP-resistant strain was seen in one strain (type 4) isolated in 1969, and then the resistant strain increased year by year along with the prevalence of type 12. The first appearance of EM-resistant strain was seen in 30 strains (type 12) isolated in 1972, and then, similarly to the case of CP-resistance, the resistant strain increased year by year together with the prevalence of type 12. Meanwhile, among the 1,586 strains isolated at the time of hospitalization and estimated of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 932 strains (58.8%), 452 strains (28.5%), and 574 strains (36.2%) showed resistance to TC, CP, and EM, respectively. Variations of drug-resistance by serotypes were as follows: TC-resistant strains increased in accordance with the prevalence of type 4 in 1964; CP- and EM-resistant strains increased in accordance with the prevalence of type 12 in 1972; and type 6 strains were low in the rate of resistant strain to any of the three drugs. So far, prevalence of a serotype of group A streptococci has been considered to be caused by the accumulation of the subjects non-immune to the serotype. In the present study, a phenomenon was observed that prevalence of a serotype was effected by the state of resistance-acquisition to commonly used drugs. It would be clear that the resistance-acquisition plays, in addition to the immune state, a great role in evoking prevalence of a serotype.",['Kashiwagi Y'],1991,65,7,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kashiwagi Y.

1886201,[Laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].,"Cefpirome (HR 810, CPR), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma and urinary levels of CPR were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. Average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. Average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. The results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with CPR were investigated. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of 49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. These results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These levels appear to be higher than MIC90 values against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. CPR was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. Evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute UTI, totalling 61 cases.

1903412,Selective stimulation of human T cells with streptococcal erythrogenic toxins A and B.,"Streptococcal exotoxins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. Previous studies have demonstrated that these toxins are potent stimulators of human T cells and have structural homology to staphylococcal enterotoxins. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism by which streptococcal erythrogenic toxins type A (SPEA) and B (SPEB) activate T cells and compared it with anti-CD3 and the known ""superantigen"" staphylococcal enterotoxin B. SPEA was found to selectively activate T cells bearing V beta 8, V beta 12, and V beta 14, whereas SPEB selectively activated T cells bearing V beta 2 and V beta 8. Furthermore, fibroblasts transfected with MHC class II molecules were capable of presenting SPEA and SPEB to purified T cells. The T cell response to these toxins, however, was not MHC-restricted. Although the streptococcal exotoxins stimulated both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, SPEA but not SPEB stimulated the CD4+ T cell subset proportionately more than the CD8+ T cell subset. Our results indicate that SPEA and SPEB, like the staphylococcal enterotoxins, are superantigens and suggest a mechanism by which they may mediate particular systemic syndromes associated with streptococcal infections.","['Abe J', 'Forrester J', 'Nakahara T', 'Lafferty JA', 'Kotzin BL', 'Leung DY']",1991,146,11,J Immunol,"Abe J, et al.

Associations were observed for clinical history of scarlet fever (relative risk, RR = 2.0; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.1-3.9), tuberculosis (RR = 2.3%; 95% CI = 0.9-5.7) and BCG immunisation (RR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.4-6.4). The relative risk was 1.8 (95% CI = 0.9-3.5) for episodes of Herpes zoster infection, but most of the excess cases occurred within 10 years of diagnosis, suggesting that this might have been an early manifestation of the disease. No association emerged for common childhood viral infections or any other immunisation practice. When various classes of infectious or inflammatory diseases were grouped together according to their aetiology, there was a significant positive association with chronic bacterial illnesses (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1-2.8), and the relative risk estimates increased with the number of bacterial diseases. The trend in risk with number of diseases was significant (chi 21 = 4.5, P = 0.03).

Concentrations in blood/excretion in urine. We studied pharmacokinetic in children upon intravenous bolus injections and 30-minute and 1-hour intravenous drip infusions in single dosages of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, and obtained virtually the same results as those found in adult subjects. Upon intravenous bolus injections, mean blood concentrations 30 minutes after administration of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were 26.1, 47.8, and 82.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.13, 1.43, and 1.26 hours, respectively. Upon 30-minute intravenous drip infusion, mean blood concentrations on completion of the drip infusions of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were 43.2, 106.9, and 163.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.15, 1.09, and 1.15 hours, respectively. In addition, upon 1-hour intravenous drip infusion, mean blood concentrations on completion of infusion were 27.1 micrograms/ml for 10 mg/kg and 47.5 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/kg, and half-lives were 1.09 and 1.40 hours, respectively. A clear dose response was observed at all dosages for either administration method. Mean excretion rates in urine in the first 8 hours after administration were 60.6-71.1% upon intravenous bolus injections of 10-40 mg/kg, and upon intravenous drip infusion, the values were 50.2-83.8% for administration of 10-40 mg/kg 6 or 7 hours after completion of drip infusion. 2. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid was studied in 2 subjects, and a concentration of 0.28-5.19 micrograms/ml was observed upon administration of 50 mg/kg, a moderate degree of penetration compared to the penetration of cephalosporins of group 5 studied up to now. 3.

1670601,An evolutionary conserved mechanism of T cell activation by microbial toxins. Evidence for different affinities of T cell receptor-toxin interaction.,"The enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus are the most potent mitogens known. They belong to a group of distantly related mitogenic toxins that differ in other biologic activities. In this study we have compared the molecular mechanisms by which these mitogens activate human T lymphocytes. We used the staphylococcal enterotoxins A to E, the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin, the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins A and C (scarlet fever toxins, erythrogenic toxins (ET)A, ETC), and the soluble mitogen produced by Mycoplasma arthritidis. We found that all these toxins can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and require MHC class II expression on accessory and target cells. However, T cells could be activated in the absence of class II molecules if the toxins ETA or SEB were co-cross-linked on beads together with anti-CD8 or anti-CD2 antibodies. Enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin and scarlet toxins stimulate a major fraction of human T cells, and show preferential, but not exclusive, stimulation of T cells carrying certain TCR V beta. In contrast, the mitogen of M. arthritidis, a pathogen for rodents stimulates only a minority of human T cells but activates a major fraction of murine T cells. Analysis of human T cell clones expressing V beta 5 or V beta 8 TCR showed that these clones responded also to those toxins that did not stimulate V beta 5+ and V beta 8+ T cells in bulk cultures. These results indicate that different TCR bind to these toxins with different affinities and that the specificity of the TCR-V beta-toxin interaction is quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. Taken together our findings suggest that these toxins use a common mechanism of T cell activation. They are functionally bivalent proteins crosslinking MHC class II molecules with variable parts of the TCR. Besides V beta, other parts of the TCR must be involved in this binding. The finding that murine T cells responded more weakly to the toxins produced by the human-pathogenic bacteria than to the Mycoplasma mitogen could indicate that the toxins have been adapted to the host's immune system in evolution.","['Fleischer B', 'Gerardy-Schahn R', 'Metzroth B', 'Carrel S', 'Gerlach D', 'Köhler W']",1991,146,1,J Immunol,"Fleischer B, et al.

2196166,Therapy of toxic shock syndrome.,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute febrile, exanthematous illness associated with multisystem failure including shock, renal failure, myocardial failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It usually presents with fever, pharyngitis, diarrhoea, vomiting, myalgia, and a scarlet fever-like rash, and may progress rapidly (within hours) to signs of hypovolaemic hypotension such as orthostatic dizziness or fainting. The signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome should be recognised early to permit successful therapy. Patients are usually suffering from hypovolaemia due to leaky capillaries and fluid loss into the interstitial space, and consequently large volumes of fluid, both crystalloid (e.g. saline, electrolyte-solutions) and colloid (e.g. albumin, intravenous gamma-globulin), may be necessary to maintain adequate venous return and cardiac output. Patients with toxic shock syndrome usually have a focus of staphylococcal infection such as a surgical wound infection or soft tissue abscess, or they may have TSS associated with menstruation and use of a vaginal device such as tampons. The site of infection should be adequately drained and treated with antimicrobial therapy. Subacute complications including ARDS and myocardial failure require a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology to ensure appropriate treatment. Recurrences of TSS can be avoided by appropriate antimicrobial treatment and avoidance of recurrent conditions which might favour staphylococcal toxin production (e.g. use of tampons during menstruation). More than 95% of patients survive toxic shock syndrome if appropriate therapy is instituted early.",['Todd JK'],1990,39,6,Drugs,Todd JK. Therapy of toxic shock syndrome.

2311279,Hypothesis--the natural selection of psoriasis.,"The high genetic frequency of some inherited disorders may in part be related to a survival advantage conferred against an environmental hazard. Psoriasis is an inherited disorder which is common amongst populations of northern latitudes. Cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity response to streptococcal antigen is altered in such patients with a decrease in induration and erythema. Scarlet fever has until recently been associated with a high childhood mortality, the pathogenesis of which is related to interdependent primary toxicity and secondary toxicity (including delayed-type hypersensitivity) to streptococcal antigen (erythrogenic toxin), leading to cellular damage and potentially lethal shock. Streptococcal infection, usually presenting as pharyngitis, is a classical trigger for both scarlet fever and psoriasis. Individual susceptibility to scarlet fever has been clinically assessed in the past by the Dick test--an intradermal injection of the filtrate of a broth culture of scarlatina-producing strains of Streptococcus giving an erythematous reaction at 24-48 h (Dick-positive). The degree of reaction is directly related to susceptibility to scarlet fever. The severity of and mortality from scarlet fever may be ameliorated by immunological mechanisms also found in psoriatic patients.

2206394,Staphylococcal and streptococcal pyrogenic toxins involved in toxic shock syndrome and related illnesses.,"Toxic-shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute onset, multiorgan illness which resembles severe scarlet fever. The illness is caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains that express TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1), enterotoxin B, or enterotoxin C. TSST-1 is associated with menstrual TSS and approximately one-half of nonmenstrual cases; the other two toxins cause nonmenstrual cases, 47% and 3%, respectively. The three toxins are expressed in culture media under similar environmental conditions. These conditions may explain the association of certain tampons with menstrual TSS. Biochemically, the toxins are all relatively low molecular weight and fairly heat and protease stable. Enterotoxins B and C, share nearly 50% sequence homology with streptococcal scarlet fever toxin A; they share no homology with TSST-1 despite sharing numerous biological properties. Numerous animal models for development of TSS have suggested mechanisms of toxin action, though the exact molecular action is not known. The toxins are all potent pyrogens, induce T lymphocyte proliferation, requiring interleukin 1 release from macrophages, suppress immunoglobulin production, enhance endotoxin shock, and enhance hypersensitivity skin reactions. The genetic control of the toxins has been studied and suggests the exotoxins are variable traits. Some additional properties of TSS S. aureus which facilitate disease causation have been clarified.","['Bohach GA', 'Fast DJ', 'Nelson RD', 'Schlievert PM']",1990,17,4,Crit Rev Microbiol,"Bohach GA, et al.

The efficacy rate classified according to types of infection were 85.7% in upper RTI, 89.5% in acute bronchitis, 94.4% in pneumonia, 78.9% in scarlet fever, and 90.5% in UTI. 3. Out of the suspected causative organisms, 43 strains of a total of 50 strains isolated were eradicated. The bacteriological eradication rate was 86.0%. (Haemophilus influenzae 100%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, Streptococcus pyogenes 88.5%, Escherichia coli 85.7%). 4. One hundred forty four children were analyzed for side effect. Side effects were observed in 2 children (1.4%) with diarrhea in 1 and anorexia in another. Abnormal laboratory test results were recorded in 4 children (3.3%). The above results suggest that CFIX is a very useful new oral cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.","['Mikawa H', 'Mayumi M', 'Akiyama Y', 'Ito S', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kanaoka H', 'Takeshita S', 'Takahashi Y', 'Akiyama F', 'Yoshimura T']",1989,42,12,Jpn J Antibiot,"Mikawa H, et al.

The colony hybridization technique employing a specific internal fragment of the speA gene was used for initial screening, and all positive results were further confirmed by the Southern hybridization technique. Among over 300 general strains obtained from patients with a variety of diseases, except scarlet fever (such as tonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, pyoderma, abscess, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis), 15% were found to contain the speA gene. Among a group of 146 strains obtained from individuals described as having scarlet fever, 45% were shown to contain the speA gene. Further analysis of the data indicated that strains with certain M- or T-type surface antigens showed a higher (such as M and T types 1 and 3/13) or lower (such as M2, M12, T4, T5, and T28) tendency to contain the speA gene. No correlation was found between speA content of a strain and the ability to cause a specific disease, although strains possessing the speA gene were more likely to be associated with scarlet fever and rheumatic fever than with other types of disease.","['Yu CE', 'Ferretti JJ']",1989,57,12,Infect Immun,Yu CE and Ferretti JJ.

Simultaneously, the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease has diminished. Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections remain common but with reduced severity and fewer subsequent cases of rheumatic fever. Scarlet fever has become relatively benign, with low mortality. Whether recent sporadic outbreaks of rheumatic fever due to known rheumatogenic strains of group A streptococci will have a significant effect on morbidity and mortality trends remains to be seen.

CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Motohiro T', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Oda K', 'Aramaki M', 'Kawakami A', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Tomita S', 'Sakata Y', 'Yamashita F']",1989,42,9,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

2659990,Severe group A streptococcal infections associated with a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever toxin A.,"There is concern that group A streptococci, which have caused less serious infections in developed countries in recent decades, may be acquiring greater virulence. We describe 20 patients from the Rocky Mountain region who had group A streptococcal infections from 1986 to 1988 that were remarkable for the severity of local tissue destruction and life-threatening systemic toxicity. Among the 20 patients (median age, 36), necrotizing fasciitis with or without myositis was the most common soft-tissue infection (55 percent). Nineteen patients (95 percent) had shock, 16 (80 percent) had renal impairment, and 11 (55 percent) had acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mortality rate was 30 percent. All patients but 1 had positive tissue cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes; 12 had positive blood cultures. Most of the patients had no underlying disease; 2 used intravenous drugs. Strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from 10 patients were not of a single M or T type; however, 8 of the 10 strains produced pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin A, a classic erythrogenic toxin), which has rarely been observed in recent years. From our study of this cluster of severe streptococcal infections with a toxic shock-like syndrome, we conclude that in our region, more virulent group A streptococci have reappeared that produce the pyrogenic toxin A associated with scarlet fever.","['Stevens DL', 'Tanner MH', 'Winship J', 'Swarts R', 'Ries KM', 'Schlievert PM', 'Kaplan E']",1989,321,1,N Engl J Med,"Stevens DL, et al.

2523895,Cutaneous manifestations of bacterial sepsis.,"In short, bacterial sepsis is associated with a number of peripheral manifestations involving the skin and soft tissues. The pathogenesis of the lesions observed is not fully understood and is almost certainly multifactorial. In ecthyma gangrenosum, the presence of large numbers of gram-negative bacilli in the walls of small blood vessels without a substantial inflammatory response suggests that either the bacteria themselves or bacterial products are responsible for tissue damage. Endotoxin probably plays a prominent role in producing these lesions. That Pseudomonas and Aeromonas species seem to cause ecthyma out of proportion to their prevalence as a cause of bacteremia might suggest that the endotoxin of these organisms has a special predilection for skin and subcutaneous structures. More likely, it indicates that other bacterial substances, such as exotoxins or proteases, are involved. The absence of PMN leukocytes is thought to play a permissive role, allowing unopposed bacterial proliferation. Lesions of symmetric peripheral gangrene characteristically do not have bacteria present. The presence of intravascular fibrin accumulation probably resembles the generalized Shwartzman phenomenon. However, the gangrenous lesions themselves more likely result from systemic hypotension and the resulting hypoperfusion of the tissues than from vessel obstruction. In lesions associated with vigorous inflammatory response, bacterial products may damage tissue either directly or by attracting leukocytes that, in turn, release substances that cause further tissue damage. An etiologic role for endotoxin or the gram-positive bacterial cell wall is likely, since endotoxin is known to produce similar lesions in the localized Shwartzman reaction. Favoring a role for other bacterial substances is the predisposition of V. vulnificus to cause cellulitis or of C. fetus to cause inflammation of the major vessels during sepsis; the mechanisms for these reactions are entirely unknown. It is interesting that in most instances in which peripheral lesions are caused by sepsis, either a large number of bacteria or an intense inflammatory response by PMNs is present, but not both. In both kinds of lesion, the tendency to involve blood vessels by different pathogenetic mechanisms contributes to the evolution of the disease process. In intensely inflamed lesions, veins and arteries can be shown histologically to be occluded. In the absence of inflammation, bacterial invasion of vessel walls or simply the presence of bacterial products adjacent to the vessel may produce spasm. As noted, the pathogenetic significance of thrombosis observed in the lesions of DIC remains unclear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Musher DM'],1989,24,5,Hosp Pract (Off Ed),"Musher DM.

2500798,[The success of hygiene in the last 40 years].,"In Germany, the last period of the Second World War and the following years were characterized by deficiencies of hygiene which had not occurred previously in Middle Europe during the 20th century. There were focuses of typhus, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and meningitis. Insufficiencies in the removal of faeces caused high incidences of shigellosis, hepatitis A, and ascariasis. As a result of insufficient body care, many people were infested with fleas, lice and scabies. The migration of large proportions of the population resulted in an increasing prevalence of syphilis an gonorrhea. As the population resettled, the first steps towards reorganization of public health could be done. The spread of typhoid fever was controlled by drinking-water disinfection with chlorine, repair of sewage systems, and patient isolation. The application of DDT helped to reduce scabies and pediculosis, resulting in decreasing typhus risks. During the first two decades after the war, there was a steady decrease of the incidence of infectious diseases. The reconstruction of the towns resulted in improved housing conditions and a decreasing number of persons per housing area, reducing the intensity of physical contacts of the inhabitants with each other. The nutrition and clothing situation of the population improved, which, in addition to a general rise of the standards of hygiene, brought about an increase of the individual resistance to infection. A further reduction of sporadic and epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases was achieved by the introduction of chemotherapy and antibiotics. Increasing prosperity was accompanied by new problems of hygiene. Infectious diseases almost eradicated in West Germany, were imported by air travellers. Ten imported cases of smallpox were reported between 1957 and 1972, eight of which originated from Southeast Asia. Malaria, imported by German and foreign soldiers, had not been uncommon after the end of the war but had been easy to control by insecticides and antimalarials. As tourism expanded, a new wave of imported malaria cases was reported. In West Germany there is, however, no more spread of the disease under present conditions, cholera caused similar problems. The 1961 cholera epidemic started in Southeast Asia and caused minor outbreaks in Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain. A significant spread of the disease throughout Europe was prevented by generally high standards of drinking water and sewage treatment. Sporadic cases of typhoid fever were imported from countries with low standards of hygiene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Thofern E'],1989,187,4-6,Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg B Umwelthyg Krankenhaushyg Arbeitshyg Prav Med,Thofern E.

2526256,[Clinical study on clarithromycin granule and tablet in the field of pediatrics].,"A newly developed macrolide clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), with antibacterial spectrum and antibacterial activity nearly equal to those of erythromycin (EM), shows beneficial characteristics such as a higher blood level, higher recovery rate in urine, and better penetration into each tissue than conventional macrolides (MLs). TE-031 has been studied in adults against various infections and proved to be useful. The present paper describes the results of a study in children to examine the usefulness of TE-031 granules and tablets with a potency of 50 mg. TE-031 granules were administered to 132 children with ages from 6 months to 13 years and 10 months. Excluded from the evaluation were 12 cases in which clinical effects were deemed unevaluable. The evaluable subjects consisted of 1 case with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 9 with acute bronchitis, 19 with pneumonia, 19 with mycoplasmal pneumonia, 2 with scarlet fever, 20 with Campylobacter enteritis, 11 with impetigo, 2 with subcutaneous abscess, 18 with primary atypical pneumonia and 16 with acute enteritis of unidentified pathogens; a total of 120 subjects. An average daily dose of TE-031 was 25.9 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses except 1 case with 2 daily doses and lengths of the treatment averaged 7 days. TE-031 tablets each containing 50 mg potency, were administered to 49 subjects with ages from 3 year and a month to 14 years consisting of 8 cases with pharyngitis, 1 with tonsillitis, 1 with acute bronchitis, 4 with pneumonia, 14 with mycoplasmal pneumonia, 4 with scarlet fever, 5 with Campylobacter enteritis, 7 with impetigo, 1 with atypical pneumonia, 1 with Salmonella gastroenteritis and 3 with acute enteritis caused by unidentified pathogens, at an average daily dose of 13.5 mg/kg dived into 2-4 doses (2 doses/day for 12 cases, 3 doses for 32, 4 doses for 5) for 7 days on the average. In addition to examine the clinical and bacteriological effects of the 2 dosage forms of TE-031, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 9 antibiotics consisting of 5 MLs including TE-031, EM, josamycin (JM), midecamycin acetate (MDM acetate), and rokitamycin (RKM), 3 penicillins including ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin, cloxacillin and 1 cephem antibiotic, cefaclor (CCL), against 29 strains consisting of 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 7 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 of Streptococcus pneumonia 2 of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 of Campylobacter jejuni, out of 71 strains of pathogens or possible pathogens that had been isolated from the cases given TE-031.","['Motohiro T', 'Sakata Y', 'Kuroiwa Y', 'Aramaki M', 'Oda K', 'Kawakami A', 'Shimada Y', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Fujimoto T']",1989,42,2,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule.

2573914,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hantaviruses, the causative agents of HFRS, have become more widely recognized. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that these pathogens are distributed worldwide. People who come into close contact with infected rodents in urban, rural and laboratory environments are at particular risk. Transmission to man occurs mainly via the respiratory tract. The epidemiology of the hantaviruses is intimately linked to the ecology of their principal vertebrate hosts. Four distinct viruses are now recognized within the hantavirus genus and that number is likely to increase to six very soon; however, further investigations are necessary. Much more work is still needed before we fully understand the wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms of HFRS as well as the pathogenicity of the different viruses in the hantavirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. HFRS is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone and serological evidence is often needed. A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer in a 1-week interval, and the presence of the IgM type of antibodies against hantaviruses are good evidence for an acute hantavirus infection. Physicians should be alert for HFRS each time they deal with patients with acute febrile flu-like illness, renal failure of unknown origin and sometimes hepatic dysfunction. Especially the mild form of HFRS is difficult to diagnose. Acute onset, headache, fever, increased serum creatinine, proteinuria and polyuria are signs and symptoms compatible with a mild form of HFRS. Differential diagnosis should be considered for the following diseases in the endemic areas of HFRS: acute renal failure, hemorrhagic scarlet fever, acute abdomen, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, spotted fevers, non-A, non-B hepatitis, Colorado tick fever, septicemia, dengue, heartstroke and DIC. Treatment of HFRS is mainly supportive. Recently, however, treatment of HFRS patients with ribavirin in China and Korea, within 7 days after onset of fever, resulted in a reduced mortality as well as shortened course of illness.","['Lee HW', 'van der Groen G']",1989,36,,Prog Med Virol,Lee HW and van der Groen G.

A tablet form of this combined drug has been released since July, 1987 in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. Hence, the granular form of SBTPC was administered to 6 boys (age: 8 years 5 months-11 years 5 months) to determine plasma and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery-rates. The dose of 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg was given orally just after meal to 3 boys. To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 27.1 mg/kg divided 2-4 times a day was administered for 9 days on the average to a total of 57 cases with pharyngitis (5), tonsillitis (5), laryngitis (1), bronchitis (1), pneumonia (8), scarlet fever (1), typhoid fever (1), impetigo (16), furuncle (2), abscess (6), lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (10) except 2 cases which were unevaluable for clinical effects. MICs of 7 drugs (SBTPC, ABPC, SBT, methicillin (DMPPC), cloxacillin (MCIPC), cephalexin and cefaclor) against 12 of 22 strains isolated from patients with infections of skin and soft tissue were determined with inoculum-sizes of 10(8) and 10(8) CFU/ml to study beta-lactamase producing activities. Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients including dropped-out cases. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Mean plasma peak levels of ABPC and SBT were observed at 1 hour after administration in both of the 10 mg/kg and the 15 mg/kg groups with values of 2.34 and 5.57 micrograms/ml for ABPC and 1.87 and 4.66 micrograms/ml for SBT, respectively.

An attempt was made to obtain quantitative estimates for changes coinciding with the introduction of antibiotics. Two possible types of effect were considered: a sharp reduction of mortality at the moment of the introduction of antibiotics, and a longer lasting (acceleration of) mortality decline after the introduction. Changes resembling the first type of effect were possibly present for many infectious diseases, but were difficult to measure exactly, due to late effects on mortality of World War II. Changes resembling the second type of effect were present in 16 infectious diseases and were sometimes quite large. For example, estimated differences in per cent per annum mortality change were 10% or larger for puerperal fever, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, erysipelas, otitis media, tuberculosis, and bacillary dysentery. No acceleration of mortality decline after the introduction of antibiotics was present in mortality from 'all other diseases'. Although the exact contribution of antibiotics to the observed changes cannot be inferred from this time trend analysis, the quantitative estimates of the changes show that even a partial contribution would represent a substantial effect of antibiotics on mortality from infectious diseases in the Netherlands.","['Mackenbach JP', 'Looman CW']",1988,17,3,Int J Epidemiol,"Mackenbach JP and Looman CW.

Of these 7232 (58%) were isolates from hospital patients, 249 (2%) from hospital staff and 4988 (40%) from the community. The survey extended from January 1980 to June 1987. During this time the numbers of isolates of M-types 6, 49 and 81 rose then fell, being replaced by types 1, 3 and 28. The proportion of isolates of M-types 4 and 12 remained constant. Few strains were received from cases of nephritis or rheumatic fever but there has been an increase in the number of strains from serious infections and deaths. Forty-four of the 55 (80%) strains received since 1985 from fatal infections have belonged to M-type 1. All other strains, bar two, received from fatal infections in those years belonged to M-type 3. Representatives of M-type 1 were also associated with erysipelas. Types 3 and 4 predominated among the isolates from scarlet fever, types 1, 4, 12 and 49 from nephritis, types 49 and 81 from skin infections in meat workers and type 28 in cases of puerperal sepsis.

3122461,Streptococcal outbreaks and erythrogenic toxin type A.,"Reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and strains from recent epidemics and sporadic cases of scarlet fever were examined for their ability to produce erythrogenic toxin type A (ET A) by ELISA and double immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) using an anti-ET A antibody purified by affinity chromatography. Of the reference strains (most of them isolated before 1945) 16/51 produced more or less ET A (Table 1). ET A synthesis is strain-specific, but not type-specific. Well-known toxin producers like the strains NY-5; 594 or ""Smith"" produce up to 16.000 micrograms/l under optimal culture conditions. Type 3 strains isolated from scarlet fever patients during the outbreak 1972/73 seem to belong to one clone as evidenced by the uniform SDS-PAGE pattern: They were found to produce 5-200 micrograms/l (mean 68 micrograms/l) ET A only. Type 3 strains from sporadic cases, isolated 10 years later, produced 0-138 micrograms/l (mean 30 micrograms/l). Strains of the type 1 clone, causing the epidemic in 1982/83 produced only 0.75-10 micrograms/l (mean 8 micrograms/l) ET A (Table 3). Only a few strains of S. pyogenes isolated 1984 or later synthesized ET A but they were found more often to produce ET B (proteinase precursor) in batch cultures. S. pyogenes strains seem to have lost their ability to produce large amounts of ET A during the last decades. Because this toxin must be considered as a pathogenicity factor the decrease in toxin production may be one reason for the present mild form of scarlet fever.","['Köhler W', 'Gerlach D', 'Knöll H']",1987,266,1-2,Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg A,"Köhler W, et al.

From each serological group of human isolates, more than 100 strains were tested. The results were evaluated statistically with respect to serological group, type and source of isolates. Between human isolates of groups A, C and G, no statistical differences concerning IgG binding were found. However, group C streptococci isolated from pigs showed a significantly higher number of strains with high IgG binding than the human isolates of groups A, C and G. Group A streptococci isolated from suppurating lesions showed an increased IgG uptake when compared with isolates from scarlet fever patients or patients with throat infections. However, strong IgG binding by group A streptococci seems not to be restricted to certain types. By using selected streptococcal strains, it was found that IgG absorption from a solution of purified IgG was much higher than from IgG solutions containing albumin or from diluted serum. The results are discussed in connection with the competition of different plasma proteins for binding sites on the streptococcal cell surface and with a possible influence of IgG receptors on the virulence of streptococci.","['Schmidt KH', 'Kühnemund O', 'Köhler W']",1987,265,3-4,Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg A,"Schmidt KH, et al.

SI structural manifestations involved development of necrotic or purulent-necrotic inflammation of a various degree in the area of the primary focus, regional lymph nodes as well as in the foci resulting from lymphohaematogenic and intracanalicular dissemination. The first symptoms of the septic process could be found even in case of death during the first day of the disease. The role of viral respiratory infection being the background for the SI development, especially for its pharyngeal variant and lung affection, is shown.

3762641,The natural history of primary first-degree atrioventricular heart block.,"The long-term prognosis of first-degree heart block in the absence of organic heart disease has not been clearly defined. We addressed this question in a 30-year longitudinal study of 3983 healthy men. We identified 52 cases that were present on entry into the study and 124 incident cases during follow-up. The incidence rose steadily after age 40 and was 1.13 per 1000 person-years over the entire period. Two thirds of the cases had only moderate prolongation of the PR interval (0.22 to 0.23 second). We compared four age-matched controls with each case for histories of scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, diphtheria, smoking, blood pressure, and body-mass index. No significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were found. Likewise, mortality from all causes did not differ between cases and controls. Although somewhat higher rates of morbidity and mortality from ischemic heart disease were observed in the cases than in the controls, the differences were not significant.

The pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 11 patients, each of 6 patients was given CFIX at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of the remaining patients was given CFIX at 6 mg/kg. Serum concentrations of CFIX were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFIX were measured for periods of 0-6 and 6-12 hours after dosing. CFIX was assayed by the disk method using E. coli ATCC 39188 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 35 children including 5 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 1 of purulent lymphadenitis, 1 of scarlet fever, 8 of acute bronchitis, 5 of pneumonia, 3 of urinary tract infections and 1 of paratyphoid B. One additional patient was included only in the evaluation of safety since he was suffering from Mycoplasma pneumonia. the patients were from 4 months to 8 years 2 months old and 11 of them were inpatients. Daily doses were from 6.0 to 13.5 mg/kg. After CFIX administration in doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations were 1.75 and 3.36 micrograms/ml, half-lives were 2.65 and 2.86 hours and urinary excretions rates up to 12 hours after dosing were 16.1 and 12.4%, respectively.

Most of these diseases may be conveniently grouped according to the clinical appearance of the exanthem as maculopapular, petechial, papular, or vesicular. In some situations, viral infection may be difficult to differentiate clinically from nonviral disease; thus, extensive laboratory evaluation is sometimes necessary to pinpoint the virus involved. Nonviral disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with skin eruptions, especially of the maculopapular type.

4050773,Toxic shock syndrome. I. Clinical exclusion of other syndromes by strict and screening definitions.,"Several clinical definitions of toxic shock syndrome have been proposed and used in extensive epidemiologic and clinical studies. Most of these definitions suggest (but usually do not require) that there be sufficient laboratory studies to exclude other potentially similar syndromes. Simplified definitions which broaden the spectrum of toxic shock syndrome illness have also been proposed but not validated. In this study, clinical findings of consecutive hospitalized patients were compared: nine with toxic shock syndrome (confirmed by a modification of the collaborative strict case definition) and 120 with potentially similar diagnoses (bacteremia with shock, meningococcemia, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, scarlet fever, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute rheumatic fever, leptospirosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rubeola, Kawasaki syndrome, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). None of the 120 controls satisfied the clinical criteria of the modified strict definition of toxic shock syndrome, demonstrating its exclusionary properties even in the absence of additional laboratory data. A ""simplified"" screening definition was constructed which might be applied early in illness (i.e., at admission) and this definition distinguished all the patients with toxic shock syndrome from all but three (2.5%) of the 117 analyzable patients with other mucocutaneous or potential infectious shock syndromes. Applied prospectively in the state of Colorado passive/active reporting system, the screening definition identified 24 potential toxic shock syndrome cases of which 19 (76%) eventually were confirmed as toxic shock syndrome. Before being adopted and widely used, clinical syndrome definitions should be documented to exclude other potentially overlapping syndromes or should require additional mandatory exclusionary laboratory data.","['Wiesenthal AM', 'Ressman M', 'Caston SA', 'Todd JK']",1985,122,5,Am J Epidemiol,"Wiesenthal AM, et al.

In a pharmacokinetic study, serum concentrations were determined in a patient after oral administration of BRL 25000 granules in the non-fasting state at a dose of 11.76 mg/kg. The serum levels of amoxicillin (AMPC) and clavulanic acid (CVA) 1 hour after administration were 7.76 micrograms/ml and 6.64 micrograms/ml, with biological half-lives of 0.86 hour and 0.88 hour respectively. The serum concentration profile at a dose of 31.58 mg/kg showed almost the same tendency as at 11.76 mg/kg, although the peak level and biological half-life of the serum concentrations were not obtained. These serum levels and their peak levels were considered reasonable compared with those obtained in adults at similar dose levels.

3974168,[Microbiology of streptococcal infections].,"Since the discovery of streptococci by the surgeon of Vienna, Theodor Billroth, more than 100 years ago, they have proved to be a bacterial group of great medical and epidemiological importance. The classification in growth-characteristics on blood culture mediums (alpha-, beta- and gamma-hemolysis) has been detached by the evidence of group specific cell wall antigens. The antigene extraction described by Lancefield can distinguish at least 21 serogroups (A-T). They have also taken over the historical names (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae etc.). In addition to group relationship the antigen structure of the streptococci cell wall (carbohydrates, peptidoglycanes, M-T-R-proteins and others) is responsible for antigenetic and pathogenetic conditions. Some species of streptococci do also excrete exotoxines (streptolysin, hyaluronidase, bacteriocines, erythrogenic toxins) with antigenetic and pathogenetic significance. Infections with streptococci of the serogroup A, B, D and H are numerously and medically significant. There is a great interest in infections due to A streptococci (pharygitis, impetigo, erysipel, scarlatin fever). The known non-purulent diseases following A streptococci infections (acute rheumatoid fever, acute glomerulonephritis) are streptococcal specific reactions for the individual. Some antigens of the cell wall and also some exotoxines react in human beings as autoantigenes. Human beings are the most important reservoir for streptococci.

3843587,Kawasaki disease.,"Kawasaki disease, a pathologic syndrome known to occur in children, was first described in 1967 as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome by Kawasaki. The disease occurs chiefly in infants under 4 years of age, presenting with symptoms similar to scarlet fever or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The changes are found at postmortem and consist of multiple aneurysms and thrombosis, which occur predominantly in the coronary arteries and are responsible for sudden death in most cases. Kawasaki disease is a systemic, acute inflammatory disease entity and in the early stages shows diffuse, necrotizing necrosis. Vasculitis affects primarily the arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Once aneurysmal dilatation has taken place, the wall of the coronary aneurysm becomes thin and the basic structures are destroyed by infiltration of inflammatory cells, which is followed by scar formation within 1 month from the onset of the disease. Coronary arterial lesions are nowadays responsible for the increase of myocardial infarction among the patients. Causes of sudden death include acute ischemia from obstruction or narrowing of the main coronary artery due to thrombosis, thickening of the vascular walls, myocarditis, rupture, and involvement of the conduction system by inflammatory infiltrates, resulting in complete atrioventricular block.",['Hamashima Y'],1985,1,,Heart Vessels Suppl,Hamashima Y.

6372467,Cutaneous infections: microbiologic and epidemiologic considerations.,"The normal bacterial flora of the skin represents an important host defense mechanism against invasion by potentially pathogenic organisms. This flora is primarily composed of aerobic diphtheroids (Corynebacterium species), anaerobic diphtheroids (Propriono-bacterium acnes), and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli may be present in limited numbers in intertriginous areas. Localized cutaneous infections occur in ostensibly normal hosts, often after trivial trauma, examples being streptococcal or staphylococcal impetigo, staphylococcal furunculosis, or more unusual infections due to agents such as Mycobacterium marinum. When the skin is injured more extensively by trauma, burns, ischemia with ulceration, or iatrogenic manipulations, or when host immunologic defenses are suppressed, more severe infections are likely to supervene, and the threat of systemic dissemination of infecting microorganisms increases. Cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed hosts may involve the same pyogenic bacteria that affect normal subjects or it may involve a variety of opportunistic invaders, including herpes viruses, gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, and deep or superficial mycoses. The skin may also be affected by infections whose primary site lies elsewhere in the body. Cutaneous manifestations may be secondary to hematogenous seeding of the causative agent or to the effects of toxins or immune complexes. Certain microbial agents may initiate a wide variety of cutaneous lesions, depending on route of infection and the status of the host. Thus, cutaneous lesions attributable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa range from ""green nail syndrome"" and self-limited folliculitis to ecthyma gangrenosum. Similarly, group A streptococci may produce pyoderma, cellulitis, lymphangitis, erysipelas, or scarlet fever. We recently described a syndrome of recurrent cellulitis in the saphenous vein donor extremities of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafts. Most patients have associated tinea pedis. The pathophysiologic aspects of this syndrome are probably multifactorial, involving compromise of lymphatic or venous drainage, bacterial infection, elaboration of bacterial toxins, and hypersensitivity to bacterial or fungal products, or both. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are exhibiting a more prominent pathogenic potential than heretofore. When they infect immunosuppressed hosts or patients with indwelling intravascular catheters or cardiac prostheses, coagulase-negative staphylococci may cause life-threatening disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Bisno AL'],1984,76,5A,Am J Med,Bisno AL.

6359775,Isolation and characterization of erythrogenic toxins. V. Communication: identity of erythrogenic toxin type B and streptococcal proteinase precursor.,"Production of erythrogenic toxin type B by Streptococcus pyogenes strain T19 was found to be strongly dependent on the pH of the cultivation medium. Maximum yields (greater than 100 mg of toxin/1) were obtained at pH 6.0. In contrast no toxin production was serologically detectable at pH values above 6.5. Purified B-toxin was shown to consist of two components when assayed by SDS-electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the two components was estimated to be 30 000 and 12 000. Isoelectric focusing revealed a heterogeneity of the preparation with isoelectric points between 8.0 and 9.0. Streptococcal proteinase precursor was isolated from culture supernatants of strains T19 and B220 by ammonium sulfate crystallization and purification on CM-Sepharose CL 6B. The protein obtained was homogeneous by SDS-gel electrophoresis and had a molecular weight of 44 000. After autocatalytic activation with mercaptoethanol two bands appeared corresponding to molecular weights 30 000 and 12 000. Isoelectric focusing of proteinase precursor preparations yielded a double band at pI 8.2-8.3. However, activation of precursor to active proteinase finally resulted in a change of the pI to 9.0. Erythrogenic toxin type B, streptococcal proteinase precursor, its intermediate activation products and the active proteinase itself reacted serologically identical with anti B-toxin antiserum. Streptococcal proteinase precursor provoked a delayed skin reaction and was pyrogenic as well as mitogenic. Its pyrogenic activity could be inhibited by antiserum against scarlet fever toxin (Wellcome Laboratories). We therefore believe erythrogenic toxin type B to be identical with streptococcal proteinase precursor. This helps to understand the heterogeneity of B toxin, its inactivation by trypsin and the different protocols for toxin production described in the literature.","['Gerlach D', 'Knöll H', 'Köhler W', 'Ozegowski JH', 'Hríbalova V']",1983,255,2-3,Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg A Med Mikrobiol Infekt Parasitol,"Gerlach D, et al.

6356291,Streptococcal toxins.,"Few of the cellular components of group A streptococci appear to be directly toxic for animals or humans. Some preparations of M protein produce an immunotoxic effect on human platelets and neutrophils. Cell wall fragments produce a chronic multinodular inflammatory lesion of dermal connective tissue. The peptidoglycan component of cell walls has many of the biologic features of endotoxins. The exotoxins of group A streptococci include the erythrogenic toxins (pyrogenic exotoxins) and the cytolytic toxins (streptolysins S and O). The high prevalence of erythrogenic, toxin-producing strains is difficult to reconcile with the epidemiologic behavior of scarlet fever; the variations may be due to quantitative differences in toxin production or to a shift from the early scarlet fever-associated strains that produce A toxin to the currently prevalent strains that produce B and C toxins. Experiments with animals suggest that a positive Dick test and the rash of scarlet fever result not from a direct toxic effect but rather from enhancement by pyrogenic exotoxin(s) of acquired hypersensitivity to diverse streptococcal products. The mechanism of toxigenic phage conversion is not clear. The pyrogenic exotoxins are associated with the enhancement of endotoxin shock and a wide variety of other biologic properties. Streptolysin S is a nonantigenic polypeptide associated with various stabilizing carrier molecules. It lyses a wide range of mammalian cells, influences T lymphocyte functions, and is probably responsible for the leukotoxic property of group A streptococci. Rheumatic fever has been associated with a streptococcal outbreak due to a nonhemolytic (streptolysin S-negative) strain. Streptolysin O is an oxygen-labile (thiol-activated) cytolysin. It is inhibited by nonesterified cholesterol and binds to cholesterol in the membranes of mammalian cells and organelles, an interaction producing ring-like and C-shaped structures demonstrable by electron microscopy. Streptolysin O affects a number of leukocyte functions. It produces profound electrocardiographic changes in experimental animals and toxic effects on pulsating heart cells in tissue culture. The observation that rheumatic fever is not associated with infection of the skin due to group A streptococci has suggested that nonesterified cholesterol in the epidermis may inhibit a toxic effect of streptolysin O, an effect necessary for the development of rheumatic fever.",['Wannamaker LW'],1983,5 Suppl 4,,Rev Infect Dis,Wannamaker LW.

30921943,Epidemiology of Milk-Borne Diseases.,"Secular trends in milk-borne diseases in the U.S.A. show numerous outbreaks associated with ingestion of raw milk in the early 1900s until the end of World War II. Diseases common in this period, but no longer milk-borne, were typhoid fever, scarlet fever, septic sore throat, diphtheria, tuberculosis, shigellosis, and milk sickness. Milk-borne and milk-product-borne diseases rarely reported somewhere in the world were botulism, Escherichia coli enteritis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa enteritis, listeriosis, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, Bacillus cereus gastroenteritis, Haverhill fever, Q fever, hepatitis A, poliomyelitis, toxoplasmosis, histamine intoxication and hypertension. After most milk was pasteurized, outbreaks decreased dramatically. Milk-borne diseases of contemporary importance in the U.S.A. are salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, staphylococcal intoxication, brucellosis, and yersiniosis. These have usually been associated with ingestion of raw milk, certified raw milk, home-made ice cream containing fresh eggs, dried milk, pasteurized milk which was contaminated after heat processing, or either cheese made from raw milk or cheese in which starter activity was inhibited during its manufacture.",['Bryan FL'],1983,46,7,J Food Prot,Bryan FL.

The antibacterial activities of T-1982 against clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were determined in comparison with those of CER, CEZ, CMZ and CTT. Against S. aureus, CER and CEZ exhibited excellent activity, whereas T-1982 was less active with the peak MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml even with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The activity of T-1982 was equal to that of CTT and by far superior to that of CER, CEZ and CMZ against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, the peak MICs with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml being less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2-0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. Against S. marcescens, T-1982 was superior to CMZ and CTT and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml or less, whereas all the strains were resistant to CER and CEZ. The MIC of T-1982 against most strains of P. aeruginosa was more than 100 micrograms/ml. 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of T-1982 was administered by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion to 23 pediatric patients to measure serum levels and urinary recovery. At 30 minutes after one shot injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the highest serum levels of 22.0-38.8 micrograms/ml and 52.4-80 micrograms/ml were observed, the half-lives being 1.32 hours and 1.76 hours. When given by 1 hour drip infusion, the serum levels attained the peaks of 29.2-42.6 micrograms/ml and 49.0-75.6 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, the half-lives being 1.24 hours and 1.19 hours.

Toxigenic conversion was found in 19 newly constructed lysogenic and pseudolysogenic strains resulting in synthesis of exotoxin types A and B. Conversion was accomplished by a positive conversion effector, which was a phage characteristic expressed by the prophage and vegetatively reproducing phage. Exotoxin production was determined by the rabbit skin test and by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis with type-specific antisera. New lysogens and pseudolysogens were constructed with strains which failed to produce at least one exotoxin type. Phages were obtained from toxigenic strains isolated from cases of scarlet fever. Conversions were consistent and repeatable; loss of the recently introduced phage was accompanied by loss of the newly acquired toxin productivity. Conversion resulted in production of additional exotoxin type or types and never affected existing toxin synthesis. Converting phages were characterized by electron microscopy and negatively stained preparations and were all found to be of morphological class B1. All phage nucleic acid was double-stranded DNA. Though similar in structure, each converting phage had a different host range, and the nine new converting phages identified here did not react with antiserum prepared against the originally reported converting phage.","['Nida SK', 'Ferretti JJ']",1982,36,2,Infect Immun,Nida SK and Ferretti JJ.

In 1980, in Bucharest, morbidity from scarlet fever was at its lowest level (92.7 per 100,000) during the last 31 years; it was in general benign, affecting especially in the month of March the 5-9 years age group (623.9 per 100,000) and the 1-4 years age group (529.4 per 100,000). The trailing evolution of a scarlet fever focus in a prescholar community suggested the hypothesis of the potentiation of the induction of streptococcal toxigenesis under the influence of intercurrent vital infections, especially measles. There were no deaths from scarlet fever. Laboratory investigations for the active detection and treatment of anginas, of carriers at risk, totalled 52101 tests; of these 4478 (8.59%) were positive for group ""A"" streptococci. In the prescholar communities surveyed no poststreptococcal complications were reported (acute articular rheumatism and glomerulonephritis). In 1980, there were 63 cases of acute articular rheumatism (code 250) in the 0-18 year-old group. The results suggest the need of continued epidemiological survey of streptococcal infections in children with a view to improving the health status of the population.","['Măgureanu E', 'Dobrescu A', 'Busuioc C', 'Ulmeanu V', 'Horhogea G', 'Ionescu M', 'Horhogea P', 'Beznea A']",1982,27,1,Rev Ig Bacteriol Virusol Parazitol Epidemiol Pneumoftiziol Bacteriol Virusol Parazitol Epidemiol,"Măgureanu E, et al.

Cefroxadine 20 mg/kg was administered to 9 children with heart disease for the prophylaxis against infections before undergoing cardiocatheterization and cardioangiography, and serum levels were determined. Peak levels reached after 30 minutes in 4 of the 9 cases, with a mean peak level of 22.5 mcg/ml and after 1 hour in 5 cases, with a mean peak level of 16.2 mcg/ml. Half life was 3.1 hours in the former group in a 6-hour blood sampling (1.04 hours in a 2-hour sampling) while in the latter group it was 1.37 hours. 2. Clinical responses were evaluated in 56 children comprising 23 cases of pharyngitis, 8 of tonsillitis, 13 of scarlet fever, 10 of urinary tract infections and 2 of impetigo. Fifty of these cases had excellent and good responses showing a efficacy rate of 89.3%. 3. From 42 of the cases, 43 strains were isolated as causative organisms. Major organisms included 27 strains of S. pyogenes, 9 of E. coli and 3 of S. aureus. As for bacteriological responses, all strains were eradicated. 4. No severe side effects were observed except for diarrhea of 1 cases and eosinophilia of 2 cases.

Also, its clinical efficacies and side effects were investigated in the following cases who were treated with a mean dose of 33 mg/day divided into 3 to 4 portions for a period of 9 days on the average; viz. a total of 151 cases consisting of 9 cases of pharyngitis, 39 of tonsillitis, 11 of streptococcal infection, i.e. scarlet fever, 7 of bronchitis, 6 of pneumonia, 1 of otitis media, 6 of purulent lymphadenitis, 1 of purulent parotitis, 1 of subcutaneous abscess and 3 of impetigo. 1. The serum level tends to reach its maximum level within 1 hour after administration. The mean concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dose in the foregoing time were 6.35, 9.12 and 21.62 mcg/ml respectively and dose response was observed. CXD showed higher concentration than CEX, CED and CFT. The mean half-life periods of the 3 dose were 72, 84 and 66 minutes respectively and variations were observed, but the drugs maintains a satisfactory serum level. 2. The time which showed highest urine excretion was mainly in the 0 to 2 hours bracket and the average concentrations of 5 , 10 and 20 mg/kg dose in the foregoing time were 381.2, 771.7 and 1,577.7 mcg/ml respectively. The dose response was more evident than in the serum concentrations. The average recovery rates within 6 hours were 93.6, 88.3 and 94.3% respectively and they were similar to those of CEX, CED and CFT. 3. The clinical effects were evaluated were in 148 cases out of the total of 151 and 136 cases, or 91.9% showed good or excellent efficacy response. 4. The daily dose groups of less than 30 mg/kg and 31 to 40 mg/kg formed the majority and there was no difference in the comparison of the clinical effectiveness in these 2 groups. Administration of a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg is sufficient for the treatment of the aforementioned mild diseases except for pneumonia. 5. The clinical effects were compared between the 3 and 4 times a day treatment groups, but there was no difference between these two groups with regard to the foregoing daily dose. The 3 times a day treatment is acceptable, but the 4 times a day treatment is preferable when pharmacokinetics if taken into account. 6.

The outstanding features of this review are the following: a very high incidence of the disease in 1978 and 1979, coinciding with an epidemic of scarlet fever. From 127 patients a renal biopsy was obtained; in 79.5% the histological picture srowed proliferative endocapillary glomerulonephritis (PEG), 5.5% corresponded to focal proliferative endo and extracapillary glomerulonephritis (FPEEG), 11% were diffuse proliferative endo and extracapillary crescent-forming glomerulonephritis (DPEEG) and 3.9% membranoproliferative glomerulonephriteis (MPG). On clinical basis, the evolution of the disease through a 12 years follow-up period has demonstrated normal renal function in 91% of all patients. Correlation of the results of histologic examination with the clinical course of the disease have demonstrated a good prognosis in PEG, whereas DPEEG and MPG have shown a poor evolution.

Previous investigation has demonstrated the presence of a factor in streptococcal culture filtrates capable of stimulating proliferation of rabbit keratinocytes in vivo and human lymphocytes in vitro. This report outlines an in vivo method for the production of streptococcal proliferation factor, its purification, and characterization of its physical properties. We cultured Group A streptococci (Type 12, Strain NY5) in synthetic media by in vivo incubation within dialysis casing surgically implanted in rabbit peritoneum. Streptococcal exoproteins were isolated by centrifugation of the bacteria and millipore filtration. Purification of streptococcal proliferative factor was accomplished by differential solubility and molecular sieve was discovered in the resulting product. The relative by SDS gels and molecular sieve chromatography. The sedimentation coefficient determined by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation is 2.7S. Isoelectric focusing showed minimal microheterogeneity with the pI of the major band being 5.0. Thus, streptococcal proliferative factor can be produced by in vivo incubation of streptococci in synthetic media. Purification entails a rapid 2-step process.

A CFX vial which contained 1 g of CFX was used in two ways, i.e., one shot intravenous injection and drip infusion. The dosage of the drug varied from 57 to 121 mg/kg/day and the administration was continued from 2 to 20 days. Clinical effects were evaluated as follows: when cardinal symptoms disappeared within 3 days it was considered to be 'excellent'; within 5 days 'good'; and no change of clinical symptoms within 5 days 'poor'. The bacteriological effect was expressed as 'eliminated', 'unchanged' and 'undetermined'. Clinical efficacy evaluated as 'excellent' occurred in 11 cases, 'good' in 8 cases and 'poor' in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 95.0%. When classified by the disease, the efficacy rate was as follows: 'good' to 'excellent' in 7 out of the 8 cases of ARD, 'excellent' in all of the 3 cases of UTI, 'good' and 'excellent' in the 2 cases of scarlet fever and in the 2 cases of peritonitis, 'excellent' in each case of left coxitis, purulent parotitis and intractable diarrhea with fever, 'good' in each case of infected medial cervical cyst and febrile illness with a V-P shunt operation. From the bacteriological point of view, 'eliminated' occurred in 5 cases, 'reduced' in 1 case and 'undetermined' in the 2 cases of ARD, 'eliminated' in all of the 3 cases of UTI, 'eliminated' in 1 case and 'undetermined' in the 1 case of peritonitis, 'undetermined' in the 2 cases of scarlet fever, 'eliminated' in each case of infected medial cervical cyst and purulent parotitis and 'undetermined' in the other cases.

7216472,Staphylococcal scarlet fever: role of pyrogenic exotoxins.,"Staphylococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (PE) types A and B were tested for their role in production of a scarlatiniform rash. The PEs elicited minimal skin reactions after intracutaneous injection into animals not presensitized to the toxins. In contrast, erythematous injection into animals not presensitized to the toxins. In contrast, erythematous and edematous rashes were produced after administration of either PE to animals presensitized to homologous toxin. After 3 to 4 days, the erythematous areas showed membranous desquamation. Staphylococcal PEs also enhanced delayed and Arthus hypersensitivity skin reactions developed against unrelated proteins; the reactions subsequently desquamated. In addition, animals previously sensitized to either staphylococcal PE type developed scarlatiniform rashes after challenged with heterologous staphylococcal or any group A streptococcal PE. The data suggest that staphylococcal PEs produce scarlet fever-like rashes comparable to group A streptococcal PEs and that all PE types contain a common core moiety against which delayed hypersensitivity may be developed.",['Schlievert PM'],1981,31,2,Infect Immun,Schlievert PM.

Mortality due to tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles, typhoid, puerperal fever and infant gastro-enteritis started to fall long before the introduction of immunization and/or antibiotics. This decline was probably due to a great extent to various factors linked to the steady rise in the standard of living: qualitative and quantitative improvements in nutrition; better public and personal hygiene; better housing and working conditions and improvements in education. Immunization has probably been decisive in the eradication of smallpox and poliomyelitis and for the reduction in mortality from tetanus. The introduction of sulfonamides and antibiotics was associated with the beginning of the decline in mortality from non-meningococcal meningitis, otitis and appendicitis and with a more pronounced decline in mortality from pneumonia and acute rheumatic fever.

Although the authors of these case reports speculated that the gangrene was due to septic embolization, pathologic study of the amputated tissue failed to reveal evidence of septic emboli. In reviewing reports of amputation following scarlet fever, varicella, pneumococcemia, and appendicitis, we found cases with clinical, hematologic, and pathologic evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We describe 2 patients who required extremity amputation following an acute, systemic infection: transmetatarsal and Lisfranc amputation following meningococcal meningitis and bilateral below-knee amputation following pneumococcal meningitis. Both of these patients had clinical, hematologic, and pathologic evidence of DIC. Following amputation, both of these patients had significant problems with skin healing and prosthetic fitting. The presence of an acute systemic bacterial or viral infection, coagulation abnormalities and pathologic tissue indicative of DIC, and skin lesions of the extremities progressing to dry gangrene and ultimately requiring bilateral amputation are the key clinical features of this syndrome. We conclude that DIC is a major pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for peripheral gangrene following systemic infection.","['Reinstein L', 'Govindan S']",1980,61,2,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Reinstein L and Govindan S.

161910,Reinterpretation of the Dick test: role of group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin.,"Because of the association of the group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs) with erythrogenic toxin used in the classical Dick test, the involvement of the SPEs in production of erythematous skin reactions was assessed. Unless they had been presensitized, young adult rabbits failed to show skin reactions after intracutaneous challenged with SPEs. Rabbits presensitized to purified protein derivative exhibited enhanced skin reactivity when given purified protein derivative plus SPE C; the enhancement was neutralized by antiserum to SPE C. Rabbits sensitized to bovine serum albumin showed extensive red rash development resembling scarlet fever rashes when given bovine serum albumin containing SPE C. Desquamation occurred 5 to 10 days after injection. Animals sensitized to one SPE type showed enhanced skin reactivity to challenge with homologous or heterologous SPE types, indicating the presence of a cross-reactive determinant within the SPE molecules. Repeated challenge of SPE-sensitized animals with homologous toxin resulted in concomitant antitoxin production with reduction of the enhanced skin reactivities, until typical delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions remained. The data indicate that, in addition to the toxic reaction previously described, SPEs enhance Arthus and delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions. It follows that erythrogenic toxin represents the enhancement of acquired skin reactivity to streptococcal antigens by one or more SPE types. Therefore, the Dick test measures SPE-enhanced hypersensitivity to streptococcal products.","['Schlievert PM', 'Bettin KM', 'Watson DW']",1979,26,2,Infect Immun,"Schlievert PM, et al.

The study was performed simultaneously in two groups of children (an experimental and a control group) and allowed, after confrontation of the results obtained, to evaluate correctly the investigations performed, that is the detection of the acute disease and of healthy carriers by bacteriological examinations and early detection of post-streptococcal complications with the aid of serologic examinations (ASLO). The importance is stressed, of living conditions in the family and at school, as well as of individual factors (hereditary, hormonal, immunologic, etc.) in the development of late complications. Thus the measures proposed by the authors are aimed not only at the medical aspects, but also to the social-organizatoric ones.","['Oteşteanu E', 'Rusu O', 'Elias A', 'Plăcintă A', 'Theodorescu G']",1979,24,4,Rev Ig Bacteriol Virusol Parazitol Epidemiol Pneumoftiziol Bacteriol Virusol Parazitol Epidemiol,"Oteşteanu E, et al.

Diagnoses of atypical measles were confirmed by hemagglutination-inhibition and complement-fixation antibody studies. Patients were followed with pulmonary function studies for 12 weeks. The most common admitting diagnoses were varicella, scarlet fever, meningococcemia, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, due largely to the protean cutaneous manifestations. Roentgenographic studies showed diffuse, segmental, and nodular chest lesions. Hypoxemia (mean arterial Po2, 58 mm Hg) and markedly reduced lung volumes were noted. Gradual resolution of physiologic abnormalities was noted during 12 weeks, but two children had persistent nodular densities seen on chest roentgenograms. Atypical measles in the older child and young adult has a wide spectrum of pulmonary manifestations ranging from acute respiratory failure to isolated nodular lesions. Proper recognition of this syndrome will prevent unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures.","['Hall WJ', 'Hall CB']",1979,90,6,Ann Intern Med,Hall WJ and Hall CB.

The 14 specific proteins were simultaneously quantitated in the serum specimens using radial immunodiffusion on antibodyagar plates. Antistreptolysin O titres were also determined and compared with the corresponding immunoglobulin levels. However, the titres showed only minor differences in various stages of illness the course of which was mild and without complications. Serum levels of prealbumin, albumin, alpha2HS-glycoproetin, transferrin and beta 2-glycoprotein I were found decreased at the acute clinical stage. Of the ""negative acute phase reactants"" prealbumin proved to be the most expressive one. Of a triad of ""positive reactants"" the largest relative increments showed haptoglobin, its increase was twofold of orosomucoid and that threefold of ceruloplasmin. C-reactive protein was increased almost in two thirds of patients on admission, but normalized in all cases about the end of the first week of penicillin therapy. No significant changes were found for alpha 2-macroglobulin.

The most frequent SE types detected were A (47.4%) and C (36.8%); type B was produced by 2 strains, type E by 1, while type D, or a combination of SE types, was not detected at all (by means of immunodiffusion in a micromodification). So far no significant correlation has been found between the clinical course of scarlet fever or accompanying complaints and presence of SE-positive S. aureus strains. The significance of these findings is discussed.",['Sourek J'],1978,242,1,Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig A,Sourek J. Findings of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus strains in scarlet fever.

One form is associated with staphylococci that are usually phage group II Staphylococcus aureus, are penicillin resistant, and produce a protein exotoxin which produces epidermolysis by causing a split to develop in the epidermis between the stratum granulosum and the stratum spinosum. The other form is associated usually with drug reactions and is characterized by necrosis of the epidermis with a split between epidermis and dermis. The staphylococcal Lyell syndrome should be treated with penicillinase resistant antibiotics and not with corticosteroids; the non-staphylococcal form of the Lyell syndrome often requires systemic corticosteroids. Therefore the correct diagnosis must be established early. This is possible since the histopathology of the two forms is different.","['Dimond RL', 'Wuepper KD']",1977,28,9,Hautarzt,Dimond RL and Wuepper KD. [Staphylogenous Lyell's syndrome].

319063,Distribution of antibodies to streptococcal esterases in patients with scarlet fever.,"Repetitive counterelectrophoresis (RCE), which has been described (Hayano and Tanaka, 1977), was used to assay the contents of antibodies to streptococcal esterases (STE) in sera from patients with scarlet fever. The levels of antibodies to STE were expressed semiquantitatively by reading the intensity of the colored spot developed by RCE with a densitometer. The present study deals with the determination of anti-STE in sera drawn at intervals from 54 patients diagnosed as suffering from scarlet fever. The STE used in this study were prepared from the streptococcal strains as follows. STE-AI was prepared from SS379 (group A, type 40), STE-AII from strain 69882 (group A, type 49), STE-B from strain H36B (group B, lb), and STE-C from strain Austin (group C). Of the 54 cases studied, 32 (59.3%) showed anti-STE-AI, 24 (44.4%) showed anti-STE-AII, 5 (9.3%) showed anti-STE-B, and 23 (42.6%) showed anti-STE-C. Comparison of the titer of anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) with the type of specific reaction of anti-STE-AI and -AII, determined in the same specimen, showed a marked correlation. Of 20 cases giving ASLO titers of 12 or less, 18 showed no sign of anti-STE-AI and -AII and two showed signs of anti-STE-AI. Of 34 cases giving ASLO titers of more than 12, 33 showed signs of anti-STE-AI and/or -AII, 22 showed signs of anti-STE-AI and -AII, 7 showed signs of anti-STE-AI, and 4 showed signs of anti-STE-AII. Of all the cases, 26 showed coincident rises in titers of ASLO and levels of anti-STE-AI and/or -AII during the course of the disease. One case showed the presence of only anti-STE-B. All of the 23 cases that showed the presence of anti-STE-C showed signs of anti-STE-AI. Some of these cases showed a marked increase in levels of anti-STE-C during the course of the disease.","['Hayano S', 'Tanaka A']",1977,15,1,Infect Immun,Hayano S and Tanaka A.

Reference antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with STE of streptococcal strains as follows: SS379 (group A, type 40), 69882 (group A, type 49), and H36B (group B, type Ib). Some human sera, derived from patients with scarlet fever, were also used as references. By this method, we have confirmed the immunological specificity of the STE produced by strains SS379 (STE-AI), 69882 (STE-AII), H36B (STE-B), and Austin (STE-C, group C) and have shown that the STE produced by strain 10706 (group C) is immunologically identical with STE-AI. Each STE presented a distinct colored line with the respective homologous antibody upon development of enzyme activity except for STE-AII, which formed a round spot with the homologous antibody. Horse activating factor (Hayano and Tanaka, 1973) formed a round spot with each STE. The factor in serum that reacted specifically with STE seemed to correspond to gamma globulin.","['Hayano S', 'Tanaka A']",1977,15,1,Infect Immun,"Hayano S and Tanaka A.

However, since attack rates and measured intelligence are related inversely to social class, the lower scores of children with measles and pertussis may be due to class differences which are not eliminated completely by standardization for maternal age and birth order.

994201,Epidemiology of diseases in adult males with leukemia.,"In the Tri-State Leukemia Survey, the history of diseases in 605 adult male leukemia cases 15 years and older and in 668 adult male population controls was examined. These diseases occurred at least 1 year before leukemia was diagnosed. The data were based on respondents' answers that the disease was diagnosed by a physician; the respondent was either the subject or his spouse. Of 30 diseases studied, 7 showed an excess among the patients with leukemia: infectious hepatitis, eczema, psoriasis, diabetes, arthritis and rheumatism, heart disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. Mumps had a lower reported occurrence among the cases, whereas pneumonia was less frequent in acute lymphatic cases than in population controls. Three diseases occurred significantly less in controls than in persons with specific histologic types of leukemia. Our data revealed a more frequent history of herpes zoster (shingles) in chronic lymphatic leukemia, more hives in acute chronic myeloid cases, and meningitis in acute myeloid leukemia. When we only considered the patients' responses, more of them admitted having had acne than did our controls. The remaining diseases--childhood viral diseases, infectious mononucleosis, smallpox, typhoid fever, dysentery, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, asthma, hay fever, and goiter did not occur more frequently in cases than in controls. The findings were consistent with evidence from previous laboratory and clinical studies. The increased occurrence of infectious hepatitis in our case series is consistent with the findings of other studies showing an increased frequency of Australia antigen in patients with hepatitis, leukemia, and Down's syndrome.","['Gibson R', 'Graham S', 'Lilienfeld A', 'Schuman L', 'Levin M', 'Swanson M']",1976,56,5,J Natl Cancer Inst,"Gibson R, et al.

810336,Streptococcal infections--updated.,"Streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. Infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. In newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (Table 1). In normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. Although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. Erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. Infections with group D streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group B streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. Streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see Table 1). Thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.","['Wannamaker LW', 'Ferrieri P']",1975,,,Dis Mon,Wannamaker LW and Ferrieri P.

Culture medium consisting of agar with 0.5% human albumin made it possible to isolate beta-haemolytic streptococci even after transport and with a count of less than a hundred micro-organisms per swab. The use of selective nutrient media may be necessary because of the sometimes marked multiplication during transport when there are mixed organisms.

In all cases of scarlet fever and especially of rheumatic fever the lymphocytes were better stimulated by streptococcal products than in the control group. The SO and the MAP fraction showed a good stimulating activity. The response in the rheumatic fever patients was not influenced by the steroid treatment, nor by the stage of the illness. A parallelism with high humoral and cellular responses to SO at the beginning of the acute rheumatic fever was observed, followed by a dissociation of both responses during the evolution with the maintenance of the cellular one and the decrease of the ASO titre.","['Mihalcu F', 'Stefănescu ?M', 'Teodorescu ?M']",1975,28,,Dev Biol Stand,"Mihalcu F, et al.

4874780,International survey of the distribution of serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci).,"To determine whether there are major differences in the distribution of Streptococcus pyogenes serotypes in different countries and to compare the typing results obtained in different laboratories with the same cultures, an international survey of the distribution of such serotypes was carried out in 1964-65 in 12 laboratories in different parts of the world.The cultures typed were a representative selection of those causing disease in each country, were as far as possible uninfluenced by seasonal changes and local prevalences, and included separate collections from cases of scarlet fever, sore throat, and other streptococcal diseases.Typing was carried out by the T-agglutination method in 12 laboratories and by the M-precipitation method as well in 8. Between 80% and 98% of the cultures were typable by T-agglutination in the different laboratories, and between 23% and 56% by M-precipitation.Some T-agglutination patterns were associated with a single M-antigen but others included members of several M-types. The same M-antigen was rarely found in streptococci with different T-agglutination patterns. The two methods could therefore conveniently be used as a combined system of typing.Certain streptococcal types were relatively common in most countries, but there were considerable national differences in type-distribution. Separate analysis of the cultures obtained from individual streptococcal diseases showed that there were also differences in type-distribution between streptococci isolated from scarlet fever, from sore throat, and from septic lesions not associated with the respiratory tract.",['Parker MT'],1967,37,4,Bull World Health Organ,Parker MT.

Countway Library of Medicine in May of 1965. As a result of this unification the historian may now consult many significant primary source materials in one research collection in Boston. Many of these works are early imprints of medical Americana. This paper discusses twenty-four imprints, from 1700 to 1820, which were firsts of their kind in American medical literature. Presented are the first American medical publication, book, pharmacopeia, mortality statistics, anatomical illustrations, transactions of a medical society, medical journal, textbook of obstetrics, medical dictionary, textbook of medicine, and official pharmacopeia. Also discussed are the first works in this country on smallpox inoculation, scarlet fever, pleurisy, public health, medical education, medical ethics, the history of medicine, surgery, epidemiology, smallpox vaccination, dentistry, meningitis, and psychiatry.

14042791,A NEW APPROACH TO BACTERIAL VACCINES.,"Immunizing antigens against only 10 bacterial diseases-cholera, diphtheria, paratyphoid, pertussis, plague, scarlet fever, staphylococcal disease, tetanus, tuberculosis and typhoid-have been licensed for sale in Canada and the United States. Convincing evidence of efficacy is available for only four of these-diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and pertussis and typhoid vaccines.The principles which determine the efficacy of different immunizing antigens are not always the same. Toxoids, for example, stimulate the formation of antitoxin-producing mechanisms which can neutralize toxins produced by invading organisms, thereby rendering them harmless. Conversely, vaccines stimulate the formation of antibacterial mechanisms which stop the growth of organisms before they can produce disease.Use of enzyme-lysed vaccines for prevention of staphylococcal disease represents a new approach in vaccine research. Animal tests have shown lysed vaccines to be 10 to 100 times less toxic, and about eight times more effective, than whole bacterial vaccines. Studies with lysed vaccines for other diseases are now in progress.",['GREENBERG L'],1963,89,9,Can Med Assoc J,GREENBERG L. A NEW APPROACH TO BACTERIAL VACCINES.

13710679,The use of precipitin analysis in agar for the study of human streptococcal infections. IV. Further observations on the purification of group A extracellular antigens.,"Studies on the purification of group A streptococcal extracellular antigens detectable with naturally occurring human antibodies from normal individuals have been extended. It has been shown that streptococcal electrophoretic fractions intermediate between the most rapidly migrating components are quite complex. In the calcium phosphate chromatography of adjacent electrophoretic fractions, particular antigenic components desorbed at similar buffer elution steps. It is clear from the results obtained that substantially more extracellular antigens than the twelve heretofore recognized are secreted in human beings during infection, as judged by their detection with human antibodies. The precise number is not yet known, but is probably greater than 16. Of the nine components which thus far have been separated rather well from the others, four were previously identified as streptolysin ""O,"" diphosphopyridine nucleotidase, proteinase precursor, and desoxyribonuclease B. The accumulated data substantiated these previous identifications. The identity of a fifth antigen has been made as a possible complex of C carbohydrate and protein. Tentative evidence for the relationship of a sixth component to scarlet fever toxin has been presented. It has been shown that rechromatography of crystalline proteinase precursor and desoxyribonuclease B on calcium phosphate columns resulted in elution principally at the expected stepwise increase in buffer concentration. Attempts to isolate antigens present as mixtures in some calcium phosphate chromatographic peaks, by rechromatography on DEAE or CM cellulose columns resulted in only limited further purifications.","['HALBERT SP', 'AUERBACH T']",1961,113,1,J Exp Med,HALBERT SP and AUERBACH T.

13783427,Host-parasite factors in group A streptococcal infections. Pyrogenic and other effects of immunologic distinct exotoxins related to scarlet fever toxins.,"The factors present in streptococcal lesion extracts (SLE) which enhanced the lethal and tissue-damaging properties of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins and streptolysin O were identified with the scarlet fever group of toxins. Toxic manifestations attributed to this group of toxins included lethality, cardiotoxic and other tissue damage, enhancement of toxicity, and pyrogenicity. Of these, the measurement of febrile response in American Dutch rabbits was the most useful parameter of toxicity. In rabbits, repeated daily intravenous injections of 0.125 Lf of a purified erythrogenic toxin immunizes specifically against the pyrogenic activity; this technique was used to type the toxins and to distinguish them from exogenous and endogenous pyrogens; non-specific pyrogens, such as streptococcal endotoxin, were not found in SLE. All types of the Lancefield Group A streptococci tested produced one or or more immunologically distinct toxins in vivo in contrast to Groups B and C which did not produce them; toxins A and B, previously distinguished by neutralization of rash-inducing activity in the skin, were produced in vivo. The A toxin was the most common, as indicated by its presence in extracts prepared with Types 28, 12, 17, and 10 (NY-5); B toxin was found in 10 (NY-5) and 19. A new toxin, designated C, was obtained from a Type 18. In American Dutch rabbits, purified toxin at a concentration of 15 Lf (900,000 STD) neither gave a Dick test nor prepared the skin for the local Shwartzman reaction; by this route, however, in contrast to classical endotoxins, they enhance the lethal and tissue-damaging properties of sublethal doses of these and other toxins. These properties of the immunologic distinct exotoxins as demonstrated in American Dutch rabbits suggest by analogy their importance in the pathogenesis of streptococcal disease in man. Evidence that might implicate them in sequelae, in addition to scarlet fever, is discussed.",['WATSON DW'],1960,111,2,J Exp Med,WATSON DW. Host-parasite factors in group A streptococcal infections.

The titer of these antibodies rises between the first half-week and the 3rd week of scarlet fever, in more than 80 per cent of the cases. The titers then remain elevated for at least 4 months. In children, 91 per cent of the normal sera examined showed anti-CP titers up to 32; 87 per cent of sera in active rheumatic disease had titers above this level. Corresponding data with S fell in the same range of percentage distribution. Anti-CP and anti-S titers remained elevated long after the rheumatic process had reached quiescence.

19871154,A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF THE SCARLET FEVER TOXIN-ANTITOXIN FLOCCULATION REACTION.,1. Highly purified scarlet fever toxin has been prepared from culture filtrates of two scarlatinal strains (NY5 and 594B) of hemolytic streptococcus grown on a medium of defined composition. 2. The flocculation reaction of Rane and Wyman has been studied quantitatively and has been shown specific for scarlet fever toxin and antitoxin. 3. Scarlet fever toxin from strains NY5 and 594B are quantitatively identical in their immunological behavior. 4. Pure scarlet fever toxin contains 0.00023 mg. nitrogen per flocculating unit and close to 1.3 x 10(8) skin test doses per mg. nitrogen as calculated from the immunological data. Both the immunological and the analytical data suggest that scarlet fever toxin is a protein. Similar calculations indicate that scarlet fever antitoxin contains 0.00093 mg. nitrogen per unit. 5. The scarlet fever toxin-antitoxin complex is readily dissociated in dilute solutions. In this respect the scarlet fever toxin-antitoxin system contrasts sharply with the diphtheria toxin-antitoxin system. 6. The scarlet fever toxin-antitoxin reaction is discussed in relation to other flocculation reactions.,"['Hottle GA', 'Pappenheimer AM']",1941,74,6,J Exp Med,Hottle GA and Pappenheimer AM.

19870089,STUDIES ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF STREPTOCOCCUS HEMOLYTICUS TO THE RHEUMATIC PROCESS : I. OBSERVATIONS ON THE ECOLOGY OF HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCUS IN RELATION TO THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF RHEUMATIC FEVER.,"Certain factors of climate are favorable to streptococcus respiratory diseases. In those tropical environments where hemolytic streptococcus is unusual in the throat flora, scarlet fever is unknown and rheumatic fever rare. In New York City, however, following epidemic waves of pharyngitis with hemolytic streptococcus the incidence of rheumatic fever rises precipitously. The correlation between the geographical distribution of hemolytic streptococcus and rheumatic fever is a definite one. Furthermore, in New York City during the seasons of the year in which hemolytic streptococcus is seldom recovered from the pharynx, acute attacks of rheumatism are unusual. Corresponding to the seasonal rise in hemolytic streptococcus infections, the curve of incidence of acute rheumatism shows a similar form. Among the children of wealthy patients, enjoying great protection, hemolytic streptococcus has been recovered infrequently from the throat, and rheumatism has not been encountered during this study. Among the poor under observation in New York City, however, the organism is found frequently in the pharyngeal flora, and rheumatic fever is common. The findings suggest that poverty and unhygienic living conditions favor both the activity of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat and the incidence of rheumatic fever. Moreover, localized outbreaks of rheumatism have been observed frequently following epidemics of ""sore throat"". Bacteriological studies of these upper respiratory infections demonstrate a close relationship between the advent of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat flora and the outbreak of rheumatic fever in susceptible individuals. In addition to these studies of streptococcus infections and their relationship to the development of rheumatic fever, observations of the rheumatic patient add further emphasis to this association. First, among a group of rheumatic children in an isolated environment, reactivation of the rheumatic process has been recognized only following the advent of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat flora. Also, an investigation of families in which several members have rheumatic heart disease has led to the same conclusion. Recrudescences of the disease have been observed under a variety of conditions among these individuals. However, the one constant factor in the outbreaks of recrudescences in rheumatic homes is their association with family epidemics of hemolytic streptococcus infection. Moreover, by studying rheumatic patients before, during and after transplantation to a tropical environment, it has been possible to demonstrate a close relationship between activity of the disease process and infection with hemolytic streptococcus. While the rheumatic patients remained in the tropics this organism was not recovered from the pharyngeal flora, and the disease process seemed quiescent. On return to New York City, those individuals who have escaped respiratory infection have remained symptom-free. However, of those who have contracted hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis, each has developed a rheumatic attack within 3 weeks after infection. Finally, extensive bacteriological studies made in ambulatory rheumatic subjects over a period of 4 years have demonstrated that the individuals who escape respiratory disease remain free of rheumatic manifestations. On the other hand, the majority of rheumatic patients who contract hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis experience shortly afterward a definite recrudescence of their disease. In conclusion, there is a close relationship between respiratory infection with hemolytic streptococcus and activity of the rheumatic process in susceptible individuals.","['Coburn AF', 'Pauli RH']",1932,56,5,J Exp Med,Coburn AF and Pauli RH.

19869694,THE BACTERIAL GROWTH INHIBITOR (LACTENIN) OF MILK : I. THE PREPARATION IN CONCENTRATED FORM.,"The bacterial growth inhibitory substance found in milk is called lactenin in this paper. It is stable for 1(1/2) hours at pH 4 and at pH 10 and for longer periods in neutral solution. It is not associated with salts and carbohydrates and may be separated from them by dialysis. Lactenin is removed by agents which precipitate the proteins of whey. Part of these proteins may be hydrolyzed by tryptic digestion and the resulting split products, together with the salts and sugar, may then be removed by dialysis without appreciable loss of lactenic activity. This dialysis may be performed in a concentrating dialyzer, under sterile conditions and at low temperature, thus reducing the solution to small volume. The material may then be completely desiccated and kept 3 months with practically no loss of activity. The residue, on treating this dried material with salt solution, is 200 times as active as the original milk, on a dry weight basis. The size of hemolytic zones of the scarlet fever streptococcus grown on a medium containing lactenin is found to furnish a simple and reliable measure of lactenic activity.","['Jones FS', 'Simms HS']",1930,51,2,J Exp Med,Jones FS and Simms HS.

19987071,Puerperal Fever and Pyrexias.,"A classification is made of 219 cases notified as puerperal fever or puerperal pyrexia. Of these, 71 were local uterine infections; 47, pelvic or general peritonitis; 11, pelvic cellulitis; 20, septicaemia or pyaemia; 12, pyelitis, and 58, febrile conditions not due to infection of the genital tract. Fatal cases were all due to general peritonitis or blood infections and the general death-rate for infections of the genital tract is 21.4 per cent. Of 32 maternal deaths, 7 followed abortion; 11 occurred in primiparae, the preponderance of whom showed more or less severe trauma, and 13 in multiparae in whom trauma was absent in the great majority. Similar antecedent circumstances were found in recovered cases of puerperal infection; from these figures an attempt is made to assess the importance of trauma in the production of sepsis. Two cases of puerperal scarlet fever are described and the transmission of infection in puerperal sepsis is discussed. A study has been made of sensitiveness to the haemolytic streptococcal toxin in 103 cases of puerperal sepsis and the results do not bear out the suggestion that infection by the streptococcus in the puerperium is correlated with toxin sensitiveness.",['Joe A'],1929,22,9,Proc R Soc Med,Joe A.

19869566,STUDIES ON BACILLUS TYPHOSUS TOXIC SUBSTANCES : II. THE EFFECT OF SERA UPON THE FACTORS DETERMINING LOCAL SKIN REACTIVITY TO FILTRATES OF BACILLUS TYPHOSUS CULTURES.,"It is shown in this paper that homologous immune sera are able to neutralize the B. typhosus skin-preparatory factors. The neutralization experiments were performed on a large number of rabbits, at least ten rabbits which showed positive control reactions being used for the titration of each serum. The rabbits into which the mixtures of B. typhosus culture filtrates with immune sera were injected can be divided into the following categories: those showing complete neutralization in highest dilutions (HN), those showing complete neutralization only in lower dilutions (LN) and those showing no neutralization (NN). The results indicate that the potency of a given serum as measured by the method outlined above has a direct relation to the reactions obtained in these groups of rabbits. For practical purposes the highest dilution of the serum which gives complete neutralization of the B. typhosus skin-preparatory factors (HN titer) may be taken as the actual titer of the serum as expressed in terms of their neutralization. The occurrence of a phenomenon suggestive of the prozone reaction is demonstrated. It also appears that the filtrates possess an antigenicity equal to that of dead and live bacteria. The studies on normal sera bring out the fact that normal sera fail to neutralize the B. typhosus skin-preparatory factors unless agglutinins can be demonstrated for B. typhosus. No normal sera have thus far been obtained which neutralized the skin-preparatory factors yet contained no B. typhosus agglutinins, but there were sera which contained these agglutinins but failed to neutralize the skin-preparatory factors. Some of the normal animals whose sera failed to neutralize the skin-preparatory factors were subsequently injected with B. typhosus culture filtrate and responded with neutralizing sera of high titer. Several heterologous sera were also investigated namely, scarlet fever, erysipelas, Shiga bacillus, Flexner bacillus, Mt. Desert bacillus, P. coli and B. avicida. These did not neutralize the B. typhosus skin-preparatory factors. Paratyphosus A and B sera on the other hand produced neutralization in various proportions. And the rabbits into which the serum-filtrate mixtures were injected could also be divided according to the results obtained into the same three groups as those with B. typhosus sera. It is not known yet whether this neutralization is a group reaction or whether the skin-preparatory factors are identical with those of B. typhosus. It would appear from these studies that a method is available for the quantitative titration of substances in the serum which neutralize the skin-preparatory factors of local skin reactivity to B. typhosus culture filtrates. It should be emphasized that it is possible to control the individual susceptibility of rabbits to this phenomenon. The method should permit of considerable accuracy in the quantitative titration of the neutralizing properties of a serum when a standardized procedure is developed. Experiments are under way to determine whether the method can be applied to the preparation of therapeutic sera. Work is also in progress to determine the effect of specific antisera upon B. typhosus skin-reacting factors introduced by the intravenous route.",['Shwartzman G'],1929,49,4,J Exp Med,Shwartzman G.

19869458,UDDER INFECTION WITH STREPTOCOCCI OF THE SCARLET FEVER TYPE : III. THE INFLUENCE OF MILK ON THE GROWTH OF SCARLET FEVER STREPTOCOCCI.,"The experiments indicate that milk filtered through a Berkefeld candle V or heated at 58 degrees C. for 20 minutes when added to blood agar plate cultures interferes with the development of colonies of the scarlet fever streptococcus. The observed inhibition is proportional to the amount of milk. When the approximate milk dilution in the Petri dish is 1:20 or 1:25 growth of the organisms is completely suppressed or only a small proportion of non-hemolytic colonies develop. As the amount of milk is decreased the colonies become larger and their hemolytic zones more pronounced, although even when the final dilution of milk reaches 1:100 or 1:125 only colonies easily mistaken for the narrow zoned bovine streptococci appear. The effects upon the surviving organisms would appear to be transient since both the non-hemolytic colonies and those with small zones manifest the original hemolytic properties when transferred to other media. When scarlet fever streptococci are added in small quantities to milk heated at 58 degrees C. for 20 minutes and incubated growth is inhibited. If the period is prolonged the streptococci are killed. On refrigeration of such mixtures some of the streptoccci are killed but others survive the test period.",['Jones FS'],1928,47,6,J Exp Med,Jones FS.

One of the cows was found in a herd supplying raw milk to a small town where a milkborne outbreak of scarlet fever had occurred a short time before. When small numbers of the streptococcus obtained from this case were injected into the udder of a normal cow severe mastitis accompanied by a well marked general reaction resulted. Evidence leads to the conclusion that a severe attack of mastitis due to this organism in one quarter does not sufficiently immunize the other quarters to protect them completely since the streptococcus can be readily implanted in them.

19869298,BACTERIUM LEPISEPTICUM INFECTION : ITS MODE OF SPREAD AND CONTROL.,"In this paper we have attempted to describe the manner of spread of an endemic, native, respiratory infection and a method for its control. The essential factor determining the prevalence of such an endemic disease is, we believe, host susceptibility, which is controlled by hereditary and environmental influences. Furthermore, it seems probable that the amount of this population susceptibility determines the dosage of specific microbes available to the population. An increase in dosage in the herd is followed by an increase in the spread and severity of the infection, and a decrease by a corresponding alleviation. Hence, two methods for the prevention of epidemics are available: (1) an enhancement of population resistance, and (2) the reduction to a minimum of available dosage. These procedures have proved successful for 3 years in maintaining a population of breeding rabbits, in the midst of a badly infected community, entirely free from Bact. lepisepticum infection. Confirmation of the above conclusions has been gained from other studies in the field of experimental epidemiology. Dr. D. T. Smith (2), at Saranac, New York, found that changes in population susceptibility were responsible for a severe outbreak of Bact. lepisepticum infection and septicemia. Freund (3), at Berlin, has just published an interesting account of respiratory epidemics of rabbits and guinea pigs, apparently brought about by sudden changes in temperature and housing conditions. Pneumonia and Pasteurella infection, endemic in the population, increased suddenly in extent and severity. Nevertheless, neither endemic nor epidemic strains of the microorganisms were found to be especially virulent. Dr. Theobald Smith (4), in a study of paratyphoid epidemics of guinea pigs, has made similar observations. He noted that pregnant females acted as the foci of infection, and that from these individuals, presumably of lessened resistance, the bacteria were given off and infection was spread. The studies in experimental epidemiology are rapidly reaching a stage where they may be applied to the problems of human disease. Indeed, more recent observations of the mode of spread of pneumonia (5-7), scarlet fever (8), typhoid (9, 10), plague (11), diphtheria (12-14), measles (15), and tuberculosis (16-18) increasingly show a tendency to discard the theory of fluctuating microbic virulence and to emphasize the importance of the host factors.","['Webster LT', 'Burn C']",1927,45,5,J Exp Med,Webster LT and Burn C.

19869130,STUDIES ON THE BIOLOGY OF STREPTOCOCCUS : V. ANTIGENIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STRAINS OF STREPTOCOCCUS FROM SCARLET FEVER AND ERYSIPELAS.,"1. Strains of hemolytic streptococci isolated from cases of erysipelas agglutinate in a high percentage of instances with erysipelas immune sera. When agglutination occurs with one serum, the strain usually agglutinates with all other erysipelas sera. 2. Erysipelas immune sera agglutinate strains from erysipelas in a higher percentage of instances than they agglutinate scarlatinal strains. 3. Strains from miscellaneous pyogenic infections may agglutinate in these sera, but the percentage of positive reactions is low and a strain usually agglutinates in but one or two of several sera. 4. Erysipelas strains which agglutinate in immune sera are not necessarily identical, although identical strains may occur. Similarly, identical strains may occur among scarlatinal strains agglutinated by scarlatinal immune sera. 5. Erysipelas strains form a closely related group of hemolytic streptococci. Scarlatinal strains form an equally compact group. The two groups are related antigenically but less closely related than the strains within the groups. These groups are related to pyogenic strains, but less closely than they are related to each other. 6. Erysipelas, scarlatinal, or pyogenic strains which agglutinate in erysipelas or scarlatinal sera are capable of absorbing the agglutinin for all other strains except the homologous strain and strains identical with it. Strains identical with the homologous strain absorb the agglutinin completely. 7. Erysipelas or scarlatinal strains may absorb the common group agglutinin from their respective sera, when they are incapable of agglutination in these sera. 8. The agglutinogen is probably of complex or composite nature, with characteristic variations in the scarlet fever and erysipelas groups.","['Stevens FA', 'Dochez AR']",1926,43,3,J Exp Med,Stevens FA and Dochez AR.

19868926,OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRESENCE OF A TOXIC SUBSTANCE IN THE BLOOD AND URINE OF PATIENTS WITH SCARLET FEVER.,"A series of observations on the blood of patients acutely ill with scarlet fever has shown that a toxic substance can be demonstrated in the serum by means of intracutaneous injections of the serum in persons who have not had scarlet fever and whose serums fail to blanch the rash in scarlet fever. The reaction caused by this substance consists of a bright red local erythema, varying from 20 to 70 mm. in diameter, of 1 to 4 days duration. The severer reactions are moderately indurated and tender, and are followed bypigmentation and desquamation. Control injections in persons whose serums blanch the rash in scarlet fever cause no reaction. The toxic substance is not neutralized by mixture with a human serum which gives a negative blanching test but is readily neutralized by a human serum which gives a positive blanching test. It is not neutralized by normal horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum. In a limited number of observations on the urine of patients with scarlet fever a similar toxic substance has been found in two out of five cases studied. Since the toxic substance described appears to resemble the toxic substance found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus haemolyticus capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease.","['Trask JD', 'Blake FG']",1924,40,3,J Exp Med,Trask JD and Blake FG.

Strains of hemolytic streptococci from cases of scarlet fever occurring in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore, and Copenhagen, Denmark, all interagglutinate with immune sera prepared with these strains. 2. Sera prepared with these strains do not agglutinate pyogenic streptococci or strains isolated from cases of septic sore throat. 3. The strains obtained from the throats of patients from an epidemic of scarlet fever and the strain from the milk responsible for this epidemic fall into the scarlatinal group according to these agglutination tests. 4. Absorption tests can be carried out with these strains and sera under proper conditions. 5. A group of hemolytic streptococci biologically distinct from streptococci from other sources than scarlet fever is constantly associated with scarlatina.

Hemolytic streptococcus has been found in 100 per cent of the throats of patients with scarlet fever during the 1st week of the disease. 2. The average length of time that these organisms are present in the throat varies from 10 to 20 days. 3. No morphological or cultural characteristics peculiar to the hemolytic streptococcus from scarlet fever can be demonstrated. 4. Ten immune sera have been prepared from different strains of scarlet fever streptococci and each of the sera agglutinated more than 80 per cent of the strains isolated from scarlatinal throats. On the other hand, scarlatinal streptococci are not agglutinated by immune sera prepared from hemolytic streptococci isolated from other pathological sources. 5. Serum from patients convalescent from scarlet fever agglutinates weakly or not at all the homologous strain of hemolytic streptococcus. 6. The specificity of the agglutination reaction of scarlatinal streptococci is confirmed by absorption experiments. 7. Scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum affords some degree of protection against virulent scarlet fever streptococci but has no protective power against hemolytic streptococci from other diseases. 8. In a small epidemic of scarlet fever a healthy carrier of hemolytic streptococcus was detected; the organism carried was identical in its serological reactions with strains of hemolytic streptococci isolated from active cases of scarlet fever. 9.

AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS BY REPEATED INJECTIONS OF BACTERIA.,"Repeated injections into the blood stream of streptococci and stapnylococci derived from cases of scarlet fever, and of Bacillus coli communior failed to produce typical glomerulonephritis even when immune antibodies could be demonstrated in the serum in high dilutions. Bacteriolysis of streptococci was not found by the usual tests in intro or by the Pfeiffer procedure. It is therefore concluded that the weight of evidence is against the theory that glomerulonephritis is due to immune bacteriolysis of streptococci. The experiments also failed to give any support to the hypothesis of allergy or. of sensitization as a factor in the production of the disease. Evidence is presented to show that bacterial emboli are rapidly removed from the glomerular capillaries by leukocytes, and that this embolism, even after injections of enormous quantities of bacteria, affects but a small proportion of the glomeruli. It is again suggested that a circulating poison in the soluble state is responsible directly for the disease in question.","['Faber HK', 'Murray V']",1917,26,5,J Exp Med,Faber HK and Murray V.

19867663,EXPERIMENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF SCARLET FEVER TO THE LOWER MONKEYS.,"1. The reported successful transfer of scarlet fever to both higher and lower monkeys is not definitely established. 2. In the course of the experiments here reported, the infectious agent can be assumed to have been carried over to the monkeys. The failure to cause infection probably proceeds from the insusceptibility of the monkeys employed, or to the manner of introducing the agent. 3. The temperature curve and leucocyte count of monkeys are unsatisfactory criteria for the diagnosis of disease in those animals. 4. Monkeys frequently have transient blotchy, erythematous eruptions on the face and neck, and almost always a bran-like desquamation. 5. Monkeys are highly resistant to infection with microorganisms from human beings.","['Draper G', 'Hanford JM']",1913,17,5,J Exp Med,Draper G and Hanford JM.

19867474,ON THE COMPOSITION OF URINARY ALBUMIN.,"A few findings which seem to be of importance may be pointed out:- Table I shows the analytical figures of serum-albumin, serum-globulin, and fibrin of the normal dog. The main difference between albumin and globulin appears in the relation of the precipitable to the non-precipitable total nitrogen and amino-nitrogen. Precipitable total nitrogen as well as amino-nitrogen is considerably larger in the albumin than in the globulin. In the cases of uranium nitrate nephritis (table II), the important figures approximate very closely those of normal serum-albumin. The samples from dog 3, that had been poisoned at the same time with phosphorous oil and uranium nitrate, show relatively large variations as compared with the figures from specimens from the other dogs, chiefly as regards the amino-nitrogen distribution: i. e., in dog 3, (1) the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation is higher; (2) the percentage of precipitable amino-nitrogen is larger; and (3) the ratio of precipitable amino-nitrogen to precipitable total nitrogen exceeds that of the other cases. All these changes, together with the fact that the total precipitable nitrogen did not undergo any quantitative variation, suggest that in the case of dog 3 the analyzed material contained a higher amount of lysin or cystin. It may further be mentioned that the analytical figures in this case differ also from those of the normal serum-albumin and still more from those of the serum-globulin. These changes, however, were not found in the case of dog 4, although this animal was treated in the same manner as the preceding dog. In the cases of nephritis in man (table III), striking differences were met with in the case of acute scarlet fever nephritis (No. 1a) and in the case (No. 2) of a patient with chronic nephritis and Pott's disease. This patient died a few weeks after the specimen for analysis was collected. The autopsy showed a general amyloidosis. The variations in both cases consist in a lowering of the ratio of amino-nitrogen to total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation, and corresponding to this, a fall of the same ratio in the filterable nitrogen. Such a change points to a relatively larger amount of prolin and oxyprolin or tryptophan in these cases. As a whole, one may conclude that Van Slyke's method, carefully applied and sufficiently controlled, may also be used for the study of urinary albumin. The results already obtained indicate that definite differences in the composition of urinary ""albumin"" may be detected. As yet it is premature to establish a definite relationship between the chemical composition of the ""albumin"" and the clinical or pathological conditions under which it appears, but it seems hopeful that further work may lead to the finding of such a relationship.",['Medigreceanu F'],1911,14,3,J Exp Med,Medigreceanu F.

19867467,COMPLEMENT DEVIATION IN SCARLET FEVER WITH COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF THE WASSERMANN AND NOGUCHI SYSTEMS.,"The Wassermann reaction in scarlet fever per se is uniformly negative. The antigen of scarlet fever liver yields practically the same results as that of luetic liver, and both fail to deviate complement with scarlet fever antibodies. The Noguchi reaction in scarlet fever is practically negative. Sixteen cases, or 6.4 per cent. of 250 cases, were positive when active serum was used; with inactivated serum, but eleven, or 4.4 per cent., remained positive. Five of these eleven cases were also positive with the Wassermann system. In other words, sixteen cases, or 6.4 per cent., were positive according to the Noguchi system with active or inactivated serum or both, whereas with the Wassermann system only 2 per cent. were positive. The presence of anti-sheep hemolysin normally in human serum is one of the main disturbing factors in the Wassermann system; for this reason, complement and hemolysin (made by immunization of rabbits) require careful titration. A positive Wassermann reaction usually indicates the presence of syphilitic antibodies, and a negative Noguchi reaction, their absence, and both systems should be used in the examination of all cases.",['Kolmer JA'],1911,14,3,J Exp Med,Kolmer JA.

19867003,ON THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN BODIES IN THE SKIN AND BLISTER FLUID FROM SCARLET-FEVER AND MEASLES.,"In sections of control and normal skin, the nuclei of the epithelial cells were often indented by the cell protoplasm, giving them an appearance similar to those indented by Mallory's bodies. It would seem that if these bodies of Mallory's were protozoa they would have been found in the sections from both the living and the dead skin of scarlet-fever and measles, as they were present in the blister fluid. Their absence is certainly more suggestive of a degeneration than of a protozoon. This view is also borne out by the fact that they were not found immediately after death, but were present in another specimen from the same case removed twenty-four hours later. It would seem probable also that the bodies found in the blister fluid were the products of degeneration and cytolytic activity, because they were found in the antitoxin rashes as well as in the cases of scarlet-fever and measles. The histological changes in the skin of these two diseases leads us to expect the presence of cytolytic products both in the blister fluid and in the sections. It certainly cannot be stated that none of these bodies is a protozoön, but it can be positively stated that a great majority of them arise from degenerating cells; and in many cases, I think, it is not possible to differentiate a degeneration from a protozoön by the study of its morphology and staining reactions. The bodies present in blister fluid resemble very closely those granular bodies found in blood under certain conditions, and seen in vaccine lymph and in emulsions of tissues and in exudates. I think, therefore, that they are for the most part, if not wholly, products of degenerating tissue cells and of leucocytes, and within certain limits specific to scarlet-fever and measles.",['Field CW'],1905,7,4,J Exp Med,Field CW.

19866889,ACUTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS.,"Acute interstitial nephritis is found in the infectious diseases of children, particularly in diphtheria and scarlet fever, but may be met with in other infectious diseases. The disease is characterized by general and focal infiltration of the interstitial tissue of the kidney with cells which correspond to those which Unna has described under the name of plasma cells. The focal character of the infiltration is marked; even in the cases in which all parts of the kidney show some interstitial cellular infiltration the cells are most abundant in certain foci. These foci are found in three places: in the boundary zone of the pyramids, in the sub-capsular region of the cortex, and around the glomeruli. A considerable number of cases is found in which the blood-vessels of the boundary zone of the pyramids contain nnmbers of lymphoid and plasma cells without any infiltration of the interstitial tissue. The new cells in the interstitial tissue are due to emigration from the blood-vessels and multiplication by mitotic division of the cells which have emigrated. The cells can emigrate as plasma. cells or as lymphoid cells, and the latter may change into plasma cells in the tissues. In the normal individual, plasma cells may be formed in the mucous membrane of the intestine, where they practically form the entire tissue between the epithelium and the muscularis mucosa, and to a limited extent in the spleen. In diphtheria, in scarlet fever, and probably in a number of infectious diseases, plasma cells are formed in great numbers in the spleen and bone-marrow, and to some extent in the lymphatic glands. In the spleen they are formed from the cells of the Malpighian bodies, which are often principally composed of them, and to some extent from the cells in the pulp. They are formed from the lymphoid cells. No adequate explanation is found for the focal character of the lesions in the kidneys. There is some ground for believing that the physical conditions of the circulation may have something to do with their accumulation in the vessels in certain places. It is also possible that in the interstitial foci there may be soluble substances which exert a positive chemotaxis for them. Such substances may be foundin the urine, which may exert its influence on the interstitial tissue in different places. The explanation of the foci cannot be found in primary focal degeneration of the epithelium. Epithclial degeneration in these cases is always present, but it is diffuse. In foci where it is more intense and due to the interstitial changes, polynuclear leucocytes are found in the tissue, in the degenerated epithellum and in the tubules. Folynuclear lencocytes and not plasma cells are attracted by degenerated tissue. The foci are not due in these cases to the local action of bacteria. In a number of the cases in which interstitial nephritis was found the kidneys were shown to be sterile both by cultures and by microscopical examination. In cases where bacteria were present they were found only in small numbers in cultures and not on microscopical examination, and their connection with the foci could not be demonstrated. In three cases plasma cells were found in the interstitial tissue in definite bacterial diseases of the kidney. In these cases they were not found in connection with the lesions produced directly by the bacteria, but in the periphery of the purulent foci.",['Councilman WT'],1898,3,4-5,J Exp Med,Councilman WT.
