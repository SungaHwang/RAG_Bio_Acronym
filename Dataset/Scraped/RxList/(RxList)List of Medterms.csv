Medterms,Definitions
A (adenine),"A (adenine): In genetics, A stands for adenine, one member of the A-T (adenine-thymine) base pair in DNA. The other base pair in DNA is G-C (guanine-cytosine). Each base pair forms a ""rung of the DNA ladder."" A DNA nucleotide is made of a molecule of sugar, a molecule of phosphoric acid, and a molecule called a base. The bases are the ""letters"" that spell out the genetic code. In DNA, the code letters are A, T, G, and C, which stand for the chemicals adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, respectively. In DNA base pairing, adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. Adenine is also one of the bases in RNA. There it always pairs with uracil (U). The base pairs in RNA are therefore A-U and G-C."
A-,"A-: Prefix indicating the absence or depletion of something: for example, aphagia (not eating) or aphonia (voiceless). The related prefix an- is usually used before a vowel, as in anemia (without blood) and anoxia (without oxygen)."
A-T,A-T: Ataxia-telangiectasia.
a.c.,"a.c.: Abbreviation on a prescription meaning before meals; from the Latin ""ante cibum"", before meals. This is one of a number of abbreviations of Latin terms that have traditionally been used in writing prescriptions."

Aarskog-Scott syndrome,"Aarskog-Scott syndrome: A syndrome of wide spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), front-facing (anteverted) nostrils, a broad upper lip, a malformed (""saddle-bag"") scrotum, and laxity of the ligaments resulting in bending back of the knees (genu recurvatum), flat feet, and overly extensible fingers. There are X-linked and autosomal forms of the disease. The gene for the X-linked form has been mapped to chromosome band Xp11.21 and identified as the FGD1 gene. The disease is named for DJ Aarskog (1928-) and CI Scott, Jr. (1934-), Norwegian and American pediatricians, who described it in 1970 and 1971. It is also known as Aarskog syndrome, faciodigitogenital dysplasia, and faciogenital dysplasia."
Aase-Smith syndrome I,"Aase-Smith syndrome I: A syndrome of congenital malformations (birth defects) characterized by hydrocephalus, cleft palate, and severe arthrogryposis (joint contractures). Other anomalies may include deformed ears, ptosis (drooping) of the eyelids, inability to open the mouth fully, heart defects, and clubfoot. The fingers are thin with absent knuckles, reduced creases over the joints and inability to make a full fist. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, transmitted from generation to generation, affecting both males and females. It is named for the American dysmorphologists (birth-defect experts) Jon Aase and David W. Smith."
Aase-Smith syndrome II,"Aase-Smith syndrome II: A genetic disorder that may be detected during early infancy and is characterized by the presence of three bones (phalanges) within the thumbs (triphalangeal thumbs) rather than the normal two and abnormally reduced production of red blood cells (hypoplastic anemia). The exact cause of the syndrome is unknown. However, most evidence suggests that the disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The syndrome is named for the American dysmorphologists (birth-defect experts) Jon Aase and David W. Smith. Alternative names for the syndrome include: Anemia and triphalangeal thumbs. Congenital anemia and triphalangeal thumbs. Hypoplastic anemia-triphalangeal thumbs, Aase-Smith type."
Ab-,"Ab-: Prefix indicating from, away from, or off, as in abduction (movement of a limb away from the midline of the body) and abnormal (away from normal)."
Abate,"Abate: To lessen or decrease. For example, after a boil is lanced, the pus can drain and the pain and tenderness abate. From the French abbatre, to beat down."
Abatement,"Abatement: A diminution, decrease or easing. In medicine there may be abatement of pain or any other symptom or sign. In the environment there may abatement in the degree of pollution. See also: Abate."
Abdomen,"Abdomen: The belly, that part of the body that contains all of the structures between the chest and the pelvis. The abdomen is separated anatomically from the chest by the diaphragm, the powerful muscle spanning the body cavity below the lungs. The abdomen includes a host of organs including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, appendix, gallbladder, and bladder. The word ""abdomen"" has a curious story behind it. It comes from the Latin ""abdodere"", to hide. The idea was that whatever was eaten was hidden in the abdomen."
"Abdomen, acute","Abdomen, acute: Medical shorthand for the acute onset of abdominal pain. A potential medical emergency, an acute abdomen may reflect a major problem with one of the organs in the abdomen, such as appendicitis (inflamed appendix), cholecystitis (inflamed gallbladder), a perforated ulcer in the intestine, or a ruptured spleen."
Abdominal,"Abdominal: Relating to the abdomen, the belly, that part of the body that contains all of the structures between the chest and the pelvis. The abdomen is separated anatomically from the chest by the diaphragm, the powerful muscle spanning the body cavity below the lungs. The abdomen includes a host of organs including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, appendix, gallbladder, and bladder. The word ""abdomen"" comes from the Latin ""abdodere"", to hide."
Abdominal aorta,"Abdominal aorta: The abdominal aorta is the final section of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. It is a continuation of the thoracic aorta. It begins at the diaphragm, and runs down to the point where it ends (by splitting in two to form the common iliac arteries). The abdominal aorta supplies oxygenated blood to all of the abdominal and pelvic organs and the legs. Like the other sections of the aorta (the ascending aorta, aortic arch and thoracic aorta), the abdominal aorta is an arbitrary anatomic entity. The aorta is one continuous conduit that arises out of the left ventricle of the heart to carry blood to the body. Nonetheless, the abdominal aorta is a hallowed and convenient subdivision of the aorta. The abdominal aorta is also known in medical Latin as the aorta abdominalis or the pars abdominalis aortae (under which it is often hidden in standard print medical dictionaries)."
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm: A balloon-like swelling in the wall of the aorta within the abdomen. This swelling weakens the aorta's wall and, because of the great volume of blood flowing under high pressure in the aorta, it can rupture. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is monitored by ultrasound. Surgery is often recommended if the aneurysm is more than 5.5 centimeters (2.2 inches) in diameter or if a smaller aneurysm is enlarging with unusual rapidity."
Abdominal cavity,"Abdominal cavity: The cavity within the abdomen, the space between the abdominal wall and the spine. The abdominal cavity is hardly an empty space. It contains a number of crucial organs including the lower part of the esophagus, the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and bladder."
Abdominal guarding,"Abdominal guarding: Tensing of the abdominal wall muscles to guard inflamed organs within the abdomen from the pain of pressure upon them. Abdominal guarding is detected when the abdomen is pressed and is an indication that inflammation of the inner abdominal (peritoneal) surface may be present due, for example, to appendicitis or diverticulitis. The tensed muscles of the abdominal wall automatically go into spasm to keep the tender underlying tissues from being irritated."
Abdominal hysterectomy,"Abdominal hysterectomy: Surgical removal of the uterus (a hysterectomy) done through an incision made in the abdominal wall. This may also be done by laparoscopy. As opposed to a vaginal hysterectomy, in which the incision is made within the vagina."
Abdominal pain,"Abdominal pain: Pain in the belly. Abdominal pain can be acute or chronic. It may reflect a major problem with one of the organs in the abdomen, such as appendicitis or a perforated intestine, or it may result from a fairly minor problem, such as excess buildup of intestinal gas."
Abducent nerve,"Abducent nerve: The sixth cranial nerve, which emerges from the skull to operate the lateral rectus muscle. This muscle draws the eye toward the side of the head. Paralysis of the abducent nerve causes inward turning of the eye."
Abduction,Abduction: The movement of a limb away from the midline of the body. The opposite of abduction is adduction.
Abductor muscle,"Abductor muscle: Any muscle used to pull a body part away from the midline of the body. For example, the abductor muscles of the legs spread the legs away from the midline and away from one another. The word ""abductor"" comes from the Latin prefix ""ab-"" meaning ""away from"" + ""ducere"" meaning ""to draw or lead"" = ""to draw away from."" The prefix ""ab-"" is opposed to the prefix ""ad-"". Therefore, the opposite of ""abductor"" is ""adductor."" An abductor muscle opposes an adductor muscle."
Aberration,"Aberration: (1) A deviation or irregularity. For example, a chromosome aberration is a deviation from the normal chromosome number or the normal chromosome structure. In this sense, aberration is also synonymous with deflection, departure, divergence, diversion, turning. (2) A mental aberration is a significant deviation from normal mental activity. In this sense, aberration is synonymous with mental derangement, mental illness, psychopathy."
Abiotic,"Abiotic: 1. Not associated with living organisms. 2. Anything in the environment incapable of life, such as the soil or weather. 3. Incompatible with life or antagonist to it. Also called abiological."
Abiotrophy,"Abiotrophy: Loss of function, or degeneration for reasons unknown."
Ablate,"Ablate: To remove. A tumor may be ablated. To ablate the thyroid gland is to remove it. The word ""ablation"" came from the Latin ""ablatum"" meaning to carry away. "
Ablation,"Ablation: Removal or excision. Ablation is usually carried out surgically. For example, surgical removal of the thyroid gland (a total thyroidectomy) is ablation of the thyroid."
Abnormal,"Abnormal: Outside the expected norm, or uncharacteristic of a particular patient."
Abortifacient,Abortifacient: A medication or substance that causes pregnancy to end prematurely.
Abortion,"Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is a loss of pregnancy due to the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus due to any cause. An abortion may occur spontaneously (termed a miscarriage) or may be medically induced.  The miscarriage of three or more consecutive pregnancies is termed habitual abortion or recurrent pregnancy loss. 
 "
Abortive,"Abortive: Tending to cut short the course of a disease, as in abortive polio (polio cut short)."
Abortive polio,"Abortive polio: Abortive polio is a minor illness. It accounts for 80-90% of clinically apparent cases of polio infection, chiefly in young children. It does not involve the CNS. The usual symptoms are slight fever, malaise, headache, sore throat and vomiting which hit 3-5 days after exposure to the polio virus. Full recovery occurs in 24-72 hours. There are no permanent disabilities of any kind. Polio as a major illness is in contrast to abortive polio. Symptoms appear usually with no sign of a prior illness 7-14 days after exposure to the virus, particularly in older children and adults, and may include fever, severe headache, stiff neck and back, deep muscle pain, and sometimes areas of hyperesthesia (increased sensation) and paresthesia (altered sensation). There may be no further progression from this picture of viral meningitis (called ""aseptic"" meningitis) or there be loss of tendon reflexes and weakness or paralysis of muscle groups. Polio can thus take one of two main avenues: that of minor (""abortive"") illness or that of major illness. And polio as a major illness can then take one of two branching roads: that of aseptic meningitis without paralysis or that of paralytic polio. In abortive polio, recovery is complete. Recovery is also complete in polio with only aseptic meningitis. In paralytic polio, about 50% of patients recover with no residual paralysis, about 25% are left with mild disabilities, and the remaining patients have severe permanent disability. The word ""abortive"" here means ""tending to cut short"" so that abortive polio is polio cut short."
ABR test,ABR test: Auditory brainstem response test. An automated test for hearing and brain (neurological) functioning that is performed by applying wires to the skin around the ear. ABR may be used in the evaluation of: The ABR test involves attaching electrodes to the head to record electrical activity from the auditory nerve (the hearing nerve) and other parts of the brain. Also known as brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP).
Abrade,"Abrade: to wear away by friction or erosion. The term ""abrasion"" comes from the verb abrade and is used in medicine to refer to an injury characterized by scraping or wearing away of tissue, most often on the skin. Synonyms include excoriate, scrape, scratch, rub raw, and chafe."
Abrasion,"Abrasion: An abrasion or ""excoriation"" is a wearing away of the upper layer of skin as a result of applied friction force. In dentistry an ""abrasion"" is the wearing away of the tooth substance."
Abs,Abs: Slang term for the abdominal muscles.
Abscess,Abscess: A local accumulation of pus anywhere in the body. The following are some examples of abscesses:
Abscission,"Abscission: To remove tissue by cutting it away, as in surgery."
Abse,"Abse: See: Abse, Dannie."
the breast,"Absence of the breast: A rare condition wherein the normal growth of the breast or nipple never takes place and they are congenitally absent. Absence of the breast, also called amastia, is frequently not an isolated problem. Unilateral amastia (amastia just on one side) is often associated with absence of the pectoral muscles (the muscles of the front of the chest). Bilateral amastia (with absence of both breasts) is associated in 40% of cases with multiple congenital anomalies (birth defects) involving other parts of the body as well. Amastia can be distinguished from amazia -- wherein breast tissue is absent, but the nipple is present -- a condition that typically is a result of radiation or surgery."
the nipple,"Absence of the nipple: Medically called athelia, this is a rare condition that may occur with a number of hereditary diseases or chromosomal defects, such as Poland Syndrome, progeria (premature aging), ectodermal dysplasia, and Yunis-Varon syndrome. Athelia tends to occurs on one side (unilaterally) in children with the Poland sequence and on both sides (bilaterally) in certain types of ectodermal dysplasia. Athelia is distinguished from amastia, wherein the breast is absent, and from amazia, wherein breast tissue is absent but the nipple is still resent."
Absence seizure,"Absence seizure: A seizure that takes the form of a staring spell. The person suddenly seems to be ""absent."" An absence seizure involves a brief loss of awareness, which can be accompanied by blinking or mouth twitching. Absence seizures have a very characteristic appearance on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Also called a petit mal seizure."
Absent eye,"Absent eye: Also called anophthalmia, a congenital malformation (birth defect) of the globe. Anophthalmia refers, strictly speaking, to absence of the globe and ocular tissue from the orbit. However, in most cases of anophthalmia, CT scans show some remnants of the globe, indicating they represent severe microphthalmia (small eyes). Anophthalmia/microphthalmia may involve one or both eyes. It may occur in isolation with no associated malformations or it may be part of a multiple congenital malformation syndrome as, for example, the congenital rubella syndrome, the triploidy syndrome (due to the presence of 69 chromosomes), the trisomy 13 syndrome (Patau syndrome, due to an extra chromosome 13), and the Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome (which is due to deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 4). Anophthalmia comes from the Greek an-, absence + ophthalmos, eye + absence of the eye."
Absinthism,"Absinthism: The disorder associated with the habitual abuse of absinthe. The symptoms included hallucinations, sleeplessness, tremors, and convulsions. There has been debate over whether absinthism was due to absinthe or the alcohol contained therein. For more information, see: Absinthe."
Absolute neutrophil count,"Absolute neutrophil count: The real number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The absolute neutrophil count is commonly called the ANC. The ANC is not measured directly. It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3). Sample calculation of the ANC:
WBC count: 6,000 cells/mm3 of blood
Segs: 30% of the WBCs
Bands: 3% of the WBCs
Neutrophils (segs + bands): 33% of the WBCs
ANC: 33% X 6,000 = 2,000/mm3
ANC of 2,000/mm3, by convention = 2.0
Normal range: 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3)
Interpretation: Normal Neutrophils are key components in the system of defense against infection. An absence or scarcity of neutrophils (a condition called neutropenia) makes a person vulnerable to infection. After chemotherapy, radiation, or a blood or marrow transplant, the ANC is usually depressed and then slowly rises, reflecting the fact that the bone marrow is recovering and new blood cells are beginning to grow and mature. In practical clinical terms, a normal ANC is 1.5 or higher; a ""safe"" ANC is 500-1500; a low ANC is less than 500. A safe ANC means that the patient's activities do not need to be restricted (on the basis of the ANC)."
Absorb,"Absorb: 1. To take something in, as through the skin or the intestine.
2. To react with radiation and reduce it in intensity, as with a dose of radiation or transmitted light.
See also: Absorbed dose; Absorption; Malabsorption; Reabsorption."
Absorption,"Absorption: Uptake. For example, intestinal absorption is the uptake of food (or other substances) from the digestive tract."
Abstinence,"Abstinence: The voluntary self-denial of food, drink, or sex. Today, abstinence most commonly refers to denial of one's sexual activity."
AC joint,AC joint: Acromioclavicular joint located between the acromion (a projection of the scapula that forms the point of the shoulder) and the clavicle (the collar bone). This is a gliding type of joint. The ligaments that serve to support and strengthen this joint are called the capsular; superior and inferior acromioclavicular; articular disk; and coracoclavicular (trapezoid and conoid) ligaments.
Acanthamoeba,"Acanthamoeba: A microscopic organism, an amoeba, found in soil, dust and fresh water (lakes, rivers, hot springs and hot tubs). Acanthamoeba also occur in brackish water and sea water as well as in heating, venting, and air conditioner units, humidifiers, and dialysis units. Acanthamoeba can enter the skin through a cut, wound, or through the nostrils and, once inside the body, can travel to the lungs and through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Through improper storage, handling, and disinfection of contact lenses, Acanthamoeba can enter the eye and there cause infection. A particularly dire infection caused by Acanthamoeba called granulomatous amebic encephalitis is characterized by headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, and coma that can progress over several weeks and end in death. Acanthamoeba infections occur more frequently in people with compromised immune systems and the chronically ill. Eye and skin infections are generally treatable while infections of the brain are almost always fatal."
Acapnia,Acapnia: Lower than normal level of carbon dioxide in the blood. The opposite of acapnia is hypercapnia.
Acaricide,"Acaricide: An agent, usually a chemical, that kills mites. This class of pesticides is large and includes antibiotic acaricides, carbamate acaricides, formamidine acaricides, mite growth regulators, organophosphate acaricides, and many others. From the Latin acarus, a mite + -cide, to kill."
ACC,ACC: Adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Access,"Access: 1. In general, a means of approaching something. 2. In health care, the opportunity or right to receive health care. 3. In dialysis, the point on the body where a needle or catheter is inserted to gain entry to the bloodstream."
Accessory,"Accessory: Additional, extra, supplementary, subsidiary to the main thing. An accessory digestive organ is an organ that helps with digestion but is not part of the digestive tract. The accessory nerve is so-called because it receives an additional (accessory) root from the upper part of the spinal cord. An accessory placenta is an extra placenta separate from the main placenta."
Accessory digestive organ,"Accessory digestive organ: An organ that helps with digestion but is not part of the digestive tract. The accessory digestive organs are the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder."
Accessory dwelling unit,Accessory dwelling unit: (ADU) A separate housing arrangement within a single-family home. The ADU is defined by Medicare as a complete living unit and includes a private kitchen and bath.
Accessory placenta,Accessory placenta: A condition in which there is an extra placenta that is separate from the main placenta. Also known as a succenturiate or supernumerary placenta.
Accommodation,"Accommodation: In medicine, the ability of the eye to change its focus from distant to near objects (and vice versa). This process is achieved by the lens changing its shape. Accommodation is the adjustment of the optics of the eye to keep an object in focus on the retina as its distance from the eye varies. It is the process of adjusting the focal length of a lens."
Acellular,"Acellular: Not made up of cells or divided into cells. Or lacking intact cells as, for example, an acellular vaccine which may contain cellular material but not complete cells."
Acentric chromosome,"Acentric chromosome: A fragment of a chromosome (one of the microscopically visible carriers of the genetic material DNA) that is lacking a centromere (the ""waist"" of the chromosome essential for the division and the retention of the chromosome in the cell) and so is lost when the cell divides."
Acetabulum,"Acetabulum: The cup-shaped socket of the hip joint. The acetabulum is a feature of the pelvis. The head (upper end) of the femur (thighbone) fits into the acetabulum and articulates with it, forming a ball-and-socket joint."
Acetaminophen,"Acetaminophen: A nonaspirin pain reliever or analgesic. Acetaminophen may be given alone to relieve pain and inflammation or it may be combined with other drugs, as in some migraine medications, which contain acetaminophen, a barbiturate, and caffeine."
Acetate,Acetate: A molecular ion derived from acetic acid. The formula of acetate is CH3COO-.
Acetone,"Acetone: A volatile liquid used as an industrial solvent. Acetone is also one of the ketone bodies that is formed when the body uses fat instead of glucose (sugar) for energy. The formation of acetone is usually a sign that cells lack insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin that is available, as occurs in diabetes. Acetone is excreted from the body in the urine."
Acetylcholine,Acetylcholine: A neurotransmitter released by nerves that is essential for communication between the nerves and muscles.
Acetylcysteine,Acetylcysteine: An antioxidant drug used to reduce the thickness of mucus and ease its removal. It is also used to reverse the toxicity of high doses of acetaminophen. Acetylcysteine with hydration significantly reduces the risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Also called N-acetyl-L-cysteine.
ACh (acetylcholine),ACh (acetylcholine): Abbreviation for acetylcholine. See: Acetylcholine.
AChE (acetylcholinesterase),AChE (acetylcholinesterase): Abbreviation for acetylcholinesterase. See: Acetylcholinesterase.
Achilles tendon,"Achilles tendon: One of the longest tendons in the body, a tough sinew that attaches the calf muscle to the back of the heel bone (calcaneus). The name comes from Greek mythology: The hero Achilles was invulnerable to injury except for his heel, which proved his downfall when it was pierced by Paris's arrow. It has also proved, literally, to be the downfall of many athletes who have experienced the sudden pain of its rupture."
Achillobursitis,"Achillobursitis: Pain due to inflammation of the bursa associated with the Achilles tendon. . The Achilles tendon is one of the better known anatomic features in sports medicine due to the abrupt dramatic nature of some injuries to this tendon. It is in the back of the lower leg and connects the calf muscle (the triceps surae) with the calcaneus bone in the heel. This tendon is so named for the hero whose heel, according to Greek mythology, was the only part of his body where he could be hurt. Inflammation in the Achilles tendon and bursa is collectively known as achillodynia. "
Achoo syndrome,"Achoo syndrome: A disorder characterized by nearly uncontrollable paroxysms of sneezing provoked in a reflex fashion by the sudden exposure of a dark-adapted subject to intensely bright light, usually to brilliant sunlight. The number of successive sneezes is usually 2 or 3, but can be up to about 40. The Achoo syndrome is also called the photic sneeze reflex or the helio-ophthalmic outburst syndrome. The syndrome is much more common than has been generally recognized. In one study it was found in 23% of medical students. The syndrome is one of the most frequent of all known genetic traits. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, affecting males and females alike, who have a 50:50 chance of passing the Achoo gene to each of their children who will have the disorder. For those affected, being in tunnels and shadows created by tall buildings and forested terrain can induce sneezing upon re-entering the bright sunlight."
Acid indigestion,Acid indigestion: Excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach cells. Medically known as hyperchlorhydria. Sometimes used interchangeably with heartburn. See also: Heartburn.
Acid phosphatase,"Acid phosphatase: An enzyme that acts to liberate phosphate under acidic conditions and is made in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and prostate gland. Abnormally high serum levels of acid phosphatase may indicate infection, injury, or cancer of the prostate."
Acid-base balance,"Acid-base balance: Acid-base balance refers to the mechanisms the body uses to keep its fluids close to neutral pH (that is, neither basic nor acidic) so that the body can function normally."
Acidophilus,"Acidophilus: Bacteria found in yogurt that can help restore a supportive bacterial environment to an intestinal tract whose normal intestinal bacterial population (""flora"") has been disturbed by disease or antibiotics. Eating yogurt with acidophilus may also be useful in preventing candidiasis (thrush), including in the vagina."
Acidosis,"Acidosis: Too much acid in the body, a distinctly abnormal condition resulting from the accumulation of acid or from the depletion of alkaline reserves. In acidosis, the pH of the blood is abnormally low. Acidosis is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, lung disease, and severe kidney disease. The opposite of acidosis is alkalosis in which there is too high a pH due to excess base or insufficient acid in the body."
"Acinus, pulmonary","Acinus, pulmonary: The ending of a tiny airway in the lung, where the alveoli (air sacs) are located. In anatomy, an acinus is a round cluster of cells, usually epithelial cells, that looks somewhat like a knobby berry. The word ""acinus"" means ""berry"" in Latin. (The plural is ""acini"".) There are also acini, round clusters of epithelial cells, in the salivary glands and in the pancreas."
Acne,"Acne: Localized skin inflammation as a result of overactivity of the oil glands at the base of specialized hair follicles. Acne happens when oil (sebaceous) glands come to life around puberty, when these glands are stimulated by male hormones that are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls. The oil glands, which are located just beneath the skin, continuously produce and secrete oil through openings in the skin. The oil lubricates and protects the skin. Under certain circumstances, cells that are close to the openings of the oil glands block the openings. This causes a buildup of oil underneath the skin. Bacteria, which live in everyone's skin but generally mind their own business, feast on this oil, multiply, and cause the surrounding tissues to become inflamed if the follicle ruptures. If the inflammation is right near the surface, you get a pustule; if it's deeper, a papule (pimple); deeper still and it's a cyst. If the pore of the affected hair follicle is closed to the surface, the result is a "" whitehead."" If the pore is wide open, oil becomes oxidized (that is, acted on by oxygen in the air), the oil changes from white to black, and the result is a ""blackhead."" Acne is also referred to as pimples."
Acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris: The common form of acne, in teens and young adults, that is due to overactivity of the oil (sebaceous) glands in the skin that become plugged and inflamed. Acne typically develops when the oil glands come to life around puberty and are stimulated by male hormones that are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls. Treatments include keeping the skin clean and avoiding irritating soaps, foods, drinks, and cosmetics. Severe acne and acne in those who are prone to scarring can be treated with topical creams and oral medications. Skin damaged by acne can be improved with treatment by a dermatologist or facial technologist using dermabrasion (sanding), removal of scar tissue via laser, and chemical peels. Also known as pimples."
Acou-,"Acou-: Combining form relating to hearing. As in acoustic, otoacoustic emission test, and presbyacousia."
Acoustic,Acoustic: Having to do with sound or hearing. The acoustic nerve (the 8th cranial nerve) is concerned with hearing and the sense of balance and head position. An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor on the acoustic nerve.
Acquired,"Acquired: Not inherited, or present at birth (congenital), but developing after birth. For example, AIDS is an acquired, not an inherited, form of immune deficiency."
Acquired immunity,Acquired immunity: Immunity acquired by infection or vaccination (active immunity) or by the transfer of antibody or lymphocytes from an immune donor (passive immunity). Acquired immunity is in contrast to innate immunity (natural immunity).
Acrocentric chromosome,Acrocentric chromosome: A chromosome in which the centromere is located quite near one end of the chromosome. Humans normally have five pairs of acrocentric chromosomes. Down syndrome is caused by an extra acrocentric chromosome (chromosome21).
Acrochordon,"Acrochordon: A small tag of skin that may have a stalk (a peduncle). An acrochordon may appear on skin anywhere although the favorite locales are the eyelids, neck, armpits (axillae), upper chest, and groin. Invariably benign, this tiny tumor of the skin usually causes no symptoms unless repeatedly irritated as, for example, by the collar. Treatment may be done by freezing with liquid nitrogen or by cutting off with a scalpel or scissors if the acrochordon is irritating or cosmetically unwanted. The term ""acrochordon"" is from the Greek ""acro-"" (which means top, summit, extreme, or refers to an arm or leg) + ""chorde"", string. Medically, an acrochordon is also called a cutaneous papilloma. It is far better known as a skin tag."
Acrocyanosis,"Acrocyanosis: Blueness of the hands and feet, usually due to inadequate circulation."
Acrodynia,Acrodynia: Pain in the extremities (the hands and feet).
Acromegaly,"Acromegaly: Condition due to the production of too much growth hormone by the pituitary gland after the end of adolescence. When there is secretion of too much growth hormone before the end of adolescence, gigantism results. People with pituitary gigantism can truly be giants; they can sometimes end up over 7 or 8 feet in height. When too much growth hormone is secreted after adolescence, there cannot be an increase in height but acromegaly ensues. The cardinal manifestations of acromegaly include thickening of the skin, soft tissues, and bones of the hands and feet. These effects are insidious and very slowly progressive. Ultimately they cause considerable disability (aside from the need for larger rings, gloves, and shoes) including hoarseness, sleep apnea, joint pain, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, visual impairment and severe headaches. Excessive growth hormone secretion may be caused by an adenoma of the pituitary (a tumor of the pituitary) or by other causes. Treatment is usually possible via medication, surgery or radiation. Inadequate treatment of pituitary gigantism or acromegaly is associated with increases in deaths from cardiovascular causes, cancer, and other causes."
Acromion,"Acromion: The projection of the scapula (the shoulder blade) that forms the point of the shoulder. The acromion is part of the scapula. It protrudes laterally (away from the midline) and is triangular in shape. The top of the shoulder is acromial. The word ""acromion"" comes from the Greek ""akron"", peak + ""omos"", shoulder = the peak of the shoulder."
Acrophobia,"Acrophobia: An abnormally excessive and persistent fear of heights. Sufferers experience severe anxiety even though they usually realize that, as a rule, heights pose no real threat to them. Derived from the Greek ""acron"", height + ""phobos"", fear."
Actinic,Actinic: Referring to the ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight and UV lamps. Sunburn is an actinic burn. An actinic keratosis is a skin lesion that is the consequence of chronic sun exposure.
Actinic keratosis,"Actinic keratosis: Rough, scaly patches of skin that are considered precancerous and are due to sun exposure. Prevention is to cut sun exposure and wear sunscreen. Treatments include performing cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), cutting the keratoses away, burning them, putting 5-fluorouracil on them, and using photodynamic therapy (injecting into the bloodstream a chemical that collects in actinic keratoses and makes them more sensitive to destruction by a specialized form of light). Also known as solar keratosis and senile keratosis."
Acu-,Acu-: A combining form indicating a relationship to a needle. As in acupuncture. From the Latin acus meaning needle.
Acupressure,Acupressure: A traditional Chinese medicine bodywork technique based on the principles of acupuncture. Acupressure is the application of pressure rather than needles on specific points on the body to control symptoms such as pain or nausea.
Acute,"Acute: Of abrupt onset, in reference to a disease. Acute often also connotes an illness that is of short duration, rapidly progressive, and in need of urgent care. ""Acute"" is a measure of the time scale of a disease and is in contrast to ""subacute"" and ""chronic."" ""Subacute"" indicates longer duration or less rapid change. ""Chronic"" indicates indefinite duration or virtually no change. The time scale depends on the particular disease. For example, an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) may last a week, while an acute sore throat may only last a day or two."
Acute abdomen,"Acute abdomen: Medical shorthand for the acute onset of abdominal pain. A potential medical emergency, an acute abdomen may reflect a major problem with one of the organs in the abdomen, such as appendicitis (inflamed appendix), cholecystitis (inflamed gallbladder), a perforated ulcer in the intestine, or a ruptured spleen."
Acute bronchitis,"Acute bronchitis: inflammation of the breathing tubes within the lungs (bronchial tubes or bronchi) as a result of an infection (viral or bacterial) or a chemical irritant (such as smoke or gastric acid reflux). The inflammation causes swelling of the lining of these breathing tubes, narrowing the tubes and promoting secretion of inflammatory fluid. Most commonly, acute bronchitis is due to a viral infection. Common viruses that cause bronchitis include the rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the influenza virus. Symptoms are a cough that begins abruptly and can include a runny nose, nasal stuffiness, and sore throat. As opposed to acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition with a daily cough with sputum production for at least three months, two years in a row. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for the development of both acute and chronic bronchitis. See also chronic bronchitis."
Acute glomerulonephritis,"Acute glomerulonephritis: one of a group of kidney diseases characterized by the abrupt onset of inflammation and proliferation of the glomeruli, microscopic structures within the kidney that are responsible for filtering the blood and producing urine. Acute glomerulonephritis can result in long-term damage or may resolve, depending upon the cause and severity. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is the prototype condition of this group. This condition involves inflammation of the kidney that occurs following an infection with Streptococcus bacteria, such as strep throat. Other conditions that can cause acute glomerulonephritis include systemic lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's disease, and polyarteritis nodosa. Symptoms and signs of acute glomerulonephritis include The condition is often accompanied by hypertension, edema (swelling), and salt and water retention. Treatment is supportive and can sometimes include medications to remove excess fluid or control high blood pressure."
Acute idiopathic polyneuritis,"Acute idiopathic polyneuritis: Also known as the Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder characterized by progressive symmetrical paralysis and loss of reflexes, usually beginning in the leg, with in most cases nearly complete or complete recovery. The Guillain-Barre syndrome is not associated with fever. There is paralysis involving more than one limb, most commonly the legs, and that paralysis is progressive. There is areflexia (loss of reflexes) or hyporeflexia (diminution of reflexes) in the legs and arms. Other conditions that may mimic the Guillain-Barre syndrome need to be ruled out. The Guillain-Barre syndrome is due to an immune response that results in the direct destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the peripheral nerves or the axon of the nerve itself. The syndrome sometimes follow triggering events, including vaccinations. Among the vaccines reportedly associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome are the swine influenza vaccine (in 1976-1977), the oral poliovirus vaccine, and tetanus toxoid. Aside from vaccinations, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and viral infections can trigger the Guillain-Barre syndrome."
Acute illness,"Acute illness: A disease with an abrupt onset and, usually, a short course."
Acute mountain sickness (AMS),"Acute mountain sickness (AMS): Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the effect on the body of being in a high altitude environment. AMS is common at high altitudes, that is above 8,000 feet (2,440 meters). Three-quarters of people have mild symptoms of AMS over 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). The occurrence of AMS depends on the altitude, the rate of ascent, and individual susceptibility. Mild AMS: Many people experience mild AMS during the acclimatization process (the first 1 to 3 days at a given altitude). Symptoms usually start 12-24 hours after arrival at altitude and include headache, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, nausea, disturbed sleep, and a general feeling of malaise. These symptoms tend to be worse at night when respiratory drive is decreased. Mild AMS does not usually interfere with normal activity and symptoms generally subside within 2-4 days as the body acclimatizes. As long as symptoms are mild, and only a nuisance, ascent can continue at a moderate rate. When hiking, it is essential to communicate any symptoms of illness immediately to others on your trip. AMS is considered to be a neurological problem caused by changes in the central nervous system. It is basically a mild form of high altitude cerebral edema. Mild AMS is usually treated with pain medications for headache and a drug called DIAMOX which allows one to breathe faster and so metabolize more oxygen, thereby minimizing the symptoms caused by poor oxygenation. This is especially helpful at night when respiratory drive is decreased. Since it takes a while for DIAMOX to have an effect, it is advisable to start taking it 24 hours before going to altitude and continue it for at least 5 days at higher altitude. Moderate AMS: Moderate AMS includes severe headache (not relieved by medication), nausea, vomiting, increasing weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased coordination. Normal activity is difficult. At this stage, only advanced medications or descent can reverse the problem. Descending even a few hundred feet (70-100 meters) may help. Definite improvement is usually seen in descents of 1,000-2,000 feet (305-610 meters). Twenty-four hours at the lower altitude usually results in significant improvement. The person should remain at lower altitude until symptoms have subsided (up to 3 days). At that point, the person has become acclimatized to that altitude and can begin ascending again. The best test for moderate AMS is to have the person ""walk a straight line"" heel to toe. Just like a sobriety test, a person with AMS will be unable to walk a straight line. This is a clear indication that immediate descent is required. It is important to get the person to descend before the AMS reaches the point where they cannot walk on their own. Severe AMS: Severe AMS presents as an increase in the severity of the symptoms, including greater shortness of breath at rest, inability to walk, decreasing mental status, and fluid buildup in the lungs. Severe AMS requires immediate descent to lower altitudes: 2,000 - 4,000 feet (610-1,220 meters). The only cure for AMS is acclimatization or descent. (Based in part on the Princeton University Outdoor Action ""Guide to High Altitude: Acclimatization and Illnesses"" by Rick Curtis)."
Acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction: A heart attack. The term ""myocardial infarction"" focuses on the heart muscle, which is called the myocardium,and the changes that occur in it due to the sudden deprivation of circulating blood. This is usually caused by arteriosclerosis with narrowing of the coronary arteries, the culminating event being a thrombosis (clot). The main change is death (necrosis) of myocardial tissue. The word ""infarction"" comes from the Latin ""infarcire"" meaning ""to plug up or cram."" It refers to the clogging of the artery, which is frequently initiated by cholesterol piling up on the inner wall of the blood vessels that distribute blood to the heart muscle."
Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia,"Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia: Abbreviated ANLL. More commonly called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A quickly progressive malignant disease in which there are too many immature blood-forming cells in the blood and bone marrow, the cells being specifically those destined to give rise to the granulocytes or monocytes, both types of white blood cells that fight infections. In AML, these blasts do not mature and so become too numerous. AML can occur in adults or children. The early signs of AML may be similar to the flu or other common diseases with fever, weakness and fatigue, loss of weight and appetite, and aches and pains in the bones or joints. Other signs of AML may include tiny red spots in the skin, easy bruising and bleeding, frequent minor infections, and poor healing of minor cuts. First, blood tests are done to count the number of each of the different kinds of blood cells and see whether they are within normal ranges. In AML, the red blood cell levels may be low, causing anemia; platelet levels may be low, causing bleeding and bruising; and the white blood cell levels may be low, leading to infections. A bone marrow biopsy or a bone marrow aspiration may be done if the results of the blood tests are abnormal. During a bone marrow biopsy, a hollow needle is inserted into the hip bone to remove a small amount of the marrow and bone for examination under a microscope. In a bone marrow aspirate, a small sample of liquid bone marrow is withdrawn through a syringe. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may be done to see if the disease has spread into the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the central nervous system (CNS) -- the brain and spinal cord. Other key diagnostic tests may include flow cytometry (in which cells are passed through a laser beam for analysis), immunohistochemistry (using antibodies to distinguish between types of cancer cells), cytogenetics (to determine chromosome changes in cells), and molecular genetic studies (DNA and RNA tests of the cancer cells). The primary treatment of AML is chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is less common; it may be used in certain cases. Bone marrow transplantation is under study in clinical trials and is coming into increasing use. There are two phases of treatment for AML. The first phase is called induction therapy. The purpose of induction therapy is to kill as many of the leukemia cells as possible and induce a remission, a state in which there is no visible evidence of disease and blood counts are normal. Patients may receive a combination of drugs during this phase including daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone plus cytarabine and thioguanine. Once in remission with no signs of leukemia, patients enter a second phase of treatment. The second phase of treatment is called post-remission therapy (or continuation therapy). It is designed to kill any remaining leukemic cells. In post-remission therapy, patients may receive high doses of chemotherapy, designed to eliminate any remaining leukemic cells. Treatment may include a combination of cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, or cytarabine. There are a number of different subtypes of AML. AML is classified using a system called the French American British (FAB) system. In the this system, the subtypes of AML are grouped according to the particular cell line in which the disease developed. There are eight distinct types of AML, designated M0 through M7. Types M2 (myeloblastic leukemia with maturation) and M4 (myelomonocytic leukemia) each account for 25% of AML; M1 (myeloblastic leukemia, with few or no mature cells) accounts for 15%; M3 (promyelocytic leukemia) and M5 (monocytic leukemia) each account for 10% of cases; the other subtypes are rarely seen. AML is also classified according to the chromosomal abnormalities in the malignant cells. The treatment of the subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) differs from that for other forms of AML. (APL is M3 in the FAB system.) Most APL patients are now treated first with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which induces a complete response in 70% of cases and extends survival. APL patients are then given a course of consolidation therapy, which is likely to include cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and idarubicin. Bone marrow transplantation is used to replace the bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. First, all of the bone marrow in the body is destroyed with high doses of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Healthy marrow is then taken from another person (a donor) whose tissue is the same as or almost the same as the patient's. The donor may be a twin (the best match), a brother or sister, or a person who is otherwise related or not related. The healthy marrow from the donor is given to the patient through a needle in the vein, and the marrow replaces the marrow that was destroyed. A bone marrow transplant using marrow from a relative or from a person who is not related is called an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. A greater chance for recovery occurs if the doctor chooses a hospital that does more than five bone marrow transplantations per year. The overall chance of recovery (the long-term prognosis) depends on the subtype of AML and the patient's age and general health."
Acute otitis media,"Acute otitis media: Inflammation of the middle ear in which there is fluid in the middle ear accompanied by signs or symptoms of ear infection: a bulging eardrum usually accompanied by pain; or a perforated eardrum, often with drainage of purulent material (pus). Acute otitis media is the most frequent diagnosis in sick children in the U.S., especially affecting infants and preschoolers. Almost all children have one or more bouts of otitis media before age 6. The Eustachian tube is shorter in children than adults which allows easy entry of bacteria and viruses into the middle ear, resulting in acute otitis media. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (strep) and Hemophilus influenzae (H. flu) account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media and viruses the remaining 15%. Babies under 6 weeks of age tend to have infections from different bacteria in the middle ear. Bottlefeeding is a risk factor for otitis media. Breastfeeding passes immunity to the child that helps prevent acute otitis media. The position of the breastfeeding child is better than the bottle- feeding position for Eustachian tube function. If a child needs to be bottle-fed, holding the infant rather than allowing the child to lie down with the bottle is best. A child should not take the bottle to bed. In addition to increasing the chance for acute otitis media, falling asleep with milk in the mouth increases the incidence of tooth decay. Upper respiratory infections are a prominent risk factor for acute otitis media so exposure to groups of children as in child care centers results in more frequent colds and therefore more earaches. Irritants such as tobacco smoke in the air also increase the chance of otitis media. Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are predisposed to ear infections. Children who have acute otitis media before 6 months of age have more frequent later ear infections. Young children with otitis media may be irritable, fussy, or have problems feeding or sleeping. Older children may complain about pain and fullness in the ear. Fever may be present in a child of any age. These symptoms are often associated with signs of upper respiratory infection such as a runny or stuffy nose or a cough. The buildup of pus within the middle ear causes pain and dampens the vibrations of the eardrum (so there is usually transient hearing loss during the infection). Severe ear infections may cause the eardrum to rupture. The pus then drains from the middle ear into the ear canal. The hole in the eardrum from the rupture usually heals with medical treatment. The treatment for acute otitis media is most commonly antibiotics usually for 7- 10 days. Otherwise healthy children 6 months to 2 years of age and older, without severe symptoms or uncertain diagnosis, may be observed without antibiotics. Otherwise healthy children 6 months to 2 years of age and older, without severe symptoms or uncertain diagnosis, may be observed without antibiotics. About 10% of children do not respond within the first 48 hours of treatment. Even after antibiotic treatment, 40% of children are left with some fluid in the middle ear which can cause temporary hearing loss lasting for up to 3-6 weeks. In most children, the fluid eventually disappears (resorbs) spontaneously (on its own). Children who have recurring bouts of otitis media may have a tympanostomy tube inserted into the ear during surgery to permit fluid to drain from the middle ear. If a child has a bulging eardrum and is experiencing severe pain, a myringotomy (surgical incision of the eardrum to release the pus) may be necessary. The eardrum usually heals within a week. Acute otitis media is not contagious (although the cold that preceded it may be). A child with otitis media can travel by airplane bur, if the Eustachian tube is not functioning well, changes in pressure (such as in a plane) can cause discomfort. A child with a draining ear should, however, not fly (or swim)."
Acute pain,"Acute pain: Pain that comes on quickly, can be severe, but lasts a relatively shorter period of time. As opposed to chronic pain."
Acute pancreatitis,"Acute pancreatitis: Sudden inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas abruptly becomes inflamed and then gets better. Some people have more than one attack but recover fully after each one. The cause of acute pancreatitis is most often alcohol abuse or gallstones. Other causes include use of prescribed drugs, trauma or surgery to the abdomen, or abnormalities of the pancreas or intestine. In rare cases, the disease may result from infections, such as mumps. In about 1 case in 6 or 7, the cause is unknown. Symptoms usually begin with pain in the upper abdomen that may last for a few days, is often severe, and may be constant, just in the abdomen, or it may reach to the back and other areas. The pain may be sudden and intense, or it may begin as a mild pain that is aggravated by eating and slowly grows worse. The abdomen may be swollen and very tender. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and an increased pulse rate. One often feels and looks very sick. In about 20% of cases, the disease is severe. The patient may become dehydrated and have their heart, lungs, or kidneys fail. In the most severe cases, bleeding can occur in the pancreas, leading to shock and sometimes death. During acute attacks of pancreatitis, high levels of amylase and lipase (a digestive enzyme formed in the pancreas) are found in the blood. Changes may also occur in the blood levels of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate. There may high glucose (sugar) and lipids (fats) in the blood, too. After the pancreas recovers, the blood levels of these substances usually return to normal. The treatment depends on how bad the attack is. Unless complications occur, acute pancreatitis usually gets better on its own, so only supportive care is needed. The patient may enter the hospital where fluids can be given by vein to restore blood volume and the kidneys and lungs treated to prevent their failure. Other problems, such as cysts in the pancreas, may need treatment, too. Sometimes a patient cannot control vomiting and needs to have a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach to remove fluid and air. In mild cases, the patient may not have food for 3 or 4 days but is given fluids and pain relievers by vein. An acute attack usually lasts only a few days, unless the ducts are blocked by gallstones. In severe cases, the patient may be fed through the veins for 3 to 6 weeks while the pancreas slowly heals. Antibiotics may be given if signs of infection surface. Surgery may be needed if complications such as infection, cysts, or bleeding occur. Attacks caused by gallstones may require removal of the gallbladder or surgery of the bile duct. Surgery is sometimes needed to exclude other abdominal problems that can simulate pancreatitis or to treat it. When there is severe injury with death of tissue, an operation may be done to remove the dead tissue. After all signs of acute pancreatitis are gone, the doctor will usually try to determine the cause to prevent future attacks. In some patients the cause of the attack is clear, but in others further tests need to be done. For more information, see Pancreatitis."
Acute promyelocytic leukemia,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia: Commonly called APL, a malignancy of the bone marrow in which there is a deficiency of mature blood cells in the myeloid line of cells and an excess of immature cells called promyelocytes. APL is due to a translocation (an exchange of chromosome material) between chromosomes 15 and 17 which is symbolized t(15;17). This translocation is not a mere marker of APL. It is the cause of APL. APL was first recognized as a distinct disease entity in 1957. It accounts for 5-10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The peak incidence of APL is in young adults. APL is considered a type of AML and is classified as the M3 variant of AML in the internationally accepted French-American-British (FAB) Classification. The signs and symptoms of APL are nonspecific and include fatigue (feeling tired), minor infections, or a tendency to bleed (hemorrhagic diathesis). There is usually pancytopenia with low levels of red blood cells (anemia), low levels of the granulocytes and monocytes (types of white blood cells that fight infections), and low levels of platelets (that are needed for blood to clot normally). Patients with APL may therefore receive transfusions. APL is consistently associated with a disorder that resembles (but is not identical to) disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is in APL a pronounced tendency to hemorrhage (bleeding). The bleeding can manifest itself as petechiae (little bleeding spots in the skin or elsewhere), small ecchymosis (bruises), epistaxis (nose bleeds), bleeding in the mouth, hematuria (blood in the urine), bleeding from venipuncture and bone marrow sites and in girls and women who are menstruating may have menometrorrhagia (excessive irregular menstrual bleeding). The hemorrhagic diathesis (bleeding condition) may precede the diagnosis of leukemia by 2-8 weeks. The t(15;17) translocation in APL is the result of two chromosome breaks: one in chromosome 15 and the other in chromosome 17. The break in chromosome 15 disrupts the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene which encodes a growth suppressing transcription factor. And the break in chromosome 17 interrupts the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa) gene which regulates myeloid differentiation. The translocation creates a PML/RARa fusion gene. It produces a chimeric protein that arrests the maturation of myeloid cells at the promyelocytic stage. (It reduces terminal cell differentiation.) And this leads to the increased proliferation of promyelocytes. The treatment of APL differs from that for all other forms of AML. Most APL patients are now treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA is a form of ""differentiation therapy."" It activates the retinoid receptor RAR and causes the promyeloctes to differentiate (to mature) and this deters them from proliferating. ATRA can induce a complete remission in most patients with APL by causing the APL-blasts to mature. However, ATRA cannot eliminate the leukemic clone. ATRA is therefore used in combination with chemotherapy including an anthracycline drug. Survival is better with the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy than chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed APL, because ATRA + chemotherapy makes for a slightly higher rate of complete remissions while allowing significantly fewer relapses. Maintenance treatment with ATRA, and possibly with low-dose chemotherapy, further reduces the incidence of relapse. The prognosis for APL depends on a number of factors including the white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis, etc. Overall, more than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed APL today can achieve complete remission, and about 75% can be cured by the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy. In patients who relapse after remission, treatment may include arsenic trioxide. The advent of ATRA therapy revolutionized the treatment of APL and markedly improved the prognosis (the outlook). ATRA syndrome is a serious side effect of ATRA treatment and includes fever, respiratory distress, and hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure). The ATRA syndrome can be prevented by the addition of chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone if the WBC is increasing. In sum, APL is a form of acute myeloid leukemia caused by a specific chromosome translocation t(15;17). APL is associated with a characteristic cellular picture classified as M3 in the FAB Classification and responds favorably to treatments including retinoids, chemotherapy and, most recently, arsenicals."
Acute renal failure,"Acute renal failure: Sudden and often temporary loss of kidney function. Also called acute kidney failure. As opposed to chronic renal failure. More recently also called acute kidney injury. Many times this is reversible but depending on the cause and severity, it may be irreversible and lead to chronic renal failure or chronic kidney disease. Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water. Acute kidney failure is when the kidneys suddenly stop working. Acute renal failure can be due to many different causes. Generally these causes can be divided into three categories. Pre-renal means the cause is before the kidney or glomerulus. Generally, this is caused by a decrease in the amount of blood that gets to the kidney. Examples include heart failure, liver failure, shock. Another class of acute renal failure is post-renal. In this type, there is an obstruction to the flow of urine from the kidney. The most common example is prostate problems in men, urinary tract cancers, which directly obstruct the urine flow, or cancers in the abdomen or pelvis that push on the ureters that carry the urine from the kidney to the bladder. The last category is termed renal and is due to damage to the kidney itself, especially the filtering units (glomeruli) or the tubules leading from the glomeruli. Examples of renal injury include infections, cancer, some medications and other nephrotoxins, and auto-immune diseases. As well, primary kidney diseases (glomerulonephritis and nephrotic diseases, such as membranous nephropathy) can damage the kidneys and cause acute renal failure as well as chronic renal failure. Treatment generally is directed at support of blood pressure and flow of the blood to the kidneys. As well, any offending agents should be discontinued and any nephrotoxic agents should be avoided. Some cases will be severe enough to require dialysis to remove toxins from the body until the kidneys can recover. Sometimes, the damage is severe enough that it is irreversible and the patient will require long-term dialysis or renal transplant."
Acute stress disorder,"Acute stress disorder: The anxiety and behavioral disturbances that develop within a month of exposure to extreme trauma. The symptoms of an acute stress disorder usually begin during or shortly following the trauma. Such extreme traumatic events include rape or other severe physical assault, near-death experiences in accidents, witnessing a murder, and combat. The symptom of dissociation, which reflects a perceived detachment of the mind from the emotional state or even the body, is a critical feature. Dissociation also is characterized by a sense of the world as a dreamlike or unreal place and may be accompanied by poor memory of the specific events, which in severe form is known as dissociative amnesia. Other features of acute stress disorder include symptoms of generalized anxiety and hyperarousal, avoidance of situations or stimuli that elicit memories of the trauma, and persistent, intrusive recollections of the event via flashbacks, dreams, or recurrent thoughts or visual images. If the symptoms and behavioral disturbances of the acute stress disorder persist for more than a month, and if these features are associated with functional impairment or significant distress to the sufferer, the diagnosis is changed to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."
Acute thrombocytopenic purpura,"Acute thrombocytopenic purpura: Sudden onset of low blood platelet levels, with bleeding into the skin and elsewhere. Abbreviated ATP. ATP can have many causes; for example, it can be a potentially serious complication during the acute phase of measles infection."
Acyclovir,"Acyclovir: (Brand name: Zovirax) One of a group of antiviral drugs that acts against the herpes viruses, including: Acyclovir inhibits the replication of viral DNA needed for the virus to reproduce. Virally infected cells absorb more acyclovir than normal cells and convert more of it to an active form, prolonging its antiviral activity where it is most needed. Acyclovir may reduce the severity and duration of a shingles attack if given soon after the onset of symptoms. For more information, see: Acyclovir."
Ad lib,"Ad lib: Abbreviation for the Latin ""ad libitum"" meaning ""at pleasure"" and ""at one's pleasure, as much as one desires, to the full extent of one's wishes."" Sometimes seen on a prescription or doctor's order. For example, during an overnight fast when the patient is not to eat any food but can have water, the doctor's order might read: ""Water ad lib"" (water as desired)."
Ad-,"Ad-: Prefix indicating toward or in the direction of. For example, adduction is the movement of a limb toward the midline of the body, and adrenal literally means 'toward the kidney.'"
ADA deficiency,"ADA deficiency: Lack of normal adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, a genetic (inherited) condition causing one form of severe combined immunodeficiency ((SCID) disease. It is said to be ""combined"" in that there is dysfunction of both B and T lymphocytes with impaired cellular immunity and decreased production of immunoglobulins. Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that plays a key role in salvaging purine molecules. The ADA gene is located on chromosome 20 in the region of bands q12-q13.11. The complete sequence and structure of the gene is known. A variety of mutant alleles (altered forms of the gene) have been identified, including base pair substitutions and deletions. ADA deficiency is of special interest in the history of genetics. The first successful instance of gene therapy in humans was carried out in 1990 by Drs. W. French Anderson, R. Michael Blaise and Kenneth W. Culver who infused genetically engineered blood cells to repair ADA. (Clinical trials in the treatment of ADA deficiency are ongoing. Bone marrow transplant in infancy has proven efficacy.) deficiency."
Adam's apple,"Adam's apple: The familiar feature on the front of the neck that is the forward protrusion of the thyroid cartilage, the largest cartilage of the larynx. It tends to enlarge at adolescence, particularly in males. It is usually said to take its name from the extrabiblical story that a piece of the forbidden fruit stuck in Adam's throat."
Adamantine,"Adamantine: In dentistry, relating to the enamel of the teeth. Adamantine comes from the Greek and Latin word adamas which applied to substances having the hardness or luster of a diamond. Adamantine figuratively means unyielding and inflexible."
ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity),"ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity): An immune response in which antibodies, by coating target cells, makes them vulnerable to attack by immune cells. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is commonly (and blissfully) abbreviated ADCC."
ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder),"ADD (attention deficit disorder) is an older term for primarily inattentive ADHD, a common condition that affects children and adolescents. ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder in children and is more common in boys than in girls. Children with ADHD generally have greater problems paying attention or concentrating. They can't seem to follow directions and are easily bored or frustrated with tasks. They also tend to move constantly and are impulsive, not stopping to think before they act. The exact cause of ADHD is not known, although researchers continue to study the brain for clues. There are no laboratory tests for ADHD. The diagnosis is made based on the child's symptoms and behavior. Healthcare professionals, such as pediatricians and child psychologists can diagnose ADHD with the help of standard guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The doctor may ask for input from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults who are familiar with the child's symptoms. Treatment for ADHD is multifaceted. It consists of ADHD medications or behavioral modification therapy or both. Studies have established the safety and effectiveness of using stimulant medications, other drugs, and behavioral therapy."
Addiction,"Addiction: An uncontrollable craving, seeking, and use of a substance such as alcohol or another drug. Dependence is such an issue with addiction that stopping is very difficult and causes severe physical and mental reactions."
Addison anemia,"Addison anemia: A blood disorder caused by a lack of vitamin B12. Patients who have this disorder do not produce the substance in the stomach that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12. This substance is called intrinsic factor (IF). Addison anemia, better known today as pernicious anemia (PA), is characterized by the presence in the blood of large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts) that are forerunners of red blood cells. (Red blood cells, when mature, have no nucleus). It is thus a type of megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia (PA) was first described (although not by that name) in 1855 by the English physician Thomas Addison. He called it an invariably fatal ""idiopathic anemia."" The ""idiopathic"" was a frank admission that the cause of this illness was wholly unknown. The name ""pernicious anemia"" was coined in 1872 by the German physician Anton Biermer whose description of the disease was superior to that of Addison. The studies of George H. Whipple on the effects of feeding liver in anemia followed by those of George R. Minot and Wm. P. Murphy on the effects of feeding liver specifically in pernicious anemia (PA) led to the cure of PA and to their receiving the Nobel Prize in 1934. Nowadays PA is an non-pernicious anemia. It is simply treated with vitamin B12. The vitamin B12 has to be administered by injection (parenterally) because people with PA do not have IF (or an effective form of IF) and so cannot absorb vitamin B12 taken by mouth. There is some evidence that PA may be genetic although its mode of inheritance is poorly documented. There is a congenital form of PA due to defect of IF that is clearly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with the affected child having received two copies of the gene, one from each parent. The IF gene itself has been localized to human chromosome 11. The word ""pernicious"" means highly injurious, destructive, or deadly. ""Pernicious"" comes from the Latin root ""nex"" meaning ""violent death."" Pernicious anemia was once quite deadly. Today it fortunately is not. PA has also been called addisonian anemia and Biermer's anemia."
Addison disease,"Addison disease: Long-term underfunction of the outer portion of the adrenal gland. In medical terms, chronic insufficiency of the adrenal cortex. This may be due to a number of different insults to the adrenal including physical trauma, hemorrhage, and tuberculosis of the adrenal, and destruction of the cells in the pituitary gland that secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) which normally drives the adrenal. Addison's disease is characterized by bronzing of the skin, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. The U.S. President J.F. Kennedy is said to have had Addison disease. Named after the British physician Thomas Addison (1793-1860).When Addison first identified adrenal insufficiency in 1849, tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for 70-90% of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. TB now accounts for around 20% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries."
Addisonian anemia,"Addisonian anemia: A blood disorder caused by a lack of vitamin B12. Patients who have this disorder do not produce the substance in the stomach that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12. This substance is called intrinsic factor (IF). Addisonian anemia, also called pernicious anemia (PA), is characterized by the presence in the blood of large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts) that are forerunners of red blood cells. (Red blood cells, when mature, have no nucleus). It is thus a type of megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia (PA) was first described (although not by that name) in 1855 by the English physician Thomas Addison. He called it an invariably fatal ""idiopathic anemia."" The ""idiopathic"" was a frank admission that the cause of this illness was wholly unknown. The name ""pernicious anemia"" was coined in 1872 by the German physician Anton Biermer whose description of the disease was superior to that of Addison. The studies of George H. Whipple on the effects of feeding liver in anemia followed by those of George R. Minot and Wm. P. Murphy on the effects of feeding liver specifically in pernicious anemia (PA) led to the cure of PA and to their receiving the Nobel Prize in 1934. Nowadays PA is an unpernicious anemia. It is simply treated with vitamin B12. The vitamin B12 has to be administered by injection (parenterally) because people with PA do not have IF (or an effective form of IF) and so cannot absorb vitamin B12 taken by mouth. There is some evidence that PA may be genetic although its mode of inheritance is poorly documented. There is a congenital form of PA due to defect of IF that is clearly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with the affected child having received two copies of the gene, one from each parent. The IF gene itself has been localized to human chromosome 11. The word ""pernicious"" means highly injurious, destructive, or deadly. ""Pernicious"" comes from the Latin root ""nex"" meaning ""violent death."" Pernicious anemia was once quite deadly. Today it fortunately is not. PA has also been called Addison anemia and Biermer's anemia."
Additive genetic effects,Additive genetic effects: A mechanism of quantitative inheritance such that the combined effects of genetic alleles at two or more gene loci are equal to the sum of their individual effects.
Adduction,Adduction: Movement of a limb toward the midline of the body. The opposite of adduction is abduction.
Adductor muscle,"Adductor muscle: Any muscle that pulls a body part toward the midline. For example, the adductor muscles of the legs pull the legs toward the midline of the body so the legs are closer together. The word ""adductor"" comes from the Latin prefix ""ad"" meaning ""toward"" + ""ducere"" meaning ""to draw or lead"" = ""to draw toward."" The opposite of ""adductor"" is ""abductor."" An adductor muscle opposes an abductor muscle."
Aden-,Aden-: See: Adeno-.
Adenitis,"Adenitis: Inflammation of a lymph gland. From the aden-, gland + -itis, inflammation."
Adeno-,"Adeno-: Prefix referring to a gland, as in adenoma and adenopathy. From the Greek aden meaning originally ""an acorn"" and later ""a gland"" in the form of an acorn. Before a vowel, adeno- becomes aden-, as in adenitis (inflammation of a gland)."
Adenocarcinoma,Adenocarcinoma: A cancer that develops in the lining or inner surface of an organ and usually has glandular (secretory) properties.
Adenoiditis,Adenoiditis: Infection of the adenoids.
Adenoids,"Adenoids: A lump of lymphoid tissue of varying size, located behind the nose in a space called the nasopharynx."
Adenoma,"Adenoma: A benign tumor that arises in or resembles glandular tissue. If an adenoma becomes cancerous, it is called an adenocarcinoma."
Adenopathy,"Adenopathy: Large or swollen lymph nodes. Lymph nodes can become enlarged as a result of inflammatory diseases, infection, or cancer. Synonymous with lymphadenopathy."
Adenosine,Adenosine: A nucleoside containing adenine as its base. Adenosine acts to dilate the coronary arteries and is employed in the adenosine thallium scan of the heart.
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency: A genetic (inherited) condition that results in a immune deficiency disorder called severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that plays a key role in salvaging purine molecules. ADA deficiency is of special interest in the history of genetics. The first successful instance of gene therapy in humans was carried out in 1990 by Drs. W. French Anderson, R. Michael Blaese and Kenneth W. Culver who infused genetically engineered blood cells to repair ADA deficiency."
Adenosine triphosphate,Adenosine triphosphate: A nucleotide compound that is of critical importance for the storage of energy within cells and the synthesis of RNA. Abbreviated ATP.
ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder),"ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder): a common condition that affects children and adolescents, while ADD is more common in adults.    ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder of children and is more common in boys than in girls. Children with ADHD generally have  greater problems paying attention or concentrating. They can't seem to follow directions and are easily bored or frustrated with tasks. They also tend to move constantly and are impulsive, not stopping to think before they act.  The exact cause of ADHD is not known, although researchers continue to study the brain for clues. There are no laboratory tests for ADHD.     The diagnosis is made based on  the child's symptoms and behavior. Healthcare professionals, such as pediatricians and child psychologists can diagnose ADHD with the help of standard guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The doctor may ask for input from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults who are familiar with the child's symptoms.      Treatment for ADHD is multifaceted. It consists of ADHD medications or behavioral modification therapy or both. Studies have established the safety and effectiveness of using stimulant medications, other drugs, and behavioral therapy.   "
Adhesion,"Adhesion: The union of two opposing tissue surfaces. This term is often used to refer to the sides of a wound, as well as to scar tissue strands that can form at the site of a previous operation, such as within the abdomen after a laparotomy."
ADI,ADI: Acceptable daily intake.
Adipocyte,"Adipocyte: A fat cell, a connective tissue cell that has differentiated and become specialized in the synthesis (manufacture) and storage of fat. The adipocyte is important to the body in maintaining proper energy balance, storing calories in the form of lipids, mobilizing energy sources in response to hormonal stimulation, and commanding changes by signal secretions. Under the microscope, the adipocyte appears bloated with triglycerides. The nucleus of the cell is displaced to one side by the fat. The cytoplasm of the cell looks like a thin line surrounding the pool of fat."
Adipose,Adipose: Fatty. Adipose refers to tissue made up of mainly fat cells such as the yellow layer of fat beneath the skin.
Adiposity,"Adiposity: a condition of being severely overweight, or obese. The term ""obesity"" more frequently is used for this condition in the U.S. where obesity is usually defined by measuring a person's body mass index (BMI). There also is a measurement of body fat used by some researchers known as the body adiposity index (BAI). Unlike the BMI, weight is not taken to account in the BAI, which is based on a person's height and hip circumference."
Adjacent,"Adjacent: Lying nearby. Related terms include superjacent, subjacent, and circumjacent. From ad-, near + the Latin jacere, to lie = to lie near."
Adjuvant,"Adjuvant: A substance that helps and enhances the effect of a drug, treatment, or biologic system."
Adjuvant therapy,"Adjuvant therapy: Treatment that is given in addition to the primary (initial) treatment. Adjuvant treatment is an addition designed to help reach the ultimate goal. Adjuvant therapy for cancer usually refers to surgery followed by chemo- or radiotherapy to help decrease the risk of the cancer recurring (coming back). In Latin ""adjuvans"" means to help and, particularly, to help reach a goal."
daily living),"ADLs (activities of daily living): The things we normally do in daily living including any daily activity we perform for self-care such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure. The ability or inability to perform ADLs can be used as a very practical measure of ability/disability in many disorders."
Admission,Admission: Entry. As a patient admission (into a hospital). The opposite of admission in this context is discharge.
Adnexa,"Adnexa: In gynecology, the appendages of the uterus, namely the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, and the ligaments that hold the uterus in place."
Adrenal cortex,Adrenal cortex: The outer portion of the adrenal gland located on top of each kidney. The adrenal cortex produces steroid hormones which regulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism and mineralocorticoid hormones which regulate salt and water balance in the body. Underfunction of the adrenal cortex results in Addison disease while overfunction occurs in the adrenogenital syndrome and in Cushing syndrome.
Adrenal failure,"Adrenal failure: A condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the adrenal hormones that control important functions such as blood pressure. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. The adrenal is made up of an outer layer (the cortex) and an inner portion (the medulla). The adrenal glands produce hormones that help control the heart rate, blood pressure, the way the body uses food, and other vital functions. The adrenal cortex secretes steroid (cortisone-related) hormones and mineralocortoids that regulate the levels of minerals such as sodium and potassium in the blood. The adrenal medulla makes adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Adrenaline is secreted in response to low blood levels of glucose as well as exercise and stress; it causes the breakdown of the storage product glycogen to the sugar glucose in the liver, facilitates the release of fatty acids from adipose (fat) tissue, causes dilation (widening) of the small arteries within muscle and increases the output of the heart. Noradrenaline is a neurohormone, a neurotransmitter, for of most of the so-called sympathetic nervous system. The term ""Addison's disease"" refers to long-term insufficiency of the adrenal cortex. This may be due to a number of different insults to the adrenal including physical trauma, hemorrhage, and tuberculosis of the adrenal, and destruction of the cells in the pituitary gland that secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) which normally drives the adrenal. Addison's disease is characterized by bronzing of the skin, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. The U.S. President John F. Kennedy had Addison's disease. The condition is named after the British physician Thomas Addison (1793-1860)."
Adrenal gland,"Adrenal gland: A small gland located on top of the kidney. The adrenal glands produce hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, the way the body uses food, the levels of minerals such as sodium and potassium in the blood, and other functions particularly involved in stress reactions."
Adrenal medulla,"Adrenal medulla: The inner portion of adrenal gland. (The outer portion is the adrenal cortex). The adrenal medulla makes epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine is secreted in response to low blood levels of glucose as well as exercise and stress; it causes the breakdown of the storage product glycogen to the sugar glucose in the liver, facilitates the release of fatty acids from adipose (fat) tissue, causes dilation (widening) of the small arteries within muscle and increases the output of the heart. Norepinephrine secreted by the adrenal gland acts to narrow blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Underfunction of the adrenal medulla is virtually unknown. However, a tumor called a pheochromocytoma produces norepinephrine and epinephrine and is equivalent to overfunction of the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas arise within the adrenal medulla or elsewhere in the sympathetic nervous system. They typically cause hypertension (high blood pressure) that may be paroxysmal (sharply episodic) with attacks of headaches, feelings of apprehension, sweating, flushing of the face, nausea and vomiting, palpitations and tingling of the extremities (the arms and legs)."
Adrenaline,"Adrenaline: A stress hormone produced within the adrenal gland that quickens the heart beat, strengthens the force of the heart's contraction, and opens up the bronchioles in the lungs, among other effects. The secretion of adrenaline is part of the human 'fight or flight' response to fear, panic, or perceived threat. Also known as epinephrine."
Adrenoleukodystrophy,"Adrenoleukodystrophy: A rare genetic (inherited) disorder characterized by the breakdown or loss of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells in the brain and progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers in the brain. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering which acts as an electrical insulator. There are several forms of ALD: The treatment for all forms of ALD is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy, psychological support, and special education may be useful for some individuals. The prognosis for patients with ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms."
ADU,ADU: Accessory dwelling unit.
Adult primary liver cancer,"Adult primary liver cancer: A tumor in which the cancer starts during adulthood in cells in the liver. Also called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Primary liver cancer is different from cancer that has metastasized (spread) from another place in the body to the liver. The signs and symptoms may include a hard lump just below the rib cage on the right side (from swelling of the liver), discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side, pain around the right shoulder blade, or yellowing of the skin (jaundice). There is often an increase in the blood levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and alkaline phosphatase. A rapid deterioration of liver function may be the only clue to the presence of the tumor. Hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curable by surgery, but surgery is the treatment of choice for only a small fraction of patients who have localized disease. Laparoscopy may detect metastatic disease, tumor in both lobes of the liver, or an inadequate liver remnant, and avoid the need for open surgery to explore the liver. Liver transplantation is also potentially curative, but is appropriate for only 5% of patients presenting with a hepatoma. Therapy other than surgery is best as part of a clinical trial. Such trials evaluate the efficacy of systemic or infusional chemotherapy, hepatic artery ligation or embolization, percutaneous ethanol (alcohol) injection, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy (freezing the tumor), and radiolabeled antibodies, often in conjunction with surgical resection (removal) and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis (outlook) depends on the degree of local tumor replacement and the extent of liver function impairment. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the most common cancer in some parts of the world. It is still relatively uncommon in the US but its incidence is rising, principally in relation to the spread of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. People who have a disease of the liver called cirrhosis are also more likely to get adult primary liver cancer. People with the iron-storage disease called hemochromatosis are also at increased risk for hepatoma. Hepatitis B and C appear to be the most significant causes of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. People who have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be at even higher risk if they consume more than 3 oz. (80 grams) of alcohol a day. A history of a first-degree relative with hepatocellular carcinoma also increases the risk. Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with cirrhosis in 50% to 80% of patients; 5% of cirrhotic patients eventually develop hepatocellular cancer. Aflatoxin has also been implicated as a factor in the etiology (causation) of primary liver cancer in parts of the world where this mycotoxin- that is a toxic substance which comes from a mold- occurs in high levels in food. Workers exposed to vinyl chloride before controls on vinyl chloride dust were instituted developed sarcomas in the liver, most commonly angiosarcomas. These are different from hepatomas"
Advance directives,"Advance directives: These directives pertain to treatment preferences and the designation of a surrogate decision-maker in the event that a person should become unable to make medical decisions on their own behalf. Advance directives generally fall into three categories: living will, power of attorney and health care proxy. LIVING WILL: This is a written document that specifies what types of medical treatment are desired. A living will can be very specific or very general. The most common statement in a living will is to the effect that: If I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued. More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual's desire for such services such as analgesia (pain relief), antibiotics, hydration, feeding, and the use of ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. HEALTH CARE PROXY: This is a legal document in which an individual designates another person to make health care decisions if he or she is rendered incapable of making their wishes known. The health care proxy has, in essence, the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if capable of making and communicating decisions. DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY: This is the third type of advance directive. Individuals may draft legal documents providing power of attorney to others in the case of incapacitating medical condition. The durable power of attorney allows an individual to make bank transactions, sign Social Security checks, apply for disability, or simply write checks to pay the utility bill while an individual is medically incapacitated."
Adventitious,"Adventitious: Coming from an external source or occurring in an unusual place or manner. Not inherent, inherited or innate but rather occurring accidentally or spontaneously. When a doctor or nurse auscults (listens to) the chest or abdomen, adventitious sounds are those that are normally not heard coming from the chest or abdomen. The word ""adventitious"" comes from the Latin ""adventicius"" meaning ""foreign, strange, extraneous, coming from abroad or from outside."" This, in turn, comes from the verb ""advenire"" meaning ""to come to"" or ""to arrive."" Other English words that stem from ""advenire"" include ""adventure,"" ""avenue,"" and the medical term ""adventitia."""
Adverse effect,Adverse effect: A harmful or abnormal result. An adverse effect may be caused by administration of a medication or by exposure to a chemical and be indicated by an untoward result such as by illness or death.
Adverse reaction,"Adverse reaction: In pharmacology, any unexpected or dangerous reaction to a drug. An unwanted effect caused by the administration of a drug. The onset of the adverse reaction may be sudden or develop over time. Also called an adverse drug event (ADE), adverse drug reaction (ADR), adverse effect or adverse event."
"Aer-, aero-","Aer-, aero-: Prefix indicating air or gas, such as aerogastria (excess stomach gas)."
Aerobic,Aerobic: Oxygen-requiring. Aerobic bacteria need oxygen to grow. Aerobic exercise requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body's increased oxygen demand.
Aerobic exercise,"Aerobic exercise: Brisk exercise that promotes the circulation of oxygen through the blood and is associated with an increased rate of breathing. Examples include running, swimming, and bicycling."
Aerophagia,"Aerophagia: Swallowing too much air, a common cause of gas in the stomach and belching. Everyone swallows small amounts of air when eating or drinking. However, rapid eating or drinking, chewing gum, smoking, or ill-fitting dentures may cause a significant increase in swallowed air. The word ""phage"" in Greek means ""to eat."" Aerophagia is literally to eat air."
Aerophobia,"Aerophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of flying. Sufferers experience severe anxiety even though they usually realize that the flying does not pose a threat commensurate with their fear. Aerophobia also means an irrational fear of fresh air or drafts of air. Derived from the Greek ""aero-"", air or gas + ""phobos"", fear = literally, fear of air."
Aerosol,Aerosol: A fine spray or mist. Medications in aerosol form can be administered via a nebulizer and inhaled.
Aerotitis,"Aerotitis: Middle ear problems due to changing atmospheric pressures, as when a plane descends to land. Symptoms include ear pain, ringing ears, diminished hearing and, sometimes, dizziness. Also known as aerotitis media, barotitis, barotitis media, and otic barotrauma."
Aesculapius,"Aesculapius: The ancient Roman god of medicine, whose staff with a snake curled around it is commonly used as a symbol of medicine. According to mythology, Aesculapius's children included Hygeia, the goddess of health, and Panaceia, the goddess of healing."
Aetiology,"Aetiology: The study of the causes. For example, of a disorder. The word ""aetiology"" is mainly used in medicine, where it is the science that deals with the causes or origin of disease, the factors which produce or predispose toward a certain disease or disorder. Today in medicine one hears (or reads) that ""the aetiology is unknown."" Translation -- we don't know the cause. Aetiology is the preferred spelling in some countries, including the UK, whereas ""etiology"" without an ""a"" has taken over in the US. The word ""aetiology"" comes from the Greek ""aitia"", cause + ""logos"", discourse."
Affect,"Affect: The emotional tone a person expresses. A person's affect may be appropriate or inappropriate to the situation. One type of inappropriate affect is a flat affect or blunted affect, a common feature of schizophrenia."
Afferent,Afferent: Carrying toward. A vein is an afferent vessel because it carries blood from the body toward the heart. The opposite of afferent is efferent.
Affinity,"Affinity: In immunology, the strength of binding interaction between antigen and antibody molecules."
AFIP,AFIP: The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
AFO (ankle-foot orthosis),AFO (ankle-foot orthosis): Ankle-foot orthosis.
Afterbirth,"Afterbirth: The placenta and fetal membranes that are expelled from the uterus following the baby's birth. Hence, the ""afterbirth."" The placenta is what joins the mother and fetus. It also permits the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus besides the release of carbon dioxide and waste products from the fetus to the mother. As a uniquely disposable organ, the placenta is disk-shaped and at full term, measures about 7 inches (18 cm) in diameter and little under less than 2 inches (4 cm) thick. The fetal membranes - the chorion is the outer one and the amnion is the inner one - envelop the embryo and contain the amniotic fluid. The word ""afterbirth"" entered the English language in the 16th century. The term has also been applied to a child born after the father's death or last testament."
Age by decade,"Age by decade: A term designating someone's age by decade. For example, a septuagenarian refers to someone in his or her seventies (age 70 to 79). The prefix in such terms is always from the Latin. For example, the Latin septuageni = seventy. The terms denarian, vicenarian, tricenarian, and quadragenarian are not in common usage. The term supercentenarian was coined in 1991."
Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration: An eye disease with its onset usually after age 60 that can progressively destroy the macula, the central portion of the retina, impairing central vision. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD) rarely causes blindness because only the center of vision is affected. However, injury to the macula in the center of the retina can impair the ability to see straight ahead clearly and make it difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities that require fine central vision. The macula is in the center of the retina at the back of the eye. As we read, light is focused onto the macula where millions of cells change the light into nerve signals that travel to the brain and tell it what we are seeing. This is our central vision. With normal central vision, we are able to read, drive, and perform other activities that require fine, sharp, straight-ahead vision. There are two types of AMD -- the dry type and the far less frequent wet type. Neither type causes pain. An early symptom of wet AMD could be that straight lines appear wavy. This happens because blood vessels leak fluid under the macula. The fluid raises the macula from its normal place at the back of the eye and distorts vision. Another sign that a person may have wet AMD is rapid loss of central vision. This is different from dry AMD in which loss of central vision occurs slowly. An advanced form of age-related, dry macular degeneration 
called geographic atrophy leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Geographic atrophy causes sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina, resulting from loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium, and choriocapillaris. Geographic atrophy is also known as atrophic age-related macular degeneration.  In both dry and wet AMD, the person may also notice a blind spot. If any of these changes in vision is noticed, an ophthalmologist should be consulted without delay. Supplements of zinc together with the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene reportedly slow the progression of dry AMD. In people with intermediate-stage disease dry AMD, zinc reduced the risk of the disease progressing to the advanced stage by 11%, and the antioxidants reduced the risk by 10%. When the two were combined, the risk was reduced by 19%. The daily doses of the antioxidants used in this study were 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 milligrams of vitamin E and 15 milligrams of beta-carotene (a molecule the body converts to vitamin A). The daily dose of zinc was 80 milligrams with 2 milligrams of copper added to prevent copper deficiency sometimes associated with high zinc intake. These amounts are well above the usual levels recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
"Agent, tocolytic","Agent, tocolytic: A medication that can inhibit labor, slow down or halt the contractions of the uterus. Tocolytic agents are widely used today to treat premature labor and permit pregnancy to proceed so the fetus can gain in size and maturity before birth."
Ageusia,"Ageusia: An inability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, or salty substances. People who can taste sweet, sour, bitter, or salty substances but have a reduced ability to do so are said to have hypogeusia."
Aggressive,"Aggressive: In oncology, quickly growing, tending to spread rapidly. As, for example, an aggressive tumor."
Aging,"Aging: The process of becoming older, a process that is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. Research into aging: To sum up the state of research into aging is well beyond the confines of this space (and this writer's talents). However, here is one type of research into the genetics of aging. A gene has been discovered that helps determine the life-span of the fruit fly Drosophila. When the gene is mutated (altered), it can extend the life-span of fruit flies. It doubles their life-span. The gene has been named Indy (for I'm not dead yet). It appears that the protein encoded by this gene transports and recycles metabolic byproducts. Defects in the gene may lead to production of a protein that renders metabolism less efficient so that its body functions as if the fruit fly were dieting, even though its eating habits are unchanged. Mutations in Indy thus appear to create a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown to extend life-span. Reference: Rogina B, Reenan RA, Nilsen SP, and Helfand SL. Extended life-span conferred by cotransporter gene mutations in Drosophila. Science Dec 15 2000: 2137-2140. Some useful suggestions for extending life: No known substance can halt aging or extend life, but here are some useful tips for improving the chances of living a long time and staying healthy:"
Agita,"Agita: Heartburn, acid indigestion, an upset stomach or, by extension, a general feeling of upset. The word is Italian-American slang derived from the Italian ""agitare"" meaning ""to agitate."""
Agonist,Agonist: A substance that acts like another substance and therefore stimulates an action. Agonist is the opposite of antagonist. Antagonists and agonists are key players in the chemistry of the human body and in pharmacology.
Agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of public places or open areas, especially those from which escape could be difficult or in which help might not be immediately accessible. Persons with agoraphobia frequently also have panic disorder. People with mild agoraphobia often live normal lives by avoiding anxiety-provoking situations. In the most severe agoraphobia, the victims may be incapacitated and homebound. Agoraphobia tends to start in the mid to late20s, and the onset may appear to be triggered by a traumatic event."
Agranulocytosis,"Agranulocytosis: A marked decrease in the number of granulocytes. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell filled with microscopic granules that are little sacs containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Granulocytes are part of the innate, somewhat non specific infection-fighting immune system. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do B-cells and T-cells. Agranulocytosis results in a syndrome of frequent chronic bacterial infections of the skin, lungs, throat, etc. Although ""agranulocytosis"" literally means no granulocytes, there may, in fact, be some granulocytes but too few of them, i.e. granulocytopenia. Agranulocytosis can be genetic and inherited or it can be acquired as, for example, an aspect of leukemia. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are all types of granulocytes. They are named by the staining features of their granules in the laboratory: This classification dates back to a time when certain structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of these intracellular structures were still not yet fathomed. However, the classification of granulocytes into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils is still widely used (and quite useful)."
Ague,"Ague: A fever (such as from malaria) that is marked by paroxysms of chills, fever, and sweating recurring regular intervals. Also a fit of shivering, a chill. Hence, ague can refer to both chills and fevers. Pronounced 'A-("")gyu with the accent solidly on the ""A"", the word ""ague"" is an example of how medical terminology changes with time). ""Aigue"" entered English usage in the 14th century, having crossed the channel from the Middle French ""agu?"". The word share the same origin as ""acute."" It descends from the Latin ""acutus"" meaning ""sharp or pointed"". A ""fievre aigue"" in French was a sharp or pointed (or acute) fever."
Agyrophobia,"Agyrophobia: Abnormal and persistent fear of crossing streets, highways and other thoroughfares; fear of thoroughfares themselves. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize that streets, highways and other thoroughfares pose no threat commensurate with their fear. Formed from the Greek ""gyrus"" (turning or whirling) and the Greek ""phobos"" (fear). The first letter, ""a,"" is privative--that is, it creates a negative. Thus, an agyrophobiac shuns or avoids the whirl of traffic."
AHD,AHD: Abbreviation for alveolar hydatid disease; American Hospital Directory; and atherosclerotic heart disease.
AID (artificial insemination by donor),"AID (artificial insemination by donor): A procedure in which a fine catheter (tube) is inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the uterus) into the uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample from a donor other than the woman's mate directly into the uterus. The purpose of this procedure is to achieve fertilization and pregnancy. AID is also called heterologous insemination. AID is distinguished from homologous insemination, that is artificial insemination by husband (AIH)."
AIDS,"AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a syndrome caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with ensuing compromise of the body's immune system. Features include deficiency of certain types of leukocytes, especially T cells; infection with opportunistic infections that take advantage of the impaired immune response, such as tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, human herpes virus, or toxoplasmosis; certain types of cancer, particularly Kaposi sarcoma; inability to maintain body weight (wasting); and in advanced cases, AIDS dementia complex. Treatment for AIDS has advanced rapidly. Antiviral, antibacterial, and immune-boosting medications, among other treatments, are part of current treatment protocols."
AIDS-related complex,"AIDS-related complex: A term used in the early years of the AIDS epidemic to describe people with HIV infection who had only mild symptoms of illness, such as swollen lymph glands. It is rarely used today. Abbreviated ARC."
AIH (artificial insemination by husband),AIH (artificial insemination by husband): A procedure in which a fine catheter (tube) is inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the uterus) into the uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample from the woman's mate directly into the uterus. The purpose of this procedure is to achieve fertilization and pregnancy. AIH is distinguished from artificial insemination by donor (AID) in which the donor is a man other than the woman's mate. AIH is also known as homologous insemination.
Air bag,"Air bag: The airbag is a vehicle safety device. It is restraining device designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision. It prevents the driver and passenger from striking the steering wheel or a window. The airbag is designed to only inflate in moderate to severe frontal crashes. Airbags are normally designed with the intent of supplemental protection of those already restrained with a seatbelt. Most designs are inflated through pyrotechnic means and can only be operated once. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the combination of an air bag in addition to a lap and shoulder belt reduces the risk of serious head injury by about 80%, compared with 60% reduction for belts alone. The first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s. Commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag, and a front passenger airbag as well on some cars; and many modern vehicles now include four or more units. Infants should NEVER ride in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag. Children ages 12 and under should always be properly restrained in a child safety seat or safety belt and ride in the back seat. Even if there isn't a passenger air bag in the motor vehicle, the safest place for infants and children is properly secured and buckled up in the back seat."
Air-conditioner lung,"Air-conditioner lung: Is more appropriately referred to as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammation of the lungs due to breathing in a foreign substance, usually certain types of dust, fungus, or molds. It has also called humidifier lung, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, farmer's lung, mushroom picker's disease, and bird breeder's lung. The condition is usually found in those whose home or work place contains high levels of contaminants. For example, as a result of fungus present in humidifiers, heating systems, and air conditioners found in homes and offices. Exposure to certain bird droppings (for example, among bird owners) can also lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In farmers with repeated or intense exposure to dust from moldy hay, straw, and grain can lead to lung inflammation and acute lung disease. Over time, this acute condition may turn into long-lasting (chronic) lung disease. Symptoms of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis may occur 4 - 6 hours after leaving the area and include: chills, cough, fever, malaise, or shortness of breath. Symptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include, breathlessness especially with exertion, cough, often dry, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. Prevention is by avoiding material that causes lung inflammation."
Airway,"Airway: The path that air follows to get into and out of the lungs. The mouth and nose are the normal entry and exit ports for the airway. Entering air then passes through the back of the throat (pharynx) and continues through the voice box (larynx), down the trachea, to finally pass through the bronchi."
AK,AK: 1. Above the knee. 2. Acanthamoeba keratitis. 3. Actinic keratosis.
AKA (above the knee amputation),"AKA (above the knee amputation): In general usage, this would be read to mean ""also known as."" However, in medical parlance, AKA means ""above the knee?amputation."" AKA is as opposed to BKA, a below-the-knee amputation."
Akathisia,"Akathisia: A movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in constant motion, as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if marching on the spot, and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting.

Akinesia,Akinesia: The state of being without movement.
Akinetic,Akinetic: Related to the loss of the normal ability to move the muscles.
ALA,"ALA: 1. Alpha-linolenic acid 2.Aminolevulinic acid, a naturally occurring chemical in the body that is converted to protoporphyrin IX, a light-sensitive compound. Aminolevulinic acid has been used in the photodynamic therapy of skin precancer and cancer. In this therapy topical treatment with forms of ALA sensitizes the tissues to light. Then a special blue or red light depending upon the form of ALA used is then shone on the tissue to be treated. The reaction of the ALA treated tissues to the light source can kill cells."
Alanine,"Alanine: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. It is not essential to the diet, as it can be made by the body from other substances. Alanine was discovered in protein in 1875. Symbol: Ala."
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT),"Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. ALT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood ALT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise ALT levels. ALT is also called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
Alb-,"Alb-: Prefix from the Latin ""albus"" meaning ""white."" As in albino and albinism. The term ""albino"" was first applied by the Portuguese to ""white"" people they encountered in West Africa. Those ""white"" people probably had partial or complete albinism, an inherited lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes."
Albinism,"Albinism: A group of genetic disorders in which there is partial or total lack of the pigment melanin in the eyes, skin, and hair. See also: Albinism, oculocutaneous; Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome."
"Albinism, oculocutaneous","Albinism, oculocutaneous: An hereditary disorder characterized by deficiency of the pigment melanin in the eyes, skin and hair. The lack of eye pigment causes photophobia (sensitivity to light), nystagmus, and decreased visual acuity. Oculocutaneous albinism is conventionally classified as to whether it is tyrosinase-negative or tyrosinase-positive. In the tyrosinase-negative class, there is absence of the enzyme tyrosinase. In the tyrosinase-positive class, tyrosinase is present but it cannot enter pigment cells to do its job and make melanin. There are a number of specific types of oculocutaneous albinism, all of which are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner: Oculocutaneous albinism is also a feature of certain other genetic conditions including the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome."
Albino,"Albino: A person with albinism. The term was first applied by the Portuguese to people in West Africa, who may have had partial or complete albinism."
Albumen,"Albumen: The white of an egg, the part of the egg from which meringues are made. Albus in Latin is white. Not to be confused with ""albumin"" which is the main protein in human blood and the key to the regulation of the osmotic pressure of blood."
Albumin,"Albumin: The main protein in human blood and the key to regulating the osmotic pressure of blood. Chemically, albumin is soluble in water, precipitated by acid, and coagulated by heat."
Albuminuria,"Albuminuria: More than the normal amount of albumin in the urine. Albuminuria can be a sign that protein is leaking through the kidney, most often through the glomeruli, or a sign of significant kidney disease. It may also be the harmless result of vigorous exercise. Also known as proteinuria."
Alcohol,"Alcohol: An organic substance formed when a hydroxyl group is substituted for a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon. The type of alcohol used in alcoholic beverages, ethanol, derives from fermenting sugar with yeast. After alcohol is ingested, the body converts it to sugar-based fuel. Alcohol acts as a central nervous system depressant, and it may be part of solutions used as preservatives, antiseptics, or medications."
Alcohol poisoning,"Alcohol poisoning: A condition in which a toxic amount of alcohol has been consumed, usually in a short period of time. The affected individual may become extremely disoriented, unresponsive, or unconscious, with shallow breathing. Because alcohol poisoning can be deadly, emergency treatment is necessary."
Alcoholism,"Alcoholism is the physical dependence on alcohol to the extent that stopping alcohol use would bring on withdrawal symptoms. In popular and therapeutic parlance, the term may also be used to refer to ingrained drinking habits that cause health or social problems. Treatment requires first ending the physical dependence and then making lifestyle changes that help the individual avoid relapse. In some cases, medication and hospitalization are necessary. Alcohol dependence can have many serious effects on the brain, liver, and other organs of the body, some of which can lead to death. It's also referred to as ethanolism."
Aldosterone,"Aldosterone: A hormone produced by the outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal gland. Aldosterone regulates the balance of water and electrolytes in the body, encouraging the kidney to excrete potassium into the urine and retain sodium, thereby retaining water. It is classified as a mineralocorticoid hormone."
Alembic,"Alembic: A type of still, an apparatus used in the process of distillation. Alembics were employed in chemistry and biomedical laboratories as well as in distilling cognac. By extension, ""alembic"" is anything that refines or transmutes as if by distillation. For example, the alembic of the surgeon's mind. From the Arabic al-anbiq meaning ""the still"" from the Greek word for a still (""ambix""). In Europe, the Arabic word was transmuted in Medieval Latin to ""alembicum."" and later shortened in English to ""alembic."""
Alexia,"Alexia: Loss of the ability to read or understand the written word, due either to brain damage that disconnects these functions or to temporary dysfunction caused by abnormal electrical or chemical activity in the brain."
algia,"algia: Word ending indicating pain, as in arthralgia (joint pain), cephalgia (headache), fibromyalgia, mastalgia (breast pain), myalgia (muscle pain), and neuralgia (nerve pain). Derived from the Greek algos meaning pain."
Alimentary,"Alimentary: Concerning food, nourishment, and the organs of digestion. From the Latin alimentum meaning nourishment."
Alkaline phosphatase,"Alkaline phosphatase: An enzyme that liberates phosphate under alkaline conditions and is made in liver, bone, and other tissues. Alkaline phosphatase can be measured in a routine blood test. Abnormally high serum levels of alkaline phosphatase may indicate bone disease, liver disease, or bile duct obstruction."
Alkaloid,"Alkaloid: A member of a large group of chemicals that are made by plants and have nitrogen in them. Many alkaloids possess potent pharmacologic effects. The alkaloids include cocaine, nicotine, strychnine, caffeine, morphine, pilocarpine, atropine, methamphetamine, mescaline, ephedrine, and tryptamine."
Alkalosis,"Alkalosis: Relatively too much base in the blood and body, an abnormal condition resulting from the accumulation of base or the depletion of acid. The pH of an alkalotic body measures above normal. The opposite of alkalosis is acidosis."
Allelic,"Allelic: Pertaining to an allele, an alternative form of a gene. A single allele is inherited from each parent."
Allergic contact dermatitis,"Allergic contact dermatitis: A red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac or certain preservatives in creams and lotions. This type of reaction reflects a specific sensitivity or allergy to a specific substance. Also called allergic contact eczema."
Allergic reaction,"Allergic reaction: The hypersensitive response of the immune system of an allergic individual to a substance. When an allergen enters the body, it causes the body's immune system to develop an allergic reaction in a person with an allergy to it. This reaction can occur when the immune system attacks a normally harmless substance (the allergen). The immune system calls upon a protective antibody called immunoglobulin E or IgE to fight these invading substances. Even though everyone has some IgE, an allergic person has an unusually large army of these IgE defenders -in fact, too many for their own good. This army of IgE antibodies attacks and engages the invading army of allergic substances of allergens. As is often the case in war, innocent bystanders are affected by this battle. These innocent bystanders are special cells called mast cells. When a mast cell is injured or irritated, it releases a variety of strong chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood that promote allergic reactions. These chemicals are very irritating and cause itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from nearby cells. These allergic chemicals can cause muscle spasm and can lead to lung airway and throat tightening as is found in asthma and loss of voice. They are also what leads to the familiar hay fever or allergic rhinitis and common pink eye."
Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis: Medical term for hay fever, an allergic reaction that mimics a chronic cold. Symptoms include nasal congestion, a clear runny nose, sneezing, nose and eye itching, and tearing of the eyes. Postnasal dripping of clear mucus frequently causes a cough, loss of smell is common, and occasionally loss of taste. Nosebleeds may occur. Also known as June cold and summer cold."
Allergy,"Allergy: A misguided reaction to foreign substances by the immune system, the body system of defense against foreign invaders, particularly pathogens (the agents of infection). The allergic reaction is misguided in that these foreign substances are usually harmless. The substances that trigger allergy are called allergen. Examples include pollens, dust mite, molds, danders, and certain foods. People prone to allergies are said to be allergic or atopic. Although allergies can develop at any age, the risk of developing allergies is genetic. It is related to ones family history of allergy. If neither parent is allergic, the chance for allergies is about 15%. If one parent is allergic, the risk increases to 30% and if both are allergic, the risk is greater than 60%. Allergens cause the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody that all of us have in small amounts. Allergic persons, however, produce IgE in abnormally quantities. Normally, this antibody is important in protecting us from parasites, but not from other allergens. During the sensitization period in allergy, IgE is overproduced. It coats certain potentially explosive cells that contain chemicals including histamine. These chemicals, in turn, cause inflammation and the typical allergic symptoms. This is how the immune system becomes misguided and primed to cause an allergic reaction when stimulated by an allergen. The most common allergic conditions include hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, allergic eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), allergic eczema, hives (urticaria), and allergic shock (also called anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock). For a thumbnail sketch of each of these conditions: Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) is the most common of the allergic diseases and refers to seasonal nasal symptoms that are due to pollens. Year round or perennial allergic rhinitis is usually due to indoor allergens, such as dust mites or molds. Symptoms result from the inflammation of the tissues that line the inside of the nose (mucus lining or membranes) after allergens are inhaled. Adjacent areas, such as the ears, sinuses, and throat can also be involved. The most common symptoms include: Asthma is a breathing problem that results from the inflammation and spasm of the lung's air passages (bronchial tubes). The inflammation causes a narrowing of the air passages, which limits the flow of air into and out of the lungs. Asthma is most often, but not always, related to allergies. Common symptoms include: Allergic eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) is inflammation of the tissue layers (membranes) that cover the surface of the eyeball and the undersurface of the eyelid. The inflammation occurs a result of an allergic reaction and features: Allergic eczema is an allergic rash that is usually not caused by skin contact with an allergen and features the following symptoms: Hives (urticaria) are skin reactions that appear as itchy swellings and can occur on any part of the body. Hives can be caused by an allergic reaction, such as to a food or medication, but they also may occur in non-allergic people. Typical hive symptoms are: Allergic shock (anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock) is a life-threatening reaction that can affect a number of organs at the same time. It typically occurs when the allergen is eaten (for example, foods) or injected (for example, a bee sting). Allergic shock is caused by dilated and ""leaky"" blood vessels, which result in a drop in blood pressure. Some or all of the following symptoms may occur:"
Allogeneic,Allogeneic: Taken from different individuals of the same species. Two or more individuals are said to be allogeneic to one another when the genes at one or more loci are not identical.
Allograft,"Allograft: The transplant of an organ or tissue from one individual to another of the same species with a different genotype. For example, a transplant from one person to another, but not an identical twin, is an allograft. Allografts account for many human transplants, including those from cadaveric, living related, and living unrelated donors. Also known as an allogeneic graft or a homograft."
Allopathic medicine,"Allopathic medicine: Allopathic medicine refers broadly to medical practice that is also termed Western medicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine. The term ""allopathy"" was coined in 1810 by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) to designate the usual practice of medicine (allopathy) as opposed to homeopathy, the system of therapy that he founded. Homeopathy is based on the concept that disease can be treated with minute doses of drugs thought capable of producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself. Although allopathic medicine"" was rejected by mainstream physicians, it was adopted by alternative medicine advocates to refer pejoratively to conventional medicine."
Allopathy,"Allopathy: The system of medical practice which treats disease by the use of remedies which produce effects different from those produced by the disease under treatment. MDs practice allopathic medicine. The term ""allopathy"" was coined in 1842 by C.F.S. Hahnemann to designate the usual practice of medicine (allopathy) as opposed to homeopathy, the system of therapy that he founded based on the concept that disease can be treated with drugs (in minute doses) thought capable of producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself."
Alongshan Virus (ALSV),"Alongshan virus: This is a segmented RNA virus first identified in 2017 in 
China. Alongshan virus (ALSV) belongs to the jingmenvirus group of the family 
Flaviviridae. In northern China, patients who had this viral infection 
also experienced fever and illness. Medical professionals believe the virus 
spreads via tick bites. In addition to fever and a history of tick bites, headache was a symptom of infection, similar to other tick-borne encephalitis virus infections."
Alopecia areata,"Alopecia areata: Patchy baldness that typically begins with rapid hair loss on discrete areas of the scalp and sometimes progresses to complete baldness and even loss of body hair. The characteristic diagnostic finding is short, broken hairs called 'exclamation point' hairs. Alopecia areata affects both males and females and, most often, children and young adults. It seems to be caused by an autoimmune mechanism, wherein the body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Alopecia areata is sometimes associated with allergic disorders, thyroid disease, vitiligo, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and other conditions, and some forms may be inherited. Hair can sometimes regrow within a year without treatment. The longer the period of time of hair loss, the less chance that the hair will regrow."
Alprazolam,"Alprazolam: A benzodiazepine sedative that causes dose-related depression of the central nervous system. Alprazolam is useful in treating anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and muscle spasms. The brand name is Xanax. A generic version is available."
ALT (alanine aminotransferase),"ALT (alanine aminotransferase): An enzyme normally present in liver and heart cells that is released into the bloodstream when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood ALT levels are elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise ALT levels. ALT is also called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
Alternative medicine,"Alternative medicine: Alternative medicine is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. Standard care is what medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, and allied health professionals, such as nurses and physical therapists, practice. Alternative medicine is used in place of standard medical care. An example is treating heart disease with chelation therapy (which seeks to remove excess metals from the blood) instead of using a standard approach. Examples of alternative practices include homeopathy, traditional medicine, chiropractic, and acupuncture. Complementary medicine is different from alternative medicine. Whereas complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. See also complementary medicine, conventional medicine."
Altitude sickness,"Altitude sickness: Altitude sickness (or altitude illness) is a disorder caused by being at high altitude. It more commonly occurs above 8,000 feet (2,440 meters). The cause of altitude illness is a matter of oxygen physiology. At sea level the concentration of oxygen is about 21% and the barometric pressure averages 760 mmHg. As altitude increases, the concentration remains the same but the number of oxygen molecules per breath is reduced. At 12,000 feet (3,658 meters) the barometric pressure is only 483 mmHg, so there are roughly 40% fewer oxygen molecules per breath. In order to oxygenate the body effectively, your breathing rate (even while at rest) has to increase. This extra ventilation increases the oxygen content in the blood, but not to sea level concentrations. Since the amount of oxygen required for activity is the same, the body must adjust to having less oxygen. In addition, high altitude and lower air pressure cause fluid to leak from the capillaries which can cause fluid build-up in both the lungs and the brain. Continuing to higher altitudes without proper acclimatization can lead to potentially serious, even life-threatening illnesses. The prevention of altitude illnesses falls into two categories, proper acclimatization and preventive medications. A few basic guidelines for proper acclimatization are: Preventive medications for altitudes illness are two drugs: one called DIAMOX (acetazolamide) and the other called dexamethasone (a steroid). DIAMOX (acetazolamide) allows a person to breathe faster and so metabolize more oxygen, thereby minimizing the symptoms caused by poor oxygenation. This is especially helpful at night when respiratory drive is decreased. Since it takes a while for DIAMOX to have an effect, it is advisable to start taking it 24 hours before you go to altitude and continue for at least 5 days at higher altitude. Dexamethasone (a steroid) is likewise a prescription drug. It decreases brain and other swelling reversing the effects of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Like DIAMOX, it should be used with caution and only on the advice of a physician because of possible serious side effects. It may be combined with DIAMOX. No other medications have been proven valuable for preventing AMS. (Based in part on the Princeton University Outdoor Action ""Guide to High Altitude: Acclimatization and Illnesses"" by Rick Curtis). This entry does not deal with acute mountain sickness (AMS) or, in any detail, with acclimatization. For information on these topics, please see the respective entries to Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and to Acclimatization."
Alveolar,"Alveolar: Pertaining to the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place in the alveoli which look like cells in a honeycomb. The word comes from the Latin diminutive of ""alveus"" meaning a cavity or hollow = a little cavity or hollow."
Alveolar hydatid disease,"Alveolar hydatid disease: Abbreviated AHD. A parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of a microscopic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. AHD is found worldwide, mostly in northern latitudes. in central Europe, Russia, China, Central Asia, Japan, and North America. In North America E. multilocularis is found primarily in the north central region from eastern Montana to central Ohio, as well as in Alaska and Canada. Human cases have been reported in Alaska, the province of Manitoba, and Minnesota. Prevalence among wild foxes and coyotes is high, and may reach over 50% in some areas; however, even in these areas, transmission to humans has been low. Wild foxes, coyotes, and cats get infected when they eat Echinococcus multilocularis larvae in infected rodents, field mice, or voles. Cats are less susceptible than dogs, but because they probably catch and eat rodents more often, may also become infected. Once the animal becomes infected, the tapeworm matures in its intestine, lays eggs, and the infected animal passes eggs in the stool. These tapeworm eggs, which are directly infectious to other animals, are too tiny to see, and will stick to anything with which they come in contact. Coyotes, foxes, dogs, and cats are not harmed by the tapeworm and do not have symptoms of AHD. Infection can occur by accidentally swallowing the eggs of the E. multilocularis tapeworm. Humans can be exposed to these eggs in two main ways, both of which involve ""hand-to-mouth"" transfer or contamination: For 50 years, E. multilocularis was confined to the Alaskan coast and Canada. Now, because wild coyotes, foxes, and wolves are being trapped and transported to states where E. multilocularis has not previously been found, there is increased risk of spreading the disease to animals and humans. Wild animals carrying the tapeworm could set up the transmission cycle and expose animals not already infected. Many states prohibit this movement of wild animals, but trapping and movement of infected wild canines still occurs. If the transportation and relocation of these animals continues, the risk of human transmission will increase. Although the chances of contracting AHD are low, certain groups may be at greater risk. People at high risk for AHD include trappers, hunters, veterinarians, or others who contact wild foxes, coyotes, or their stool, or household cats and dogs who have the opportunity to eat wild rodents infected with AHD. AHD is caused by tumor-like or cyst-like tapeworm larvae growing in the body. AHD usually involves the liver, but can spread to other organs of the body. Because the cysts are slow-growing, infection with AHD may not produce any symptoms for many years. Pain or discomfort in the upper abdominal region, weakness, and weight loss may occur as a result of the growing cysts. Symptoms may mimic those of liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. The diagnosis is made by a blood test for the presence of the parasite or antibodies to E. multilocularis. Surgery is the most common form of treatment for AHD, although removal of the parasite mass is not usually 100 % effective. After surgery, medication may be necessary to keep the cyst from growing back. If you live in an area where E. multilocularis is found in rodents and wild canines, take the following precautions to avoid infection:"
Alveoli,Alveoli: The plural of alveolus. The alveoli are tiny air sacs within the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place.
Alveolitis,"Alveolitis: Inflammation of the alveoli, the air sacs in the lungs."
Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease: A progressive degenerative disease of the brain that leads to dementia. On a cellular level, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the finding of unusual helical protein filaments in nerve cells of the brain. These twisted filaments are called neurofibrillary tangles. In the brain, Alzheimer's disease involves degeneration of the cortical regions, especially the frontal and temporal lobes. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but new medications and therapies appear to slow its progress and improve the patient's ability to function."
Amastia,"Amastia: A rare condition wherein the normal growth of the breast or nipple does not occur. Unilateral amastia (just on one side) is often associated with absence of the pectoral muscles. Bilateral amastia (with absence of both breasts) is associated in 40% of cases with multiple congenital anomalies (birth defects) involving other parts of the body as well. The condition is thought to be described in the Bible ""We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts"" (Song of Solomon VIII:8). Amastia is distinguished from amazia wherein the breast tissue is absent, but the nipple is present. Amazia typically is a result of radiation or surgery."
Amathophobia,"Amathophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of dust. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize dust poses no threat. From the Greek ""amathos"" (sand) and ""phobos"" (fear)."
Ambidextrous,Ambidextrous: 1. Able to use both the right and left hands with equal dexterity. Neither right- nor left-handed.
Ambient,"Ambient: Surrounding, present on all sides; encompassing. As, the ambient noise is deafening, or the ambient light is blinding. From the Latin ""ambire"" meaning ""to go around."""
Ambiguous genitalia,"Ambiguous genitalia: Genitalia that are neither typically female nor typically male. Also known as intersexual genitalia. Girls (with a 46, XX chromosome constitution) can have virilized genitalia due to excess androgen action. Conversely, the genitalia in boys (with a 46, XY chromosome constitution) can appear undermasculinized or frankly feminized because of lack of androgen action."
Amblyopia,"Amblyopia: Partial or complete loss of vision in one eye caused by conditions that affect the normal development of vision. These conditions include strabismus, in which the eyes are crossed inward (esotropia) or turned outward (exotropia) and anisometropia, in which there is a major difference in refractive error between the two eyes from nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Less common causes of amblyopia include ptosis (drooping) of one eyelid, disease of the cornea (preventing light from entering the eye), congenital cataract, and injury to the eye of a young child. In amblyopia, the brain favors one eye over the other. The other eye is ignored. It is not adequately stimulated and the visual brain cells do not mature normally. Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular blindness, partial or complete blindness in one eye. Amblyopia affects 2 to 3% of children in the US. Treatment of strabismus may involve surgical correction of the eye muscle imbalance. In the case of severe refractive error, it should be corrected by glasses, contact lenses or, if appropriate, lasix. Wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye is a hallowed treatment for amblyopia. Another option is atropine eye drops to blur the vision temporarily in the stronger eye. Weekend atropine provides an improvement in visual acuity of a magnitude similar to that provided by daily atropine in treating moderate amblyopia. The term ""amblyopia"" is sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably with lazy eye. ""Amblyopia"" is made up of ambly- from the Greek ""amblys"" meaning blunt, dull, faint, or dim and -opia from the Greek ""ops"" meaning eye, and refers to vision, so amblyopia is literally dim vision. See also: Anisometropia: Nocturnal amblyopia; Strabismus."
AMC (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita),"AMC (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita): AMC stands for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a disorder that develops before birth (prenatal) is evident at birth (congenital) and involves limited mobility of many (multiple) joints. In AMC, the range of motion of the joints in the arms and legs is usually limited or fixed. Joints affected in AMC may include the shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers and the hips, knees, ankles, and feet -- virtually any and all joints. The impairment of joint mobility in AMC is often accompanied by overgrowth (proliferation) of fibrous tissue in the joints (fibrous ankylosis). AMC was once thought to be a single disease. It is clearly many. The mechanisms responsible for AMC are presumed to be the same as for all arthrogryposis, irrespective of the number of joints involved, and are thought to include: Arthrogryposis means crooking of the joint. It comes from the Greek ""arthro-"", joint + ""gryposis "", crooking. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita can be translated (very roughly) as ""lots of crooked joints at birth."""
Amebiasis,"Amebiasis: The state of being infected with amebae, especially with the ameba Entamoeba histolytica."
Amelioration,"Amelioration: Improvement in a patient's condition, or the activity of making an effort to correct, or at least make more acceptable, conditions that are difficult to endure related to patient's conditions."
Amenia,"Amenia: Better known as amenorrhea, amenia is the absence or cessation of menstruation. Amenorrhea is conventionally divided into primary and secondary amenorrhea. With primary amenorrhea, menstruation never takes place. It fails to occur at puberty. With secondary amenorrhea, menstruation starts but then stops. The absence of menstruation during pregnancy is a form of physiologic amenorrhea, physiologic in the sense that it is completely normal and is not caused by anything pathologic. Amenorrhea during lactation is another type of physiologic amenorrhea. The word ""amenorrhea"" is compounded from three Greek roots ""a-"", no + ""men"", month + ""rhoia"", flow = no monthly flow."
Amenorrhea,"Amenorrhea: Absence or cessation of menstruation. Amenorrhea is conventionally divided into primary and secondary amenorrhea. The absence of menstruation during pregnancy is a form of physiologic secondary amenorrhea, physiologic in the sense that it is completely normal and is not caused by anything medically harmful (pathologic). Amenorrhea during lactation is another type of physiologic secondary amenorrhea. The word ""amenorrhea"" is compounded from three Greek roots ""a-"", no + ""men"", month + ""rhoia"", flow = no monthly flow. Amenorrhea is less commonly called amenia."

AMI,AMI: Acute myocardial infarction.
Amino acid,"Amino acid: One of the20 building blocks from which proteins are assembled. Isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine are deemed 'essential' amino acids because the human body cannot make them and they must be obtained in the diet. Amino acids are sometimes taken orally in supplement form."
Amino acid symbols,"Amino acid symbols: Symbols that stand for the amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Each amino acid has both a three-letter symbol and a single-letter symbol. For example, the three-letter and single-letter symbols for alanine are Ala and A. The three-letter symbols (such as Ala) are much more widely used than the single letter ones (such as A). Therefore, the following list is limited to the three-letter symbols and is further limited to those 20 alpha-amino acids specified by the genetic code: These three-letter symbols for amino acids are used not only to refer to an individual amino acid but also to present the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide or a protein. For example, part of the sequence of insulin reads: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Ala-Ser-Val. The N-terminal residue of the polypeptide or protein is by convention always on the left and the sequence reads from left-to-right toward the C-terminal residue of the polypeptide or protein."
Amino acids,Amino acids: The building blocks of polypeptides and proteins.
Aminotransferase,"Aminotransferase: An enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule. The donor molecule is usually an amino acid and the recipient molecule is usually an alpha-2 keto acid. Two of the best-known enzymes in this class are serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), both of which are normally found primarily in cells in the liver and heart."
Amitriptyline,"Amitriptyline: An antidepressant medication. In some patients with depression, abnormal levels of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters may relate to the depression. Amitriptyline elevates mood by raising the level of neurotransmitters in brain tissue. Amitriptyline is also a sedative that is useful for depressed patients with insomnia, restlessness, and nervousness. It is sometimes used to treat fibromyalgia and symptoms related to chronic pain. Brand names are Elavil and Endep. A generic version is available."
AML,"AML: Acute myeloid leukemia (also known as acute myelogenous leukemia), a quickly progressive malignant disease in which there are too many immature blood-forming cells in the blood and bone marrow, the cells being specifically those destined to give rise to the granulocytes or monocytes, both types of white blood cells that fight infections. In AML, these blasts do not mature and so become too numerous. AML can occur in adults or children. Acute myeloid leukemia is also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The early signs of AML may be similar to the flu or other common diseases with fever, weakness and fatigue, loss of weight and appetite, and aches and pains in the bones or joints. Other signs of AML may include tiny red spots in the skin, easy bruising and bleeding, frequent minor infections, and poor healing of minor cuts. First, blood tests are done to count the number of each of the different kinds of blood cells and see whether they are within normal ranges. In AML, the red blood cell levels may be low, causing anemia; platelet levels may be low, causing bleeding and bruising; and the white blood cell levels may be low, leading to infections. A bone marrow biopsy or a bone marrow aspiration may be done if the results of the blood tests are abnormal. During a bone marrow biopsy, a hollow needle is inserted into the hip bone to remove a small amount of the marrow and bone for examination under a microscope. In a bone marrow aspirate, a small sample of liquid bone marrow is withdrawn through a syringe. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may be done to see if the disease has spread into the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the central nervous system (CNS) -- the brain and spinal cord. Other key diagnostic tests may include flow cytometry (in which cells are passed through a laser beam for analysis), immunohistochemistry (using antibodies to distinguish between types of cancer cells), cytogenetics (to determine chromosome changes in cells), and molecular genetic studies (DNA and RNA tests of the cancer cells). The primary treatment of AML is chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is less common; it may be used in certain cases. Bone marrow transplantation is under study in clinical trials and is coming into increasing use. There are two phases of treatment for AML. The first phase is called induction therapy. The purpose of induction therapy is to kill as many of the leukemia cells as possible and induce a remission, a state in which there is no visible evidence of disease and blood counts are normal. Patients may receive a combination of drugs during this phase including daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone plus cytarabine and thioguanine. Once in remission with no signs of leukemia, patients enter a second phase of treatment. The second phase of treatment is called post-remission therapy (or continuation therapy). It is designed to kill any remaining leukemic cells. In post-remission therapy, patients may receive high doses of chemotherapy, designed to eliminate any remaining leukemic cells. Treatment may include a combination of cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, or cytarabine. There are a number of different subtypes of AML. AML is classified using a system called the French American British (FAB) system. In the this system, the subtypes of AML are grouped according to the particular cell line in which the disease developed. There are eight distinct types of AML, designated M0 through M7. Types M2 (myeloblastic leukemia with maturation) and M4 (myelomonocytic leukemia) each account for 25% of AML; M1 (myeloblastic leukemia, with few or no mature cells) accounts for 15%; M3 (promyelocytic leukemia) and M5 (monocytic leukemia) each account for 10% of cases; the other subtypes are rarely seen. AML is also classified according to the chromosomal abnormalities in the malignant cells. The treatment of the subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) differs from that for other forms of AML. (APL is M3 in the FAB system.) Most APL patients are now treated first with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which induces a complete response in 70% of cases and extends survival. APL patients are then given a course of consolidation therapy, which is likely to include cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and idarubicin. Bone marrow transplantation is used to replace the bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. First, all of the bone marrow in the body is destroyed with high doses of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Healthy marrow is then taken from another person (a donor) whose tissue is the same as or almost the same as the patient's. The donor may be a twin (the best match), a brother or sister, or a person who is otherwise related or not related. The healthy marrow from the donor is given to the patient through a needle in the vein, and the marrow replaces the marrow that was destroyed. A bone marrow transplant using marrow from a relative or from a person who is not related is called an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. A greater chance for recovery occurs if the doctor chooses a hospital that does more than five bone marrow transplantations per year. The overall chance of recovery (the long-term prognosis) depends on the subtype of AML and the patient's age and general health."
Ammonia,"Ammonia: A colorless gas with a very sharp odor. Made both by humans and by nature, ammonia dissolves easily in water and evaporates quickly. Liquid ammonia is found in many household cleaners. Ammonia is irritating to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. Exposure to high concentrations in the air can severely burn the skin, eyes, throat, or lungs. In extreme cases, blindness, lung damage, or death can occur. Breathing lower concentrations causes coughing and nose and throat irritation. Swallowing ammonia may burn the mouth, throat, and stomach. The amount of ammonia produced by humans every year is almost equal to that produced by nature every year. Ammonia is produced naturally in soil by bacteria, decaying plants and animals, and animal wastes. Ammonia is essential for many biological processes. Most of the ammonia produced in chemical factories is used to make fertilizers. The remaining is used in textiles, plastics, explosives, pulp and paper production, food and beverages, household cleaning products, refrigerants, and other products. It is also used in smelling salts."
Amnesia,"Amnesia: An impairment to or lack of memory. Antegrade amnesia refers to a lack of memory of events occurring after a traumatic event, whereas retrograde amnesia refers to lack of memory of events that occurred before the event."
Amnion,"Amnion: A thin membrane that surrounds the fetus during pregnancy. The amnion is the inner of the two fetal membranes (the chorion is the outer one), and it contains the amniotic fluid."
Amok,"Amok: A syndrome first reported in the Malay people, usually male, consisting of a period of brooding followed by a sudden outburst of indiscriminate murderous frenzy, sometimes provoked by an insult, jealousy or sense of desperation. The person who runs amok may also die in a form of murder-suicide. Spelled also amuck. The Malay word for ""furious attack."" Similar syndromes such as cafard in Polynesia and mal de pelea in Puerto Rico are known to occur in other peoples."
Amphetamine,Amphetamine: A drug that has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system that can be both physically and psychologically addictive when overused. Amphetamine has been much abused recreationally. The street term 'speed' refers to stimulant drugs such as amphetamine.
Ampulla,"Ampulla: In anatomy, a sac-like enlargement of a canal or duct. The ampulla of Vater is the enlargement of the ducts from the liver and pancreas at the point where they enter the small intestine. Ampulla in Latin means flask. An ampulla was a flask used in ancient Rome to hold ointment, perfume, and wine."
Amputation,"Amputation: Removal of part or all of a body part that is enclosed by skin. Amputation can occur at an accident site, the scene of an animal attack, or a battlefield. Amputation is also performed as a surgical procedure. It is typically performed to prevent the spread of gangrene as a complication of frostbite, injury, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, or any other illness that impairs blood circulation. It is also performed to prevent the spread of bone cancer and to curtail loss of blood and infection in a person who has suffered severe, irreparable damage to a limb. When performing an amputation, surgeons generally cut above the diseased or injured area so that a portion of healthy tissue remains to cushion bone. Sometimes the location of a cut may depend in part on its suitability to be fitted with an artificial limb, or prosthesis."
Amsler grid,"Amsler grid: While conducting an eye examination, the eye care professional may ask the patient to look at an Amsler grid. This grid is a pattern that resembles a checkerboard. The patient covers one eye and stares at a black dot in the center of the grid. While staring at the dot, the patient may notice that the straight lines in the pattern appear wavy. This kind of wavy pattern on viewing the Amsler grid is abnormal. It can be an important warning sign of what is called wet age-related macular degeneration. The macula is an area in the retina of the eye that is responsible for central (straight-ahead) vision. It deteriorates most often after age 60 resulting in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). An early sign of the dangerous ""wet"" type of AMD is the wavy appearance of the lines on the Amsler grid. The early diagnosis of wet AMD is critical since laser surgery is urgently needed to preserve sight. The Amsler grids shown here are reduced in size; eye care specialists have full-size grids in their office and for the patient to use at home."
Amusia,Amusia: The inability to recognize musical tones or to reproduce them. Amusia can be congenital (present at birth) or be acquired sometime later in life (as from brain damage). Amusia is composed of a- + -musia and literally means the lack of music. Also commonly called tone deafness.
Amygdaloid nucleus,"Amygdaloid nucleus: A small oval structure in the temporal lobe of the brain that is closely connected to the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the cingulate gyrus. The amygdaloid nucleus is part of the olefactory and limbic systems and plays a role in the sense of smell, motivation, and emotional behavior. It was named the amygdaloid nucleus because anatomists thought it was shaped like an almond. From the Greek amydale (almond) + the Greek eidos (like). Also called the amygdala, amygdaloid body, amygdaloid complex, corpus amygdaloideum, and nucleus amygdalae."
Amyl-,"Amyl-: (Amylo- before a consonant.) A prefix pertaining to starch. From the Greek amylon, meaning starch."
Amylase,Amylase: An enzyme produced in the pancreas and salivary glands that helps in the digestion of starches. Elevation of blood amylase is common in pancreatitis.
Amylo-,"Amylo-: (Amyl- before a vowel.) A prefix pertaining to starch. From the Greek amylon, meaning starch."
Amyloidosis,"Amyloidosis: A group of diseases that result from the abnormal deposition of a protein, called amyloid, in various tissues of the body. Amyloid protein can be deposited in a localized area, and it may not be harmful or it may affect only a single tissue of the body. This form of amyloidosis is called localized amyloidosis. Amyloidosis that affects tissues throughout the body is referred to as systemic amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidosis can cause serious changes in organs throughout the body. Amyloidosis can occur as its own entity or secondarily, as a result of another illness, including multiple myeloma, chronic infections (such as tuberculosis or osteomyelitis), or chronic inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis)."
An-,"An-: Prefix very much employed in medicine and all of the health sciences, indicating ""not, without, or -less."" For example, the prefix ""an"" figures into these words: anemia (without blood), anophthalmia (no eye), anotia (no ear), anoxia (no oxygen). The ""an-"" usually becomes ""a-"" before a consonant as, for example, in alexia (not read), aphagia (not eat), aphonia (not voice, voiceless). The prefix ""an-"" comes from the Greek meaning ""not."""
ANA,"ANA: Antinuclear antibody, an unusual antibody directed against structures within the nucleus of the cell. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system is predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one's own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs indicate the possible presence of autoimmunity."
Anaerobic,"Anaerobic: Not requiring oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria, for example, do not require oxygen to grow."
Anaesthesia,Anaesthesia: See: Anesthesia.
Anal fistula,Anal fistula: An opening in the skin near the anus that leads into a blind pouch or may connect through a tunnel with the rectal canal.
Anal papilla,Anal papilla: A skin tag that projects up from the junction between the skin and the inside lining of the anus. Anal papillae tend to occur with anal fissures and may be detected on a digital examination of the anus or with a scope. Removal is only necessary if the anal papillae are causing symptoms.
Anal papillae,Anal papillae: The plural of anal papilla. See: Anal papilla.
Analgesia,Analgesia: The inability to feel pain.
Analgesic,Analgesic: A drug that relieves pain.
Analog,"Analog: In biochemistry, a substance that is similar, but not identical, to another."
Analogous,"Analogous: In anatomy, similar in appearance or function but otherwise different. Two structures may be analogous if they serve the same purpose but differ evolutionary in origin as, for example, human and insect legs. As compared to homologous."
Analysis,"Analysis: In psychology, a term for conversation-based therapeutic processes used to gain understanding of complex emotional or behavioral issues."
Anaphia,"Anaphia: The inability to feel touch. From the Greek prefix an, not + Greek haphe, touch = inability to (feel) touch. A person with anaphia is said to be anaptic."
Anaphylactic shock,"Anaphylactic shock: A widespread and very serious allergic reaction. Symptoms include dizziness, loss of consciousness, labored breathing, swelling of the tongue and breathing tubes, blueness of the skin, low blood pressure, heart failure, and death. Immediate emergency treatment is required for this type of shock, including administration of epinephrine in the case of bee or wasp stings."
Anaphylactoid purpura,"Anaphylactoid purpura: A form of blood vessel inflammation that affects small capillaries in the skin and the kidneys. It results in skin rash associated with joint inflammation (arthritis) and cramping pain in the abdomen. Anaphylactoid purpura frequently follows a bacterial or viral infection of the throat or breathing passages, and it is an unusual reaction of the body's immune system to this infection. It occurs most commonly in children. Generally a mild illness that resolves spontaneously, anaphylactoid purpura can sometimes cause serious problems in the kidneys and bowels. Treatment is directed toward the most significant area of involvement. Also known as Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)."
Anaphylaxis,"Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can include potentially deadly anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis develops within seconds to minutes after contact with an allergen (a substance that someone is allergic to). Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include a Some of the allergens that can trigger an anaphylactic reaction can include insect bites, foods, and certain medications. Those who are at risk for anaphylactic reactions should carry a device for the immediate injection of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis."
Anaptic,"Anaptic: Suffering from an impaired sense of touch, (a state called anaphia) or tactile anesthesia. An anaptic person has anaphia (an, not + Greek haphe, touch = inability to (feel) touch."
Anasarca,"Anasarca: generalized, pronounced swelling (edema) of body tissues due to fluid buildup in subcutaneous tissues."
Anastrozole,Anastrozole: An oral antiestrogen. Anastrozole inhibits the enzyme aromatase in the adrenal glands that produces the estrogens (estradiol and estrone) and thereby lowers their levels. Brand name: Arimidex. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes. This can slow or stop the growth of many types of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. See also: Aromatase inhibitor.
Anatomic orientation terms,"Anatomic orientation terms: In anatomy, certain terms are used to denote orientation. For example, a structure may be horizontal, as opposed to vertical. Some of the terms of anatomic orientation are as follows:"
Anatomical position,"Anatomical position: The position with the body erect with the arms at the sides and the palms forward. The anatomical position is of importance in anatomy because it is the position of reference for anatomical nomenclature. Anatomic terms such as anterior and posterior, medial and lateral, abduction and adduction, and so on apply to the body when it is in the anatomical position."
Anatomy,"Anatomy: The study of human or animal form, by observation or examination of the living being, examination or dissection of dead specimens, microscopic examination, and/or textbooks."
"Anatomy, gross","Anatomy, gross: In medicine, the study of human structures that can be seen with the naked eye."
ANC,"ANC: The absolute neutrophil count, the number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The ANC is not measured directly. It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3). Sample calculation of the ANC:
WBC count: 6,000 cells/mm3 of blood
Segs: 30% of the WBCs
Bands: 3% of the WBCs
Neutrophils (segs + bands): 33% of the WBCs
ANC: 33% X 6,000 = 2,000/mm3
ANC of 2,000/mm3, by convention = 2.0
Normal range: 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3)
Interpretation: Normal Neutrophils are key components in the system of defense against infection. An absence or scarcity of neutrophils (a condition called neutropenia) makes a person vulnerable to infection. After chemotherapy, radiation, or a blood or marrow transplant, the ANC is usually depressed and then slowly rises, reflecting the fact that the bone marrow is recovering and new blood cells are beginning to grow and mature. In practical clinical terms, a normal ANC is 1.5 or higher; a ""safe"" ANC is 500-1500; a low ANC is less than 500. A safe ANC means that the patient's activities do not need to be restricted (on the basis of the ANC)."
Androgen,Androgen: A male sex hormone that promotes the development and maintenance of the male sex characteristics. The major androgen is testosterone.
Androgenic,"Androgenic: Pertaining to the development of male characteristics, including body hair, the genital organs and muscle mass. ""Androgenic"" is the adjective form of the noun ""androgen,"" a word referring to any of the male hormones, including testosterone and androsterone. Androgenic development -- that is, the development of male characteristics -- begins in puberty, the time when a person becomes physically capable of producing offspring. In males, this time most commonly occurs between ages 12 and 14. A deepening voice is one of the signs of androgenic activity. Androgen is produced in males by the testes, the two globe-shaped reproductive organs below the penis, and by the adrenal glands, two small hormone-producing organs that each sit atop a kidney. Androgen is also produced in females in the adrenal glands. Overproduction of androgen can generate some male characteristics in women and exaggerate male characteristics in men. ""Androgenic"" is derived from the Greek words ""andros"" (man) and ""genein"" (to produce)."" Related words include ""androgynous"" (having both male and female characteristics), ""andrology"" (the study of health in males), ""androphobia"" (fear of men) and ""android"" (in science fiction, a manlike robot)."
Android pelvis,"Android pelvis: There are significant differences in the anatomy of the pelvis in the female and male. The android or male pelvis is more robust, narrower, and taller than the female pelvis. The angle of the male pubic arch and the sacrum are narrower as well. The female pelvis is more delicate, wider and not as high as the male pelvis. The angle of the female pubic arch is wide and round. The female sacrum is wider than the male's and the iliac bone is flatter. The pelvic basin of the female is more spacious and less funnel-shaped. From a purely anatomic viewpoint, the female pelvis is better suited to accommodate the fetus during pregnancy and permit the baby to be born."
Anemia,"Anemia: The condition of having a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells or quantity of hemoglobin. Anemia diminishes the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen. Patients with anemia may feel tired, fatigue easily, appear pale, develop palpitations, and become short of breath. Children with chronic anemia are prone to infections and learning problems. The main causes of anemia are bleeding, hemolysis (excessive destruction of red blood cells), underproduction of red blood cells (as in bone marrow diseases), and underproduction of normal hemoglobin (as in sickle cell anemia and in iron deficiency anemia). Women are more likely than men to have anemia because of menstrual blood loss. In children, anemia is most commonly due to insufficient iron in the diet. Anemia is also often due to gastrointestinal bleeding caused by medications, including such common drugs as aspirin and ibuprofen."
Anemic,"Anemic: Relating to anemia, the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased. Persons with anemia may feel tired and fatigue easily, appear pale, develop palpitations (feelings of rapid heart beating) and become unusually short of breath. Children with chronic anemia are prone to infections and learning problems. A person can become anemic by three mechanisms. One or more of these mechanisms must be operating to produce anemia:"
Anesthesia,"Anesthesia: Loss of feeling or awareness, as when an anesthetic is administered before surgery."
Anesthetic,"Anesthetic: A substance that causes lack of feeling or awareness, dulling pain to permit surgery and other painful procedures."
Aneurysm,"Aneurysm: A localized widening (dilatation) of an artery, a vein, or the heart. At the point of an aneurysm, there is typically a bulge. The wall of the blood vessel or organ is weakened and may rupture."
Angelman syndrome,"Angelman syndrome: An important genetic syndrome characterized by severe motor and intellectual retardation, microcephaly (abnormally small head), ataxia, frequent jerky limb movements and flapping of the arms and hands, hypotonia (floppiness), hyperactivity, seizures, absence of speech, frequent smiling and outbursts of laughter, and an unusual facies (facial appearance) characterized by macrostomia (large mouth), a large jaw and open-mouthed expression, and a great propensity for protruding the tongue (tongue thrusting). The name Angelman syndrome is now preferred because the old term ""happy puppet syndrome"" may appear derisive to the child's family. Angelman syndrome is due in most cases to a chromosome deletion involving loss of material from chromosome region 15q11-q13. The loss is consistently of the contribution of chromosome region 15q11-q13 from the mother. This loss is due to a new deletion in most cases. Deletion of chromosome region 15q11-q13 causes both Angelman syndrome and a totally different disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome. However, while the deleted chromosome is of maternal origin in Angelman syndrome, it is the paternal chromosome that is partially deleted in the Prader-Willi syndrome. There are rare families with more than one child with Angelman syndrome. The mode of inheritance in these families is autosomal dominant modified by imprinting."
Anger,"Anger: An emotional state that may range in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage. Anger may have physical effects such as raising the heart rate, blood pressure and the levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline."
Angiitis,Angiitis: Inflammation of the walls of small blood vessels. Also known as vasculitis.
Angina,"Angina: Chest pain due to an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. The pain is typically severe and crushing, and it is characterized by a feeling of pressure and suffocation just behind the breastbone. Angina can accompany or be a precursor of a heart attack."
Angina pectoris,"Angina pectoris: Chest pain due to an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. The pain is typically severe and crushing, and it is characterized by a feeling of pressure and suffocation just behind the breastbone. Angina can accompany or be a precursor of a heart attack."
Angioedema,"Angioedema: Like hives, but affects deeper skin layer."
Angiogenesis,Angiogenesis: The process of developing new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is critically important during the normal development of the embryo and fetus. It also appears to be important during tumor formation.
Angiography,"Angiography: A procedure performed to view blood vessels after injecting them with a radiopaque dye that outlines them on x-ray. This technique can be usefully used to look at arteries in many areas of the body, including the brain, neck (carotids), heart, aorta, chest, pulmonary circuit, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and limbs."
Angiomyolipoma,"Angiomyolipoma: This is a benign (noncancerous) tumor of the kidney. An angiomyolipoma is composed of three types of cells: These benign tumors are usually found in the kidney, but they occasionally occur in the liver and rarely in the ovary, fallopian tube, colon, palate, and spermatic cord. Most angiomyolipomas cause no symptoms or signs. However, even though they are benign tumors, some angiomyolipomas can cause symptoms and signs if the tumor becomes very large or if the blood vessels in the angiomyolipoma start to leak or rupture. In this case, symptoms such as back pain or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, anemia, or high blood pressure may occur. The cause of angiomyolipoma is unknown."
"Angioneurotic edema, hereditary","Angioneurotic edema, hereditary: A genetic form of angioedema. (Angioedema is also referred to as Quinke's disease.) Persons with it are born lacking an inhibitor protein (called C1 esterase inhibitor) that normally prevents activation of a cascade of proteins leading to the swelling of angioedema. Patients can develop recurrent attacks of swollen tissues, pain in the abdomen, and swelling of the voice box (larynx) which can compromise breathing. The diagnosis is suspected with a history of recurrent angioedema. It is confirmed by finding abnormally low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor in the blood. Treatment options include antihistamines and male steroids (androgens) that can also prevent the recurrent attacks. Also called hereditary angioedema."
Angiopathy,"Angiopathy: Disease of the arteries, veins, and capillaries. There are two types of angiopathy: microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. In microangiopathy, the walls of small blood vessels become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood. For example, diabetics may develop microangiopathy with thickening of capillaries in many areas, including the eye. In macroangiopathy, fat and blood clots build up in the large blood vessels, stick to the vessel walls, and block the flow of blood. Macroangiopathy in the heart is coronary artery disease; in the brain, it is cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease is macroangiopathy that affects, for example, vessels in the legs."
Angioplasty,Angioplasty: Procedure with a balloon-tipped catheter to enlarge a narrowing in a coronary artery. Also called Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA).
Angiotensin,Angiotensin: A family of peptides that constrict blood vessels. Narrowing the diameter of the blood vessels causes blood pressure to rise.
Angiotensin converting enzyme,Angiotensin converting enzyme: An enzyme that helps the body regulate blood pressure. Abbreviated ACE.
Angiotensin receptor blocker,Angiotensin receptor blocker: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are medications that block the action of angiotensin II by preventing angiotensin II from binding. See: Angiotensin II receptor blocker.
Angle-closure glaucoma,"Angle-closure glaucoma: This condition can be acute or chronic. It consists of increased pressure in the front chamber (anterior chamber) of the eye due to sudden (acute) or slowly progressive (chronic) blockage of the normal circulation of fluid within the eye. The block takes place at the angle of the anterior chamber formed by its junction of the cornea with the iris. Angle-closure glaucoma tends to affect people born with a narrow angle. Certain races, such as people of Asian and Eskimo ancestry, are at higher risk of developing it. Age and family history are risk factors. It occurs in older women more often than others. When the pupil of the eye is wide open (dilated), the iris is retracted and thickened, and it can block the area around the canal of Schlemm, a drainage pathway for fluid within the eye. Blocking the drainage canal of Schlemm sends the pressure within the eye up. With acute angle-closure glaucoma, there is an abrupt increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the buildup of aqueous (fluid) in the eye. The high pressure can damage the optic nerve (the nerve to the eye) and lead to blindness. The elevated pressure is best detected before the appearance of symptoms. When symptoms of acute angle glaucoma do develop, they may include severe eye and facial pain, nausea and vomiting, decreased vision, blurred vision and seeing haloes around light. The eye in a far advanced case of angle closure glaucoma appears red with a steamy (clouded) cornea and a fixed (nonreactive) dilated pupil. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency because optic nerve damage and vision loss can occur within hours of the onset of the problem. Administering medications to lower the pressure within the eye is done first. In the past, a piece of the iris was then surgically removed in a procedure called an iridectomy to make a hole in the iris and create a channel (other than the canal of Sclemm) to permit the free flow of fluid. Today, a comparable procedure can be done by laser to create a small hole in the iris to keep the intraocular pressure within normal limits. This condition can be chronic (progressing slowly or occurring persistently) or acute (occurring suddenly). Chronic angle-closure glaucoma, like the more common type of glaucoma (open-angle glaucoma), may cause vision damage without symptoms."
Anhedonia,"Anhedonia: Loss of the capacity to experience pleasure. The inability to gain pleasure from normally pleasurable experiences. Anhedonia is a core clinical feature of depression, schizophrenia, and some other mental illnesses. An anhedonic mother finds no joy from playing with her baby. An anhedonic football fan is not excited when his team wins. An anhedonic teenager feels no pleasure from passing the driving test. ""Anhedonia"" is derived from the Greek ""a-"" (without) ""hedone"" (pleasure, delight). Other words derived from ""hedone"" include hedonism (a philosophy that emphasizes pleasure as the main aim of life), hedonist (a pleasure-seeker), and hedonophobia (an excessive and persistent fear of pleasure)."
Anion,"Anion: A negatively charged ion. Pronounced an-I-on. An anion is as opposed to a cation, which is a positively charged ion."
Anion gap,"Anion gap: A measurement of the interval between the sum of ""routinely measured"" cations minus the sum of the ""routinely measured"" anions in the blood. The anion gap = (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-) where Na- is sodium, K+ is potassium, Cl- is chloride, and HCO3- is bicarbonate. The anion gap can be normal, high, or low. A high anion gap indicated metabolic acidosis, the increased acidity of the blood due to metabolic processes. A low anion gap is relatively rare but may occur from the presence of abnormal positively charged proteins, as in multiple myeloma."
Aniso-,"Aniso-: Unequal, unlike, or dissimilar. As in anisocoria, anisocytosis, and anisometropia. From the Greek anisos meaning unequal, from an-, not, + isos, equal. The opposite of aniso- is iso-."
Anisometropia,"Anisometropia: The condition in which the two eyes have unequal refractive power. One eye may be myopic (nearsighted) and the other hyperopic (farsighted) or one eye may be markedly stronger than the other. Anisometropia is a serious concern in newborns and young children because it can lead to amblyopia (impaired vision in one eye). With a major degree of anisometropia, the brain cannot reconcile the difference in images coming from the two eyes. It develops a preference for the image coming from one eye and suppresses the image from the other eye and, in time, the brain loses the ability to ""see"" the image from the suppressed eye. Anisometropia is derived from Greek and made up of four parts: an-, -iso-, -metr-, and -opia. Their meaning (in parentheses) is simple. An- (not) + -iso- (equal) + -metr- (measure) + -opia (vision). Literally, the measure of vision is not equal. The refractive power of the two eyes is different. The opposite of anisotropia is isometropia. In isometropia, the refractive power is equal in both eyes."
Ankle,"Ankle: The ankle joint is complex. It is made up of two joints: the true ankle joint and the subtalar joint: The ends of the bones in the joints of the ankle are covered by cartilage. The major ligaments of the ankle are: the anterior tibiofibular ligament (connecting the tibia to the fibula), the lateral collateral ligaments (attaching the fibula to the calcaneus to give the outside of the ankle stability), and the deltoid ligaments on the inside of the ankle (connecting the tibia to the talus and calcaneus and providing medial stability to the ankle). In medicine, the ankle is the meeting of the leg and the foot; it is strictly the articulation of the tibia, fibula, and the talus. In popular usage, the ankle is often taken to be the ankle joint proper plus the surrounding region including the lower end of the leg and the tarsus, the start of the flat of the foot."
Ankle bone,Ankle bone: The ankle bone is termed the talus. It is the bone of the foot that joins the tibia and fibula to form the ankle joint. Plural tali.
Ankle-foot orthosis,"Ankle-foot orthosis: A brace, usually made of plastic, that is worn on the lower leg and foot to support the ankle, hold the foot and ankle in the correct position and correct foot drop. Abbreviated AFO. Also known as foot drop brace."
Ankyloglossia,"Ankyloglossia: A minor birth defect in which the flap of membrane attached to the underside of the tongue (frenulum) is too short. This shortened frenulum limits the mobility of the tongue. Ankyloglossia is also called tongue tie, from the folk belief that the anomaly causes feeding and speech problems. A child cannot feed or speak properly because the tongue is 'tied.' This antiquated belief is untrue."
Ankylose,Ankylose: To undergo ankylosis (stiffening or fusion of a joint).
Ankylosing,Ankylosing: Having a tendency to stiffen and fuse together.
Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis: A form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. Chronic inflammation in these areas causes pain and stiffness in and around the spine. Over time, chronic spinal inflammation (spondylitis) can lead to a complete cementing together (fusion) of the vertebrae, a process called ankylosis. Ankylosing spondylitis can sometimes be seen in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative and Crohn's colitis)."
Ankylosis,"Ankylosis: Stiffness or, more often, fusion of a joint. From the Greek ankylsis, meaning stiffening of a joint."
Annulus,"Annulus: A ringlike structure, or any body part that is shaped like a ring. Applied to many small ring-shaped structures. The base of a heart valve that supports the valve's leaflets is called the annulus. A ring-shaped pancreas that encircles the duodenum is an annular pancreas. ""Annulus"" is a misspelling of the Latin ""anulus"" (a little ring), the diminutive of the Latin ""anus"" (a ring of more substantial size)."
Anogenital tract,"Anogenital tract: Angiogenital tract is a term used to refer to both the anus and genital tract. The genital tract encompasses the external and internal sex organs in both men and women. The term anogenital tract is often used in the categorization and/or description of disease processes that can affect both of these anatomic regions. For example, infection with certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is associated with the development of cancers of the anogenital tract (cancers of the anus as well as cancers of the genital organs)."
Anomaly,"Anomaly: Any deviation from normal, out of the ordinary. In medicine, an anomaly is usually something that is abnormal at birth."
Anomia,"Anomia: A problem with word finding. Impaired recall of words with no impairment of comprehension or the capacity to repeat the words. In ""The Case of Anna H."" who had anomia, the neurologist/writer Oliver Sacks noted that: ""When I showed her some kitchen matches, she recognized them at once, visually, but could not say the word 'match,' saying instead, 'That is to make fire.'"" Also known as anomic aphasia, amnesic (or amnestic) aphasia, and nominal aphasia."
Anorexia,"Anorexia: An eating disorder characterized by markedly reduced appetite or total aversion to food. Anorexia is a serious psychological disorder. It is a condition that goes well beyond out-of-control dieting. The person with anorexia, most often a girl or young woman, initially begins dieting to lose weight. Over time, the weight loss becomes a sign of mastery and control. The drive to become thinner is thought to be secondary to concerns about control and fears relating to one's body. The individual continues the endless cycle of restrictive eating, often to a point close to starvation. This becomes an obsession and is similar to an addiction to a drug. Anorexia can be life-threatening. Also called anorexia nervosa."
Anorgasmy,"Anorgasmy: Or anorgasmia. Failure of a male or female to achieve an orgasm (climax) during sexual intercourse. Anorgasmia is characterized by psychologists as a ""psychosexual dysfunction,"" a sexual maladjustment that is psychological or emotional in origin. Anorgasmia can result from a variety of problems, including stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, worry, guilt, fear of painful intercourse, fear of pregnancy, the undesirability of a partner, the undesirability of a setting, and use of alcohol or drugs. In women this problem is also referred to as ""frigidity,"" or female orgasmic dysfunction. ""Anorgasmia"" is derived from the Greek ""an"" (without, not), the Greek ""orgasmos"" (swell) and the Greek and Latin ""ia"" (a suffix used in the names of ailments)."
Anoxia,"Anoxia: The absence, or near absence, of oxygen. Anoxia can injure tissues of the body."
Antagonist,Antagonist: A substance that acts against and blocks an action. Antagonist is the opposite of agonist. Antagonists and agonists are key players in the chemistry of the human body and in pharmacology.
Antegrade,"Antegrade: Forward-moving. As in blood flow. Sometimes synonymous with anterograde. From the Latin ante- + gradior, to step."
Anterior,"Anterior: The front, as opposed to the posterior. The anterior surface of the heart is toward the breast bone (the sternum). For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Anterior chamber,"Anterior chamber: The space in the eye that is behind the cornea and in front of the iris. The cornea is the outer, transparent, dome-like structure that covers the iris, pupil, and the anterior chamber. The iris is the colored ring of tissue suspended behind the cornea and immediately in front of the lens; it regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil. The anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid known as the aqueous humor, or aqueous. Produced by a structure alongside the lens called the ciliary body, the aqueous passes first into the posterior chamber (between the lens and iris) and then flows forward through the pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye."
Anterior cruciate ligament,"Anterior cruciate ligament: A ligament in the knee that crosses from the underside of the femur (the thigh bone) to the top of the tibia (the bigger bone in the lower leg). Abbreviated ACL. Injuries to the ACL can occur in a number of situations, including sports, and can be quite serious, requiring surgery. The anterior cruciate ligaments, one on either side of the knee, are so called because they cross each other in front of the knee. ""Cruciate"" taken from the Latin ""crux"" for ""cross"" means ""in the form of a cross."" See: Anterior cruciate injury."
Antero-,"Antero-: Prefix signifying before, earlier, front. From the Latin anterior meaning before."
Anterolisthesis,"Anterolisthesis: The forward positioning of one spinal vertebra in relation to the adjacent vertebra beneath it. Anterolisthesis can be graded: Grade 1 is less than 25% slippage, grade 2 between 25%-50% slippage, grade 3 between 50%-75% slippage, and grade 4 greater than 75% slippage. Symptoms of anterolisthesis depend on the severity, location, and cause. The opposite of anterolisthesis is retrolisthesis or backward positioning of one vertebra in relation to the adjacent vertebra beneath it."
Anteroposterior,"Anteroposterior: From front to back. When a chest x-ray is taken with the back against the film plate and the x-ray machine in front of the patient it is called an anteroposterior (AP) view. As opposed to from back to front (which is called posteroanterior). For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Anteroposterior (AP),"Anteroposterior (AP): In anatomy, AP stands for anteroposterior: from front-to-back. For example, an AP X-ray of the chest is taken from front-to-back. AP in this respect is the opposite of PA, which stands for posteroanterior: from back-to-front."
Anthrax,"Anthrax: A serious bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis that occurs primarily in animals. Cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and some wild animals are highly susceptible. Humans and swine are generally quite resistant to anthrax. Humans become infected when the spores of B. anthracis enter the body by contact with animals infected with B. anthracis or from contact with contaminated animal products, insect bites, ingestion, or inhalation. Aerosolized (""weaponized"") spores of B. anthracis can potentially be used (misused) for biological warfare and bioterrorism. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of the disease and is characterized by the development of a localized skin lesion with a central eschar surrounded by marked edema (swelling). Inhalation anthrax (woolsorters' disease) typically involves hemorrhagic mediastinitis (bleeding into the mid-chest), rapidly progressive systemic (bodywide) infection, and carries a very high mortality rate. Gastrointestinal anthrax is much rarer but is also associated with a high mortality rate. Anthrax can, as mentioned, take different forms. One is the pulmonary (lung) form of the disease. It is contracted by inhaling a large dose of the anthrax spores, typically in an enclosed space protected from direct sunlight. (The spores are quickly killed by sunlight.) If pulmonary anthrax is untreated, it is usually fatal. An intestinal form of anthrax is caused by eating meat contaminated with anthrax. But most human anthrax comes from skin contact with animal products contaminated by anthrax. Cutaneous (skin) anthrax was once well known among people who handled infected animals (farmers, woolsorters, tanners, brushmakers and carpetmakers in the days when the brushes and carpets were animal products). The hallmark of skin anthrax is a carbuncle, a cluster of boils, that ulcerates. Typically, the carbuncle has a hard black center surrounded by bright red inflammation. This dramatic appearance accounts for its name, ""anthrax"", the Greek word for ""coal"", a burning coal. The cutaneous form of anthrax is treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin (Cipro). The pulmonary form of anthrax is an emergency and calls for early continuous IV antibiotics (such as penicillin in combination with streptomycin). There is an anthrax vaccine for persons at high risk (such as members of the armed forces). However, the only anthrax vaccine currently made in the USA is experiencing problems with production standardization. Bioterrorism -- The General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of the US Congress, in a 1999 report considered anthrax as a ""possible"" biologic threat for terrorism, but noted that a virulent strain of the bacterium is difficult to acquire and that an attack would require sophistication to manufacture and disseminate the bacteria. The GAO considered the lethal effects of anthrax to be ""very high."" In the autumn of 2001, anthrax was no longer a ""possible"" biologic threat for terrorism. With its distribution through the mail in the US, anthrax became a 21st-century agent of bioterrorism."
Anti-,"Anti-: Prefix generally meaning ""against, opposite or opposing, and contrary."" In medicine, anti- often connotes ""counteracting or effective against"" as in antibacterial, anti-infective, and antiviral. Sometimes medical terms containing anti- take on new meanings as has occurred with antibiotic and antibody. As a prefix, anti- may be shortened to ant- as in antacid. ""Anti"" is the Greek word for ""against."""
Anti-infective,"Anti-infective: An agent that is capable of acting against infection, either by inhibiting the spread of an infectious agent or by killing the infectious agent outright."
Antibacterial,"Antibacterial: Anything that destroys bacteria or suppresses their growth or their ability to reproduce. Heat, chemicals such as chlorine, and antibiotic drugs all have antibacterial properties. Many antibacterial products for cleaning and handwashing are sold today. Such products do not reduce the risk for symptoms of viral infectious diseases in otherwise healthy persons. This does not preclude the potential contribution of antibacterial products to reducing symptoms of bacterial diseases in the home."
Antibiotic,"Antibiotic: A drug used to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics have no effect on viral infections. Originally, an antibiotic was a substance produced by one microorganism that selectively inhibits the growth of another. Synthetic antibiotics, usually chemically related to natural antibiotics, have since been produced that accomplish comparable tasks. In 1926, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a substance produced by fungi that appeared able to inhibit bacterial growth. In 1939, Edward Chain and Howard Florey further studied penicillin and later carried out trials of penicillin on humans (with what were deemed fatal bacterial infections). Fleming, Florey and Chain shared the Nobel Prize in 1945 for their work which ushered in the era of antibiotics. Another antibiotic, for example, is tetracycline, a broad-spectrum agent effective against a wide variety of bacteria including Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and many others. The first drug of the tetracycline family, chlortetracycline, was introduced in 1948."
Antibody,"Antibody: An immunoglobulin, a specialized immune protein, produced because of the introduction of an antigen into the body, and which possesses the remarkable ability to combine with the very antigen that triggered its production. The production of antibodies is a major function of the immune system and is carried out by a type of white blood cell called a B cell (B lymphocyte). Antibodies can be triggered by and directed at foreign proteins, microorganisms, or toxins. Some antibodies are autoantibodies and home in against our own tissues. The term ""antibody"" dates to 1901. Prior to that time, an ""antibody"" referred to any of a host of different substances that served as ""bodies"" (foot soldiers) in the fight against infection and its ill effects."
Anticholinergic,"Anticholinergic: Opposing the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Anticholinergic drugs inhibit the transmission of parasympathetic nerve impulses, thereby reducing spasms of smooth muscles (for example, muscles in the bladder). Side effects of anticholinergic medications include dry mouth and related dental problems, blurred vision, tendency toward overheating (hyperpyrexia), and in some cases, dementia-like symptoms."
Anticoagulant,"Anticoagulant: An agent that is used to prevent the formation of blood clots. Anticoagulants have various uses. Some are used for the prevention or treatment of disorders characterized by abnormal blood clots and emboli. Examples of diseases and conditions that require anticoagulant treatment to reduce the risk of blood clots include heart attack, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. There are different classes of anticoagulant drugs:"
Anticoagulant agent,"Anticoagulant agent: A medication used to prevent the formation of blood clots and to maintain open blood vessels. Anticoagulants are called blood ""thinners,"" but they do not thin the blood, they only prevent or reduce clots, or thrombi. Anticoagulants have various uses. Some are used for the prophylaxis (prevention) or the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, such as stroke, heart attack (myocardial infarction) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Emboli are clots that break free, travel through the bloodstream, and lodge in a blood vessel, such as a Pulmonary embolism. The anticoagulant drugs used for these clinical purposes include: Anticoagulant solutions are also used for the preservation of stored whole blood and blood fractions. These anticoagulants include heparin and acid citrate dextrose (commonly called ACD). Anticoagulants are also used to keep laboratory blood specimens from clotting. These agents include not only heparin but also several agents that make calcium ions unavailable to the clotting process and so prevent the formation of clots; these agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (commonly called EDTA), citrate, oxalate and fluoride."
Anticonvulsant,"Anticonvulsant: A medication used to control (prevent) seizures (convulsions) or stop an ongoing series of seizures. There are a large number of anticonvulsant drugs today including, but not limited to: phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine, levetiracetam (Keppra), ethosuximide (Zarontin), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and midazolam (Versed). Anticonvulsant drugs taken during pregnancy put the baby at risk of major birth defects -- growth retardation, microcephaly (a small head) and deformities of the face and fingers -- a condition known as anticonvulsant embryopathy."
Antidepressant,"Antidepressant: Anything, and especially a drug, used to prevent or treat depression. The available antidepressant drugs include the SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants, and others. Antidepressants should not be used unless the depression is severe and/or other treatments have failed. As with all drugs, the use of antidepressants requires monitoring for side effects, and suicide should be considered a possible side effect of the newer antidepressants, particularly in children and adolescents."
Antidepressants,"Antidepressants: Anything, and especially a drug, used to prevent or treat depression. The available antidepressant drugs include the SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants, and others. Examples of SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include: Examples of MAOIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors include: Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include: The tetracyclic antidepressant is maprotiline (Ludiomil). Other antidepressant drugs include: Antidepressants should not be used unless the depression is severe and/or other treatments have failed. As with all drugs, the use of antidepressants requires monitoring for side effects, and suicide should be considered a possible side effect of the newer antidepressants."
Antidiabetic agent,Antidiabetic agent: A substance that helps a person with diabetes control their level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Antidiabetic agents include insulin and the oral hypoglycemic agents.
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH),"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): A relatively small (peptide) molecule that is released by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain after being made nearby (in the hypothalamus). ADH has an antidiuretic action that prevents the production of dilute urine (and so is antidiuretic). A syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH results in the inability to put out dilute urine, perturbs fluid (and electrolyte) balance, and causes nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, confusion and convulsions. This syndrome may occur in association with oat-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and Hodgkin's disease as well as a number of other disorders. ADH also can stimulate contraction of arteries and capillaries. ADH is also known as vasopressin."
Antidote,Antidote: A drug that counteracts a poison.
Antiemetics,"Antiemetics: 1. As a noun, a drug taken to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting. As, for example, the antihistamine meclizine hydrochloride (Bonine).
2. As an adjective, pertaining to the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting. Opening a window in a car can have an antiemetic effect.
From anti- + emetic."
Antiestrogen,"Antiestrogen: A substance that can prevent the full expression of estrogen. Antiestrogens act by exerting antagonistic effects on target tissues (androgens and progestogens act in this way) or by competing with estrogens for access to receptor sites located on the cell surface. For example, the drug tamoxifen (brand name: Nolvadex) is an antiestrogen that is used in the treatment of breast cancer and to reduce the breast cancer incidence in high-risk women."
Antifungal,Antifungal: A medication that limits or prevents the growth of yeasts and other fungal organisms.
Antifungal agent,"Antifungal agent: A drug used to treat fungal infections. Examples of antifungal drugs include miconazole (MONISTAT) and clotrimazole (LOTRIMIN, MYCELEX)."
Antifungal medication,"Antifungal medication: A drug used to treat fungal infections. Examples of antifungal drugs include miconazole (MONISTAT) and clotrimazole (LOTRIMIN, MYCELEX)."
Antigen,Antigen: A substance that the immune system perceives as being foreign or dangerous. The body combats an antigen with the production of an antibody.
Antihistamines,"Antihistamines: Drugs that combat the histamine released during an allergic reaction by blocking the action of the histamine on the tissue. Antihistamines do not stop the formation of histamine nor do they stop the conflict between the IgE and antigen. Therefore, antihistamines do not stop the allergic reaction but protect tissues from some of its effects. Antihistamines frequently cause mouth dryness and sleepiness. Newer non-sedating antihistamines are generally thought to be somewhat less effective. Antihistamine side effects that very occasionally occur include urine retention in males and fast heart rate."
Antihypertensive,Antihypertensive: Something that reduces high blood pressure (hypertension).
Antimalarial,"Antimalarial: A drug directed against malaria. The original antimalarial agent was quinine which took its name from the Peruvian Indian word ""kina"" meaning ""bark of the tree."" A large and complex molecule, quinine is the most important alkaloid found in cinchona bark. Until World War I, it was the only effective treatment for malaria. In fact, quinine was the first chemical compound to be successfully used to treat an infectious disease. Quinine was isolated in crystalline form in 1820 by J.B. Caventou and P.J. Pelletier. In one of the classical achievements of synthetic organic chemistry, R.B. Woodward and W. Doering first made synthetic quinine in 1944. Quinine acts by interfering with the growth and reproduction of the Plasmodium, the malarial parasite that lives within the victim's red blood cells. Quinine causes the parasites to disappear from the blood and the symptoms of the disease are thereby alleviated. However, when quinine treatment ends, many patients relapse. They suffer another attack of malaria due to the failure of quinine to kill the malarial parasites in cells of the body other than the red blood cells. These parasites persist and, after a time, they reinvade the red blood cells and precipitate the relapse. Since quinine does not permanently cure malaria, better drugs were sought. A number were discovered that replaced quinine during and after World War II. Some of these drugs (such as chloroquine and chloroguanide) are more effective than quinine in suppressing the growth of the blood forms of the malarial parasite. Others (such as primaquine and pyrimethamine) act upon both the blood and tissue phases of the parasite, producing a complete cure and preventing a relapse. Quinine was once used for the treatment of leg cramps, but it is no longer FDA approved for this use, due to serious side effects, including low platelet counts and death."
Antimetabolite,"Antimetabolite: A drug that is similar enough to a natural chemical to participate in a normal biochemical reaction in cells but different enough to interfere with the normal division and functions of cells. So named because the drug inhibits a normal metabolic process. Examples of antimetabolites include 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), methotrexate, and hydroxyurea."
Antimicrobial,"Antimicrobial: A drug used to treat a microbial infection. ""Antimicrobial"" is a general term that refers to a group of drugs that includes antibiotics, antifungals, antiprotozoals, and antivirals."
Antimicrobial agent,"Antimicrobial agent: A general term for drugs, chemicals, or other substances that either kill or slow the growth of microbes. Among the antimicrobial agents are antibacterial drugs, antiviral agents, antifungal agents, and antiparasitic drugs."
Antimicrobial drug,"Antimicrobial drug: A drug used to treat a microbial infection. ""Antimicrobial"" is a general term that refers to a group of drugs that includes antibiotics, antifungals, antiprotozoals, and antivirals."
Antimony,"Antimony: A silvery-white earth metal which at high levels can be toxic. Antimony occurs naturally in the earth. Antimony ores are mined and then mixed with other metals to form antimony alloys or combined with oxygen to form antimony oxide. Antimony breaks easily, but when mixed into alloys, it is used in lead storage batteries, solder, sheet and pipe metal, bearings, castings, and pewter. Antimony oxide is added to textiles and plastics to prevent them from catching fire and is also used in paints (especially enamels), ceramics, and fireworks. Antimony is released into the environment from natural sources and industry. In the air, antimony attaches to very small particles that may stay there for many days. Most antimony ends up in soil, where it attaches strongly to particles that contain iron, manganese, or aluminum. Antimony is found at low levels in some rivers, lakes, and streams. Because antimony is found naturally in the environment, the general population is exposed to low levels of it every day, primarily in food, drinking water, and air. It may be found in air near industries that process or release it, such as smelters, coal-fired plants, and refuse incinerators. Workers in industries that process it or use antimony ore may be exposed to higher levels. Exposure to antimony at high levels can result in a variety of adverse health effects. Breathing high levels for a long time can irritate the eyes and lungs and can cause heart and lung problems, stomach pain and ulcers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Ingesting large doses of antimony can also cause vomiting. Antimony can irritate the skin if it is left on it. Antimony is known to trigger lichen planus -- a recurring itchy inflammatory rash on the skin or in the mouth. Antimony can have beneficial effects. Antimony-containing compounds (meglumine antimonate and sodium stibogluconate) are the principal medications used to treat leishmaniasis (kala-azar), an infection caused by a protozoan parasite. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows 0.006 parts of antimony per million parts (0.006 ppm) of drinking water. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an occupational exposure limit of 0.5 milligrams of antimony per cubic meter of air (0.5 mg/m3) for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) currently recommend the same guidelines for the workplace as OSHA."
Antineoplastic,"Antineoplastic: Acting to prevent, inhibit or halt the development of a neoplasm (a tumor). An agent with antineoplastic properties. For example, oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) is an antineoplastic used in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer. The term is applicable to dozens of other chemotherapy agents used to treat this an other forms of cancer."
Antioxidant,"Antioxidant: A substance that reduces damage due to oxygen, such as that caused by free radicals. Well-known antioxidants include enzymes and other substances, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene, which are capable of counteracting the damaging effects of oxidation. Antioxidants are also commonly added to food products such as vegetable oils and prepared foods to prevent or delay their deterioration from the action of air. Antioxidants may possibly reduce the risks of cancer. Antioxidants clearly slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration."
Antiprotozoal,"Antiprotozoal: Something that destroys protozoa or inhibits their growth and ability to reproduce. A few of the protozoa of medical importance include Plasmodium (the cause of malaria); Entamoeba histolytica (the cause of amebiasis, amebic dysentery) and Trichomonas vaginalis (a cause of vaginal infection); and Pneumocystis carinii (a common cause of pneumonia in immunodeficient persons). Some antiprotozoal drugs include the antimalarials Aralen (chloroquine), Daraprim (pyrimethamine), Lariam (mefloquine) and Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine); Flagyl (metronidazole) which is active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis; and Mepron (atovaquone) for Pneumocystis carinii."
Antiprotozoal drug,"Antiprotozoal drug: Something that destroys protozoa or inhibits their growth and ability to reproduce. A few of the protozoa of medical importance include Plasmodium (the cause of malaria); Entamoeba histolytica (the cause of amebiasis, amebic dysentery) and Trichomonas vaginalis (a cause of vaginal infection); and Pneumocystis carinii (a common cause of pneumonia [PCP] in immunodeficient persons). Some antiprotozoal drugs include the antimalarials Aralen (chloroquine), Daraprim (pyrimethamine), Lariam (mefloquine) and Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine); Flagyl (metronidazole) which is active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis; and Mepron (atovaquone) for Pneumocystis carinii."
Antipsychotic,"Antipsychotic: A medication (or another measure) that is believed to be effective in the treatment of psychosis. For example, aripiprazole (Abilify) is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia."
Antipyretic,"Antipyretic: Something that reduces fever or quells it. There are 3 classes of antipyretic medications that are sold OTC (over-the-counter) without prescription: From anti-, against + the Greek pyretos, fever from pyr, fire. The same root gives rise to pyrexia, a medical term for fever."
Antiretroviral,"Antiretroviral: An agent or process effective against a retrovirus. For example, a drug to treat HIV."
Antisepsis,"Antisepsis: Prevention of infection by inhibiting or arresting the growth and multiplication of germs (infectious agents). Antisepsis implies scrupulously clean and free of all living microorganisms. From the Greek roots anti- meaning against + sepsis against putrefaction = literally, against putrefaction."
Antiseptic,"Antiseptic: Something that discourages the growth of microorganisms. By contrast, aseptic refers to the absence of microorganisms."
Antispasmodic,"Antispasmodic: A medication that relieves, prevents, or lowers the incidence of muscle spasms, especially those of smooth muscle such as in the bowel wall."
Antithyroid drug,"Antithyroid drug: A drug directed against the thyroid gland. The antithyroid drugs include carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil (PTU). These drugs are used to treat hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland) in order to reduce the excessive thyroid activity before surgery and to treat and maintain patients not having surgery. Carbimazole, its active metabolite methimazole, and propylthiouracil all act by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase and in that way they block the synthesis (the production) of thyroid hormone. About 30 to 40% of patients treated with an antithyroid drug remain euthyroid (with normal levels of thyroid hormone) 10 years after the discontinuation of antithyroid drug therapy, which means that the Graves' disease (the most common cause of hyperthyroidism) is in remission. A common problem with antithyroid drugs is undershooting or overshooting causing persistent hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. A rare complication of antithyroid therapy is agranulocytosis (decrease in white blood cells) which calls for immediate discontinuation of the drug."
Antitoxin,"Antitoxin: An antibody produced in response to and capable of neutralizing a specific biologic toxin such as those that cause diphtheria, gas gangrene, or tetanus. Antitoxins are used prophylactically and therapeutically."
Antiviral,"Antiviral: An agent that kills a virus or that suppresses its ability to replicate and, hence, inhibits its capability to multiply and reproduce. For example, amantadine (Symmetrel) is a synthetic antiviral. It acts by inhibiting the multiplication of the influenza A virus. It was used to lessen the severity of the disease, particularly in individuals at high-risk such as those who are immunosuppressed or in a nursing home. Amantadine has been replaced by safer medicines, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) which have fewer side effects. The development of antivirals has lagged far behind that of antibiotics. A virus is just genetic material, DNA or RNA, perhaps with a few enzymes, wrapped in a protein coat. A viral is technically not alive which makes it hard to kill. Further, viruses replicate (make copies of themselves) by hijacking the machinery of the cell they infect, so it is difficulty to kill the virus without killing the cell. Some viruses can also remain dormant in the body without replicating, thereby avoiding drugs that inhibit replication. The antivirals that have been developed are generally less effective than one would like. Viruses can replicate rapidly and, in many cases sloppily, giving rise to mutations that make them resistant to drugs. And for fast-moving viral infections like flu or a cold, a drug must be very powerful to make a difference before the disease runs its natural course."
Antrum,"Antrum: A general term for a nearly closed cavity or chamber. For example, the antrum of the stomach (gastric antrum) is a portion before the outlet, which is lined by mucosa and does not produce acid. The paranasal sinuses can be referred to as the frontal antrum, ethmoid antrum, and maxillary antrum."
Anus,Anus: The opening of the rectum to the outside of the body.
Anxiety,"Anxiety: A feeling of apprehension and fear, characterized by physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and feelings of stress."
Anxiety disorder,"Anxiety disorder: A chronic condition characterized by an excessive and persistent sense of apprehension, with physical symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, and feelings of stress. Treatments include the comfort offered by understanding the condition, avoiding or desensitizing exacerbating situations, and medications."
AOA,"AOA: Abbreviation for Alpha Omega Alpha, the medical honor society, the medical school equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa, in the United States and Canada. Membership is by election for distinguished academic achievement. Medical students, house officers, and medical school alumni and faculty are eligible for election. AOA is also the abbreviation for the American Osteopathic Association and the American Optometric Association. History of Alpha Omega Alpha: ""When William Webster Root and 5 other medical students at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Chicago organized AOA in 1902, excellence was hardly the word that would describe American medical education. Indeed, the founder viewed the society as a protest against ""a condition which associated the name medical student with rowdyism, boorishness, immorality, and low educational ideals."" Of the approximately 25,000 medical students in the United States at the turn of the century, no more than 15 percent were college graduates. The only requirement in most schools was a high school diploma or its equivalent; the latter often meaning the ability to pay the fee. The schools themselves-there were about 150-were by and large of dubious quality. In his landmark study of medical education in the United States and Canada, published in 1910, Abraham Flexner found so-called medical schools located in storefronts, tenements, and warehouses, their laboratory equipment consisting of a couple of microscopes, some moldy slides, and a lonely skeleton. With a few exceptions, notably the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, founded in 1893, the medical school curriculum consisted of a series of lectures, sometimes supplemented by demonstrations at the bedside or in the laboratory, if such existed. These, then, were the circumstances under which Root and his fellow medical students met to form a society that would foster honesty and formulate higher ideals of scholastic achievement."""
Aorta,"Aorta: The largest artery in the body, the aorta arises from the left ventricle of the heart, goes up (ascends) a little ways, bends over (arches), then goes down (descends) through the chest and through the abdomen to where ends by dividing into two arteries called the common iliac arteries that go to the legs. Anatomically, the aorta is traditionally divided into the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta. The descending aorta is, in turn, subdivided into the thoracic aorta (that descends within the chest) and the abdominal aorta (that descends within the belly). The aorta gives off branches that go to the head and neck, the arms, the major organs in the chest and abdomen, and the legs. It serves to supply them all with oxygenated blood. The aorta is the central conduit from the heart to the body."
Aortal,"Aortal: Pertaining to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Aortal is not often encountered (except in The New York Times crossword). The preferred term is aortic."
Aortic,"Aortic: Pertaining to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. ""Aortic"" is in common usage as, for example, in an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The term ""aortal"" has the same meaning but is rarely encountered (except in The New York Times crossword)."
Aortic aneurysm,"Aortic aneurysm: An outpouching (a local widening) of the largest artery in the body, the aorta, involving that vessel in its course above the diaphragm (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or, more commonly, below the diaphragm (abdominal aortic aneurysm). The diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm can be straight forward or difficult. Around 1900 the eminent physician William Osler said: ""There is no disease more conducive to clinical humility than aneurysm of the aorta."" At the area of the aneurysm, there is typically a bulge and the wall is weakened and may rupture. Because of the volume of blood flowing under relatively high pressure through the aorta, a ruptured aneurysm of the aorta is a catastrophe. The word ""aneurysm"" comes from the Greek ""aneurysma"" meaning ""a widening."""
Aortic arch,"Aortic arch: The second section of the aorta following the ascending aorta. As it continues from the heart, it gives off the brachiocephalic trunk, and the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. The brachiocephalic trunk splits to form the right subclavian and the right common carotid arteries, which supply blood to the right arm and the right side of the neck and head. The left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery, the second and third branches off the aortic arch, perform parallel functions on the left side."
Aortic regurgitation,"Aortic regurgitation: The return of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle of the heart due to aortic valve insufficiency, incomplete closure of the aortic valve."
Aortic stenosis,"Aortic stenosis: Narrowing (stenosis) of the aortic valve, the valve between the left ventricle of the heart and the aorta. This narrowing impedes the delivery of blood to the body through the aorta and makes the heart work harder. The need for surgery depends on the degree of stenosis. A procedure called balloon valvuloplasty has been used in some cases of aortic stenosis."
Aortic valve,"Aortic valve: One of the four valves in the heart, this valve is situated at exit of the left ventricle of the heart where the aorta (the largest of all arteries) begins. The aortic valve lets blood from the left ventricle be pumped up (ejected) into the aorta but prevents blood once it is in the aorta from returning to the heart."
Aortitis,Aortitis: Inflammation of the aorta. The causes of aortitis include syphilis and rheumatic fever.
AP,"AP: AP is a versatile abbreviation. It serves in cardiology to abbreviate angina pectoris (AP) and arterial pressure (AP). In endocrinology, it stands for the anterior pituitary (AP). And in anatomy, AP means anteroposterior, i.e., from front-to-back."
"AP, X-ray","AP, X-ray: An X-ray picture in which the beams pass from front-to-back (anteroposterior). As opposed to a PA (posteroanterior) film in which the rays pass through the body from back-to-front."
APA,APA: 1. American Psychiatric Association. 2. American Psychological Association. 3. American Podiatry Association. 4. Antiphospholipid antibody. 5. Alkaline phosphatase activity.
APC,"APC: APC has several very different meanings in medicine. See each of the following separate entries:
1. APC (gene).
2. APC (immunology).
3. APC (medication)."
APC (immunology),"APC (immunology): Antigen-presenting cell, a cell that can ""present"" antigen in a form that T cells can recognize it. Among the APCs are B cells and cells of the monocyte lineage including macrophages."
APC (medication),"APC (medication): Aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine (a pill containing all three). Phenacetin was the first nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to be associated with kidney failure."
APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy),"APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy): A genetic autoimmune disease with an extraordinary array of clinical features but characterized most often by at least 2 of the following 3 findings: hypoparathyroidism -- under function of the parathyroid glands which control calcium, candidiasis (yeast infection), and adrenal insufficiency (under function of the adrenal gland). APECED was the first systemic (bodywide) autoimmune disease found due to a defect in a single gene. By ""autoimmune"" is meant that the immune system (which normally wards off foreign invaders of the body) turns and attacks tissues such as skin, joints, liver, lungs, and other organs) of the body. Examples of common systemic autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, Sjogren syndrome, scleroderma, Goodpasture syndrome, vitiligo, Addison disease, thyroiditis, and many others. In 1997 a novel gene was identified that mapped to chromosome region 21q22.3. The gene was named AIRE for autoimmune regulator. Changes in the AIRE gene are responsible for APECED. APECED is inherited as a recessive trait such that a child with the disease has received 2 changed (mutant) AIRE genes, one from each parent. Although APECED is generally rare, it is more frequent in 3 genetically isolated populations: the Finnish, Iranian Jews, and Sardinians. The child with APECED develops problems in numerous glands (polyglandular) including hypoparathyroidism, hypogonadism (with sex gland failure), adrenal insufficiency, type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes with insufficient insulin production by the pancreas gland, and latent hypothyroidism (under function of the thyroid gland). Other features of APECED are total baldness (alopecia totalis), inflammation of the cornea and whites of the eye (keratoconjunctivitis), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the enamel of the teeth, childhood-onset moniliasis (yeast infection), juvenile-onset pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal problems (malabsorption, diarrhea), and chronic active hepatitis. The laboratory studies in APECED attest to an immune disease with an abnormally low level of gammaglobulin antibodies in blood (hypogammaglobulinemia) and an abnormally low T4/T8 white blood cell ratio (as in AIDS). There is specific evidence for autoimmunity with antibodies directed against the adrenal and thyroid glands and against cell nuclei (antiadrenal, antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies). The treatment of APECED is directed at treating the specific problems: replacing the various hormones that are in short supply, giving insulin for the diabetes, treating the yeast infections, etc. However, there is no known cure for APECED. The prognosis (outlook) depends on whether the critical hormone deficiencies are remedied and especially whether the infections can be successfully controlled. APECED goes by a confusing array of other names including autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS), polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome, hypoadrenocorticism with hypoparathyroidism and superficial moniliasis, and polyglandular deficiency syndrome. Syndrome, autoimmune polyglandular (APS): A genetic autoimmune disease with an extraordinary array of clinical features but characterized most often by at least 2 of the following 3 findings: hypoparathyroidism -- underfunction of the parathyroid glands which control calcium, candidiasis (yeast infection), and adrenal insufficiency (underfunction of the adrenal gland). APS was the first systemic (bodywide) autoimmune disease found due to a defect in a single gene.

Apex,"Apex: The Latin word for summit, the apex is the tip of a pyramidal or rounded structure, such as the lung or the heart. The apex of the lung is indeed its tip- its rounded most superior portion. The apex of the heart is likewise its tip, but it is formed by the?left ventricle, so it is essentially the most inferior portion of the heart"
Aphagia,Aphagia: Inability to eat.
Apheresis,"Apheresis: The process of removing a specific component from blood temporarily. Also known as hemapheresis and pheresis. Forms of apheresis include plasmapheresis, harvesting plasma or liquid part of the blood; leukapheresis, harvesting leukocytes or white blood cells; granulocytapheresis, harvesting granulocytes; lymphocytapheresis, harvesting lymphocytes; lymphoplasmapheresis, harvesting lymphocytes and plasma; and plateletpheresis, harvesting platelets."
Aphrasia,Aphrasia: The inability to speak or understand phrases.
Apical,"Apical: The adjective for apex, the tip of a pyramidal or rounded structure, such as the lung or the heart. For example, an apical lung tumor is a tumor located at the top of the lung."
Aplastic anemia,"Aplastic anemia: Anemia due to failure of the bone marrow to produce red and white blood cells as well as platelets. Aplastic anemia frequently occurs without a known cause. Known causes include exposure to chemicals (for example, benzene, toluene in glues, insecticides, solvents), drugs (for example, chemotherapy drugs, gold, seizure medications, antibiotics), viruses (for instance, HIV, Epstein-Barr), radiation, immune conditions (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), pregnancy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and inherited disorders (for example, Fanconi anemia)."
APLS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome),"APLS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome): An immune disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal antibodies in the blood associated with abnormal blood clotting, migraine headaches, recurrent pregnancy losses (repeat spontaneous abortions), and low blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). The abnormal antibodies are directed against phospholipids, fats that contains phosphorous. APLS can occur by itself (primary APLS) or be caused by another underlying condition (secondary APLS). About a third of persons with primary APLS have heart valve abnormalities. Antiphospholipid antibodies reduce the levels of annexin V, a protein that binds phospholipids and has potent anticoagulant activity. The reduction of annexin V levels is thought to be a possible mechanism underlying the increased tendency of blood to clot and the propensity to pregnancy loss characteristic of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."
Apnea,Apnea: The absence of breathing (respiration).
Apneic,"Apneic: a temporary cessation of breathing called apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition in which patients stop breathing for short periods during sleep. People who have sleep apnea are may not be aware they have it. They may wake up gasping for breath, and often those who share a bed with them notice snoring. "
Apophenia,"Apophenia: In psychology, the perception of connections and meaningfulness in unrelated things. Apophenia can be a normal phenomenon or an abnormal one, as in paranoid schizophrenia when the patient sees ominous patterns where there are none."
Apoplexy,"Apoplexy: A venerable term for a stroke, a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), often associated with loss of consciousness and paralysis of various parts of the body. The word ""apoplexy"" comes from the Greek ""apoplexia"" meaning a seizure, in the sense of being struck down. In Greek ""plexe"" is ""a stroke."" The ancients believed that someone suffering a stroke (or any sudden incapacity) had been struck down by the gods."
Apoptosis,"Apoptosis: A form of cell death in which a programmed sequence of events leads to the elimination of cells without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining the health of the body by eliminating old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells. The human body replaces perhaps one million cells per second. Too little or too much apoptosis can play a role in many diseases. When apoptosis does not work correctly, cells that should be eliminated may persist and become immortal,
for example, in cancer and leukemia. When apoptosis works overly well, it kills too many cells and inflicts grave tissue damage. This is the case in strokes and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. Also known as programmed cell death and cell
suicide."
Appendectomy,"Appendectomy: Removal by surgery of the appendix, the small worm-like appendage of the colon (the large bowel). An appendectomy is performed because of probable appendicitis, inflammation of the wall of the appendix generally associated with infection. Appendicitis usually is suspected because of the medical history and physical examination. The pain of developing appendicitis is at first diffuse and poorly localized (not confined to one spot) but, as the inflammation extends through the appendix to its outer covering and then to the lining of the abdomen, the pain changes and becomes localized to one small area between the front of the right hip bone and the belly button. The exact point is named after Dr. Charles McBurney - McBurney's point. If the appendix ruptures and infection spreads throughout the abdomen, the pain becomes diffuse again as the entire lining of the abdomen becomes inflamed. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography also may be helpful in diagnosis. Due to the varying size and location of the appendix and the proximity of other organs to the appendix, it may be difficult to differentiate appendicitis from other intra-abdominal diseases. The treatment for appendicitis is antibiotics and surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy). Complications of appendectomy include wound infection, abscess, and obstruction of the intestine. The first successful appendectomy was done in Davenport, Iowa in 1885 by Dr. William West Grant. The patient was Mary Gartside, age 22."
Appendiceal,"Appendiceal: Relating to the appendix. As, for example, an appendiceal abscess. Perforation of the appendix can lead to a periappendiceal abscess or diffuse peritonitis (infection of the entire lining of the abdomen and the pelvis)."
Appendiceal cancer,Appendiceal cancer: See: Appendix cancer.
Appendiceal rupture,Appendiceal rupture: Rupture of appendix.
Appendicitis,"Appendicitis: Inflammation of the appendix, usually associated with infection of the appendix. Appendicitis often causes fever, loss of appetite, and pain. Appendicitis may be suspected because of the medical history and physical examination. The pain of appendicitis can be located in various areas of the belly. If the appendix ruptures and infection spreads throughout the abdomen, the pain becomes widespread as the entire lining of the abdomen becomes inflamed. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography may be helpful in diagnosis."
Appendix,Appendix: A small outpouching from the beginning of the large intestine.
Appendix cancer,"Appendix cancer: A malignancy of the appendix, accounting for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Although unusual, cancer of the appendix can range in type. The most common type of appendiceal cancer is carcinoid tumor with adenocarcinoma next. Tumors of the appendix often present with a pattern of spread referred to as peritoneal seeding of the malignant cells. Advances in treatment have raised survival rates to about 80%."
Apposition,"Apposition: The word ""apposition"" has several senses including the act of adding or accretion and also the putting of things in juxtaposition, or side by side. Growth by apposition is a mode of growth that is characteristic of many tissues in the body by which nutritive matter from the blood is transformed on the surface of an organ into solid unorganized substance. To lose a pair of apposed teeth is to lose teeth that are next to one another, teeth that are juxtaposed. (The prefix ""juxta-"" comes from the Latin preposition meaning near, nearby, close). Apposition is thus synonymous in this sense with juxtaposition."
APS (autoimmune polyglandular syndrome),"APS (autoimmune polyglandular syndrome): A genetic autoimmune disease with an extraordinary array of clinical features but characterized most often by at least 2 of the following 3 findings: hypoparathyroidism -- underfunction of the parathyroid glands which control calcium, candidiasis (yeast infection), and adrenal insufficiency (underfunction of the adrenal gland).

Aquaporin,"Aquaporin: A water channel. Aquaporins form pores in the membranes of cells and selectively conduct water molecules through the membrane, while preventing the passage of ions (such as sodium and potassium) and other small molecules. Aquaporins are typically composed of identical subunit proteins. Water molecules traverse the narrowest portion of the water channel in single file. The presence of water channels increases the permeability of membranes to water by as much as ten-fold. Aquaporins prevent us from dying of dehydration by reabsorbing 99% of the water in the kidney. The existence of molecular water channels had been long suspected. However, their molecular identity remained unknown until the serendipitous discovery of aquaporin-1 in 1988. The protein known as AQP1 was first purified from red blood cell membranes. A number of different aquaporins have now been identified. They have been designated aquaporin-0, aquaporin-1, aquaporin-2, and so on while the corresponding aquaporin genes are symbolized AQP0, AQP1, and AQP-2. The results of mutations in the AQP genes differ. Mutation in AQP-0 causes cataracts. Mutations in AQP1 have been found in normal people. Mutations in the aquaporin-2 gene AQP2 cause an autosomal dominant form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was shared by Peter Agre from Johns Hopkins University ""for the discovery of water channels."" The other half of the prize went to Roderick MacKinnon from Rockefeller University ""for structural and mechanistic studies of ion channels."""
Aqueous humor,"Aqueous humor: In medicine, humor refers to a fluid (or semifluid) substance. Thus, the aqueous humor is the fluid normally present in the front and rear chambers of the eye. It is a clear, watery fluid that flows between and nourishes the lens and the cornea; it is secreted by the ciliary processes. The humors were part of an ancient theory that health came from balance between the bodily liquids. These liquids were termed humors. Disease arose when imbalance occurred between the humors. The humors were: This theory (which was variously called the humoral theory, humoralism, and humorism) was devised well before Hippocrates (c.460-c.375 BC). It was not definitively demolished until Rudolf Virchow published his formative book, Cellularpathologie, in 1858 that laid out the cellular basis of pathology. Present day pathology rests on a cellular and molecular foundation. The humors have been dispelled, except for the aqueous humor."
ARD,ARDS: acute respiratory distress. See ARDS.
Areola,Areola: 1. The small darkened area around the nipple of the breast. 2. The colored part of the iris around the pupil of the eye. 3. Any small space in a tissue.
Arimidex,"Arimidex: Brand name for anastrozole, an oral antiestrogen. Arimidex inhibits the enzyme aromatase in the adrenal glands that produces the estrogens (estradiol and estrone) and thereby lowers their levels. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes. This can slow or stop the growth of many types of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. See also: Aromatase inhibitor."
Arm,"Arm: 1. In popular usage, the appendage that extends from the shoulder to the hand. However, the medical definition refers to the upper extremity extending from the shoulder only to the elbow, excluding the forearm, which extends from the elbow to the wrist. The arm contains one bone: the humerus. 2. In a randomized clinical trial, any of the treatment groups. Most randomized trials have two ""arms,"" but some have three ""arms,"" or even more."
Aromatase,"Aromatase: An enzyme involved in the production of estrogen that acts by catalyzing the conversion of testosterone (an androgen) to estradiol (an estrogen). Aromatase is located in estrogen-producing cells in the adrenal glands, ovaries, placenta, testicles, adipose (fat) tissue, and brain. The growth of some breast cancers is promoted by estrogens. For example, the drug letrozole (brand name: Femara) is an antiestrogen sometimes used to treat such estrogen-dependent tumors. The drug acts by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase which lowers the level of the estrogen, estradiol."
Aromatase inhibitor,"Aromatase inhibitor: A drug that inhibits the enzyme aromatase and by that means lowers the level of the estrogen estradiol. Aromatase inhibitors represent a class of antiestrogens. Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of testosterone (an androgen) to estradiol (an estrogen) in many tissues including the adrenal glands, ovaries, placenta, testicles, adipose (fat) tissue, and brain. Estrogen is produced directly by the ovaries and is also made by the body using aromatase. Aromatase inhibitors cannot do anything about estrogen produced by the ovaries, but they do interfere with the body's use of aromatase. The growth of many breast cancers is promoted by estrogens. Most estrogen after menopause comes from the action of aromatase. Aromatase inhibitors may therefore be used to treat estrogen-dependent tumors after the menopause. Aromatase inhibitors are used mostly in women who have reached menopause, when the ovaries are no longer producing estrogen. The aromatase inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include anastrazole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara)."
Aromatherapy,"Aromatherapy: A form of alternative medicine in which essential oils or other scents are inhaled to achieve therapeutic benefit. The mechanism of action in aromatherapy is unknown, but recent studies have shown that aromatherapy may be beneficial for some health problems."
Arrector pili,"Arrector pili: A microscopic band of muscle tissue which connects a hair follicle to the dermis. When stimulated, the arrector pili will contract and cause the hair to become more perpendicular to the skin surface (stand on end)."
Arrhythmia,"Arrhythmia: An abnormal heart rhythm. In an arrhythmia the heartbeats may be too slow, too rapid, too irregular, or too early. Rapid arrhythmias (greater than 100 beats per minute) are called tachycardias. Slow arrhythmias (slower than 60 beats per minute) are called bradycardias. Irregular heart rhythms are called fibrillations (as in atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation). When a single heartbeat occurs earlier than normal, it is called a premature contraction. The term arrhythmia comes from the Greek a-, loss + rhythmos, rhythm = loss of rhythm."
Arsenic,"Arsenic: A metallic element that forms a number of poisonous compounds, arsenic is found in nature at low levels mostly in compounds with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. These are called inorganic arsenic compounds. Arsenic in plants and animals combines with carbon and hydrogen. This is called organic arsenic. Organic arsenic is usually less harmful than inorganic arsenic. Most arsenic compounds have no smell or special taste. Inorganic arsenic compounds are mainly used to preserve wood. They are also used to make insecticides and weed killers. Copper and lead ores contain small amounts of arsenic. When arsenic enters the environment, it does not evaporate. It gets into air when contaminated materials are burned. It settles from the air to the ground where it does not break down, but can change from one form to another. Most arsenic compounds can dissolve in water. Fish and shellfish build up organic arsenic in their tissues, but most of the arsenic in fish is not toxic. Exposure to arsenic can come from: Inorganic arsenic is a human poison. Organic arsenic is less harmful. High levels of inorganic arsenic in food or water can be fatal. A high level is 60 parts of arsenic per million parts of food or water (60 ppm). Arsenic damages many tissues including nerves, stomach and intestines, and skin. Breathing high levels can give you a sore throat and irritated lungs. Lower levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may cause: Long term exposure to inorganic arsenic may lead to a darkening of the skin and the appearance of small ""corns"" or ""warts"" on the palms, soles, and torso. Direct skin contact may cause redness and swelling. Arsenic is a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent). Breathing inorganic arsenic increases the risk of lung cancer. Ingesting inorganic arsenic increases the risk of skin cancer and tumors of the bladder, kidney, liver, and lung. Tests can measure a person's exposure to high levels of arsenic. These tests are not routinely performed in a doctor's office. Arsenic can be measured in the urine. This is the most reliable test for arsenic exposure. Since arsenic stays in the body only short time, one must have the test soon after exposure. Tests on hair or fingernails can measure exposure to high levels of arsenic over the past 6-12 months. These tests are not very useful for low level exposures. These tests do not predict whether you will have any harmful health effects. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of arsenic that industrial sources can release. It restricted or canceled many uses of arsenic in pesticides and may restrict more. EPA set a limit of 0.05 parts per million (ppm) for arsenic in drinking water. EPA may lower this further. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) established a maximum permissible exposure limit for workplace airborne arsenic of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (?g/m?)."
ART (antiretroviral therapy),"ART (antiretroviral therapy): Treatment that suppresses or stops a retrovirus. One of the retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Retroviruses are so named because they carry their genetic information in the form of RNA rather than DNA so that the information must be transcribed in ""reverse"" direction -- from RNA into DNA."
Artemisinin,"Artemisinin: Artemisinin: Artemisia (Artemisia annua), also known as sweet Annie or annual wormwood, is an annual herb native to China, where it is known as qinghao. Artemisia is mentioned in the Chinese Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments of 340 AD for treatment of fevers. Artemisinin, pronounced ar-te-mis'-in-in with the accent on the mis, was first isolated in 1965 by Chinese military researchers. Artemisinin has been found to act rapidly and potently against the malarial parasite, including some drug-resistant strains. Without significant side effects, it quickly reduces fever and lowers the blood levels of the parasite. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for P. falciparum malaria. To decrease the risk of resistance, artemisinin is taken as part of a """"cocktail."""" The cocktail of artemisinin and lumefantrine (Benflumetol) is marketed as Coartem and Riamet. Artemisinin is also in studies for cancer treatment and for helminth parasites. The discovery of artemisinin is reportedly being considered for a Nobel Prize in Medicine."
Arteria femoralis,Arteria femoralis: See: Femoral artery.
Arterial blood gas (ABG),"Arterial blood gas (ABG): The sampling of the blood levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the arteries, as opposed to the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in venous blood. Typically the acidity, or pH, of the blood is measured simultaneously with the gas levels in ABG sampling."
Arterial tension,"Arterial tension: The pressure of the blood within an artery, the arterial pressure. Also called the intra-arterial pressure."
Arteriogram,Arteriogram: An X-ray in which an injection of dye shows blood vessels.
Arteriole,Arteriole: A small branch of an artery that leads to a capillary. The oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) makes the blood in arterioles (and arteries) look bright red.
Arteriosclerosis,"Arteriosclerosis: Hardening and thickening of the walls of the arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur because of fatty deposits on the inner lining of arteries (atherosclerosis), calcification of the wall of the arteries, or thickening of the muscular wall of the arteries from chronically elevated blood pressure (hypertension)."
Arteriosclerotic retinopathy,"Arteriosclerotic retinopathy: Retinal disease caused by arteriosclerosis. In this condition, the arterioles (small arteries) in the retina become partially blocked because of thickening of their walls. Using an ophthalmoscope, a doctor can see the thickened arterioles and other indications of diminished blood supply to the retina. (The characteristic features include narrowed tortuous arterioles with a ""copper wire"" appearance, scattered small hemorrhages and sharp-edged deposits with no edema around them.) Arteriosclerotic retinopathy is a danger signal that the blood vessels in the body are arteriosclerotic and that steps are badly needed to prevent the progression of the disease process."
Arteriovenous malformation (AVM),"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM): An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital disorder (one present at birth) of blood vessels in the brain, brainstem, or spinal cord that is characterized by a complex, tangled web of abnormal arteries and veins connected by one or more fistulas (abnormal communications). The AVM has no capillary bed of its own and the fistulas in the AVM permit high-speed, high-flow shunting of blood from the arterial to the venous side of the circulation. This shunting causes low blood pressure (hypotension) in the arterial vessels feeding the AVM and neighboring areas of the brain that they normally supply with blood. AVMs typically cause problems before the age of 40. The most common symptoms of AVM include hemorrhaging (bleeding), seizures, headaches, and neurological problems such as paralysis or loss of speech, memory, or vision. The frequency of hemorrhage in various series ranges from 30-82%. AVM rupture accounts for 2% of all strokes. There are three general forms of treatment for AVM: Most people (perhaps 80% or more) with AVMs never experience problems due to them. However, AVMs that hemorrhage can lead to serious neurological problems, and sometimes death. Most people (perhaps 80% or more) with AVMs never experience problems due to them. However, AVMs that hemorrhage can lead to serious neurological problems, and sometimes death."
Artery,"Artery: A vessel that carries blood high in oxygen content away from the heart to the farthest reaches of the body. Since blood in arteries is usually full of oxygen, the hemoglobin in the red blood cells is oxygenated. The resultant form of hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) is what makes arterial blood look bright red. Arteries are part of the efferent wing of the circulatory system. (""Efferent"" from the Latin ""ex"", out + ""ferre"", to bear = to bear out or carry away. What the arteries are carrying away is blood from the heart.) By contrast, a vein is a blood vessel that carries blood low in oxygen content from the body back to the heart. The deoxygenated form of hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) in venous blood makes it appear dark. Veins are part of the afferent wing of the circulatory system which returns blood to the heart."
Arthralgia,Arthralgia: Pain in a joint.
Arthritis,"Arthritis: Inflammation of a joint. When joints are inflamed they can develop stiffness, warmth, swelling, redness and pain. There are over 100 types of arthritis. (see osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, gout, pseudogout)."
Arthro-,"Arthro-: A prefix meaning joint, as in arthropathy and arthroscopic. Before a vowel, it becomes arthr-, as in arthralgia and arthritis. From the Greek word arthron for joint. Ultimately from an Indo-European root meaning to join or to fit together."
Arthrocentesis,"Arthrocentesis: A procedure in which a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain fluid from the joint. This is usually done as an office procedure or at the bedside in the hospital. For certain conditions, medication is put into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed, and a bandage or dressing is applied over the entry point. Joint fluid can be examined to determine the cause of the joint swelling, such as infection, gout, or rheumatoid disease. Arthrocentesis can be helpful in relieving joint swelling and pain. Also known as joint aspiration."
Arthropathy,Arthropathy: Joint disease.
Arthrosis,"Arthrosis: An arthrosis is a joint, an area where two bones are attached for the purpose of motion of body parts. An arthrosis (joint) is usually formed of fibrous connective tissue and cartilage. Joints are grouped according to their motion: a ball and socket joint; a hinge joint; a condyloid joint (a joint that permits all forms of angular movement except axial rotation); a pivot joint; gliding joint; and a saddle joint. Joints can move in four and only four ways: The word ""arthrosis"" comes from a Greek root, ""arthros"" meaning a joint (as in arthritis, inflammation of a joint). The word ""joint"" itself comes from a Latin root, ""junctio"" meaning a joining (as in a junction)."
Articulation,"Articulation:1. In speech, the production and use of speech sounds. 2. In dentistry, the contact of the occlusal surfaces of the teeth.3. In anatomy, a joint (an area where two bones are attached for the purpose of motion of body parts). An articulation, or joint, is usually formed of fibrous connective tissue and cartilage. Joints are grouped according to their motion: a ball and socket joint; a hinge joint; a condyloid joint (a joint that permits all forms of angular movement except axial rotation); a pivot joint; gliding joint; and a saddle joint. Joints can move in four and only four ways: The word ""articulation"" comes from a Latin root, ""articulus"" meaning a joint. The word ""joint"" also comes from the Latin, from ""junctio"" meaning a joining (as in a junction)."
Artificial abortion,Artificial abortion: An abortion that is brought about intentionally. Also called an induced or therapeutic abortion. As opposed to a spontaneous abortion (a miscarriage).
Artificial insemination by husband (AIH),Artificial insemination by husband (AIH): A procedure in which a fine catheter (tube) is inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the uterus) into the uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample from the woman's mate directly into the uterus. The purpose of this procedure is to achieve fertilization and pregnancy. AIH is distinguished from artificial insemination by donor (AID) in which the donor is a man other than the woman's mate. AIH is also known as homologous insemination.
ASA (drug caution code),"ASA (drug caution code): Abbreviation on a medication that indicates it contains acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This special caution code is intended to be a warning for patients with specific medical conditions. If you see it or another possible caution code on a prescription, talk to your pharmacist about it before using the medicine. While not a part of the historical heritage of ancient prescription abbreviations, drug caution codes provide very valuable warnings."
Ascites,"Ascites: An abnormal accumulation of fluid within the abdomen. There are many causes of ascites, including cirrhosis of the liver, cancer within the abdomen, congestive heart failure, and tuberculosis."
Ascorbic acid,"Ascorbic acid: Vitamin C, an essential nutrient found mainly in fruits and vegetables. The body requires ascorbic acid in order to form and maintain bones, blood vessels, and skin. Ascorbic acid also promotes the healing of cuts, abrasions and wounds; helps fight infections; inhibits conversion of irritants in smog, tobacco smoke, and certain foods into cancer-causing substances; appears to lessen the risk of developing high blood pressure and heart disease; helps regulate cholesterol levels; prevents the development of scurvy; appears to lower the risk of developing cataracts; and aids in iron absorption. Ascorbic acid can cause adverse reactions when taken with some drugs."
Ascus,"ASCUS: An acronym for Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance. This term is used in the Bethesda System for reporting Pap smear findings, and indicates that some flat (squamous) cells look unusual and may or may not be pre-malignant or malignant."
Aseptic,"Aseptic: The absence of microorganisms. By contrast, something that just discourages the growth of microorganisms is antiseptic."
ASL,ASL: American Sign Language.
ASOT,ASOT: Antistreptolysin O Titer. A blood test that looks for antibodies to the streptococcus A bacteria. Also abbreviated ASLO.
Asp,Asp: Aspartic acid. See also: Amino acid symbols.
Aspartame,"Aspartame: A man-made sweetener with almost no calories used in place of sugar. A diet program with aspartame and exercise gives better results than without this sweetener. People lose more weight and regain less weight. Aspartame is a compound of two amino acids -- aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Because it is essentially half phenylalanine, people who have the genetic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) and cannot metabolize phenylalanine normally need to avoid diet drinks and other products containing aspartame (trade name: NutraSweet)."
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST),"Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): Also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), AST is an enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. AST is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood AST levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise AST levels."
Aspartic acid,"Aspartic acid: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. A amino acid that is not essential to the human diet, aspartic acid was discovered in protein in 1868. It has a role as a neurotransmitter. Symbol: Asp."
Asperger syndrome,"Asperger syndrome: An autistic disorder most notable for the often great discrepancy between the intellectual and social abilities of those who have it. Asperger syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder that is characterized by an inability to understand how to interact socially. Typical features of the syndrome also may include clumsy and uncoordinated motor movements, social impairment with extreme egocentricity, limited interests and unusual preoccupations, repetitive routines or rituals, speech and language peculiarities, and non-verbal communication problems. People with Asperger syndrome (""Aspies"" as many call themselves) generally have few facial expressions apart from anger or misery. Most have excellent rote memory and musical ability, and become intensely interested in one or two subjects (sometimes to the exclusion of other topics). They may talk at length about a favorite subject or repeat a word or phrase many times. People with Asperger syndrome tend to be ""in their own world"" and preoccupied with their own agenda. The onset of Asperger syndrome commonly occurs after the age of 3. Some individuals who exhibit features of autism (a developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication skills) but who have well-developed language skills may be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. There is no specific course of treatment or cure for Asperger syndrome. Treatment, which is symptomatic and rehabilitational, may include both psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions such as psychotherapy, parent education and training, behavioral modification, social skills training, educational interventions, and/or medications including psychostimulants, mood stabilizers, beta blockers, and tricyclic-type antidepressants. Children with Asperger syndrome have a better outlook than those with other forms of pervasive developmental disorders and are much more likely to grow up to be independently functioning adults. Nonetheless, in most cases, these individuals will continue to demonstrate, to some extent, subtle disturbances in social interactions. There is also an increased risk for development of psychosis (a mental disorder) and/or mood problems such as depression and anxiety in the later years. The syndrome is named for Hans Asperger who in 1944 published a paper that described a pattern of behavior in several young boys who had normal intelligence and language development but who had autistic-like behavior. Hans Asperger (1906-1980) was a pioneering pediatrician in Austria. He headed the play-pedagogic station at the university children's clinic in Vienna in 1932 and became director of the children's clinic in 1946. His special interest was in ""psychically abnormal"" children. Common misspellings include Aspergers, Aspberger, Aspberger's, Aspbergers, Asberger, Asbergers, or Asberger's."
Asphyxia,Asphyxia: Impaired breathing that results in severely decreased delivery of oxygen to body tissues. Asphyxia can be fatal. Choking is an example of asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia is an uncommon cause that results from an intense compression of the chest area. Asphyxia is also known as asphyxiation.
Aspirate,Aspirate: To draw in by suction. A patient may aspirate for example by accidentally drawing material from the stomach into the lungs. A doctor can aspirate a joint.
Aspiration,Aspiration: Removal by suction of fluid and cells through a needle. Aspiration also refers to the accidental sucking in of food particles or fluids into the lungs.
Aspirin,"Aspirin: Once the Bayer trademark for acetylsalicylic acid, now the common name for this anti-inflammatory pain reliever."
Assay,"Assay: An assay is an analysis done to determine: Assay is also used as a verb and has several related meanings in this role: The words ""assay"" and ""essay"" are often confounded, a cardinal sin according to some word mavens. However, ""assay"" and ""essay"" share a common ancestry. Both words come from the French ""essai"" which in turn came from the Late Latin ""exagium"" meaning the ""act of weighing""."
Association,"Association:1. In dysmorphology (the study of birth defects), the nonrandom occurrence in two or more individuals of a pattern of multiple anomalies (birth defects) not known to be a malformation syndrome (such as Down syndrome), a malformation sequence (of birth defects) or what is called a polytopic field defect (in which all of the defects are concentrated in one particular area of the body). An example of an association in dysmorphology is the VACTERL association of birth defects. 2. In genetics, the occurrence together of two or more characteristics more often than would be expected by chance alone. An example of association involves a feature on the surface of white blood cells called HLA (HLA stands for human leukocyte antigen). A particular HLA type, HLA type B-27, is associated with an increased risk for a number of diseases including ankylosing spondylitis. The extent of the association is enormous. Ankylosing spondylitis is 87 times more likely to occur in people with HLA B-27 than in the general population."
Asthenia,"Asthenia: Weakness. Lack of energy and strength. Loss of strength. Myasthenia refers to a loss of muscle strength, as in myasthenia gravis. Asthenia is from the Greek asthenes, from a- (without) + sthenos (strength)."
Asthenic,"Asthenic: 1. Weak. Lacking in strength.
2. Having a slender light body. Ectomorphic.
See also: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome ."
Asthma,"Asthma is a common lung disorder in which inflammation causes the bronchi to swell and narrow the airways, creating breathing difficulties that may range from mild to life-threatening. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. The diagnosis of asthma is based on evidence of wheezing and is confirmed with breathing tests. Many allergens and irritants can precipitate attacks of asthma. Avoidance of precipitating factors can be helpful. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, activity reduction, allergy shots, and medications to prevent or reverse the bronchospasm."
Asystole,"Asystole: A dire form of cardiac arrest in which the heart stops beating and there is no electrical activity in the heart. As a result, the heart is at a total standstill."
Ataxia,"Ataxia: Poor coordination and unsteadiness due to the brain's failure to regulate the body's posture and regulate the strength and direction of limb movements. Ataxia is usually due to disease in the cerebellum of the brain, which lies beneath the back part of the cerebrum."
Athelia,"Athelia: Absence of one or both nipples, which can occur in females and males. Athelia is a rare condition but it is common in certain other conditions. Athelia tends to occurs on one side (unilaterally) in children with the Poland sequence and on both sides (bilaterally) in certain types of ectodermal dysplasia. The Poland sequence (named for Alfred Poland, a celebrated 19th-century British surgeon and ophthalmologist) is a unique pattern of one-sided malformations characterized by a defect of the chest (pectoralis) muscle on one side of the body and webbing of the fingers (cutaneous syndactyly) of the ipsilateral hand (the hand on the same side). It is right-sided three times more often than it is left-sided. The disorder is currently considered ""a nonspecific developmental field defect"" occurring at about the sixth week of fetal development. The cause is uncertain. In Poland syndrome there is aplasia of the sternal head of the pectoralis major; the end of the main chest muscle that normally attaches to the breastbone is missing. On that side of the body, nearby chest muscles (the serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi muscles) may also be absent as may be the armpit (axillary) hair. In girls, the breast on that side is also usually absent (amastia) and there is no nipple. There is athelia. Ectodermal dysplasia is not one but a number of hereditary conditions usually characterized by the abnormal development of skin, absence of sweat glands, dry eyes and abnormal development of teeth -- all structures derived from the ectoderm (the outside layer in early embryonic development). The absence of sweat glands leads to an inability to sweat and heat intolerance. Athelia also occurs in association with the progeria (premature aging) syndrome and the Yunis-Varon syndrome (a multiple congenital malformation first reported in 1980). Athelia is distinguished from amastia, wherein the breast is absent, and from amazia, wherein breast tissue is absent but the nipple is still resent."
Atheroma,"Atheroma: A fatty deposit in the inner lining (intima) of an artery, resulting from atherosclerosis. Also called an atherosclerotic plaque, an arterial plaque, or a plaque."
Atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis: A process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of medium-sized and large arteries as a result of fat deposits on their inner lining. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include high levels of ""bad"" cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, diabetes and a genetic family history of atherosclerotic disease. Atherosclerosis is responsible for much coronary artery disease (angina and heart attacks) and many strokes."
Atherosclerotic,"Atherosclerotic: Pertaining to atherosclerosis, the process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of arteries from fat deposits on their inner lining. Atherosclerotic heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US."
Athlete's foot,"Athlete's foot: A skin infection caused by a fungus called Trichophyton that thrives within the upper layer of the skin when it is moist, warm, and irritated. The fungus can be found on floors and in socks and clothing, and it can be spread from person to person through contact with these objects. However, without proper growing conditions, athlete's foot fungus will not infect the skin. It can be treated with topical antifungal preparations. Also known as tinea pedis, athlete's foot is a form of ringworm."
Atlas and axis joint,"Atlas and axis joint: The joint between the atlas and axis bones. The atlas is the first cervical (neck) vertebra which is just under the head; it is named for Atlas, the Greek god who supported the world on his shoulders. The axis is the second cervical vertebra; it has what is called the odontoid process about which the atlas rotates. The joint between the atlas and axis is a pivot type of joint. It allows the head turn from side to side. It is also called the atloaxoid joint. The ligaments that serve to support and strengthen this joint are called the capsular; anterior and posterior atlantoaxial; and transverse ligaments."
ATM,"ATM: Symbol for the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. The protein made by the ATM gene functions to control the rate at which cells grow. The ATM protein does this by sending signals and modifying proteins in the cell, which then alters the function of the proteins. This protein also interacts with other proteins (for example BRCA1) to respond when DNA is damaged as a result of exposure to some type of radiation. If the strands of DNA are broken, the ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating other proteins. This function helps to maintain the stability of the cell's genome. Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is important to cancer biology. Mutations in the ATM gene cause ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive disorder. (People with this disorder have two mutated copies of ATM.) The mutated ATM gene makes a protein that does not function properly because it is truncated (abnormally short). As a result, the cells are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond correctly to DNA damage. Instead of activating DNA repair, the defective ATM protein allows mutations to accumulate in other genes. In addition, ATM mutations may allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly in the cerebellum (the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements). People who have mutations in one copy of the ATM gene, particularly those who have at least one family member with ataxia-telangiectasia, may be at an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The ATM gene is located in chromosome band 11q22.3. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family. This protein is a cell cycle checkpoint kinase that phosphorylates and functions as a regulator of a wide variety of downstream proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins p53 and BRCA1, checkpoint kinase CHK2, checkpoint proteins RAD17 and RAD9, and DNA repair protein NBS1. The ATM protein and the closely related kinase ATR are thought to be master controllers of cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that are required for cell response to DNA damage and for genome stability."
Atom,"Atom: The smallest part of any material that cannot be broken up by chemical means. Each atom has a center (the nucleus) which contains protons and neutrons. Electrons orbit around the nucleus. The atom is primarily empty space. If the nucleus of an atom were the size of the button on a baseball pitcher's cap, the electrons would be like dust particles revolving around the outside of the baseball stadium."
Atonic,"Atonic: Without normal muscle tone or strength. An atonic seizure is one in which the person suddenly loses muscle tone and strength; the person cannot sit or stand upright and, unless supported, falls down."
Atopic,"Atopic: A predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions. Atopy may have a hereditary component, although contact with the allergen must occur before the hypersensitivity reaction can develop."
Atopic dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis: A skin disease characterized by areas of severe itching, redness, scaling, and loss of the surface of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema. Atopic dermatitis is frequently associated with other allergic disorders, especially asthma and hay fever. A defect of the immune system within the skin has been detected in patients who have atopic dermatitis, but the reason for the defect is unknown."
Atopy,"Atopy: The genetic tendency to develop the classic allergic diseases -- atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and asthma. Atopy involves the capacity to produce IgE in response to common environmental proteins such as house dustmite, grass pollen, and food allergens. From the Greek atopos meaning out of place."
ATP,ATP: 1. Adenosine triphosphate. 2. Acute thrombocytopenic purpura.
Atresia,"Atresia: Absence of a normal opening, or failure of a structure to be tubular. Atresia can affect many structures in the body. For example, esophageal atresia is a birth defect in which part of the esophagus is not hollow, and with anal atresia, there is no hole at the bottom end of the intestine."
Atria,Atria: The plural of atrium.
Atrial,"Atrial: Pertaining to the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, as in atrial fibrillation and atrial septal defect."
Atrial fib,Atrial fib: Atrial fibrillation.
Atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation: An abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. Many people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms. Among those who do, the most common symptom is an uncomfortable awareness of the rapid and irregular heartbeat (palpitations). Atrial fibrillation can promote the formation of blood clots that travel from the heart to the brain, resulting in stroke. Treatment of atrial fibrillation involves risk-factor control, use of medications to slow the heart rate and/or convert the heart to
normal rhythm, and prevention of blood clots. Also known as auricular fibrillation."
Atrial flutter,Atrial flutter: Well-organized but overly rapid contractions of the atrium of the heart (usually at a rate of 250-350 contractions per minute). Flutter refers to a rapid vibration or pulsation. The difference between flutter and fibrillation is that flutter is well organized while fibrillation is not. Atrial flutter is a serious and potentially unstable rhythm of the heart.
Atrial septum,Atrial septum: The wall between the right and left atria of the heart.
Atrioventricular (AV),"Atrioventricular (AV): Pertaining to the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) and the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). The AV node is an electrical relay station between the atria and the ventricles. Electrical signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles. The AV node is a major element in the cardiac conduction system that generates electrical impulses within the heart, conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulates the heart to contract and pump blood, and so controls the heart rate."
Atrioventricular node,"Atrioventricular node: The electrical relay station between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. Abbreviated AV node. Electrical signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles. The AV node, which controls the heart rate, is one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system. The AV node serves as an electrical relay station, slowing the electrical current sent by the sinoatrial (SA) node before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have an opportunity to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles, along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart."
Atrium,"Atrium: An entry chamber. On both sides of the heart, the atrium is the chamber that leads to the ventricle."
Atrophy,"Atrophy: A wasting away or diminution. Muscle atrophy is a decrease in muscle mass, often due to extended immobility."
Atropine,"Atropine: A drug, made from the belladonna plant, that is administered via injection, eye drops, or in oral form to relax muscles by inhibiting nerve responses."
Attention,"Attention: The ability to focus selectively on a selected stimulus, sustaining that focus and shifting it at will. The ability to concentrate. ""Everyone knows what attention is,"" wrote William James in his Principles of Psychology (1890). ""It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought...It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state."" Attention is important to learning. Learning is most efficient when a person is paying attention. Poor attention can be a key sign of behavior disorders in children such as hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder, and learning disorders."
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD),"Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is an old term for primarily inattentive ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention (such as distractibility, disorganization, or forgetfulness) or by symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity (such as fidgeting, speaking out of turn, or restlessness). It is also referred to as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is not caused by an underlying physical or mental disorder."
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A disorder in which a person is unable to control behavior due to difficulty in processing neural stimuli, accompanied by an extremely high level of motor activity. Abbreviated ADHD. ADHD can affect children and adults, but it is easiest to perceive during schooling. A child with ADHD may be extremely distractible, unable to remain still, and very talkative. ADHD is diagnosed by using a combination of parent and/or patient interview, observation of the patient, and sometimes use of standardized screening instruments. Treatments include making adjustments to the environment to accommodate the disorder, behavior modification, and the use of medications. Stimulants are the most common drugs used, although certain other medications can be effective."
Attenuated,"Attenuated: Weakened, diluted, thinned, reduced, weakened, diminished. The use of ""attenuated"" in medicine is not new. In the 16th century, eating dried figs was claimed to attenuate the body fluids. Now ""attenuated"" refers to procedures that weaken an agent of disease (a pathogen). An attenuated virus is a weakened, less vigorous virus. A vaccine against a viral disease can be made from an attenuated, less virulent strain of the virus, a virus capable of stimulating an immune response and creating immunity but not causing illness. The word ""attenuated"" derives from a combination of the Latin prefix ""ad-"" meaning ""to"" or ""toward"" and ""tenuis"" meaning ""thin."""
Atypical,"Atypical: Unusual, or not fitting a single diagnostic
category."
Atypical measles syndrome (AMS),"Atypical measles syndrome (AMS): An altered expression of measles, AMS begins suddenly with high fever, headache, cough, and abdominal pain. The rash may appear 1 to 2 days later, often beginning on the limbs. Swelling (edema) of the hands and feet may occur. Pneumonia is common and may persist for 3 months or more. AMS occurs in persons who were incompletely immunized against measle. This may happen if a person were given the old killed-virus measles vaccine (which does not provide complete immunity and is no longer available); or the person were given attenuated (weakened) live measles vaccine that was, by accident, inactivated during improper storage. Immunization with inactivated measles virus does not prevent measles virus infection. It can, however, sensitize a person so that the expression of the disease is altered, resulting in AMS. Being atypical, AMS can be confused with other entities including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, meningococcal infection, various types of pneumonia, appendicitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, etc."
Auditory acuity,"Auditory acuity: The clarity or clearness of hearing, a measure of how well a person hears. Auditory acuity is measured in order to determine a person's need for a hearing aid."
Auditory perception,"Auditory perception: The ability to identify, interpret, and attach meaning to sound."
Aura,"Aura: A sensation perceived by a patient that precedes a condition affecting the brain. An aura often occurs before a migraine or seizure. It may consist of flashing lights, a gleam of light, blurred vision, an odor, the feeling of a breeze, numbness, weakness, or difficulty in speaking.."
Autism,"Autism: A spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, and unusual and repetitive behavior. Some, but not all, people with autism are non-verbal. Autism is normally diagnosed before age six and may be diagnosed in infancy in some cases. The degree of autism varies from mild to severe in different children. Severely afflicted patients can appear profoundly retarded. The cause (or causes) of autism are not yet fully understood. However, it is believed that at least some cases involve an inherited or acquired genetic defect. Researchers have proposed that the immune-system, metabolic, and environmental factors may play an important part as well. It is not caused by emotional trauma, as was once theorized. Autism or autistic-like behavior may co-occur with many other neurological conditions. The optimal treatment of autism involves an educational program that is suited to the child's developmental level. Autism is also called the Kanner syndrome or infantile autism. See also Asperger syndrome, elective mutism, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Rett syndrome."
Autistic savant,"Autistic savant: A person with autism who is exceptionally gifted in a specialized field. That field may, for example, be mathematics. The autistic savant may be able to do rapid, complex mental calculations. Or the field may be music. The autistic savant may be able to perform a entire piece of music after hearing it only once. The term ""autistic savant"" has replaced the old term ""idiot savant,"" which is perjorative and imprecise. A savant (from the French savoir, to know) is a sage, a learned person."
Autoimmune,"Autoimmune: Pertaining to autoimmunity, a misdirected immune response that occurs when the immune system goes awry and attacks the body itself. Autoimmunity is present to some extent in everyone and is usually harmless. However, autoimmunity can cause a broad range of human illnesses, known collectively as autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases occur when there is progression from benign autoimmunity to pathogenic autoimmunity. This progression is determined by genetic influences as well as environmental triggers. Autoimmunity is evidenced by the presence of autoantibodies (antibodies directed against the person who produced them) and T cells that are reactive with host antigens."
Autoimmune disease,"Autoimmune disease: An illness that occurs when the body tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex organization within the body that is designed normally to ""seek and destroy"" invaders of the body, including infectious agents. Patients with autoimmune diseases frequently have unusual antibodies circulating in their blood that target their own body tissues. Examples of autoimmune diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile (type 1) diabetes, polymyositis, scleroderma, Addison disease, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Autoimmune diseases are more frequent in women than in men. It is felt that the estrogen of females may influence the immune system to predispose some women to autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the presence of one autoimmune disease increases the chance for developing another simultaneous autoimmune disease."
Autoimmunity,"Autoimmunity: A misdirected immune response that occurs when the immune system goes awry and attacks the body itself. Autoimmunity is present to some extent in everyone and is usually harmless. However, autoimmunity can cause a broad range of human illnesses, known collectively as autoimmune diseases.

Autoimmunity is evidenced by the presence of autoantibodies (antibodies directed against the person who produced them) and T cells that are reactive with host antigens."
Autologous,"Autologous: In blood transfusion and transplantation, a situation in which the donor and recipient are the same person. Patients scheduled for non-emergency surgery may be autologous donors by donating blood for themselves that will be stored until the surgery. An autologous graft is a graft (such as a graft of skin) that is provided for oneself."
Autolysis,Autolysis: The enzymatic digestion of cells by enzymes present within them. The cells most susceptible to autolysis tend to be dying or dead cells. Pronounced aw-tol'i-sis.
Automated external defibrillator,"Automated external defibrillator: A device that automatically analyzes the heart rhythm and that'if it detects a problem that may respond to an electrical shock'delivers a shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. Thanks to their small size and ease of use, AEDs have been installed in many settings (such as schools and airports), and serve a role in expanding the number of opportunities for life-saving defibrillation. Abbreviated AED."
Autonomic nervous system,"Autonomic nervous system: A part of the nervous system that regulates key involuntary functions of the body, including the activity of the heart muscle; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the glands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system, which accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles."
"Autonomy, patient","Autonomy, patient: The right of patients to make decisions about their medical care without their health care provider trying to influence the decision. Patient autonomy does allow for health care providers to educate the patient but does not allow the health care provider to make the decision for the patient."
Autophobia,"Autophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of loneliness, of being alone. A fear of solitude. Sufferers from autophobia may experience anxiety even though they realize that being alone does not threaten their well-being. They may worry about being ignored and unloved, or they may worry about intruders, strange noises or the possibility of developing a medical problem. Autophobia also has another sense, that of an irrational fear of oneself, intense self-fear that is groundless. The word ""autophobia"" is derived from two Greek words: ""autos"" (self) and ""phobos"" (fear) = literally, self-fear, fear of oneself. ""Autos"" has given us many English words such as ""automatic"" and ""automotive"" (self-moving) and ""autonomy"" (self-governing). And ""phobos"" has bequeathed us a vast number of phobias such as ""claustrophobia"" (fear of closed places) and ""acrophobia"" (fear of heights)."
Autoradiography,"Autoradiography: A technique using X- ray film to visualize molecules or fragments of molecules that have been radioactively labeled. Autoradiography has many applications in the laboratory. Autoradiography can, for example, be used to analyze the length and number of DNA fragments after they are separated from one another by a method called gel electrophoresis."
Autosomal dominant,"Autosomal dominant: A pattern of inheritance in which an affected individual has one copy of a mutant gene and one normal gene on a pair of autosomal chromosomes. (In contrast, autosomal recessive diseases require that the individual have two copies of the mutant gene.) Individuals with autosomal dominant diseases have a 50-50 chance of passing the mutant gene and therefore the disorder on to each of their children. Examples of autosomal dominant diseases include Huntington disease, neurofibromatosis, and polycystic kidney disease."
Autosomal recessive,"Autosomal recessive: A genetic condition that appears only in individuals who have received two copies of an autosomal gene, one copy from each parent. The gene is on an autosome, a nonsex chromosome. The parents are carriers who have only one copy of the gene and do not exhibit the trait because the gene is recessive to its normal counterpart gene. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of a child inheriting both abnormal genes and, consequently, developing the disease. There is a 50% chance of a child inheriting only one abnormal gene and of being a carrier, like the parents, and there is a 25% chance of the child inheriting both normal genes. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an example of an autosomal recessive disorder. A CF child has the CF gene on both chromosome 7's and so is said to be homozygous for CF. The parents each have one CF and one normal paired gene and so are said to be heterozygous for CF. Other examples of autosomal recessive disorders include:"
AV (atrioventricular),"AV (atrioventricular): AV is the standard medical abbreviation for atrioventricular, a combination that means pertaining to the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) and the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). For example, the AV node is an electrical relay station between the atria and the ventricles. Electrical signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles. The AV node is a major element in the cardiac conduction system that generates electrical impulses within the heart, conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulates the heart to contract and pump blood, and so controls the heart rate."
Avuncular,"Avuncular: 1. Literally, relating to an uncle. 2. Figuratively, suggestive of an uncle, as in geniality. 3 In medical genetics, pertaining to an aunt or uncle. An avuncular relationship is the genetic relationship between aunts and uncles and their nieces and nephews. From the Latin avunculus, meaning maternal uncle. The feminine equivalent of avuncular is materteral (like an aunt)."
"Axial tomography, computerized","Axial tomography, computerized: Pictures of structures within the body created by a computer that takes the data from multiple X-ray images and turns them in pictures. The CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan can reveal some soft-tissue and other structures that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. Using the same dosage of radiation as that of an ordinary X-ray machine, an entire slice of the body can be made visible with about 100 times more clarity with the CAT scan. The ""cuts""(tomograms) for the CAT scan are usually made 5 or 10 mm apart. The CAT machine rotates 180 degrees around the patient's body; hence, the term ""axial."" The machine sends out a thin X-ray beam at 160 different points. Crystals positioned at the opposite points of the beam pick up and record the absorption rates of the varying thicknesses of tissue and bone. The data are then relayed to a computer that turns the information into a 2-dimensional cross-sectional image. CAT scanning was invented in 1972 by the British engineer Godfrey N. Hounsfield (later Sir Godfrey) and the South African (later American) physicist Alan Cormack. CAT scanning was already in general use by 1979, the year Hounsfield and Cormack were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for its development. The CAT scan is also known as the CT (computerized tomography) scan."
Axillary,"Axillary: Pertaining to the armpit, the cavity beneath the junction of the arm and the body."
Ayurveda,"Ayurveda: India's traditional, natural system of medicine that has been practiced for more than 5,000 years. Ayurveda provides an integrated approach to preventing and treating illness through lifestyle interventions and natural therapies. Ayurvedic theory states that all disease begins with an imbalance or stress in the individual's consciousness. Lifestyle interventions are a major ayurvedic preventive and therapeutic approach. In India, ayurvedic practitioners receive state- recognized, institutionalized training in parallel to their physician counterparts in India's state-supported systems for conventional Western biomedicine and homeopathic medicine. The research base is growing concerning the physiological effects of meditative techniques and yoga postures in Indian medical literature and Western psychological literature. Published studies have documented reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol, and reaction to stress, in individuals who practice Ayurvedic methods. Laboratory and clinical studies on ayurvedic herbal preparations and other therapies have shown them to have a range of potentially beneficial effects for preventing and treating certain cancers, treating infectious disease, and promoting health. Mechanisms underlying these effects may include free-radical scavenging effects, immune system modulation, brain neurotransmitter modulation, and hormonal effects."
B virus,"B virus: An infectious agent commonly found among macaque monkeys, including rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, and cynomolgus monkeys. Monkeys infected with this virus usually have no or mild symptoms. In humans, however, B virus infection can result in a fatal encephalomyelitis. B virus disease in humans is extremely rare, but often fatal -- an estimated 80% of untreated patients die of complications associated with the infection. Persons at greatest risk for B virus infection include veterinarians, laboratory workers, and others who have close contact with Old World macaques or monkey cell cultures. Infection is typically caused by animal bites, scratches, or exposure to the tissues or secretions of macaques. The virus is also known as Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1."
B-type natriuretic peptide,"B-type natriuretic peptide: A 32-amino-acid polypeptide secreted by the ventricles of the heart in response to excessive stretching of heart muscle cells. The levels of B-type natriuretic peptide are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure, and correlate with both the severity of symptoms and the prognosis. Also known as BNP."
b.i.d. (on prescription),"b.i.d. (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, b.i.d. means twice (two times) a day. It is an abbreviation for ""bis in die"" which in Latin means twice a day. The abbreviation b.i.d. is sometimes written without a period either in lower-case letters as ""bid"" or in capital letters as ""BID"". However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
Ba,Ba: The symbol for barium.
Babesiosis,"Babesiosis: An illness caused by the parasite Babesia which is transmitted from animals to humans by ticks. In the US, it is typically contracted in the Northeast or Midwest -- in southern New England or New York State and in Wisconsin or Minnesota. The signs and symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, myalgias (muscle aches), fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen) and hemolytic anemia (anemia due to break-up of red cells). Symptoms typically occur after an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks and can last several weeks. The disease is more severe in patients who are immunosuppressed, splenectomized (lack their spleen), or elderly. It can cause death. Treatment involves antibiotics, usually clindamycin and quinine or atovaquone and azithromycin. The parasite: While more than 100 species of Babesia have been reported, only a few have been identified as causing human infections. Babesia microti and Babesia divergens have been identified in most human cases, but variants (considered different species) have been recently identified. Little is known about the occurrence of Babesia species in malarial areas where Babesia can easily be misdiagnosed as Plasmodium (the agent of malaria). The life cycle of the parasite: (This contains some technical information.) The B. microti life cycle involves two hosts, which includes a rodent, primarily the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. During a blood meal, a Babesia-infected tick introduces sporozoites into the mouse host. Sporozoites enter erythrocytes and undergo asexual reproduction (budding). In the blood, some parasites differentiate into male and female gametes although these cannot be distinguished at the light microscope level. The definitive host is a tick, in this case the deer tick, Ixodes dammini (I. scapularis). Once ingested by an appropriate tick, gametes unite and undergo a sporogonic cycle resulting in sporozoites. Transovarial transmission (also known as vertical, or hereditary, transmission) has been documented for ""large"" Babesia spp. but not for the ""small"" babesia, such as B. microti. Humans enter the cycle when bitten by infected ticks. During a blood meal, a Babesia-infected tick introduces sporozoites into the human host. Sporozoites enter erythrocytes and undergo asexual replication (budding). Multiplication of the blood stage parasites is responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. Humans are, for all practical purposes, dead-end hosts and there is probably little, if any, subsequent transmission that occurs from ticks feeding on infected persons. However, human to human transmission can occur through blood transfusions. Deer are the hosts upon which the adult ticks feed and are indirectly part of the Babesia cycle as they influence the tick population. When deer populations increase, the tick population also increases, thus heightening the potential for transmission. The diagnosis: Diagnosis can be made by microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears stained with Giemsa. Repeated blood smears may need to be examined to make the diagnosis. Antibody detection by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is a complementary diagnostic test. Isolation of Babesia by inoculation of the patient's blood into hamsters or gerbils may also assist in diagnosis. Animals inoculated with infective blood typically develop parasitemia (parasites circulating in their bloodstream) within 1 to 4 weeks. Treatments in include medication and exchange transfusions."
Babinski reflex,"Babinski reflex: A reflex used to determine adequacy of the higher (central) nervous system. The Babinski reflex is obtained by stimulating the outside of the sole of the foot, causing extension of the big toe while fanning the other toes. The examiner begins the stimulation at the heel and goes forward to the base of the toes. Most newborn babies and young infants are not neurologically mature, and they therefore show a Babinski reflex. A Babinski reflex in an older child or an adult is abnormal and is a sign of a problem in the brain or spinal cord. A Babinski reflex that is present on one side but not the other is also abnormal, and it can indicate which side of the brain is involved. Also known as plantar response, big toe sign, and Babinski phenomenon, response, or sign."
Babinski response,"Babinski response: An important neurologic test based, believe it or not, upon what the big toe does when the sole of the foot is stimulated. If the big toe goes up, that may mean trouble. The Babinski reflex is obtained by stimulating the external portion (the outside) of the sole. The examiner begins the stimulation back at the heel and goes forward to the base of the toes. There are diverse ways to elicit Babinski response. A useful way that requires no special equipment is with firm pressure from the examiner's thumb. Just stroke the sole firmly with the thumb from back to front along the outside edge. Care must be taken not to overdo it. Too vigorous stimulation may cause withdrawal of the foot or toe, which can be mistaken as a Babinski response. Most newborn babies are not neurologically mature and therefore show a Babinski response. Upon stimulation of the sole, they extend the great toe . Many young infants do this, too, and it is perfectly normal. However, in time during infancy the Babinski response vanishes and, under normal circumstances, should never return. A Babinski response in an older child or adult is abnormal. It is a sign of a problem in the central nervous system (CNS), most likely in a part called the pyramidal tract. Asymmetry of the Babinski response -- when it is present on one side but not the other -- is abnormal. It is a sign not merely of trouble but helps to lateralize that trouble (tell which side of the CNS is involved). The Babinski reflex is known by a number of other names: the plantar response (because the sole is the plantar surface of the foot), the toe or big toe sign or phenomenon, the Babinski phenomenon or sign. (It is wrong to say that the Babinski reflex is positive or negative; it is present or absent). Babinski, despite the Slavic sound of the name, was French: Joseph Francois Felix Babinski (1857-1932). He will never be forgotten in medicine, thanks to the reflex he found."

Baby blues,"Baby blues: A common temporary psychological state right after childbirth when a new mother may have sudden mood swings, feeling very happy, then very sad, cry for no apparent reason, feel impatient, unusually irritable, restless, anxious, lonely and sad. The baby blues may last only a few hours or as long as 1 to 2 weeks after delivery. The baby blues in this sense are less severe than a postpartum depression. The baby blues do not always require treatment from a health care provider. Often, joining a support group of new mothers or talking with other mothers helps. The term ""baby blues"" is sometimes used as a synonym for postpartum depression."
Bacillophobia,"Bacillophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of bacilli (bacteria). A phobia is an unreasonable sort of fear that can cause avoidance and panic. Phobias are a relatively common type of anxiety disorder. Phobias can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure and fear reduction techniques. In many cases, anti- anxiety or anti-depressant medication proves helpful, especially during the early stages of therapy. Another term for bacillophobia is bacteriaphobia."
Bacillus,"Bacillus: A large family of bacteria that are rod-like in shape. They include the bacteria that cause food to spoil, as well as those that are responsible for some diseases. Helpful members of the bacillus family are used to make antibiotics or colonize the human intestinal tract and aid with digestion."
Back pain,"Back pain: Pain felt in the low or upper back. Causes of pain in the low and upper back include conditions affecting the bony spine; discs between the vertebrae; ligaments around the spine and discs; spinal inflammation; spinal cord and nerves; muscles; internal organs of the pelvis, chest, and abdomen; tumors; and the skin."
Bacteremia,"Bacteremia: The presence of live bacteria in the bloodstream. Bacteremia is analogous to viremia (the presence of a virus in the blood) and parasitemia (the presence of a parasite in the blood). Bacteremia, viremia and parasitemia are all forms of sepsis (bloodstream infection). The term ""bacteremia"" was compounded from ""bacteria"" and ""-emia"" (in the blood). Also called bacillemia."
Bacteria,"Bacteria: Single-celled microorganisms that can exist either as independent (free-living) organisms or as parasites (dependent on another organism for life). The plural of bacterium. Examples of bacteria include Acidophilus, a normal inhabitant of yogurt; Gonococcus which causes gonorrhea; Clostridium welchii, the most common cause of gangrene; E. coli, which lives in the colon and can cause disease elsewhere; and Streptococcus, the bacterium that causes the common throat infection called strep throat."
Bacterial,"Bacterial: Of or pertaining to bacteria, as in a bacterial lung infection."
Bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis: A vaginal condition characterized by an abnormal vaginal discharge due to an overgrowth of normal bacteria in the vagina. Women with bacterial vaginosis also have fewer than the usual population of vaginal bacteria, called lactobacilli. Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are vaginal discharge and sometimes a fishy odor. A microscopic sign of bacterial vaginosis is an unusual vaginal cell called a clue cell. Treatment options include oral antibiotics and vaginal gels. Bacterial vaginosis can cause premature labor and delivery, as well as infection of the amniotic fluid and of the uterus after delivery. Therefore, screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy may be done."
Bacteriology,"Bacteriology: The science and study of bacteria and their relation to medicine and to other areas such as agriculture (e.g., farm animals) and industry. Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms which can live as independent organisms or, dependently, as parasites. Among the better known bacteria are strep, staph, and the agents of tuberculosis and leprosy. Bacteriology is a part of microbiology which encompasses the study of bacteria, viruses, and all other sorts of microorganisms."
Bacteriostatic,Bacteriostatic: Capable of inhibiting the growth or reproduction of bacteria. Different from bactericidal (capable of killing bacteria outright).
Balance,"Balance: A biological system that enables us to know where our bodies are in the environment and to maintain a desired position. Normal balance depends on information from the inner ear, other senses (such as sight and touch) and muscle movement. Our sense of balance is specifically regulated by a complex interaction between the following parts of the nervous system:"
Balanoposthitis,"Balanoposthitis: In the uncircumcised male, balanitis (inflammation of the glans, the rounded head of the penis) and posthitis (inflammation of the foreskin) usually occur together as balanoposthitis: inflammation of both the glans and foreskin. Circumcision prevents balanoposthitis. Without a foreskin, there can of course be no posthitis and hence no balanoposthitis. An uncircumcised boy should be taught to clean his penis with care to prevent infection and inflammation of the foreskin and the glans penis. Cleaning of the penis is done by gently, not forcibly, retracting the foreskin. The foreskin should be retracted only to the point where resistance is met. Full retraction of the foreskin may not be possible until the age of 3 or more. The term ""balano-"", referring to the glans of the penis (or clitoris), comes from the Greek word ""balanos"" meaning acorn. The term ""posthitis"" (pronounced pos-THI-tis) also comes from the Greek, from ""posthe"" meaning foreskin + ""-itis"", inflammation = inflammation of the foreskin. So, balanoposthitis = inflammation of the glans and foreskin."
Baldness,"Baldness: Medically known as alopecia. There are many types of baldness, each with a different cause. Baldness may be localized to the front and top of the head, as in the very common type of male-pattern baldness; baldness may be patchy, a condition called?alopecia areata; or a variant of alopecia areata may involve the entire head: alopecia capitis totalis. The word ""alopecia"" comes from the Greek ""alopex"" for ""fox.""?"
Bar graph,"Bar graph: A visual display using bars to represent the relative size of different categories of a variable, with each category or value of the variable represented by a bar, usually with a gap between the bars. A bar graph is often used to illustrate the major features of the distribution of data because it is an easier and quicker way to see and grasp the information. Bar graphs are frequently used in medicine. Also called a bar chart."
Barber itch,"Barber itch: A superficial fungal infection of the skin in the bearded area of the face and neck, with swellings and marked crusting, often with itching, sometimes causing the hair to break off. The name harks back to the days when men went to the barber daily for a shave. Also known as tinea barbae. (Tinea = ringworm)."
Barber Say Syndrome,"Barber Say syndrome is a very rare syndrome characterized by excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), papery thin and fragile (atrophic) skin, outward turned eyelids (ectropion), and a large mouth (macrostomia). The exact inheritance pattern of this syndrome is not fully understood. Some cases have been linked to mutation in a gene known as TWIST2. Reports have described both severe and mild cases of the condition. Also known as hypertrichosis, atrophic skin, ectropion, and macrostomia or hypertrichosis atrophic skin ectropion macrostomia."
Bariatrics,"Bariatrics: The field of medicine that offers treatment for the person who is overweight with a comprehensive program including diet and nutrition, exercise, behavior modification, lifestyle changes and, when indicated, the prescription of appetite suppressants and other appropriate medications. Bariatrics also includes research into overweight, its causes, prevention, and treatment. The word bariatrics was derived in the 20th century from the Greek baros (weight) + -iatrics (medical treatment). Other words derived from the same Greek root include barium and barometer."
Barium,"Barium: 1. A metallic element belonging to the alkaline earths with an atomic number of 56 and an atomic weight of 137.34. The symbol for barium is Ba. 2. In medicine, refers to a chalky solution of barium used to coat the inside of organs, such as the stomach or intestines so that they will show up on an x-ray. See also: Barium enema; Barium swallow."
Basal cell carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma: The most common type of skin cancer, which commonly presents as a sore that seems to get better and then recurs and may start to bleed. Basal cell carcinoma often occurs on the face and neck, where the skin is exposed to sunlight. These tumors are locally invasive and tend to burrow in but not metastasize (spread) to distant locations."
Basal ganglia,"Basal ganglia: A region of the base of the brain that consists of three clusters of neurons (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus) that are responsible for involuntary movements such as tremors, athetosis, and chorea. The basal ganglia are abnormal in a number of important neurologic conditions, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease."
Basal temperature,"Basal temperature: 1) Usually, a person's temperature on awakening in the morning. As changes in basal temperature accompany ovulation, it is often tracked by women who wish to ensure or avoid pregnancy. 2) A crude measure of thyroid function via taking and comparing basal temperatures (also called the Broda test.)"
Baseline,Baseline: Information or data gathered at the beginning of a period from which variations that subsequently develop are compared.
Basilar,"Basilar: Located at or near the base of a structure, especially the base of the skull. For example, a basilar fracture is a break in the bone at the base of the skull and can be life-threatening."
Bathophobia,"Bathophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of depths. Sufferers from bathophobia experience anxiety even though they realize they are safe from falling into or being consumed by depths. The feared object may be a long, dark hallway, a well or a deep pool or lake. ""Bathophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""bathos"" (depth) and ""phobos"" (fear)."
Battered child syndrome,"Battered child syndrome: A disease in which children are physically abused. The battered child syndrome is a form of child abuse. Not until the 19th century were children granted the same legal status as domesticated animals in regard to protection against cruelty and/or neglect. In 1962 the term ""battered child syndrome"" entered medicine. By 1976 all states in the United States had adopted laws mandating the reporting of suspected instances of child abuse. Child abuse involves a complex and dangerous set of problems that include child neglect and the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children. Child neglect is the most frequently reported form of child abuse and the most lethal. This form of abuse is defined as the failure to provide for the shelter, safety, supervision and nutritional needs of the child. Child neglect can be physical, educational, or emotional neglect. Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care, abandonment, expulsion from the home or refusal to allow a runaway to return home, and inadequate supervision. Educational neglect includes the allowance of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school age in school, and failure to attend to a special educational need. Emotional neglect includes such actions as marked inattention to the child's needs for affection, refusal of or failure to provide needed psychological care, spouse abuse in the child's presence, and permission of drug or alcohol use by the child. Physical abuse is the second most frequently reported form of child abuse and is defined as physical injury inflicted upon the child with cruel and/or malicious intent. Physical abuse can be the result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, burning, shaking, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or caretaker may not have intended to hurt the child, rather the injury may have resulted from over-discipline or physical punishment. Emotional abuse is the third most frequently reported form of child abuse and includes acts or omissions by the parents or other caregivers that could cause serious behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders. For example, the parents/caregivers may use extreme or bizarre forms of punishment, such as confinement of a child in a dark closet. Emotional child abuse is also sometimes termed psychological child abuse, verbal child abuse, or mental injury of a child. Sexual abuse is the least frequently reported form of child abuse and is believed to be the most under-reported type of child maltreatment because of the secrecy or ""conspiracy of silence"" that so often characterizes these cases. Sexual abuse includes fondling a child's genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials. Fatal injuries from maltreatment can result from many different acts including severe head trauma (injury), shaken baby syndrome, trauma to the abdomen or chest, scalding, burns, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, etc. Factors affecting the likelihood of potential abuse and predisposing to child abuse include: Children can be neglected and abused by parents, other caregivers, or society. Child abuse should be reported, investigated and evaluated. The treatment and prevention of child abuse include a support group structure coupled with visiting nurse home visits to reinforce good parenting skills and monitor the child's well-being. Children's school programs regarding ""good touch...bad touch"" can provide parents with a forum in which to role-play and learn to avoid potentially harmful scenarios. Parents should make sure that their child's daycare center is licensed and has an open door policy regarding parental visitation. The best strategy is to prevent child abuse."
Bayes theorem,"Bayes theorem: A probability principle set forth by the English mathematician Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). Bayes' theorem is of value in medical decision-making and some of the biomedical sciences. Bayes' theorem is employed in clinical epidemiology to determine the probability of a particular disease in a group of people with a specific characteristic on the basis of the overall rate of that disease and of the likelihood of that specific characteristic in healthy and diseased individuals, respectively. A common application of Bayes' theorem is in clinical decision making where it is used to estimate the probability of a particular diagnosis given the appearance of specific signs, symptoms, or test outcomes. For example, the accuracy of the exercise cardiac stress test in predicting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) depends in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of CAD: the ""prior probability"" in Bayes' theorem. In technical terms, in Bayes' theorem the impact of new data on the merit of competing scientific hypotheses is compared by computing for each hypothesis the product of the antecedent plausibility and the likelihood of the current data given that particular hypothesis and rescaling them so that their total is unity. In Bayes' theorem:"
BCC,BCC: Basal cell carcinoma.
BCG,"BCG: An effective immunization against tuberculosis. BCG stands for Bacille Calmette Guerin. BCG is a weakened (attenuated) version of a bacteria called Mycobacterium bovis which is closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent responsible for tuberculosis. Camille Guerin (1872-1961) and Albert Calmette (1863-1933) produced the BCG strain of the bacteria at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1921. Within a decade the BCG vaccine was being given in France and many other countries. By 1928, BCG had been given to 116,000 infants in France alone. However, conflicting questions about its effectiveness delayed the use of the BCG vaccine in the United States until 1950. BCG is also used as an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response and in cancer chemotherapy."
BCM,BCM: Body cell mass.
Bed sore,"Bed sore: A painful, often reddened area of degenerating, ulcerated skin caused by pressure and lack of movement, and worsened by exposure to urine or other irritating substances on the skin. Untreated bed sores can become seriously infected or gangrenous. Bed sores are a major problem for patients who are confined to bed or a wheelchair. They can be prevented by moving the patient frequently, changing bedding, and keeping the skin clean and dry. Also called a pressure sore, decubitus sore, or decubitus ulcer."
Bedsore,"Bedsore: A painful, often reddened area of degenerating, ulcerated skin that is caused by pressure and lack of movement and is worsened by exposure to urine or other irritating substances. Untreated bedsores can become seriously infected or gangrenous. Bedsores are a major problem for patients who are confined to a bed or wheelchair, and they can be prevented by moving the patient frequently, changing bedding, and keeping the skin clean and dry. Also known as pressure sore, decubitus sore, and decubitus ulcer."
Bee sting,"Bee sting: An area of skin affected by piercing from the stinger of a bee. A bee sting can trigger an allergic reaction, including life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Avoidance and prompt treatment are essential for those who are allergic to bee stings. Self-injectible adrenaline can be carried by persons known to be allergic when in risk areas. Hikers should wear long pants and shirts in risk areas. If a person is attacked, he or she should run for shelter, covering the face to prevent airway stings. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. Stingers should be removed promptly, and the area should be cleansed with soap and water. Ice packs, pain medications, and anti-itching medications can be helpful in treating local reactions. Victims with more serious symptoms can require intravenous fluids, oxygen, cortisone medicine, or epinephrine, as well as medications to open the breathing passages. In selected cases, allergy injection therapy is highly effective for prevention. For those who are not allergic, stings are a minor nuisance unless they occur in multiples."
Beers criteria,"Beers criteria: Criteria for safe medication use in older adults -- for people over 65 years of age. First issued in 1991, these criteria have been repeatedly revised and updated. In addition to the benzodiazepines, the Beers criteria (or list) has included amiodarone, amitriptyline, cimetidine, clonidine, disopyramide, indomethacin, ketorolac, meperidine, methyldopa, and many antihistamines, antispasmodics, and muscle relaxants. Named for Dr. M.H. Beers, principal author of the original 1991 criteria."
"Beijerinck, Martinus W.","Beijerinck, Martinus W.: (1851-1931) Dutch microbiologist who was the first person to use the term ""virus"" for the invisible disease-causing material that he showed to be self-replicating. He originated selective culture techniques, also known as enrichment culturing, and was the first to isolate a wide range of microorganisms. Educated at the Delft Technical School and the University of Leiden (Ph.D. 1899), Beijerinck taught in agricultural schools, worked in the Netherlands Yeast and Alcohol Manufactory (1884-95), and taught at the Technical School in Delft (1895-1921). His research on the biology of gall wasps and gall formation in 1882 led to the theory of ontogeny in higher plants and animals as being controlled by a series of growth enzymes that become active in fixed succession. Beijerinck made major contributions to microbiology by developing the enrichment culture technique, simultaneously with Sergey Winogradsky, which permits the isolation of highly specialized microorganisms. In studying tobacco mosaic disease, Beijerinck concluded that the filterable pathogen was a ""contagium vivum fluidum,"" a term he coined to convey his concept of a living infectious agent in a fluid (noncellular) form -- a revolutionary idea at a time when life and cellularity were thought to be inextricably connected."
Bekam,Bekam: Malay name for the practice of cupping. See: Cupping.
Belching,"Belching: A normal process of releasing through the mouth air that accumulates in the stomach, thereby relieving distention. Upper abdominal discomfort associated with excessive swallowed air may extend into the lower chest, producing symptoms that suggest heart or lung disease."
Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy: Paralysis of the nerve that supplies the facial muscles on one side of the face (the seventh cranial nerve, or facial nerve). Bell's palsy often starts suddenly. The cause may be a viral infection. Treatment includes protecting the eye on the affected side from dryness during sleep. Massage of affected muscles can reduce soreness. Sometimes cortisone medication, such as prednisone, is given to reduce inflammation during the first weeks of illness. The outlook is generally good; the vast majority of patients recover within weeks or months."
Belladonna,"Belladonna: An herbaceous plant bearing the scientific name Atropa belladonna or Atropa bella-donna, also known as deadly nightshade. The leaves and berries of the plant are highly toxic and can lead to hallucinations and delirium when ingested. Eating just a few berries from the plant can be fatal in children. The belladonna plant has a long history of use by humans for medicines, cosmetics, and poisons. It is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in parts of North America. Atropine is one of the active substances found in belladonna, an agent that is also used in medicine for its effects on the involuntary nervous system (anticholinergic properties). Other active ingredients in belladonna that have similar properties are hyoscyamine and scopolamine. Belladonna was used in the past as a cosmetic by women, because of its anticholinergic actions in producing dilation of the pupils of the eye. Belladonna has been used as a sedative and cold remedy, among other medical applications, but oral consumption of any belladonna product is highly unsafe and should be strictly avoided. Symptoms of overdose can include: The name belladonna is derived from the Italian words for ""beautiful (bella) woman (donna)."""
Belly,"Belly: That part of the body that contains all of the structures between the chest and the pelvis. Also called the abdomen. The belly (or abdomen) is separated anatomically from the chest by the diaphragm, the powerful muscle spanning the body cavity below the lungs. The belly contains a host of organs including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, appendix, gallbladder, and bladder. The word ""abdomen"" has a curious story behind it. It comes from the Latin ""abdodere"", to hide. The idea was that whatever was eaten was hidden in the abdomen."
Benign,Benign: Not malignant. A benign tumor is one that does not invade surrounding tissue or spread to other parts of the body; it is not a cancer.
Benign melanoma,"Benign melanoma: See: Melanoma, benign."
Benign prostatic hyperplasia,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia: A common, noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. The enlarged prostate may compress the urinary tube (urethra), which courses through the center of the prostate, impeding the flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra to the outside. Abbreviated BPH. If BPH is severe enough, complete blockage can occur. BPH generally begins after age 30, evolves slowly, and causes symptoms only after age 50. Half of men over age 50 develop symptoms of BPH, but only a minority need medical or surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes drugs such as finasteride and terazosin. Prostate surgery has traditionally been seen as offering the most benefits'and the most risks'for BPH. BPH is not a sign of prostate cancer. Also known as benign prostatic hypertrophy and nodular hyperplasia of the prostate."
Benzodiazepines,Benzodiazepines: A class of drugs that act as tranquilizers and are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety. Benzodiazepines can cause drowsiness.
BER,BER: Base excision repair.
Beta blocker,"Beta blocker: A class of drugs that block the effect of beta-adrenergic substances such as adrenaline (epinephrine), that play a key role in the sympathetic portion of the involuntary nervous system. By blocking the action of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart, they slow the heartbeat and relieve stress on the heart. Beta blockers are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, specifically to prevent abnormally fast heart rates (tachycardias) or irregular heart rhythms, such as premature ventricular beats. Because beta blockers reduce the demand of the heart muscle for oxygen, they can be useful in treating angina. They have also become important drugs in improving survival after a heart attack. Due to their effect on blood vessels, beta blockers can lower the blood pressure and are of value in the treatment of hypertension. Other uses include the prevention of migraine headaches and the treatment of familial or hereditary essential tremors. Beta blockers reduce pressure within the eye and they are therefore used to lessen the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with glaucoma. Beta blockers include acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), bisoprolol (Zebeta), metoprol (brand names: Lopressor, Lopressor LA, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and timolol (Blocadren). Topical beta blockers for the eye include timolol ophthalmic solution (Timoptic) and betaxolol hydrochloride (Betoptic)."
Beta cell,"Beta cell: A type of cell in the pancreas. Within the pancreas, the beta cells are located in areas called the islets of Langerhans where they constitute the predominant type of cell. The beta cells make and release insulin, a hormone that controls the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Degeneration of the beta cells is the main cause of type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus."
Beta-agonist,"Beta-agonist: A bronchodilator medicine that opens the airways by relaxing the muscles around the airways that may tighten during an asthma attack or in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Beta-agonists can be administered by inhalers or orally. They are called ""agonists"" because they activate the beta-2 receptor on the muscles surrounding the airways. Activation of beta-2 receptors relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways and opens the airways. Dilating airways helps to relieve the symptoms of dyspnea (shortness of breath). Beta-2 agonists have been shown to relieve dyspnea in many asthma and COPD patients. The action of beta-2 agonists starts within minutes after inhalation and lasts for about 4 hours. Because of their quick onset of action, beta-2 agonists are especially helpful for patients who are acutely short of breath but, because of their short duration of action, several doses of beta-agonists are often necessary each day. The side effects of beta-2 agonists include anxiety, tremor, palpitations or fast heart rate, and low blood potassium. Examples of beta-2 agonists include albuterol (Ventolin, Proventil), metaproterenol (Alupent), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethaire), isoetharine (Bronkosol), and Levalbuterol (Xopenex). Beta-2 agonists with a slower onset of action but a longer period of activity such as salmeterol xinafoate (Serevent) are now available. Salmeterol has a duration of action of twelve hours and need only be taken twice a day."
BF,BF: Physician's shorthand for black female.
Bi-,"Bi-: Prefix indicating two, as in biceps (a muscle with two heads) or bicuspid (having two flaps or cusps)."
Bias,"Bias: 1. When a point of view prevents impartial judgment on issues relating to the subject of that point of view. In a clinical trial, bias refers to effects that a conclusion that may be incorrect as, for example, when a researcher or patient knows what treatment is being given. To avoid bias, a blinded study may be done. 2. Deviation of results or inferences from the truth, or processes leading to such systematic deviation. Any trend in the collection, analysis, interpretation, publication, or review of data that can lead to conclusions that are systematically different from the truth."
Bicarbonate,"Bicarbonate: In medicine, bicarbonate usually refers to bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate, baking soda), a white powder that is a common ingredient in antacids. Also, the bicarbonate level is an indirect measure of the acidity of the blood that is determined when electrolytes are tested. The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22'30 mmol/liter."
Bicornuate,"Bicornuate: Having two horns or horn-shaped branches. The uterus is normally unicornuate, but it can sometimes be bicornuate."
Bicuspid valve,"Bicuspid valve: One of the four valves of the heart, this valve is situated between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It permits blood to flow one way only, from the left atrium into the left ventricle This valve is more commonly called the mitral valve because it has two flaps (cusps) and looks like a bishop's miter or headdress."
Biermer's anemia,"Biermer's anemia: A blood disorder caused by a lack of vitamin B12. Patients who have this disorder do not produce the substance in the stomach that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12. This substance is called intrinsic factor (IF). Biermer's anemia, better known as pernicious anemia (PA), is characterized by the presence in the blood of large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts) that are forerunners of red blood cells. (Red blood cells, when mature, have no nucleus). It is thus a type of megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia (PA) was first described (although not by that name) in 1855 by the English physician Thomas Addison. He called it an invariably fatal ""idiopathic anemia."" The ""idiopathic"" was a frank admission that the cause of this illness was wholly unknown. The name ""pernicious anemia"" was coined in 1872 by the German physician Anton Biermer whose description of the disease was superior to that of Addison. The studies of George H. Whipple on the effects of feeding liver in anemia followed by those of George R. Minot and Wm. P. Murphy on the effects of feeding liver specifically in pernicious anemia (PA) led to the cure of PA and to their receiving the Nobel Prize in 1934. Nowadays PA is an unpernicious anemia. It is simply treated with vitamin B12. The vitamin B12 has to be administered by injection (parenterally) because people with PA do not have IF (or an effective form of IF) and so cannot absorb vitamin B12 taken by mouth. There is some evidence that PA may be genetic although its mode of inheritance is poorly documented. There is a congenital form of PA due to defect of IF that is clearly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with the affected child having received two copies of the gene, one from each parent. The IF gene itself has been localized to human chromosome 11. The word ""pernicious"" means highly injurious, destructive, or deadly. ""Pernicious"" comes from the Latin root ""nex"" meaning ""violent death."" Pernicious anemia was once quite deadly. Today it fortunately is not. PA has also been called addisonian anemia and Addison's anemia."
Big toe sign,"Big toe sign: An important neurologic examination based upon what the big toe (and other toes) do when the sole of the foot is stimulated. If the big toe goes up, that may mean trouble. The big toe response, also called the Babinski reflex, is obtained by stimulating the external portion (the outside) of the sole. The examiner begins the stimulation back at the heel and goes forward to the base of the toes. There are diverse ways to elicit the big toe sign. A useful way that requires no special equipment is with firm pressure from the examiner's thumb. Just stroke the sole firmly with the thumb from back to front along the outside edge. Too vigorous stimulation may cause withdrawal of the foot or toe, which can be mistaken as a big toe sign. Most newborn babies give a big toe response because their nervous system is so immature. Upon stimulation of the sole, they extend the great toe. Many young infants do this, too, and it is perfectly normal. However, in time during infancy the big toe response vanishes and, under normal circumstances, should never return. A big toe response in an older child or adult is abnormal. It is a sign of a problem in the central nervous system (CNS), most likely in a part of the CNS called the pyramidal tract. Asymmetry of the big toe response -- when it is present on one side but not the other -- is abnormal. It is a sign not merely of trouble but helps to lateralize that trouble (tell which side of the CNS is involved). The big toe reflex is known by a number of other names: including the plantar response (because the sole is the plantar surface of the foot), the toe sign or phenomenon, and the Babinski phenomenon or sign. It is quite common but entirely incorrect to say that the big toe sign is positive or negative. It is either present or absent."
Bilateral,"Bilateral: Affecting both sides. For example, bilateral arthritis affects joints on both the left and right sides of the body."
Bilateral pneumonia,"Bilateral pneumonia: See: Pneumonia, bilateral."
Bile,"Bile: Bile is a yellow-green fluid that is made by the liver, stored in the gallbladder and passes through the common bile duct into the duodenum where it helps digest fat. The principal components of bile are cholesterol, bile salts, and the pigment bilirubin. An imbalance between these components of bile leads to the formation of gallstones. Gallstones can thus be composed of different materials. Cholesterol gallstones form when there is an imbalance between the amounts of cholesterol and the bile salts. Cholesterol is normally kept in liquid form by the dissolving action of the bile salts. An increased amount of cholesterol in the bile overwhelms the dissolving capacity of the bile salts and leads to the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Similarly, a deficiency of bile salts promotes cholesterol gallstone formation. Pigment gallstones are frequently associated with chronic infection in the bile, especially in certain Asian countries where parasitic infection of the bile ducts is common. Patients with blood diseases that cause excessive breakdown of red blood cells can have increased amounts of bilirubin (breakdown product of red cells) in the bile, thus causing bilirubin gallstone formation."
Biliary,"Biliary: Having to do with the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile. The biliary system itself consists of the gallbladder and bile ducts and, of course, the bile. For example, biliary atresia is the absence or closure of the major bile ducts, the ducts that drain bile from the liver."
Biliary decompression,Biliary decompression: A procedure done to remove pressure on the biliary tree and permit the normal drainage of bile.
Biliary sand,"Biliary sand: Biliary sand is a term, mostly used by surgeons, to describe uncountable, small particles in bile that are visible to the naked eye during the removal of a gallbladder. Biliary sand may be looked upon as a stage in the growth of the particles that begin as sludge (which are microscopic and not visible to the naked eye) to gallstones. The composition of biliary sand varies, but is similar to the composition of gallstones. The most common components of biliary sand are cholesterol crystals and calcium salts. Biliary sand may cause no symptoms or cause intermittent symptoms. Symptoms of biliary sand are similar to those of gallstones and include pain in the abdomen, nausea and vomiting, particularly after a fatty meal. Biliary sand can cause complications, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Biliary sand often can be detected by an ultrasound of the abdomen. If patients with biliary sand develop symptoms or complications, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) may be performed as treatment."
Bilious,"Bilious: The adjective for bile, bilious has three meanings. It means of or relating to bile. By extension, bilious means suffering from liver dysfunction (and especially excessive secretion of bile). And, further by extension, it is indicative of a peevish ill-natured disposition. The word ""bilious"" goes back to the old belief that there were four bodily humors (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) and these four humors determined a person's temperament. ""Bilious"" was the personality type associated with an excess of yellow bile. The word ""bilious"" derives from the French ""bilieux,"" which in turn came from ""bilis,"" the Latin term for ""bile."""
Biliousness,"Biliousness: A term used in the 18th and 19th centuries pertaining to bad digestion, stomach pains, constipation, and excessive flatulence (passing gas). The quantity or quality of the bile was thought to be at fault for the condition. Hence, the name ""biliousness."" (""Bilious"" derives from the French ""bilieux,"" which in turn came from ""bilis,"" the Latin term for ""bile."") Biliousness was generally laid to high living. The ""cure"" was moderation and frequent visits to the doctor."
Bilirubin,Bilirubin: A yellow-orange compound that is produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells.
Binge eating disorder,"Binge eating disorder: An eating disorder characterized by periods of extreme overeating, but not followed by purging behaviors, as in bulimia. Binge eating disorder can occur alone or in association with abnormality of the brain's hypothalamus gland, Prader-Willi disorder, or other medical conditions. It can contribute to high blood pressure, weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease. Treatment may include therapy, dietary education and advice, and medication."
Binocular vision,"Binocular vision: The ability to maintain visual focus on an object with both eyes, creating a single visual image. Lack of binocular vision is normal in infants. Adults without binocular vision experience distortions in depth perception and visual measurement of distance."
Bio-,"Bio-: Prefix indicating living plants or creatures, as in biology (the study of living organisms)."
Bioactive,"Bioactive: Having an effect upon a living organism, tissue, or cell. Biologically active. Antibiotic, enzymes, and vitamins are all bioactive substances."
Biochemical,"Biochemical: Relating to biochemistry, the application of the tools and concepts of chemistry to living systems. Biochemists study such things as the structures and physical properties of biological molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids; the mechanisms of enzyme action; the chemical regulation of metabolism; the chemistry of nutrition; the molecular basis of genetics (inheritance); the chemistry of vitamins; energy utilization in the cell; and the chemistry of the immune response. Fields closely related to biochemistry include biophysics, cell biology, and molecular biology. Biophysics applies to biology the techniques of physics. Cell biology is concerned with the organization and functioning of the individual cell. Molecular biology, a term first used in 1950, It overlaps biochemistry and is principally concerned with the molecular level of organization. The science of biochemistry has also been called physiological chemistry and biological chemistry. History: Modern chemistry: Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794), the father of modern chemistry, carried out fundamental studies on chemical oxidation and showed the similarity between chemical oxidation and the respiratory process. Organic chemistry: In the 19th century, Justus von Liebig studied chemistry in Paris and carried the inspiration gained by contact with the former students and colleagues of Lavoisier back to Germany where he put organic chemistry on a firm footing. Enzymes: Louis Pasteur proved that various yeasts and bacteria were responsible for ""ferments,"" substances that caused fermentation and, in some cases, disease. He also demonstrated the usefulness of chemical methods in studying these tiny organisms and was the founder of what came to be called bacteriology. Later, in 1877 Pasteur's ferments were designated as enzymes. Proteins: The chemical nature of enzymes remained obscure until 1926,when the first pure crystalline enzyme (urease) was isolated. This enzyme and all others proved to be proteins, which had already been recognized as high-molecular-weight chains of amino acids which we now know are the building blocks of protein. Vitamins: The mystery of how minute amounts of dietary substances prevent diseases such as beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra came clear in 1935 when riboflavin (vitamin B2) was found to be an integral part of an enzyme. ATP: In 1929 the substance adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was isolated from muscle. The production of ATP was found associated with respiratory (oxidative) processes in the cell and in 1940 ATP was recognized by F.A. Lipmann as the common form of energy exchange in cells. Radioisotopes: The use of radioactive isotopes of chemical elements to trace the pathway of substances in the body was initiated in 1935 by R. Schoenheimer and D. Rittenberg, providing an important tool for investigating the chemical changes that occur in cells. DNA: In 1869 a substance was isolated from the nuclei of pus cells and was called nucleic acid, which later proved to be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It was not until 1944 that the significance of DNA as genetic material was revealed, when bacterial DNA was shown to change the genetic matter of other bacterial cells. Within a decade, the double helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick, providing an understanding of how DNA functions as the genetic material."

luid,"Biofluid: A biological fluid. Biofluids can be excreted (such as urine or sweat), secreted (such as breast milk or bile), obtained with a needle (such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid), or develop as a result of a pathological process (such as (such as blister or cyst fluid). The term biofluid is employed as both a noun (as in the aforementionned biofluids) and an adjective (as in biofluid dynamics and biofluid mechanics)."
Biopsy,Biopsy: The removal of a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope to check for cancer cells or other abnormalities.
Biosafety,"Biosafety: The application of knowledge, techniques and equipment to prevent personal, laboratory and environmental exposure to potentially infectious agents or biohazards. Biosafety defines the containment conditions under which infectious agents can be safely manipulated. The objective of containment is to confine biohazards and to reduce the potential exposure of the laboratory worker, persons outside of the laboratory, and the environment to potentially infectious agents."
Biotherapy,"Biotherapy: Treatment to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune (defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is thus any form of treatment that uses the body's natural abilities that constitute the immune system to fight infection and disease or to protect the body from some of the side effects of treatment. Biotherapy (also called biological therapy or immunotherapy) often employs substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces low levels of BRMs in response to infection and disease. Large amounts of BRMs can be made in the laboratory to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. Forms of biological therapy include monoclonal antibodies, interferon, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM-CSF, G-CSF). Interleukin-2 and interferon are BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma. Interferon is a BRM now in use to treat hepatitis C. Biologic therapy to block the action of instruments of inflammation called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is being explored to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Etanercept (ENBREL) is a commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatment for patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Often, these treatments cause flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, muscle aches, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some patients develop a rash, and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling. Depending on how severe these problems are, patients may need to stay in the hospital during treatment. These side effects are usually short-term and they gradually go away after treatment stops."
Biotin,"Biotin: A water-soluble B-complex vitamin involved in carbon dioxide transfer and therefore essential to the metabolism of carbohydrate and fat. A balanced diet usually contains enough biotin. Foods with high biotin levels include nuts, cereals, green leafy vegetables and milk. Biotin deficiency, which is characterized by hair loss and a scaly red rash, can occur with prolonged intravenous feeding or the frequent consumption of raw egg whites which contain a biotin antagonist called avidin. Biotin supplementation is recommended during pregnancy because the biotin requirement rises during pregnancy and a substantial number of pregnant women become biotin depleted. Extra biotin is also needed during long-term anticonvulsant treatment which depletes biotin."
Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder: A mood disorder sometimes called manic-depressive illness or manic-depression that characteristically involves cycles of depression and elation or mania. Sometimes the mood switches from high to low and back again are dramatic and rapid, but more often they are gradual and slow, and intervals of normal mood may occur between the high (manic) and low (depressive) phases of the condition. The symptoms of both the depressive and manic cycles may be severe and often lead to impaired functioning. Both phases of the disease are deleterious. Mania affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that may cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. Depression can also affect thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that may cause grave problems. For example, it elevates the risk of suicide. About 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6 percent of the population aged 18 and older, have bipolar disorder. Although bipolar disorder often worsens over time if untreated, most people with bipolar disorder can achieve stabilization of their mood swings and reduction of symptoms with proper treatment. Treatment usually consists of medications known as ""mood stabilizers."" See also: Manic-depression."
Bipolar I disorder,Bipolar I disorder: The diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires that the individual has at least one manic episode but does not require a history of major depression. See also: Bipolar disorder.
Birth control,"Birth control: Birth control is the use of any practices, methods, or devices to prevent pregnancy from occurring in a sexually active woman. Also referred to as family planning, pregnancy prevention, fertility control, or contraception; birth control methods are designed either to prevent fertilization of an egg or implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Birth control methods may be reversible or irreversible."
Birth defect,"Birth defect: Any defect present in a baby at birth, irrespective of whether the defect is caused by a genetic factor or by prenatal events that are not genetic. Birth defects may involve many different organs including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, bones, and intestinal tract. These defects can occur for many reasons including inherited (genetic) conditions, toxic exposure of the fetus (for example, to alcohol), birth injury and, in many cases, for unknown reasons. All parents are at risk of having a baby with a birth defect, regardless of age, race, income or residence. In the US (and many other developed nations), 2% to 3% of babies are born with a medically significant birth defect. The infants with birth defects include many with heart defects, cleft lip or palate, Down syndrome, spina bifida, and limb defects. Birth defects are now the leading cause of infant mortality (death) in the United States (and many other developed nations). Birth defects are present in one of every five babies that die in the US. How a particular birth defect affects a child varies and depends greatly on the severity of the defect and whether or not other medical problems are present. The parents of children with birth defects are encouraged to discuss the specifics of the effects of the defect on their child's current condition with their child's doctor. A birth defect is also called a congenital malformation or a congenital anomaly."
Birthmark,"Birthmark: A persistent visible mark on the skin that is evident at birth or shortly thereafter. A birthmark is often due to a nevus (a mole) or an hemangioma (a localized collection of small blood vessels). Birthmarks that are pink or red are commonly capillary hemangiomas -- collections of tiny blood vessels -- that are most evident when the baby cries. Common locations are on the midforehead, the eyelids, just above the nose, between the nose and the upper lip, and the so-called ""stork bite"" on the nape of the neck. These marks generally become harder to see or disappear entirely within a few years."
bis in die (on prescription),"bis in die (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, bid means twice (two times) a day. It is an abbreviation for ""bis in die"" which in Latin means twice a day. The abbreviation bid is sometimes written without a period either in lower-case letters as ""bid"" or in capital letters as ""BID"" or with periods as ""b.i.d."" However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
Bisphosphonate,"Bisphosphonate: A class of drugs used to strengthen bone. Bisphosphonates are used to treat osteoporosis and the bone pain from diseases such as metastatic breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and Paget's disease. Bone is in a constant state of remodeling, whereby new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts, while old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone removal (resorption) by the osteoclasts. The bisphosphonates include Fosamax (alendronate), Actonel (risedronate), Boniva (ibandronate), and Reclast (zoledronate)."
BKA,"BKA: Acronym standing for ""below knee amputation."" BKA is as opposed to AKA (above knee amputation)."
Blackwater Fever,"Blackwater fever is an uncommon but serious complication of malaria in which red blood cells are destroyed, releasing hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The hemoglobin is filtered by the kidneys and passes into the urine. The condition occurs almost exclusively with infection by Plasmodium falciparum. Signs and symptoms include Blackwater fever is most common in Africa and Southeast Asia and usually does not develop until a person has resided in an endemic area for 6 months or more and had at least four episodes of malaria. It is also known as malarial hemoglobinuria."
Bladder,"Bladder: A hollow organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and produce urine, which enters the bladder through two tubes, called ureters. Urine leaves the bladder through another tube, the urethra. In women, the urethra is a short tube that opens just in front of the vagina. In men, it is longer, passing through the prostate gland and then the penis. Also known as urinary bladder and vesical."
Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO),"Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO): a blockage at the base of the bladder at the site where urine flows into the urethra to be expelled from the body. Symptoms of bladder outlet syndrome can include feelings of having a full bladder, abdominal pain, inability to urinate or frequently urinating, a slow flow of urine, problems initiating urination (urinary hesitancy), having to urinate at night, and an intermittent urine stream. Common causes of bladder outlet obstruction include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), bladder stones, bladder or pelvic tumors, and scar tissue (stricture) of the urethra. Bladder outlet obstruction is most common in older men than in other groups. Treatment depends upon the underlying cause. A urinary catheter may be used to relieve the blockage."
BLAST,Blast: An immature blood cell.
Blastocyst,Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.
Blasts,Blasts: Immature blood cells. Leukemic blasts do not grow and age normally; they proliferate wildly and fail to mature.
Bleb,Bleb: A bladder-like structure more than 5 mm in diameter with thin walls that may be full of fluid. Also called a bulla.
Blepharitis,"Blepharitis: Inflammation of the eyelids. Blepharitis occurs in two forms, anterior and posterior. Anterior blepharitis affects the outside front of the eyelid, where the eyelashes are attached. The two most common causes of anterior blepharitis are bacteria (Staphylococcus) and scalp dandruff. Posterior blepharitis affects the inner eyelid (the moist part that makes contact with the eye) and is caused by problems with the oil (meibomian) glands in this part of the eyelid. Two skin disorders can cause this form of blepharitis: rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis."
Blepharospasm,"Blepharospasm: The involuntary, forcible closure of the eyelids. The first symptoms may be uncontrollable blinking. Only one eye may be affected initially, but eventually both eyes are usually involved. The spasms may leave the eyelids completely closed, causing functional blindness even though the eyes and vision are normal. Blepharospasm is a form of focal dystonia."
Blind,"Blind: 1. Unable to see. Without part or all of the sense of sight. 2. In a clinical trial, not to know the treatment given or received. The participant is not told whether they are in the experimental or control arm of the study. Also called masked."
Blindness,"Blindness: Loss of useful sight. Blindness can be temporary or permanent. Damage to any portion of the eye, the optic nerve, or the area of the brain responsible for vision can lead to blindness. There are numerous (actually, innumerable) causes of blindness. The current politically correct terms for blindness include visually handicapped and visually challenged."
Blister,"Blister: A collection of fluid underneath the top layer of skin (epidermis). There are many causes of blisters, including burns, friction forces, and diseases of the skin. Also known as bleb and bulla."
Blood,"Blood: The familiar red fluid in the body that contains white and red blood cells, platelets, proteins, and other elements. The blood is transported throughout the body by the circulatory system. Blood functions in two directions: arterial and venous. Arterial blood is the means by which oxygen and nutrients are transported to tissues while venous blood is the means by which carbon dioxide and metabolic by-products are transported to the lungs and kidneys, respectively, for removal from the body."
Blood bank,"Blood bank: : A place where blood is collected from donors, typed, separated into components, stored, and prepared for transfusion to recipients. A blood bank may be a separate free-standing facility or part of a larger laboratory in a hospital. Separation of blood: Typically, each donated unit of blood (whole blood) is separated into multiple components, such as red blood cells, plasma and platelets. Each component is generally transfused to a different individual, each with different needs. An increasingly common blood bank procedure is apheresis, or the process of removing a specific component of the blood, such as platelets, and returning the remaining components, such as red blood cells and plasma, to the donor. This process allows more of one particular part of the blood to be collected than could be separated from a unit of whole blood. Apheresis is also performed to collect plasma (the liquid part of the blood) and granulocytes (white blood cells). Who receives blood: Accident victims, people undergoing surgery and patients receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or other diseases, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, all utilize blood. Over 20 million units of blood components are transfused every year in the US. Giving blood to yourself: Patients scheduled for surgery may be eligible to donate blood for themselves, a process known as autologous blood donation. In the weeks before non-emergency surgery, an autologous donor may be able to donate blood that will be stored until the surgical procedure. Typing and testing blood: After blood is drawn, it is tested for the ABO blood group type and the Rh type (positive or negative), as well as for any unexpected red blood cell antibodies that may cause problems in the recipient. Screening tests are also performed for evidence of donor infection with hepatitis viruses B and C, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) 1 and 2, human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) I and II and syphilis. Storage of blood: Each unit of whole blood is normally separated into several components. Red blood cells may be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of 42 days, or they may be frozen for up to 10 years. Red cells carry oxygen and are used to treat anemia. Platelets are important in the control of bleeding and are generally used in patients with leukemia and other forms of cancer. Platelets are stored at room temperature and may be kept for a maximum of five days. Fresh frozen plasma, used to control bleeding due to low levels of some clotting factors, is usually kept in the frozen state for up to one year. Cryoprecipitated AHF, which contains only a few specific clotting factors, is made from fresh frozen plasma and may be stored frozen for up to one year. Granulocytes are sometimes used to fight infections, although their efficacy is not well-established. They must be transfused within 24 hours of donation. Other blood products: Other products derived from blood include albumin, immune globulin, specific immune globulins and clotting factor concentrates. These blood products are commonly made by commercial manufacturers. American Association of Blood Banks (AABB): The AABB is a key international association of blood banks, including hospital and community blood centers, transfusion and transplantation services and individuals involved in transfusion and transplantation medicine. The AABB establishes the standards of care for patients and donors in all aspects of blood banking; transfusion medicine; hematopoietic, cellular and gene therapies; and tissue transplantation. More than 2000 community and hospital blood banks, hospital transfusion services and laboratories and over 8000 individuals from the US and 80 countries outside the US make up the AABB."
Blood blister,"Blood blister: a blister full of blood due to a pinch, bruise or repeated friction. A blister is medically termed a vesicle. One that is more than 5 mm in diameter is called a bulla. The word ""blister"" entered English in the 14th century. It came from the Middle Dutch ""bluyster"", blister and was a modification of the Old French ""blostre"" which meant a leprous nodule -- a rise in the skin due to leprosy."
Blood cleaner,"Blood cleaner: A process designed to eliminate most pathogens -- viruses, bacteria and fungi -- from donated blood. The process is termed ""pathogen inactivation."" It depends upon the fact that three components of blood that are given in transfusions -- red blood cells to carry oxygen, platelets to help blood clot and plasma for clotting and other purposes -- do not contain DNA or RNA, the basic genetic materials of life, whereas viruses, bacteria and fungi do. Therefore inactivating DNA or RNA can selectively kill these pathogens while leaving the blood itself unharmed. One form of pathogen inactivation for blood uses a chemical that, when exposed to ultraviolet light, binds to the genetic material. The bonds prevent the two strands of DNA's double helix from unzipping, thereby preventing germs from replicating. RNA, the genetic material in some viruses such as HIV, is similarly immobilized. There is current concern as to whether the technique can inactivate all viruses when they are present in large numbers. The technique is not designed to inactivate prions, which cause mad cow disease and its human equivalent, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, because prions are proteins and do not have DNA or RNA. And the process cannot be used to clean up white cell packs for transfusion because white cells have a nucleus and it contains DNA (so the process would inactivate the white cells). A platelet system uses a synthetic chemical known as a psoralen and a chain of three transparent plastic bags connected by tubes. The platelets are put into the first bag where they come in contact with psoralen. They drip into the second bag, which is placed in a machine photocopier to expose them to ultraviolet light for about three minutes. Then in the third bag, an absorbent material removes the psoralen. Different chemicals have to be used for the pathogen inactivation of red blood cells because light cannot penetrate these cells to activate a psoralen. The technique of pathogen inactivation is expected to add appreciably, perhaps $50 to $100, to the cost of a unit of blood. Red cells currently cost $100 to $200 a unit and platelets from $200 to $600. However, the technique improves the safety of transfusions. Platelets are stored at room temperature and are therefore prone to bacterial contamination which is believed to kill about 8 to 12 people and make many more ill every year in the US. Red blood cells are refrigerated so that bacteria are less often a problem. Still, numerous other possible infective agents exist in blood. These include viruses such as hepatitis B and other forms of hepatitis and parasites such as those responsible for malaria and Chagas disease, which is widespread in Latin America and can fatally damage the heart after many years. These nonbacterial agents of disease can all be inactivated by the process of pathogen inactivation. (Entry based in part on ""Technique may improve safety of donated blood"" by Andrew Pollack in The New York Times of April 2, 2002 and information from pathogen inactivation technology companies.)"
Blood clot,"Blood clot: A mass of coagulated blood. A blood clot can block a major blood vessel, causing stroke or other problems."
Blood clots,"Blood clots: Blood that has been converted from a liquid to a solid state. Also called a thrombus. The process by which a blood clot forms is termed coagulation. A blood clot, or thrombus, is stationary within a vessel or the heart. If it moves from that location through the bloodstream, it is referred to as an embolus. Picture of a blood clot is formed
"
Blood draw,"Blood draw: Removal of blood, usually by venipuncture (phlebotomy, venous blood sampling). Common term for blood sampling for laboratory analysis."
Blood glucose,"Blood glucose: The main sugar that the body makes from the food in the diet. Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to provide energy to all cells in the body. Cells cannot use glucose without the help of insulin. Glucose is a simple sugar (a monosaccharide). The body produces it from protein, fat and, in largest part, carbohydrate. Ingested glucose is absorbed directly into the blood from the intestine and results in a rapid increase in blood glucose. Glucose is also known as dextrose."
Blood group,"Blood group: An inherited feature on the surface of the red blood cells. A series of related blood types constitutes a blood group system, such as the Rh or ABO system. The frequencies of the ABO and Rh blood types vary from population to population. In the US, the most common type is O+ (meaning O in the ABO system and positive in the Rh system), which is present in 37.4 percent of the population. The frequencies in the US (in descending order) are O+ (37.4 percent), A+ (35.7 percent), B+ (8.5 percent), O- (6.6 percent), A- (6.3 percent), AB+ (3.4 percent), B- (1.5 percent), and AB- (0.6 percent)."
"Blood group, ABO","Blood group, ABO: The major human blood group system. The ABO type of a person depends on the presence or absence of two genes, A and B. These genes determine the configuration of the red blood cell surface. A person who has two A genes has red blood cells of type A. A person who has two B genes has red cells of type B. If the person has one A and one B gene, the red cells are type AB. If the person has neither the A nor the B gene, the red cells are type O. It is essential to match the ABO status of both donor and recipient in blood transfusions and organ transplants."
Blood in the eye,"Blood in the eye: Medically known as a subconjunctival hemorrhage. A very common cause of a painless bloody eye usually first noticed by somebody else or by the person with it when they look in the mirror. The bleeding results from a break in a small blood vessel in the sclera, the white of the eye. This releases a tiny amount (less than a drop) of blood which is trapped underneath the conjunctiva, much like the blood in a bruise is trapped in the skin. It is called a subconjunctival hemorrhage since it occurs beneath the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane covering the sclera. A subconjunctival hemorrhage can occur with heavy lifting, coughing, sneezing, vomiting or for no apparent reason. It looks bad and may be frightening, but is not dangerous and leaves no residual change in vision. There is no discharge from the eye. The redness may turn brown or green and everything returns to normal within 3 weeks as the blood is absorbed. Subconjunctival hemorrhage does not require treatment. Any features not characteristic of subconjunctival hemorrhage (such as pain in the eye, a change in vision, or failure to clear up within 3 weeks, or recurrent hemorrhage) are reasons to see a doctor. Medical conditions that can upon occasion cause subconjunctival hemorrhages include bleeding disorders, blood-thinner (such as heparin and Coumadin), and high blood pressure."
Blood in the urine,"Blood in the urine: Blood that appears in the urine. Also known as hematuria. Gross hematuria refers to blood that is so plentiful in the urine that the blood is visible with just the naked eye. Microhematuria refers to blood in urine that is visible only under a microscope; there is so little blood that it cannot be seen without magnification. Hematuria, whether gross or microscopic, is abnormal and should be further investigated. It may or may not be accompanied by pain. Painful hematuria can be caused by a number of disorders, including infections and stones in the urinary tract. Painless hematuria can also be due to a large number of causes, including cancer."
Blood pH,"Blood pH: The acidity or alkalinity of blood. The pH of any fluid is the measure of the hydrogen ion (H-) concentration. A pH of 7 is neutral. The lower the pH, the more acidic the blood. A variety of factors affect blood pH including what is ingested, vomiting, diarrhea, lung function, endocrine function, kidney function, and urinary tract infection. The normal blood pH is tightly regulated between 7.35 and 7.45."
Blood pressure,"Blood pressure: The blood pressure is the pressure of the blood within the arteries. It is produced primarily by the contraction of the heart muscle. Its measurement is recorded by two numbers. The first (systolic pressure) is measured after the heart contracts and is highest. The second (diastolic pressure) is measured before the heart contracts and lowest. A blood pressure cuff is used to measure the pressure. Elevation of blood pressure is called ""hypertension""."
Blood transfusion,"Blood transfusion: The transfer of blood or blood components from one person (the donor) into the bloodstream of another person (the recipient). Blood transfusion may be done as a lifesaving maneuver to replace blood cells or blood products lost through bleeding or due to depression of the bone marrow. Transfusion of one's own blood (autologous) is the safest method but requires advanced planning, and not all patients are eligible for it. Directed donor blood allows the patient to receive blood from known donors. Volunteer donor blood is usually most readily available and, when properly tested, has a low risk of side effects."
Blood urea nitrogen,Blood urea nitrogen: A measure of the urea level in blood. Abbreviated BUN. Diseases that compromise the function of the kidney frequently lead to increased BUN levels.
Blue baby operation,"Blue baby operation: A surgical procedure for a baby who is cyanotic (blue) due to a heart malformation that prevents blood from being fully oxygenated. The bluish color reflects the deoxygenated state of the blood. The surgery is designed to palliate or ideally correct the heart defect and relieve the cyanosis. The term originated with a pioneering heart operation named after the surgeon Dr. Alfred Blalock (1899-1964) and the children's heart specialist Dr. Helen Taussig (1898-1986). Dr. Taussig designed the first blue baby operation and Dr. Blalock performed it. The operation was done to treat a child with a previously inoperable heart malformation called the tetralogy of Fallot. The surgical procedure joined an artery leaving the heart to an artery leading to the lungs to give the blood a second chance at oxygenation. The joining (anastomosis) was of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery. It was the first blue baby operation and came to be known as the Blalock-Taussig shunt. This operation, which was done on November 29, 1944 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, is a major landmark in the history of children's heart surgery."
Blue sclera,"Blue sclera: a bluish coloration of the whites of the eyes. The blue color is caused by thinness and transparency of the collagen fibers of the sclera, allowing the veins in the underlying tissue to show through. Blue sclerae are characteristic of a number of conditions, particularly connective tissue disorders. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and Willems De Vries syndrome, among others."
Blurred vision,"Blurred vision: Lack of sharpness of vision with, as a result, the inability to see fine detail. Blurred vision can occur when a person who wears corrective lens is without them. Blurred vision can also be an important clue to eye disease."
Blush,"Blush: Redness of the skin as a result of dilated capillaries, typically over the cheeks or neck. Blushing is an involuntary response of the nervous system that leads to widening of the capillaries in the involved skin. A blush is temporary, and it may be brought on by excitement, exercise, fever, or embarrassment. Also known as flush."
BMI Calculation,"BMI calculation is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared. BMI stands for body mass index. With pounds (lbs) and inches, use the following table to calculate the BMI. Find the appropriate height in the left-hand column. Move across the row to the given weight. The number at the top of the column is the BMI for that height and weight. Body weight in pounds according to height and body mass index."
BMT,"BMT: Bone marrow transplantation, a procedure in which doctors replace bone marrow that is diseased (or damaged) with healthy bone marrow. The bone marrow to be replaced may be deliberately destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The replacement marrow may come from another person, or it may be the patient's own marrow (which was removed and stored before treatment). When marrow from an unrelated donor is used, the procedure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. If the marrow is from an identical twin, it is termed syngeneic. Autologous bone marrow transplantation uses the patient's own marrow."
Board eligible,"Board eligible: In medicine, a description for a physician who has completed the requirements for admission to a medical specialty board examination but has not passed that examination. For example, a physician must have 3 years of training in an approved pediatric residency to be eligible for certification by the American Board of Pediatrics."
Body cell mass,"Body cell mass: The total mass of all the cellular elements in the body which constitute all the metabolically active tissue of the body. There is depletion of the body cell mass (BCM) that is characteristic of wasting of the body common with chronic diseases such as AIDS and terminal cancer. The BCM includes muscle tissue, organ tissue, intracellular and extracellular water, and bone tissue. In the normally nourished individual, muscle tissue accounts for approximately 60% of the BCM, organ tissue accounts for 20% of BCM, with the remaining 20% made up of red cells and tissue cells. The BCM also contains the large majority (98-99%) of the body's potassium. The preferred method for assessing BCM depletion is bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) which can be performed with portable equipment in the office setting. It involves no radiation, is inexpensive, painless, and has a high degree of accuracy. The results of BIA are combined with other statistics (height, weight, sex, and age) to calculate the BCM, the fat-free mass, and other body composition measurements."
Body habitus,"Body habitus: The physique or body build. For example: ""The metabolic complications most commonly reported (with HIV infection) are hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and altered body habitus."" The term ""body habitus"" is somewhat redundant, since habitus by itself means ""physique or body build."""
Body Mass Index (BMI),"Body mass index: A key index for relating weight to height. Abbreviated BMI. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) now defines normal weight, overweight, and obesity according to BMI rather than the traditional height/weight charts."
Body surface area,"Body surface area: BSA. The total surface area of the human body. The body surface area is used in many measurements in medicine, including the calculation of drug dosages and the amount of fluids to be administered IV. A number of different formulas have been developed over the years to calculate the body surface area and they give slightly different results. The most commonly used formula now is that of Mosteller, published in 1987 in The New England Journal of Medicine. According to Mosteller's ""simplified calculation of body-surface area In metric terms"" the body surface area = the square root of product of the weight in kg times the height in cm divided by 3600. The ""normal"" body surface area is generally taken to be 1.7 m2 but, in actual fact, the body surface area depends on more than just height and weight. Other influential factors include the age and gender of the individual. For example: Body surface area is used for a determining other medical measures. As examples, renal function is measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which is calculated in regard to the body surface area. The cardiac index is a measure of cardiac output divided by the body surface area, giving a better approximation of the required cardiac output. Chemotherapy and pharmacotherapies are often dosed according to the patient's body surface area. Glucocorticoid dosing is also expressed in terms of body surface area for calculating maintenance doses or to compare high dose use with maintenance requirement. Reference: Mosteller RD. Simplified calculation of body-surface area. N Engl J Med 1987;317:1098."
Boil,"Boil: A skin abscess that forms at a hair follicle infected with pus-forming bacteria. The main treatments include hot packs and draining (lancing) the boil when it is soft. Antibiotics are usually not very helpful in treating boils. A person who has a fever or long-term illness, such as cancer or diabetes, or is taking medications that suppress the immune system should contact a health care practitioner on developing a boil. Also known as furuncle."
Bone,"Bone: Bone is the substance that forms the skeleton of the body. It is composed chiefly of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. It also serves as a storage area for calcium, playing a large role in calcium balance in the blood. The 206 bones in the body serve several other purposes. They support and protect internal organs (for example, the skull protects the brain and the ribs protect the lungs). Muscles pull against bones to make the body move. Bone marrow, the soft, spongy tissue in the center of many bones, makes and stores blood cells."
Bone marrow,"Bone marrow: The soft blood-forming tissue that fills the cavities of bones and contains fat and immature and mature blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Diseases or drugs that affect the bone marrow can affect the total counts of these cells."
Bone mineral density,"Bone mineral density: BMD, a measure of bone density, reflecting the strength of bones as represented by calcium content. The BMD test detects osteopenia (mild bone loss, usually without symptoms) and osteoporosis (more severe bone loss, which may cause symptoms). See also: Bone mass density, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis."
Bone type,Bone type: One of the four basic bone shapes in the human skeleton.
"the arm, wrist and hand","Bones of the arm, wrist and hand: There are 64 bones in the upper extremity. They consist of 10 shoulder and arm, 16 wrist and 38 hand bones."
the head,"Bones of the head: There are 29 bones in the human head. They consist of 8 cranial bones, 14 facial bones, the hyoid bone, and 6 auditory (ear) bones."
"the leg, ankle and foot","Bones of the leg, ankle and foot: There are 62 lower extremity bones. They consist of 10 hip and leg, 14 ankle and 38 foot bones."
the skeleton,"Bones of the skeleton: The human body has 206 bones. These consist of 80 axial (head and trunk) bones and 126 appendicular (upper and lower extremity) bones. Axial bones: The 80 axial bones comprise 29 bones in the head and 51 bones in the trunk. Head bones: The 29 head bones consist of 8 cranial bones, 14 facial bones, the hyoid bone, and 6 auditory (ear) bones. Trunk bones: The 51 trunk bones consist of 26 vertebrae, 24 ribs and the sternum. Appendicular bones: The 126 appendicular bones are made up of 64 bones in the upper extremities (the arms, wrists, and hands) and 62 bones in the lower extremities (the legs, ankles, and feet). Upper extremity bones: The 64 upper extremity bones consist of 10 shoulder and arm, 16 wrist and 38 hand bones. Lower extremity bones: The 62 lower extremity bones consist of 10 hip and leg, 14 ankle and 38 foot bones."
the trunk,"Bones of the trunk: The 51 trunk bones consist of 26 vertebrae, 24 ribs, and the sternum. The 26 vertebrae comprise 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar vertebrae, plus the sacrum and the coccyx. The 24 ribs comprise 14 true ribs, 6 false ribs, and 4 floating ribs. The sternum is the breastbone. Along with the bones of the head, also known as axial bones."
Borborygmi,"Borborygmi: Rumbling sounds caused by gas moving through the intestines, commonly referred to as stomach ""growling""). Pronounced BOR-boh-RIG-mee. The singular is borborygmus."
Borborygmus,"Borborygmus: A gurgling, rumbling, or squeaking noise from the abdomen that is caused by the movement of gas through the bowels. Also known as stomach rumbling. The plural is borborygmi."
Bottlefeeding,"Bottlefeeding: The practice of feeding an infant a substitute for breast milk. Pediatricians generally advise exclusively breastfeeding (that is, breastfeeding with no supplementary formula) for all full-term, healthy infants for the first 6 months of life. However, many infants are bottlefed today, at least in part. For infants to achieve normal growth and maintain normal health, infant formulas must include proper amounts of water, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals."
Bougie,"Bougie: A thin cylinder of rubber, plastic, metal or another material that a physician inserts into or through a body passageway, such as the esophagus, to diagnose or treat a condition. A bougie may be used to widen a passageway, guide another instrument into a passageway, or dislodge an object. Bougies are available in a wide range of sizes and degrees of flexibility. They may consist only of a simple cylinder. The cylinder may be equipped with such devices as: (1) an inflatable balloon to apply pressure against obstructions or narrowed walls; (2) a gauge to measure the pressure applied by the balloon; (3) a wire that is positioned at the site of a stricture, blockage or another problem to guide other instruments into the passageway; (4) a channel through which dye can be injected so that a site can be identified on a fluoroscope and (5) a light to illuminate a passageway for examination. Bougies may be used to treat strictures and blockages in the esophagus, the intestines, the rectum, the anus, the ureters (the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder) and the urethra (the canal that transports urine from the bladder to the outside). A stricture is an abnormally narrow section of a passageway while a blockage is an obstruction within a passageway. To remove an object lodged in the esophagus, a lubricated bougie may be used to dislodge the object and move it down into the stomach. The object then passes through the intestines. This procedure is feasible only if the object is unlikely to damage tissue as it moves through the intestinal tract. Bougies equipped with balloons may be used to eliminate both strictures and blockages in the esophagus. In a typical procedure, a lubricated bougie may be inserted under local anesthesia. When the bougie reaches the site of the stricture or blockage, the balloon is inflated. The pressure from the balloon then can widen a narrowed passageway. Bougies sometimes play a role in treating achalasia, a disorder in which there is abnormal function of nerves and muscles of the esophagus (swallowing tube) resulting in failure of the lowest-most part (lower esophageal sphincter) to open and allow passage of food. A bougie is used to stretch this sphincter. Bougies equipped with lights are sometimes used in surgery involving the colon, rectum, abdomen and chest to help physicians view and identify internal structures. ""Bougie"" is a French word meaning ""candle."" The French apparently derived the word from ""Bugia,"" the name of a North African town that exported candles to France. Because a bougie resembles a candle, English-speaking physicians wrote it into medical lexicons to describe candle-shaped diagnostic and therapeutic instruments. It was an apt word, for such instruments originally consisted of waxed silk or cotton rolled into a cylinder. Today, the French word ""bougie"" can also mean ""probe"" and ""sparkplug."" Also, the English ""word"" bougie can sometimes be used to refer to suppositories like those inserted into the anus to treat hemorrhoids. Related terms include ""bouginage"" (also spelled ""bougienage""), which refers to a procedure in which a bougie is used, and ""bougie ? boule,"" which refers to a bulb-tipped bougie."
Bougienage,"Bougienage: A procedure involving the use of a bougie. A bougie is a thin cylinder of rubber, plastic, metal or another material that a physician inserts into or though a body passageway, such as the esophagus, to widen the passageway, guide another instrument into a passageway, or dislodge an object. An alternate spelling of ""bougienage"" is ""bouginage."" Bougies are available in a wide range of sizes and degrees of flexibility. They may consist only of a simple cylinder. The cylinder may be equipped with such devices as: (1) an inflatable balloon to apply pressure against obstructions or narrowed walls; (2) a gauge to measure the pressure applied by the balloon; (3) a wire that is positioned at the site of a stricture, blockage or another problem to guide other instruments into the passageway; (4) a channel through which dye can be injected so that a site can be identified on a fluoroscope and (5) a light to illuminate a passageway for examination."
Bovine,"Bovine: Having to do with cows and cattle, as in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), bovine tuberculosis, and bovine growth hormone."
Bowel,Bowel: The small and large intestine.
Bowel sounds,"Bowel sounds: The gurgling, rumbling, or growling noises from the abdomen caused by the muscular contractions of peristalsis, the process that moves the contents of the stomach and intestines downward. Bowel sounds are normal. Their absence can indicate intestinal paralysis (ileus). Bowel sounds may also be temporarily absent after abdominal surgery. Their increase may indicate bowel obstruction. Bowel sounds are also called borborygmus (plural: borborygmi)."
BP,"BP: Commonly used abbreviation for blood pressure. On a medical chart, you might see ""BP90/60 T98.6 Ht60/reg R15,"" which signifies that the blood pressure (BP) is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature (T) is 98.6? Fahrenheit, the heart rate (Ht) is 60 beats per minute and regular, and respirations are occurring at 15 per minute."
BPD,"BPD: Stands for Borderline Personality Disorder, a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self-identity. Originally thought to be at the ""borderline"" of psychosis, people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) suffer from a disorder of emotion regulation. While less well known than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), borderline personality disorder is more common, affecting 2% of adults, mostly young women. There is a high rate of self-injury without suicide intent, as well as a significant rate of suicide attempts and completed suicide in severe cases. Patients often need extensive mental health services and account for about 20% of psychiatric hospitalizations. While a person with depression or bipolar disorder typically endures the same mood for weeks, a person with borderline personality disorder may experience intense bouts of anger, depression and anxiety that may last only hours, or at most a day. These may be associated with episodes of impulsive aggression, self-injury, and drug or alcohol abuse. Distortions in cognition and sense of self can lead to frequent changes in long-term goals, career plans, jobs, friendships, gender identity, and values. Sometimes people with borderline personality disorder view themselves as fundamentally bad, or unworthy. They may feel unfairly misunderstood or mistreated, bored, empty, and have little idea who they are. Such symptoms are most acute when people with borderline personality disorder feel isolated and lacking in social support, and may result in frantic efforts to avoid being alone. People with borderline personality disorder often have highly unstable patterns of social relationships. While they can develop intense but stormy attachments, their attitudes towards family, friends, and loved ones may suddenly shift from idealization (great admiration and love) to devaluation (intense anger and dislike). Thus, they may form an immediate attachment and idealize the other person, but when a slight separation or conflict occurs, they switch unexpectedly to the other extreme and angrily accuse the other person of not caring for them at all. Even with family members, individuals with borderline personality disorder are highly sensitive to rejection, reacting with anger and distress to such mild separations as a vacation, a business trip, or a sudden change in plans. These fears of abandonment seem to be related to difficulties feeling emotionally connected to important persons when they are physically absent, leaving the individual with borderline personality disorder feeling lost and perhaps worthlessness. Suicide threats and attempts may occur along with anger at perceived abandonment and disappointments. People with borderline personality disorder exhibit other impulsive behaviors, such as excessive spending, binge eating and risky sex. Borderline personality disorder often occurs together with other psychiatric problems, particularly bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and other personality disorders. Group and individual psychotherapy are at least partially effective for many patients with borderline personality disorder. A new psychosocial treatment termed dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was developed by Marsha Linehan specifically to treat borderline personality disorder, and this technique appears promising. Pharmacological treatments are often prescribed based on specific target symptoms shown by the individual patient. Antidepressant drugs and mood stabilizers may be helpful for depressed and/or labile mood. Antipsychotic drugs may also be used when there are distortions in thinking."
BPH,"BPH: Benign prostatic hyperplasia, benign prostatic hypertrophy."
Brachy-,"Brachy-: Prefix indicating short, as in brachycephaly (short head) and brachydactyly (short fingers and toes)."
Bradycardia,"Bradycardia: A slow heart rate, usually defined as less than 60 beats per minute."
Bradykinesia,"Bradykinesia: Slow movement. Bradykinesia is often associated with an impaired ability to adjust the body's position. Bradykinesia can be a symptom of nervous system disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, or a side effect of medications."
Bradykinetic,"Bradykinetic: Pertaining to slowed ability to start and continue movements, and impaired ability to adjust the body's position. Bradykinesia can be a symptom of neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, or a side effect of medications. The word bradykinetic is logically derived from two Greek roots: bradys, slow + kinesis, movement = slow movement, slow motion, slow moving."
Bradyphrenia,Bradyphrenia: A slow thought process. Bradyphrenia can be a side effect of certain psychiatric medications.
Bradypnea,"Bradypnea: Abnormally slow breathing. A respiratory rate that is too slow. The normal rate of respirations (breaths per minute) depends on a number of factors, including the age of the individual and the degree of exertion."
Braille system,"Braille system: A system of raised-dot writing devised by Louis Braille (1809-1852) for the blind in which each letter is represented as a raised pattern that can be read by touching with the fingers. The System: Each braille character or ""cell"" is made up of 6 dot positions that are arranged in a rectangle comprising 2 columns of 3 dots each. A dot may be raised at any of the 6 positions. Counting a space in which there is no dot raised, there are 2 to the 6th power (2x2x2x2x2x2 = 64) possible combinations. A specific combination is described by naming the positions where dots are raised. The positions are numbered 1 through 3 from top to bottom on the left, and 4 through 6 from top to bottom on the right. For example, a combination of dots 1-3-4 describes a cell with three dots raised, those dots being at the top and bottom in the left column and on top of the right column. The 1-3-4 combination denotes the letter ""m"" in French and in all other languages (including English) that use the Roman alphabet. The same 1-3-4 combination designates the letter ""mu"" in Greek and ""mim"" in Arabic (both of which have an ""m"" sound). The basis of the braille codes for all of the world's languages is the assignment of most of the dot patterns to letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks and other symbols. This is done with a certain consistency, quite often with reference to Louis Braille's original assignments (to the extent that is possible, given the great diversity of alphabets, accent marks, vocalization marks, etc). Because the 64 distinct characters are never enough to cover all possible print signs and their variants, it is necessary to use multi-character sequences for some purposes. Often this is accomplished by using certain characters as ""prefixes"" or ""indicators"" that affect the meaning of subsequent cells. For example, in English a dot 6 before a letter indicates that the letter is a capital, whereas otherwise it is understood to be lower case. For another example, dots 3-4-5-6, called the ""numeric indicator"", causes certain following letters (a through j) to be reinterpreted as digits. Other Braille Codes: Separate braille codes can be used for notation systems such as music, mathematics and computer programming, and even for pursuits such as chess. The basis of such codes remains an association between the 64 possible braille characters and the symbols and other notational elements of interest. There is current research, under the auspices of the International Council on English Braille (ICEB), as to whether some of these separate codes, notably for mathematics and the sciences, should be combined along with the literary code into a single Unified Braille Code (UBC) for English. Louis Braille: Louis Braille was born with normal sight. At age 3, while playing in his father's harnessmaking shop, he injured an eye with a sharp tool, an awl. The eye became infected and the infection affected his other eye, leaving him entirely blind. After succeeding brilliantly in the local school, he was sent at age 10 to the Royal Institution for Blind Youth in Paris. A French army officer named Charles Barbier de la Serre invented the basic technique of using raised dots for tactile writing and reading, in order to allow soldiers to compose and read messages on the dark of the night. Barbier adapted his system and presented it to the Royal Institution for Blind Youth, hoping that it would be officially adopted there. He called the system Sonography, because it represented words according to sound rather than spelling. Louis Braille analyzed Barbier's system and discovered the potential of the basic idea and the shortcomings in some of Barbier's specific provisions, such as a clumsy 12-dot cell and the phonetic basis. Within three years, by age 15, Braille had developed the system that we know today as braille based on a 6-dot cell and on normal spelling. He also went on to lay the foundations of the braille representation of music. Over 150 years after Louis Braille worked out his basic 6-dot system, its specific benefits remain unmatched by any later technology -- though some, computers being a prime example, both complement and contribute to braille.

Brain,"Brain: The portion of the central nervous system that is located within the skull. It functions as a primary receiver, organizer, and distributor of information for the body. It has a right half and a left half, each of which is called a hemisphere."
Breakbone fever,"Breakbone fever: Also known as dengue fever, an acute mosquito-borne viral illness of sudden onset that usually follows a benign course with headache, fever, prostration, severe joint and muscle pain, swollen glands (lymphadenopathy) and rash. The presence (the ""dengue triad"") of fever, rash, and headache (and other pains) is particularly characteristic. Better known as dengue, the disease is endemic throughout the tropics and subtropics in various parts of the world. It goes by other names including dandy fever. Victims of dengue often have contortions due to the intense joint and muscle pain. Hence, the name ""breakbone fever."" Slaves in the West Indies who contracted dengue were said to have ""dandy fever"" because of their postures and gait."
Breast,"Breast: The breast refers to the front of the chest or, more specifically, to the mammary gland. The mammary gland is a milk producing gland. It is composed largely of fat. Within the mammary gland is a complex network of branching ducts. These ducts exit from sac-like structures called lobules, which can produce milk in females. The ducts exit the breast at the nipple. The breast has been viewed as an organ designed to produce milk. The lobules are the glands that produce the breast milk. The ducts are tubes or channels which transport the milk from these glands out to the nipple. The nipple becomes erect because of cold, breast feeding and sexual activity. The pigmented area around the nipple is called the areola. The lobules and ducts are supported in the breast by surrounding fatty tissue and ligaments. There are no muscles in the breast. There are blood vessels and lymphatics in the breast. The lymphatics are thin channels similar to blood vessels; they do not carry blood but collect and carry tissue fluid which ultimately reenters the blood stream. Breast tissue fluid drains through the lymphatics into the lymph nodes located in the underarm (axilla) and behind the breast bone (sternum). Picture of the anatomy of the breast"
Breast bone,"Breast bone: Familiar name for the sternum, the long flat bone in the middle of the front of the chest. The sternum consists of three portions: the manubrium (the upper segment of the sternum, a flattened, roughly triangular bone), the corpus or body of the sternum, and the xiphoid process (the little tail of the sternum than points down). These three portions of the sternum arise as separate bones and may fuse partially or completely with one another. The sternum articulates (makes contact) with the cartilages of the first seven ribs and the clavicles (the collar bones) to form the middle portion of the anterior front wall of the thorax."
Breast cancer,Breast cancer: Cancer of the tissue containing or involving the milk glands (mammary tissue).
Breast discharge,"Breast discharge: The spontaneous flow of fluid from the nipple at any time other than during nursing. This can be due to an unrecognized pregnancy, trauma, surgery, overexercise, or certain drugs. It can also be due to cirrhosis of the liver, false pregnancy (pseudocyesis), kidney failure, disorders of the spinal cord, or a prolactinoma, a benign pituitary tumor that secretes the hormone prolactin stimulating milk production. Also called galactorrhea. Includes witch's milk."
Breast lump,"Breast lump: A localized swelling, knot, bump, bulge or protuberance in the breast. Breast lumps may appear in both sexes at all ages. In women, the fear is usually of breast cancer but many breast lumps turn out, fortunately, to be due to benign conditions that can be successfully treated such as infection, trauma, fibroadenoma, cyst, or fibrocystic conditions. However, no breast lump should be dismissed as benign until it has been checked by a physician."
Breast milk,"Breast milk: Milk from the breast. Human milk contains a balance of nutrients that closely matches infant requirements for brain development, growth and a healthy immune system. Human milk also contains immunologic agents and other compounds that act against viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Since an infant's immune system is not fully developed until age 2, human milk provides a distinct advantage over formula. Children who are breastfed enjoy lower rates of several chronic childhood diseases, including respiratory infections and ear infections as well as diarrhea. Breastfed infants gain less weight and tend to be leaner at 1 year of age than formula-fed infants, resulting in fewer overweight and obese children. Breastfeeding releases a hormone in a woman's body that causes her uterus to return to its normal size and shape more quickly and reduces blood loss after delivery. In addition, breastfeeding for longer periods of time (up to 2 years) and among younger mothers may possibly reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancers."
Breast pain,"Breast pain: Pain in the breast or mammary gland, known medically as mastalgia. From the Greek masto-, breast + algos, pain."
Breast surgeon,"Breast surgeon: Usually a general surgeon who is especially skilled in operating on the breast. A breast surgeon may biopsy a tumor in the breast and, if it is malignant, remove the tumor. A breast surgeon may also do breast reconstruction following a mastectomy for breast cancer. The surgeons who carry out this type of breast reconstruction may be breast oncology surgeons or plastic surgeons. (Surgeons trained in both these specialities are known as oncoplastic surgeons.) Some breast surgeons also do cosmetic breast surgery."
Breastfeeding,"Breastfeeding: Feeding a child human breast milk. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, human breast milk is preferred for all infants. This includes even premature and sick babies, with rare exceptions. It is the food least likely to cause allergic reactions; it is inexpensive; it is readily available at any hour of the day or night; babies accept the taste readily; and the antibodies in breast milk can help a baby resist infections. In breast milk, the amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) are well balanced for the human baby, as are the sugars (primarily lactose) and fats. The baby's intestinal tract is best aided in its digestion by the vitamins, enzymes, and minerals found in breast milk. Breastfed babies do eat more often than formula fed babies since breast milk is more quickly digested and leaves the stomach empty more frequently. Exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and it is sufficient to support optimal growth and development for the first 6 months after birth, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Furthermore, it is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings, but should receive iron-fortified infant formula. See also: Breastfeeding practices; and Breast milk."
Breathing,"Breathing: The process of respiration, during which air is inhaled into the lungs through the mouth or nose due to muscle contraction and then exhaled due to muscle relaxation."
Bright's disease,"Bright's disease: Chronic inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidney with protein, specifically albumin, in the urine. There are a number of disorders that lead to Bright's disease. With nothing more sophisticated than a candle and a silver spoon, the English physician Richard Bright (1789-1858) discovered protein in urine and in 1827 published his pioneering study of kidney disease."
Bromism,"Bromism: A disease caused by chronic exposure to bromine or one of its compounds. Bromism is characterized by mental dullness, memory loss, slurred speech, tremors, ataxia and muscular weakness, a transitory state resembling paranoid schizophrenia, and a skin eruption (bromoderma). Once a common problem, bromism was generally due to chronic ingestion of proprietary bromide preparations. Also called brominism."
Bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis: Permanent abnormal widening of the bronchi (air tubes that branch deep into the lungs). Bronchiectasis can cause recurrent lung infections, a disabling cough, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood."
Bronchitis,Bronchitis: Inflammation and swelling of the bronchi. Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.
Bronchopulmonary segments,"Bronchopulmonary segments: A subdivision of one lobe of a lung based on the connection to the segmental bronchus. For example, the right upper lobe has apical, anterior, and posterior segments."
Bronchus,Bronchus: A large air tube that begins at the end of the trachea and branches into the lungs. The supporting walls of the bronchus are made up in part of cartilage.
Brontophobia,"Brontophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of thunder that causes undue anxiety even though sufferers realize that thunder itself poses no threat to them. When outdoors during a thunderstorm, they may suffer excessive anxiety. When indoors, they may hide under beds or desks, behind sofas, or in closets. ""Brontophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""bronte"" (thunder) and ""phobos"" (fear). This same Greek word has given us the English word ""brontometer,"" an instrument for recording the activity of thunderstorms. A related term: Astraphobia, fear of thunderstorms."
Bruce protocol,"Bruce protocol: A standardized multistage treadmill test for assessing cardiovascular health, The test was developed and described in 1963 by the American cardiologist Robert A. Bruce (1916-2004). According to the original Bruce protocol, the patient walks on an uphill treadmill in a graded exercise test with electrodes on the chest to monitor the EKG. Every 3 minutes, the speed and incline of the treadmill are increased. There are 7 such stages and only very fit athletes can complete all 7 stages. The modified Bruce protocol is an alteration in the protocol so that the treadmill is initially horizontal rather than uphill, with the first few intervals increasing the treadmill slope only. The test can detect evidence of angina pectoris (chest pain and discomfort), a previous heart attack, and ventricular aneurysm (bulging in the ventricle of the heart)."
Bruise,"Bruise: Injury of the soft tissues that results in breakage of the local capillaries and leakage of red blood cells. In the skin it can be seen as a reddish-purple discoloration that does not blanch when pressed. When a bruise fades, it becomes green and brown, as the body metabolizes the blood cells in the skin. It is best treated with local application of a cold pack immediately after injury. Also known as contusion."
Bruit,"Bruit: A sound heard over an artery or vascular channel, reflecting turbulence of flow. Most commonly, a bruit is caused by abnormal narrowing of an artery. Listening for a bruit in the neck with a stethoscope is a simple way to screen for narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery, which can be a result of cholesterol plaque accumulation."
Brunhilde virus,Brunhilde virus: Type 1 poliovirus. Named after a female chimpanzee from which it was first isolated. There are two other strains of poliovirus: Type 2 (known as the Lansing virus) and Type 3 (known as the Leon virus). Immunity to one strain does not provide protection against the other two. All three strains are therefore included in the poliovirus vaccine.
Brushfield's spots,Brushfield's spots: Speckled iris. Little white spots that slightly elevated on the surface of the iris arranged in a ring concentric with the pupil. These spots occur in normal children but are far more frequent in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). They were described in 1924 by Thomas Brushfield and are due to aggregation of a normal iris element (connective tissue).
BSA,"BSA: In medicine, body surface area."
BSL,"BSL: 1. Biosafety level, as in a BSL-4 laboratory. 2.Biohazard safety level. 3.Blood sugar level. 4.British Sign Language."
Bubo,"Bubo: An enlarged lymph node that is tender and painful. Buboes particularly occur in the groin and armpit (the axillae). These swollen glands are seen in a number of infectious diseases, including gonorrhea, syphilis, tuberculosis, and the eponymous bubonic plague."
Bulbar,"Bulbar: Pertaining to a bulb, in medicine any rounded mass of tissue (that is shaped somewhat like a crocus or tulip bulb). For example, the bulbar conjunctiva is that part of the conjunctiva, a clear membrane of the eye, which covers the outer rounded surface of the eye. Bulbar can also apply to a rounded enlargement."
Bulbar conjunctiva,"Bulbar conjunctiva: That part of the conjunctiva, a clear membrane of the eye, which covers the outer surface of the eye. The other part of the conjunctiva is the palpebral conjunctiva, which lines the inside of the eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva is also called the ocular conjunctiva."
Bulbourethral gland,"Bulbourethral gland: A pea-sized gland in the male located behind and to the side of the urethra that discharges a component of seminal fluid into the urethra. There are two bulbourethral glands, one on each side. Also known as the Cowper's gland."
Bulging,"Bulging refers to swelling outward or protruding (for example, a bulging abdomen)."
Bulimia,"Bulimia: Also called bulimia nervosa. An eating disorder characterized by episodes of secretive excessive eating (binge-eating) followed by inappropriate methods of weight control, such as self-induced vomiting (purging), abuse of laxatives and diuretics, or excessive exercise. The insatiable appetite of bulimia is often interrupted by periods of anorexia. Like anorexia, bulimia is generally thought to be a psychological eating disorder. It is another condition that goes beyond out-of-control dieting. The cycle of overeating and purging can quickly become an obsession similar to an addiction to drugs or other substances. Although bulimia has been widely considered to be psychological and sociocultural in origin, not everyone is susceptible to developing bulimia. There is now a substantial literature showing that bulimia is strongly familial and that the pronounced familial nature of bulimia is due largely to the additive effects of a number of genes. One bulimia susceptibility gene is known to be linked to chromosome 10p (the short arm of chromosome 10). Another susceptibility gene for bulimia may be on chromosome 14."
Bulimia nervosa,Bulimia nervosa: See Bulimia.
Bulla,"Bulla: A fluid-filled blister more than 5 mm (about 3/16 inch) in diameter with thin walls. A bulla on the skin is a blister. A bulla on the pleura (the membrane covering the lung) is also called a bleb. In Latin a bulla was a ""bubble, stud or knob."" It referred to any rounded protrusion, particularly one that was hollow or cystic."
Bullous,"Bullous: Characterized by blistering, such as a second-degree burn."
Bumps,"Bumps: Bumps are raised areas protruding from a level surface, such as skin bumps; or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood vessels into the tissues as well as from the body's response to the injury. A purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is referred to as an ecchymosis."
BUN,BUN: Blood urea nitrogen.
Buprenorphine,"Buprenorphine: A prescription medication for people addicted to heroin or other opiates that acts by relieving the symptoms of opiate withdrawal such as agitation, nausea and insomnia. Buprenorphine is more weakly addictive and has a lower risk of overdose than methadone. The effects last for about three days. Buprenorphine is sold under the brand name of Subutex and, in combination with naloxone, as Suboxone. Subutex is intended for use at the beginning of treatment while Suboxone is intended for the maintenance treatment of opiate addiction. (Naloxone was added to guard against intravenous abuse of buprenorphine by individuals physically dependent on opiates.) The side effects of buprenorphine include cold or flu-like symptoms, headaches, sweating, sleeping difficulties, nausea, and mood swings. Buprenorphine can cause dangerously diminished breathing, especially when used in combination with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants."
Burn,"Burn: Damage to the skin or other body parts caused by extreme heat, flame, contact with heated objects, or chemicals. Burn depth is generally categorized as first, second, or third degree. The treatment of burns depends on the depth, area, and location of the burn, as well as additional factors, such as material that may be burned onto or into the skin. Treatment options range from simply applying a cold pack to emergency treatment to skin grafts."
Bursa,"Bursa: A closed, fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. When a bursa becomes inflamed, the condition is known as bursitis."
Bursitis,"Bursitis: Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa. A bursa is a tiny fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees."
Bursopathy,"Bursopathy: Disease involving a bursa, a closed fluid-filled sac that supplies a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. Bursopathy includes, for instance, inflammation of a bursa (bursitis)."
Burundanga (Hyoscine Hydrobromide),"Burundanga (Hyoscine Hydrobromide): a slang term used to refer to the drug scopolamine. Scopolamine is an oral, intravenous ophthalmic or topical drug with many uses, including the prevention of motion sickness."
Bx,"Bx: Abbreviation for biopsy, the removal of a sample of tissue for examination or other study. Biopsies are most frequently studied by use of a microscope to check for possible abnormalities such as inflammation or cancer. A biopsy may also be used for specialized purposes such as to start cell cultures to analyze a genetic disease or the process of aging in the laboratory."
C. difficile,C. difficile: Clostridium difficile.
C1-C7 (cervical vertebrae),"C1-C7 (cervical vertebrae): C1 through C7 are the symbols for the cervical (neck) vertebrae, the upper 7 vertebrae in the spinal column (the vertebral column). C1 is called the atlas. It supports the head and is named for the Greek god Atlas who was condemned to support the earth and its heavens on his shoulders. (Because the god Atlas often adorned maps, a compilation of maps came to be known as an atlas). C2 is called the axis because the atlas rotates about the odontoid process of C2. The joint between the atlas and axis is a pivot that allows the head to turn. C7 is sometimes called the prominent vertebra because of the length of its spinous process (the projection off the back of the vertebral body)."
CA,CA: 1. Short (and slang) for cancer and carcinoma. 2. Abbreviation for cardiac arrest; chronological age; coronary artery.
CA 27-29,"CA 27-29: A tumor marker similar to the CA 15-3 that is found in the blood of most breast cancer patients. CA 27-29 levels may be used in conjunction with other procedures (such as mammograms and measurements of other tumor marker levels) to check for recurrence in women previously treated for stage II and stage III breast cancer. CA 27-29 levels can also be elevated by cancers of the colon, stomach, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and liver. First trimester pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, benign breast disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are noncancerous conditions that can also elevate CA 27-29 levels."
Cachectic,"Cachectic: Having cachexia, physical wasting with loss of weight and muscle mass due to disease. Patients with advanced cancer, AIDS, severe heart failure and some other major chronic progressive diseases may appear cachectic."
Cachetic,Cachetic: Common misspelling of cachectic.
Cachexia,Cachexia: General physical wasting with loss of weight and muscle mass due to a disease. Also known as marasmus.
CAD,CAD: Coronary artery disease.
Cadaver,"Cadaver: A dead human body that may be used by physicians and other scientists to study anatomy, identify disease sites, determine causes of death, and provide tissue to repair a defect in a living human being. Students in medical schools study and dissect cadavers as part of their education. Others who study cadavers include archaeologists and artists. It is said that the great Renaissance artist Michelangelo (1475-1564) studied cadavers by candlelight in a dark morgue -- enduring the smell of rotting flesh -- in order to better understand bone and sinew and muscle. The fruits of his efforts are evident in his painting ""The Creation of Adam"" on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome and in his marble sculpture ""David"" in the Galleria dell' Accademia in Florence. Courts of law sometimes use the term cadaver to refer to a dead body, as do recovery teams searching for bodies after a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood. A dead body is usually a corpse in a mystery story. The term cadaver also apparently has a more deathly ring in medicine. ""Cadaver"" comes from the Latin word ""cadere"" (to fall). Related terms include ""cadaverous"" (resembling a cadaver) and ""cadaveric spasm"" (a muscle spasm that causes a dead body to twitch or jerk). A ""cadaver graft"" (also called ""postmortem graft"") refers to the grafting of tissue from a dead body onto a living human to repair a defect."
Caduceus,"Caduceus: A staff with two snakes entwined about it, topped by a pair of wings. The caduceus was carried by the Greek messenger god Hermes, whose Roman counterpart was Mercury, and is therefore the sign of a herald. By a curious misconception, the caduceus also became the insignia of the US Army Medical Corps and a well-known symbol of physicians and medicine. The Corps should have chosen the symbol of medicine: the rod of Aesculapius, which has only one snake and no wings. No wings were necessary because the essence of medicine was not speed. The single serpent that could shed its skin and emerge in full vigor represented the renewal of youth and health."
Caecal,"Caecal: Pertaining to the caecum (also spelled cecum), the first portion of the large bowel, situated in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The caecum receives fecal material from the small bowel (ileum) which opens into it. The appendix is attached to the cecum. The word ""caecum"" comes from the Latin ""caecus"" meaning ""blind."" This refers to the fact that the bottom of the caecum is a blind pouch (a cul de sac) leading nowhere."
Caecum,"Caecum: The caecum (also spelled cecum), the first portion of the large bowel, situated in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The caecum receives fecal material from the small bowel (ileum) which opens into it. The appendix is attached to the caecum. The word ""caecum"" comes from the Latin ""caecus"" meaning ""blind."" This refers to the fact that the bottom of the caecum is a blind pouch (a cul de sac) leading nowhere."
Caffeine,"Caffeine: A stimulant compound found naturally in coffee, tea, cocoa (chocolate), and kola nuts (cola) and added to soft drinks, foods, and medicines. Caffeine can cause anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, and hypertension. Caffeine is a diuretic and increases urination. It can decrease a person's ability to lose weight because it stimulates insulin secretion, which reduces blood sugar, which increases hunger. Caffeine can help to relieve headaches, so a number of over-the-counter and prescription pain relievers include it as an ingredient, usually with aspirin or another analgesic."
Calorie,"Calorie: A unit of food energy. The word calorie is ordinarily used instead of the more precise, scientific term kilocalorie. A kilocalorie represents the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a liter of water 1' centigrade at sea level. Technically, a kilocalorie represents 1,000 true calories of energy."
Calcaneal spur,"Calcaneal spur: A bony spur, also known as a heel spur, that projects from the back or underside of the heel bone (the calcaneus) and that may make walking painful. Calcaneal spurs are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis), and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel, which is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot. Spurs under the sole (the plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia, which is the bowstring-like tissue that stretches from the heel underneath the sole. These spurs can cause localized tenderness and pain that is made worse by stepping down on the heel. Calcaneal spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone, or they can be related to underlying diseases that cause arthritis, such as reactive arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Treatment is designed to decrease the inflammation and avoid reinjury. Heel lifts reduce stress on the Achilles tendon and relieve painful spurs at the back of the heel. Donut-shaped shoe inserts take pressure off plantar spurs. Infrequently, surgery is done on chronically inflamed spurs."
Calcified granuloma,"Calcified granuloma: A node-like type of tissue inflammation that has a specific appearance under a microscope (granuloma) and contains calcium deposits. Because it usually takes some time for calcium to be deposited in a granuloma, it is generally assumed that a calcified granuloma is an old granuloma, or an old area of inflammation. For example, a calcified granuloma in the lung may be due to tuberculosis contracted years earlier that is now inactive and dormant."
Calcitonin,"Calcitonin: A hormone produced by the thyroid gland that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood and promotes the formation of bone. Bone is in a constant state of remodeling. Old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts, and new bone is added by cells called osteoblasts. Calcitonin inhibits bone removal by the osteoclasts and at the same time promotes bone formation by the osteoblasts. Calcitonin is given in hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) to lower the calcium level; in osteoporosis to increase bone density and decrease the risk of a fracture; and in Paget disease to decrease bone turnover and bone pain. Also known as thyrocalcitonin."
Calcitriol,Calcitriol: The active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol is formed in the kidneys or made in the laboratory. It is used as a drug to increase calcium levels in the body in order to treat skeletal and tissue-related calcium deficiencies caused by kidney or thyroid disorders.
Calcium,"Calcium: A mineral found mainly in the hard part of bones, where it is stored. Calcium is added to bone by cells called osteoblasts and removed from bone by cells called osteoclasts. Calcium is essential for healthy bones and is also important for muscle contraction, heart action, and normal blood clotting. Food sources of calcium include dairy foods; some leafy green vegetables, such as broccoli and collards; canned salmon; clams; oysters; calcium-fortified foods; and soy foods, such as tofu. According to the National Academy of Sciences, adequate intake of calcium is 1 gram daily for both men and women. The upper limit for calcium intake is 2.5 grams daily."
Calcium channel blocker,"Calcium channel blocker: A drug that blocks the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of the heart and the arteries. It is the entry of calcium into these cells that causes the heart to contract and arteries to narrow. By blocking the entry of calcium, calcium channel blocker (CCBs) decrease the contraction of the heart and dilate (widen) the arteries. By dilating the arteries, CCBs reduce the pressure in the arteries. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood, and, as a result, the heart needs less oxygen. By reducing the heart's need for oxygen, CCBs prevent or relieve angina. CCBs also are used for treating high blood pressure because of their blood pressure-lowering effects. CCBs also slow the rate at which the heart beats and are therefore used for treating certain abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation. The most common side effects of CCBs are constipation, nausea, headache, rash, edema (swelling of the legs with fluid), low blood pressure, drowsiness, and dizziness. When diltiazem or verapamil are given to individuals with heart failure, symptoms of heart failure may worsen because these drugs reduce the ability of the heart to pump blood. Most of the interactions of CCBs occur with verapamil or diltiazem. The interaction occurs because verapamil and diltiazem decrease the elimination of a number of drugs by the liver. Through this mechanism, verapamil and diltiazem may reduce the elimination and increase the blood levels of carbamazepine (Tegretol), simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and lovastatin (Mevacor). This can lead to toxicity from these drugs. The CCBS that have been approved for use in the US include nisoldipine (Sular), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), bepridil (Vascor), isradipine (Dynacirc), nimodipine (Nimotop), felodipine (Plendil), amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem), and verapamil (Calan, Isoptin)."
Calcium deficiency,"Calcium deficiency: A low blood level of calcium (hypocalcemia), which can make the nervous system highly irritable, causing spasms of the hands and feet (tetany), muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, overly active reflexes, and so on. Chronic calcium deficiency contributes to poor mineralization of bones, soft bones (osteomalacia) and osteoporosis, and, in children, rickets and impaired growth."
Calculi,Calculi: The plural of calculus.
"Calculus, renal","Calculus, renal: A stone in the kidney (or lower down in the urinary tract). Also called a kidney stone. The stones themselves are called renal caluli. The word ""calculus"" (plural: calculi) is the Latin word for pebble. Renal stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones occur in 1 in 20 people at some time in their life. The development of the stones is related to decreased urine volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine collecting area (the pelvis) of the kidney and may range in size from tiny to staghorn stones the size of the renal pelvis itself. The cystine stones (below) compared in size to a quarter (a U.S. $0.25 coin) were obtained from the kidney of a young woman by percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL), a procedure for crushing and removing the dense stubborn stones characteristic of cystinuria.  The pain with kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and colicky (intermittent), not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Factors predisposing to kidney stones include recent reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause hyperuricemia (high uric acid) and a history of gout. Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones may not. There are several factors which influence the ability to pass a stone. These include the size of the person, prior stone passage, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, and the size of the stone. A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. If a stone does not pass, certain procedures (usually done by a urology specialist) may be needed. The process of stone formation is called nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis. ""Nephrolithiasis"" is derived from the Greek nephros- (kidney) lithos (stone) = kidney stone ""Urolithiasis"" is from the French word ""urine"" which, in turn, stems from the Latin ""urina"" and the Greek ""ouron"" meaning urine = urine stone."
Calf,"Calf: The belly or fleshy hind part of the back of the leg below the knee. The calf is made up mainly of the gastrocnemius muscle. Pain in the calf is commonly caused by muscle strain, but can be caused by blood clots in veins of the legs."
Calipers,Calipers: A metal or plastic tool similar to a compass used to measure the diameter of an object. The skin fold thickness in several parts of the body can be measured with skin calipers to determine the lean body mass.
Callus,"Callus: 1. A localized firm thickening of the upper layer of skin as a result of repetitive friction. A callus on the skin of the foot has become thick and hard from rubbing (as a result of repetitive friction). Calluses of the feet may lead to other problems such as serious infections. Shoes that fit well can keep calluses from forming on the feet. 2. The hard new bone substance that forms in an area of bone fracture. Bony callus is part of the bone repair process. Also called, less often, a callosity. Both callus and callosity are derived from the Latin callum meaning thick skin."
Calor,"Calor: Heat, one of the four classic signs of inflammation together with dolor, rubor, and tumor (pain, redness, and swelling, respectively)."
"Calor, dolor, rubor, and tumor","Calor, dolor, rubor, and tumor: Heat, pain, redness, and swelling. The four classical signs of inflammation, originally recorded by the Roman encyclopedist Celsus in the 1st century A.D."
Calorie,"Calorie: A unit of food energy. The word calorie is ordinarily used instead of the more precise, scientific term kilocalorie. A kilocalorie represents the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a liter of water 1' centigrade at sea level. Technically, a kilocalorie represents 1,000 true calories of energy."
Cancer,"Cancer: An abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). Cancer is not one disease. It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area. Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start. If a cancer spreads (metastasizes), the new tumor bears the same name as the original (primary) tumor. The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender. While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women, the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women, breast cancer. Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality. Skin cancers are often curable. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today. Benign tumors are NOT cancer; malignant tumors are cancer. Cancer is NOT contagious. Cancer is the Latin word for crab. The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy, doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades. Cancer may also be called malignancy, a malignant tumor, or a neoplasm (literally, a new growth)."
Candida albicans,"Candida albicans: A yeast-like fungal organism found in small amounts in the normal human intestinal tract. Normally kept in check by the body's own helpful bacteria, C. albicans can increase in numbers when this balance is disturbed to cause candidiasis of the intestinal tract, or yeast infections of other parts of the body. C. albicans causes thrush. Also called Monilia albicans. See also Candidiasis."
Candidiasis,"Candidiasis: Disease caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Candida albicans can cause vaginal yeast infections, diaper rash, skin rashes that emerge in moist, warm folds of skin, and thrush (white patches inside the mouth and throat). Candidiasis tends to develop when the normal balance of bacteria is upset, as sometimes occurs with the use of antibiotics. Prevention measures include the use of probiotics, and in some cases, dietary changes. Candidiasis can be treated with antifungal medications. Candidiasis is usually a minor and easily addressed problem, but it can be an important problem for those with immune-system disorders, such as AIDS."
Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS),"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS): a condition of cyclic attacks of nausea and vomiting in people who are chronic users of cannabis. The condition typically develops in people who have been using cannabis for years, and its cause is unknown. Despite the well-known effects of marijuana in reducing nausea, there is increasing evidence for these paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Symptoms of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome include frequent and debilitating bouts of vomiting sometimes accompanied by abdominal pain and weight loss. In between these bouts of vomiting there are symptom-free intervals. Those affected by the condition typically begin to take hot showers or baths during the episodes. This behavior often becomes a compulsion as they seek relief from the incapacitating episodes of vomiting."
Capillaries,"Capillaries: Capillaries are the smallest of blood vessels. They serve to distribute oxygenated blood from arteries to the tissues of the body and to feed deoxygenated blood from the tissues back into the veins. The capillaries are thus a central component in the circulatory system, essentially between the arteries and the veins. When pink areas of skin are compressed, this causes blanching because blood is pressed out of the capillaries. The blood is the fluid in the body that contains, among other elements, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry the oxygen and give the blood its red color."
Capillary,"Capillary: A tiny blood vessel that connects an arteriole (the smallest division of an artery) with a venule (the smallest division of a vein). Although tiny, the capillary plays an imortant role in the circulatory system. The walls of capillaries act as semipermeable membranes that permit the exchange of various substances, including fluids and the gases oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the blood stream and the tissues of the body."
caps,Caps: Abbreviation for capsules.
Capsule,"Capsule: Capsule has many meanings in medicine including the following: Derived from the diminutive of the Latin word ""capsa"" meaning ""box"", a capsule is literally ""a little box"" and can refer to any encompassing structure or small container."
Carbohydrates,"Carbohydrates: Mainly sugars and starches, together constituting one of the three principal types of nutrients used as energy sources (calories) by the body. Carbohydrates can also be defined chemically as neutral compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Carbohydrates come in simple forms such as sugars and in complex forms such as starches and fiber. The body breaks down most sugars and starches into glucose, a simple sugar that the body can use to feed its cells. Complex carbohydrates are derived from plants. Dietary intake of complex carbohydrates can lower blood cholesterol when they are substituted for saturated fat. Carbohydrates are classified into mono, di, tri, poly and heterosaccharides. The smallest carbohydrates are monosaccharides such as glucose whereas polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose and glycogen can be large and even indeterminate in length. The energy produced by carbohydrates is 4 calories per gram. Proteins also provide 4 calories per gram. Fats are high-cal; they provide 9 calories per gram. Etymology: Carbohydrates are called carbohydrates because the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen they contain are usually in the proportion to form water with the general formula Cn(H2O)n."
Carbon dioxide,"Carbon dioxide: A gas which is the byproduct of cellular metabolism and which collects in the tissues, is cleared from the tissues by the blood within the veins, is carried by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, and removed from the body via the lungs in the exhaled air. Abbreviated CO2."
Carboxyhemoglobinemia,"Carboxyhemoglobinemia: The presence of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood. Carboxyhemoglobin, hemoglobin that has carbon monoxide bound to it, is formed in carbon monoxide poisoning, as from exhaust (such as from a car, truck, boat or generator), smoke from a fire, or tobacco smoke."
Carcinogen,"Carcinogen: A substance or agent that causes cancer. Related terms include the adjective ""carcinogenic"" and the nouns ""carcinogenesis"" and ""carcinogenicity."" One of the best-known carcinogens is ionizing radiation. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified some 60 substances and processes as probably or definitely carcinogenic in humans. These substances and processes are divided into three categories -- Agents and groups of agents, Mixtures, and Exposure circumstances."
Carcinogenic,Carcinogenic: Having a cancer-causing potential.
Carcinoma,"Carcinoma: Cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover body organs. Examples are carcinoma of the breast, colon, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, or stomach."
Cardiac,Cardiac: Having to do with the heart.
Cardiac index,"Cardiac index: A cardiodynamic measure based on the cardiac output, which is the amount of blood the left ventricle ejects into the systemic circulation in one minute, measured in liters per minute (l/min). Cardiac output is indexed to a patient's body size by dividing by the body surface area to yield the cardiac index."
Cardiac output,Cardiac output: The amount of blood the heart pumps through the circulatory system in a minute. The amount of blood put out by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume and the heart rate determine the cardiac output. A normal adult has a cardiac output of 4.7 liters (5 quarts) of blood per minute.
Cardiomegaly,"Cardiomegaly: Enlargement of the heart. Cardiomegaly is a descriptive term that is used to refer to the physical finding of an enlarged heart and is not a disease itself. Cardiomegaly can be caused by a number of different conditions including diseases of the heart muscle or heart valves, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly can also sometimes accompany longstanding anemia and thyroid disease among other conditions. Treatment and prognosis are dependent upon the underlying cause. Also referred to as enlarged heart."
Cardiomyopathy,Cardiomyopathy: Disease of the heart muscle (myocardium).
Cardiopathy,"Cardiopathy: Heart disease. A nonspecific term applicable to any and all diseases of the heart. From cardio- + the Greek pathos, disease."
Cardiopulmonary,Cardiopulmonary: Having to do with both the heart and lungs.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A life-saving emergency procedure that involves breathing for the victim and applying external chest compression to make the heart pump. Abbreviated CPR. In the early stages of a heart attack, death can often be avoided if a bystander starts CPR within 5 minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation. When paramedics arrive, medications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion) to the heart can be administered to convert ventricular fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm. Prompt CPR and rapid paramedic response can improve the chances of survival from a heart attack."
Cardiovascular,"Cardiovascular: Relating to the circulatory system, which comprises the heart and blood vessels and carries nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of the body and removes carbon dioxide and other wastes from them. Cardiovascular diseases are conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels and include arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, shock, endocarditis, diseases of the aorta and its branches, disorders of the peripheral vascular system, and congenital heart disease."
Cardiovascular disease,"Cardiovascular disease: Disease affecting the heart or blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases include arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, shock, endocarditis, diseases of the aorta and its branches, disorders of the peripheral vascular system, and congenital heart disease."
Caries,"Caries: Dental cavities in the two outer layers of a tooth (the enamel and the dentin). Small caries may not cause pain, and may not be noticed by the patient. Larger caries can collect food, and the inner pulp of the affected tooth can become irritated by bacterial toxins or by foods that are cold, hot, sour, or sweet causing a toothache. Caries are caused by the Streptococcus bacteria, which produces an enamel-dissolving acid as it devours carbohydrate deposits (plaque) on the teeth. To prevent caries, one should brush and floss the teeth daily, use a bacteriocidal mouthwash, and have regular dental cleanings by a professional. If caries do occur, the eroded area can be cleaned and filled by a dentist to prevent further damage."
Carminative,"Carminative: An agent that prevents or relieves flatulence (gas in the gastrointestinal tract) and, in infants, may help in the treatment of colic. The origin of the word ""carminative"" is particularly curious. It was borrowed from the French carminatif (masc.), carminative (fem.). Virtually all English-language dictionaries state that the French took the word from the Latin carminare, to card wool. However, a respected French dictionary Le Petit Robert indicates that carminare meant nettoyer, to cleanse. The confusion appears to stem from the fact that to card wool was to cleanse it. Thus, a carminative cleanses the bowels."
Carotid,"Carotid: Pertaining to the carotid artery and the area near that key artery, which is located in the front of the neck."
Carotid stenosis,"Carotid stenosis: Abnormal narrowing of the carotid artery, often a preamble to a stroke."
Cartilage,"Cartilage: Firm, rubbery tissue that cushions bones at joints. A flexible kind of cartilage makes up other parts of the body, such as the larynx and the outside parts of the ears."
Cascade,"Cascade: A sequence of successive activation reactions involving enzymes (enzyme cascade) or hormones (hormone cascade) characterized by a series of amplifications of an initial stimulus. In blood coagulation, for example, each enzyme activates the next until the final product, the fibrin clot, is reached."
Caseous,"Caseous: Cheeselike. In caseous lymphadenitis, the lymph nodes turn into a soft, dry, crumbly mass resembling cheese, usually due to tuberculosis or a related infection. From caseum, the Latin word for cheese."
Cashew allergy,"Cashew allergy: An allergic reaction to cashew nuts. Cashew allergy can be isolated, meaning that the individual is only allergic to cashews and not to other nuts, or the allergy may extend to other kinds of tree nuts such as walnuts and pistachios. Isolated cashew allergy can strike children or adults. No prior exposure to cashews is required for an allergic reaction to cashews. In children the average age of their first allergic reaction to cashews is 2 years. One in every 5 children has previously eaten cashew nuts but, conversely, 4 out every 5 children have no known prior exposure to cashews. The nature of the reaction to cashews is variable -- about 50% have skin symptoms like hives, 25% have respiratory signs such as difficulty breathing and 17% have an intestinal reaction to the cashews. The reaction can range from mild to life-threatening. Almost one-third of children are also allergic to pistachios, which belong to the same botanical family of tree nuts as cashews."
Cassette,"Cassette: A pre-existing structure into which an insert can be moved. In molecular biology, a gene conversion process in which the old gene is replaced with a copy of a silent gene and the new copy becomes active. As the process involves replacing one ready made construct with another in an active slot, it is termed a cassette mechanism."
Cast,"Cast: 1) A protective shell of fiberglass, plastic, or plaster, and bandage that is molded to protect broken or fractured limb(s) as it heals. 2) An abnormal mass of dead cells that forms in a body cavity. For example, cases of cells that form in the tubules of the kidneys are sometimes detected in urine samples."
CAT scan,"CAT scan: Computerized axial tomography scan. CAT scanning is a painless X-ray test in which a computer generates cross-section views of a patient's anatomy. It can identify normal and abnormal structures, and it can be used to guide procedures. Contrast material is sometimes used in CAT scanning. A patient who is allergic to iodine or contrast materials and is scheduled to have a CAT scan should notify the physician and the radiology staff about the allergy. Also known as CT scan."
Catalyst,"Catalyst: A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction but is not consumed or altered in the process. Catalysts are of immense importance in chemistry and biology. All enzymes are catalysts that expedite the biochemical reactions necessary for life. The enzymes in saliva, for example, accelerate the conversion of starch to glucose, doing in minutes what would otherwise take weeks."
Cataplasm,"Cataplasm: A poultice or plaster. A soft moist mass, often warm and medicated, that is spread over the skin to treat an inflamed, aching or painful area, to improve the circulation, etc. From the Greek kataplasma, poultice, from kataplasso, to spread over. See also: Mustard plaster; Poultice."
Cataplexy,"Cataplexy: A debilitating condition in which a person suddenly feels weak and collapses at times of strong emotion such as during laughter, anger, fear, or surprise. In so collapsing, people with cataplexy may injure themselves. For example, laughter and other emotions may trigger a reflex that can bring many of the muscles of the body to the point of collapse. Cataplexy often affects people who have narcolepsy."
Cataract,"Cataract: A clouding or loss of transparency of the lens in the eye as a result of tissue breakdown and protein clumping. There are many causes of cataracts, including aging, cortisone medication, trauma, diabetes, and other diseases. Cataracts affect most people who live into an old age. Symptoms include double or blurred vision and sensitivity to light and glare. A physician can diagnose cataracts by examining the eyes with a viewing instrument. Sunglasses can help to prevent cataracts. "
Cataract surgery,"Cataract surgery: Removal of the clouded (cataractous) lens in its entirety via surgery and replacement of the lens with an intraocular lens (IOL) made of plastic. A typical cataract operation takes about an hour, requires local anesthesia only, and usually does not require hospitalization."
Catecholamine,"Catecholamine: Pronounced cat?e?chol?amine. An amine derived from the amino acid tyrosine -- examples include epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and dopamine -- that act as hormones or neurotransmitters. There are a number of disorders involving catecholamines, including neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, chemodectina, the familial paraganglioma syndrome, dopamine-?-hydroxalase deficiency, and tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency Neuroblastoma is the second most common solid tumor in childhood (after brain tumors). It usually produce catecholamines. The catecholamine metabolites vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid can be measured quantitatively in the urine as a test for the disease. Pheochromocytoma is a benign tumor derived from the adrenal medulla or sympathetic paraganglia. The tumor secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. These catecholamines cause attacks of hypertension, headache, nausea and vomiting, sweating, pallor and severe apprehension. Chemodectoma is another benign tumor of the chemoreceptor system, the most common types being the carotid body tumor and the glomus jugulare tumor. Also known as nonchromaffin paraganglioma. Familial paraganglioma syndrome is an unusual familial disease involving slow-growing benign tumors -- paragangliomas, glomus tumors, or chemodectomas -- predominantly in the head and neck region. The gene for the disease is on chromosome 11q23. The tumors may lead to disfiguring local swellings, cranial nerve injury, or involvement of the base of the skull and may cause dysphonia, aspiration, hearing loss, dysphagia, tinnitus, pain, persistent cough, and shoulder weakness (due to tumor encroachment on cranial nerves). All individuals with hereditary paragangliomas inherit the disease gene from their father. This is consistent with genomic imprinting: the maternally derived gene is inactivated during oogenesis and can be reactivated only during spermatogenesis. Dopamine-?-hydroxalase deficiency is a congenital form of severe orthostatic hypotension caused by complete absence of the enzyme dopamine-?-hydroxalase. During childhood impaired exercise tolerance, fatigue, and episodes of syncope (fainting) are common. Symptoms from orthostatic hypotension become worse in late adolescence and in early adulthood. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is a genetic defect of enzymes required for the synthesis (production) of catecholamines, resulting in a deficiency in neurotransmitters. Symptoms begin between two and eight months of age, and include unstable body temperature, swallowing difficulties, hypersalivation, pinpoint pupils, ptosis of the eyelids, decreased mobility, drowsiness, and irritability."
Category five hurricane,"Category five hurricane: A hurricane with winds greater than 155 mph (135 kt or 249 km/hr). Storm surge generally greater than 18 ft above normal. Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Severe and extensive window and door damage. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the center of the hurricane. Major damage to lower floors of all structures located less than 15 ft above sea level and within 500 yards of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles (8-16 km) of the shoreline may be required. Hurricanes are rated on a 1-5 scale based on the hurricane's intensity. The scale is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. See: Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale."
Category three hurricane,"Category three hurricane: A hurricane with winds 111-130 mph (96-113 kt or 178-209 km/hr). Storm surge generally 9-12 ft above normal. Some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings with a minor amount of curtainwall failures. Damage to shrubbery and trees with foliage blown off trees and large trees blown down. Mobile homes and poorly constructed signs are destroyed. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the center of the hurricane. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures with larger structures damaged by battering from floating debris. Terrain continuously lower than 5 ft above mean sea level may be flooded inland 8 miles (13 km) or more. Evacuation of low-lying residences with several blocks of the shoreline may be required. Hurricanes are rated on a 1-5 scale based on the hurricane's intensity. The scale is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. See: Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale."
Category two hurricane,"Category two hurricane: A hurricane with winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kt or 154-177 km/hr). Storm surge generally 6-8 feet above normal. Some roofing material, door, and window damage of buildings. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees with some trees blown down. Considerable damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers. Coastal and low-lying escape routes flood 2-4 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings. Hurricanes are rated on a 1-5 scale based on the hurricane's intensity. The scale is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. See: Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale."
Catheter,"Catheter: A thin, flexible tube."
"Catheter, Foley","Catheter, Foley: A flexible plastic tube (a catheter) inserted into the bladder to provide continuous urinary drainage. The ""Foley"" has a balloon on the bladder end. After the catheter is inserted in the bladder, the balloon is inflated (with air or fluid) so that the catheter cannot pull out but is retained in the bladder as an ""indwelling"" catheter. Removal is accomplished simply by deflating the balloon and slipping the catheter out. The ""Foley"" is named for the American urologist Frederic Eugene Basil Foley (1891-1966)."
Caudad,"Caudad: Toward the feet (or, in embryology, toward the tail), as opposed to cranial. The spinal cord is caudad to the brain. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Caudal,"Caudal: An anatomic term meaning 1. Pertaining to the tail or the hind part. 2. Situated in or directed toward the tail or hind part. 3. Inferior to another structure, in the sense of being below it. Caudal is also short for caudal epidural anesthesia. The terms caudal and caudad are both derived from the Latin cauda, tail. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Cavities,"Cavities: Holes or structural damage in the two outer layers of a tooth called the enamel and the dentin. The enamel is the outermost white hard surface and the dentin is the yellow layer just beneath enamel. Both layers serve to protect the inner living tooth tissue called the pulp, where blood vessels and nerves reside. Cavities are caused by bacteria in the mouth. Small cavities may not cause pain, and may be unnoticed by the patient. Larger cavities can collect food, and the inner pulp of the affected tooth can become irritated by bacterial toxins, foods that are cold, hot, sour, or sweet - causing toothache. Also referred to as caries."
CBC,"CBC: A commonly used abbreviation in medicine that stands for complete blood count, a set values of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. These measurements are generally determined by specially designed machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute. The values generally included are the following: "
CCD (cleidocranial dysostosis),"CCD (cleidocranial dysostosis): A genetic (inherited) disorder of bone development characterized by: The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. A parent with the condition has a 50:50 chance that each of their children will have the condition. Boys and girls stand an equal chance of being affected. The gene for the condition has been found on chromosome 6 (specifically, in band p21). The gene is for the transcription factor CBFA1 (core-binding factor alpha subunit 1). Mutations of CBFA1 cause this disorder. A possible example of this disorder has been found in the skull of a Neanderthal man."
CCP,CCP: Cyclic citrullinated peptide.
CDC,"CDC: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US agency charged with tracking and investigating public health trends. A part of the US Public Health Services (PHS) under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC is based in Atlanta, Georgia. It publishes key health information, including weekly data on all deaths and diseases reported in the US and travelers' health advisories. The CDC also fields special rapid-response teams to halt epidemic diseases."
Cecum,"Cecum: The first portion of the large bowel, which is situated in the lower-right quadrant of the abdomen. The cecum receives fecal material from the small bowel (ileum), which opens into it. The appendix is attached to the cecum."
Celiac disease,"Celiac disease: A disorder resulting from an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat and related grains, and present in many foods. Celiac disease causes impaired absorption and digestion of nutrients through the small intestine. Symptoms include frequent diarrhea , weight loss , iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis . A skin condition dermatitis herpetiformis can be associated with celiac disease. The most accurate test for celiac disease is a biopsy of the small bowel usually performed by an endoscopy (tube passed into the intestine through the mouth). Treatment is to avoid gluten in the diet. Medications may be used for refractory (stubborn) celiac disease."
Cell,"Cell: The basic structural and functional unit of any living thing. Each cell is a small container of chemicals and water wrapped in a membrane. There are 100 trillion cells in a human, and each contains all of the genetic information necessary to manufacture a human being. This information is encoded within the cell nucleus in 6 billion subunits of DNA called base pairs. These base pairs are packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes, with 1 chromosome in each pair coming from each parent. Each of the 46 human chromosomes contains the DNA for thousands of individual genes."
Cellulitis,"Cellulitis: A spreading bacterial infection underneath the skin surface characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. Cellulitis commonly appears in areas where there is a break in the skin."
Centimeter (cm),"Centimeter (cm): A unit of measure in the metric system which is 1/100'th of a meter. There are 2.54 centimeters (cms) in one inch. The centimeter is commonly used in medicine to state the size of objects or distance between points. It may seem senseless to define a centimeter in a medical dictionary but in North American medicine (and medicine everywhere) today, length measurements are usually expressed in such metric units and not in inches or feet."
Central,"Central: In anatomy and medicine (as elsewhere), central is the opposite of ""peripheral"" which means away from the center. The word ""peripheral"" comes from the Greek ""peripheria"" (""peri-"", around or about + ""pherein"", to bear, carry). A central line is an infusion tube that is located in or near the heart (centrally in the circulatory system). A Swan-Ganz cather with its tip, for example, in the right atrium and ventricle of the heart is a central line. On the other hand, a peripheral line is located on the periphery of the circulatory system. An ordinary IV (intravenous) catheter is a peripheral line. The human nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The brain and spinal cord make up the CNS. The PNS contains the nerves outside the CNS."
Central line,"Central line: An infusion tube located in or near the heart, which is at the center of the circulatory system. For example, a Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the right atrium and ventricle of the heart is a central line."
Central nervous system (CNS),"Central nervous system (CNS): The central nervous system is that part of the nervous system that consists of the brain and spinal cord. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the two major divisions of the nervous system. The other is the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which is outside the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear), other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels and glands. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and what are called the autonomic nerves that are concerned specifically with the regulation of the heart muscle, the muscles in blood vessel walls, and glands."
Central venous line,"Central venous line: A catheter (tube) that is passed through a vein to end up in the thoracic (chest) portion of the vena cava (the large vein returning blood to the heart) or in the right atrium of the heart. Central venous lines have a number of different uses. A central venous line allows concentrated solutions to be infused with less risk of complications. It permits monitoring of special blood pressures including the central venous pressure, the pulmonary artery pressure, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. A central venous line can be used for the estimation of cardiac output and vascular resistance. The near end of the catheter may also be connected to a chamber for injections given over periods of months. A central venous line saves having to have frequent small injections or ""drips"" placed in the arms. It may also allow a patient to have medicine or fluids at home instead of in the hospital. The central venous line may be inserted for the short term or long term. There are two types of long term central lines: the cuffed or tunnelled line and the reservoir long line that ends in a rubber bulb or reservoir. The possible complications of a central venous line include air in the chest (pneumothorax) due to a punctured lung, bleeding in the chest (hemothorax), fluid in the chest (hydrothorax), ble4eding into or under the skin (hematoma) and infection. If the line becomes disconnected, air may enter the blood and cause problems with breathing or a stroke. A central venous line is also called a central venous catheter. Sometimes, the ""venous"" is omitted and it is called a central line or central catheter."
Central vision,"Central vision: A process in which millions of cells change light into nerve signals that tell the brain what the person is seeing. As a person reads, drives, and performs other activities that require fine, sharp, straight-ahead vision, light is focused onto the macula in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye."
Centric-fusion translocation,"Centric-fusion translocation: A type of chromosome rearrangement, also called a Robertsonian translocation, in which there is fusion of an entire long arm of one acrocentric chromosome with a similarly intact long arm of another acrocentric chromosome. The short arms of the chromosomes participating in the translocation are usually lost. Acrocentric chromosomes have their centromere near but not at the very end of the chromosome. In humans, chromosomes 13-15, 21 and 22 are acrocentric. Centric-fusion translocations are relatively common. In balanced form, they take the place of two acrocentric chromosomes and result in no problems. But in unbalanced form, centric-fusion translocations account for some cases of the trisomy 13 (Patau) syndrome and trisomy 21 (Down) syndrome."
Cephal-,Cephal-: Prefix indicating the head.
Cephalgia,Cephalgia: Headache.
Cephalic,"Cephalic: Relating to the head or the head end of the body. Situated on, in, or near the head. Cephalic is synonymous with cranial, relating to the cranium or head. The word ""cephalic"" came from the Middle French ""cephalique,"" from the Latin ""cephalicus"", from the Greek ""kephalikos"" meaning head."
Cerebral,Cerebral: Of or pertaining to the cerebrum or the brain.
Cerebral edema,"Cerebral edema: Accumulation of excessive fluid in the substance of the brain. The brain is especially susceptible to injury from edema, because it is located within a confined space and cannot expand. Also known as brain edema, brain swelling, swelling of the brain, and wet brain."
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy: An abnormality of motor function (the ability to move and control movements) that is acquired at an early age, usually less than 1 year, and is due to a brain lesion that is nonprogressive. Abbreviated CP. CP is frequently the result of abnormalities that occur while a fetus is developing inside the womb. Such abnormalities may include accidents of brain development, genetic disorders, stroke due to abnormal blood vessels or blood clots, or infection of the brain. In rare instances, obstetrical accidents during particularly difficult deliveries can cause brain damage and result in CP. CP can take three forms: spastic, choreoathetoid, and hypotonic (flaccid). In spastic CP, there is an abnormality of muscle tone in which one or more extremities (arms or legs) are held in a rigid posture. Choreoathetoid CP is associated with abnormal, uncontrollable writhing movements of the arms and/or legs. A child with hypotonic CP appears floppy'like a rag doll. Treatment may include the use of casting and braces to prevent further loss of limb function, speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, the use of augmentative communication devices, and the use of medications or botulism toxin (botox) injections to treat spasticity."
Cerebrospinal fluid,"Cerebrospinal fluid: A watery fluid that is continuously produced and absorbed and that flows in the ventricles within the brain and around the surface of the brain and spinal cord. Abbreviated CSF. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, a series of infolded blood vessels that project into the cerebral ventricles, and it is absorbed into the venous system. If production exceeds absorption, CSF pressure rises, and the result is hydrocephalus. This can also occur if the CSF pathways are obstructed, causing the fluid to accumulate. The CSF obtained during a lumbar puncture is analyzed to detect disease."
Cerebrovascular,"Cerebrovascular: Pertaining to the blood vessels and, especially, the arteries that supply the brain. As in cerebrovascular accident or cerebrovascular disease."
Cerebrovascular Accident,"Cerebrovascular accident: The sudden death of some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when the blood flow to the brain is impaired by blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain. A CVA is also referred to as a stroke. Symptoms of a stroke depend on the area of the brain affected. The most common symptom is weakness or paralysis of one side of the body with partial or complete loss of voluntary movement or sensation in a leg or arm. There can be speech problems and weak face muscles, causing drooling. Numbness or tingling is very common. A stroke involving the base of the brain can affect balance, vision, swallowing, breathing, and even unconsciousness. A stroke is a medical emergency. Anyone suspected of having a stroke should be taken immediately to a medical facility for diagnosis and treatment. The causes of stroke: An artery to the brain may be blocked by a clot (thrombosis) which typically occurs in a blood vessel that has previously been narrowed due to atherosclerosis (""hardening of the artery""). When a blood clot or a piece of an atherosclerotic plaque (a cholesterol and calcium deposit on the wall of the artery) breaks loose, it can travel through the circulation and lodge in an artery of the brain, plugging it up and stopping the flow of blood; this is referred to as an embolic stroke. A blood clot can form in a chamber of the heart when the heart beats irregularly, as in atrial fibrillation; such clots usually stay attached to the inner lining of the heart but they may break off, travel through the bloodstream, form a plug (embolus) in a brain artery and cause a stroke. A cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), as from an aneurysm (a widening and weakening) of a blood vessel in the brain, also causes a stroke. The diagnosis of stroke involves a medical history and a physical examination. Tests are done to search for treatable causes of a stroke and help prevent further brain damage. A CAT scan (a special X-ray study) of the brain is often done to show bleeding into the brain; this is treated differently than a stroke caused by lack of blood supply. A CAT scan also can rule out some other conditions that may mimic a stroke. A soundwave of the heart (echocardiogram) may be done to look for a source of blood clots in the heart. Narrowing of the carotid artery (the main artery that supplies blood to each side of the brain) in the neck can be seen with a soundwave test called a carotid ultrasound. Blood tests are done to look for signs of inflammation which can suggest inflamed arteries. Certain blood proteins are tested that can increase the chance of stroke by thickening the blood. Stroke look-alikes: Just because a person has slurred speech or weakness on one side of the body does not necessarily mean that person has had a stroke. There are many other nervous system disorders that can mimic a stroke including a brain tumor, a subdural hematoma (a collection of blood between the brain and the skull) or a brain abscess (a pool of pus in the brain caused by bacteria or a fungus). Virus infection of the brain (viral encephalitis) can cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke, as can an overdose of certain medications. Dehydration or an imbalance of sodium, calcium, or glucose can cause neurologic abnormalities similar to a stroke. Treatment of a stroke: Early use of anticoagulants to minimize blood clotting has value in some patients. Treatment of blood pressure that is too high or too low may be necessary. The blood sugar (glucose) in diabetics is often quite high after a stroke; controlling the glucose level may minimize the size of a stroke. Drugs that can dissolve blood clots may be useful in stroke treatment. Clot retrieving interventions can now be performed in some stroke centers. Oxygen is given as needed. New medications that can help oxygen-starved brain cells survive while circulation is reestablished are being developed. Rehabilitation: When a patient is no longer acutely ill after a stroke, the aim turns to maximizing the patient's functional abilities. This can be done in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital or in a special area of a general hospital and in a nursing facility. The rehabilitation process can involve speech therapy to relearn talking and swallowing, occupational therapy for regaining dexterity of the arms and hands, physical therapy for improving strength and walking, etc. The goal is for the patient to resume as many of their pre-stroke activities as possible. Footnote: The term ""stroke"" reflects the belief among the ancient Greeks and Romans that someone suffering a stroke (or any sudden incapacity) had been struck down by the gods."
Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) prevention,"Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) prevention: In many cases, a person may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a neurological event with the symptoms of a stroke, but the symptoms go away within a short period of time, usually a few minutes to a few hours. This is often caused by the narrowing or ulceration of the carotid arteries (the major arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain). If not treated, there is a high risk of having a major stroke in the future. If you suspect a TIA, you should seek medical attention right away. An operation to clean out the carotid artery and restore normal blood flow through the artery (a carotid endarterectomy) markedly reduces the incidence of a subsequent stroke. In other cases, when a person has a narrowed carotid artery, but no symptoms, the risk of having a stroke can be reduced with medications such as aspirin and platelet-inhibiting blood thinners. These medications act by partially blocking the function of blood elements, called platelets, which assist blood clotting."
Cervical,"Cervical: Having to do with any kind of neck, including the neck on which the head is perched and the neck of the uterus."
Cervical dystocia,"Cervical dystocia: Difficult labor and delivery caused by mechanical obstruction at the cervix. Dystocia comes from the Greek ""dys"" meaning ""difficult, painful, disordered, abnormal"" + ""tokos"" meaning ""birth."""
Cervicitis,Cervicitis: Inflammation of the uterine cervix.
Cervix,"Cervix: The cervix is the lower, narrow part of the uterus (womb). The uterus, a hollow, pear-shaped organ, is located in a woman's lower abdomen, between the bladder and the rectum. The cervix forms a canal that opens into the vagina, which leads to the outside of the body. The word ""cervix"" comes straight from Latin for ""neck""."
CF,"CF: 1. Cystic fibrosis, one of the most frequent and serious genetic diseases, CF affects the exocrine glands and is characterized by the production of abnormal secretions, leading to mucous build-up. This accumulation of mucus can impair the pancreas and, secondarily, the intestine. Mucous build-up in lungs tends progressively to impair respiration. Without treatment, CF results in death for 95% of affected children before age 5. However, with diligent medical care patients with CF are surviving even beyond middle age. Early diagnosis of CF is of great importance. Early and continuing treatment of CF is essential for long-term survival. However, as more people with CF survive childhood, new problems are emerging. For example, 68% of 75 adult women with CF reported leakage of urine within the past year. Coughing, sneezing, laughing and airway clearance provoked the leakage, which was worse when their chest disease was most severe. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affects both boys and girls. One in 400 white couples is at risk for having children with CF and their risk with each pregnancy is 1 in 4, so (multiplying 1 in 400 times 1 in 4) the overall risk that their child will have CF is 1 in 1600. Note that once a couple has had a CF child, the risk that each of their subsequent children will have CF drops to 1 in 4 (25%). The treatment of CF includes physical therapy to loosen the mucus in the lungs, pancreatic enzymes, and medications to fight dangerous infections of the lungs. CF is caused by mutations in a gene called CFTR (for the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator), which is located on chromosome 7.2. Citrovorum factor."
Chain-termination codon,"Chain-termination codon: A set of three adjacent bases in the DNA or their complementary bases in messenger RNA that specifies the end of a polypeptide chain. The three chain-termination codons (in messenger RNA) are UAA, UAG, and UGA. They are also called termination codons, stop codons, or nonsense codons. U = uracil; A = adenine; G = guanine."
CHAMPUS,"CHAMPUS: Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. CHAMPUS is a US federally funded health program that provides beneficiaries with medical care, supplemental to that available in US military and Public Health Service facilities. All CHAMPUS beneficiaries switch to using Medicare at age 65. CHAMPUS is like Medicare in that the government contracts with private parties to administer the program. CHAMPUS was revamped as a managed care system and renamed TRICARE."
Chancre,"Chancre: The classic painless ulcer of syphilis. The chancre forms in the first (primary) stage of syphilis. It is highly contagious and can last 1-5 weeks. The disease can be transmitted from contact with the ulcer, which is teeming with spirochetes. If the ulcer is outside of the vagina or on the scrotum of the male, the use of condoms may not help in preventing transmission of the disease. Likewise, if the ulcer is in the mouth, merely kissing the infected individual can spread syphilis. The word chancre is the French for a little ulcer. Chancre and the English canker come from the Latin cancer for crab. Why? Perhaps because chronic ulcers can be hard like the shell of a crab."
Chapped lips,"Chapped lips: Dry, cracked or sore lips, usually in cold, windy, dry weather and less often in warm weather. Sun exposure can contribute to chapping of the lips. Licking or biting the lips is often a contributing factor. The lips are more sensitive to chapping than the skin. Unlike the skin, the lips do not produce oils to protect them against drying. To treat chapped lips, use a good lip emollient, ideally one containing a sunscreen. If you don't have a lip emollient use lipstick. And, if you don't have a lip emollient or lipstick around, rub your finger over the side of your nose and then wipe the oil on your lips. In winter and at elevated altitudes, drink lots of fluid. Some steps to prevent chapped lips are to: The word ""chapped"" meaning ""fissured or cracked"" dates to the 14th century. ""Chapped"" can also apply to the parched ground in summer and hands in winter."
Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome,Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome: Loss of dreaming after a stroke. In more technical terms the syndrome is characterized by visual agnosia and the inability to revisualise images. Named for the French founder of modern neurology Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) and the German neuro-ophthalmologist Hermann Wilbrand.
Chargaff rule,"Chargaff rule: The rule that in DNA there is always equality in quantity between the bases A and T and between the bases G and C. (A is adenine, T is thymine, G is guanine, and C is cytosine.) Named for the great Austrian-American biochemist Erwin Chargaff (1905-2002) at Columbia University who discovered this rule. Also known as Chargaff's ratios. Chargaff later said: ""This observation of complementarity, later called Chargaff's ratios, was essential to the solution of DNA's structure. In hindsight, the complementary pairing of the nucleotides powerfully suggested that a DNA molecule could break into two parts. Only complementary bases could form bonds and line up in place in a new DNA strand."""
Charley horse,"Charley horse: Slang for a cramp in a muscle in the leg, usually caused by a strain or injury. A charley horse can last anywhere from a few seconds to over a quarter of an hour. It is not uncommon for one to recur before it finally resolves."
Chasing the dragon,"Chasing the dragon: A practice of heroin use involving heating heroin and then inhaling it. Some heroin users have gone to this practice because they believe erroneously that it will protect them against contracting HIV and other diseases associated with injecting heroin. ""Chasing the dragon"" carries a risk of untreatable brain damage with death occurring in about 20% of cases. Abnormalities occur in the cerebellum, the area of the brain that controls coordination of movement. Some patients develop symptoms of a rare brain disorder, progressive spongiform leukoencephalopathy in which fluid-filled spaces cover the brain's white matter and there is loss of coordination, slowed movements and difficulty moving and talking."
CHD,"CHD: Congenital heart disease, a malformation of the heart or the large blood vessels near the heart. The term ""congenital"" speaks only to time, not to causation; it means ""born with"" or ""present at birth."" Congenital heart disease is the most frequent form of major birth defects in newborns affecting close to 1% of newborn babies (8 per 1,000). This figure is an underestimate since it does not include some common problems, namely: There are a great many types of congenital heart disease. Here is an outline of the major categories of congenital heart disease and some of the more prominent entities within those categories. Detour defects within the heart: Defects may cause blood to take an abnormal route through the heart, passing directly between the right and left sides of the heart. This occurs when there is a defect in the wall (the septum) that normally separates the right and left sides of the heart. There is ""a hole in the heart."" The two most common types of septal defect are: Less common types of CHD with altered routes of blood flow include: Detour defect outside the heart: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a special type of a blood routing problem located outside the heart. The ductus arteriosus is a prenatal shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that remains open (patent) after birth, letting blood that should flow through the aorta to the body return to the lungs. Obstructive defects: A number of types of CHD obstruct blood flow within the heart or the great vessels near it. They do so via a narrowing that partly or completely blocks the flow of blood. The narrowing (a stenosis) can occur in heart valves, arteries or veins. The three most common forms of CHD with obstructed blood flow are: Less common forms of CHD with obstructed blood flow include: Cyanotic defects (""blue babies""): Some types of CHD cause cyanosis (bluing). The blood pumped to the body has less-than-normal amounts of oxygen. This results in cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin. Types of cyanotic forms of CHD include: Hypoplastic heart defects: Part of the heart may selectively be underdeveloped or hypoplastic, as in: Other developmental heart defects: A number of other defects in heart development can occur, such as: Alternative names for congenital heart disease include: congenital heart defect, congenital heart malformation, congenital cardiovascular disease, congenital cardiovascular defect, and congenital cardiovascular malformation. For a more complete treatment of this topic, see the full-length article on Congenital Heart Disease."
Cheek,"Cheek: The side of the face, which forms the side wall of the mouth. The cheekbone is part of the temporal bone of the skull, and it provides the prominence of the cheek. The term cheek also refers to something that has the form of the human cheek, particularly with two laterally paired parts, such as a buttock."
Chemo,"Chemo: Slang for chemotherapy -- drug therapy for cancer. Most anticancer drugs are given IV (into a vein) or IM (into muscle). Some anticancer agents are taken orally (by mouth). Chemotherapy is usually systemic treatment, meaning that the drugs flow through the bloodstream to nearly every part of the body. Patients who need many rounds of IV chemotherapy may receive the drugs through a catheter (a thin flexible tube). One end of the catheter is placed in a large vein in the chest. The other end is outside the body or attached to a small device just under the skin. Anticancer drugs are given through the catheter. Chemotherapy is generally given in cycles: a treatment period is followed by a recovery period, then another treatment period, and so on. Usually a patient has chemotherapy as an outpatient at the hospital, at a doctor's office or clinic, or at home. However, depending on which drugs are given and the patient's general health, the patient may need to stay in the hospital for a short time. The side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drugs and the doses the patient receives. Most anticancer drugs affect cells that divide rapidly. These include blood cells, which fight infection, help the blood to clot, or carry oxygen to all parts of the body. When blood cells are affected by anticancer drugs, patients are more likely to develop infections, may bruise or bleed easily, and may have less energy. Cells that line the digestive tract also divide rapidly. As a result of chemotherapy, patients can have side effects, such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, or mouth sores. For some patients, medicines can be prescribed to help with side effects, especially with nausea and vomiting. These side effects tend to gradually go away during the recovery period or after treatment stops. Hair loss, another side effect of chemotherapy, is a major concern for many patients. Some chemotherapy drugs only cause the hair to thin out, while others may result in the loss of all body hair. Patients may feel better if they decide how to handle hair loss before starting treatment. In some men and women, chemotherapy drugs cause changes that may result in a loss of fertility (the ability to have children). Loss of fertility can be temporary or permanent depending on the drugs used and the patient's age. For men, sperm banking before treatment may be a choice. Women's menstrual periods may stop and they may have hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Periods are more likely to return in young women. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation and peripheral stem cell support are used to replace blood cell production when it has been destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy."
Chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy: 1. In the original sense, a chemical that binds to and specifically kills microbes or tumor cells. The term chemotherapy was coined in this regard by Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915).
2. In oncology, drug therapy for cancer. Also called ""chemo"" for short. Most cancer chemotherapeutic drugs are given IV (into a vein) or IM (into muscle). Some anticancer agents are taken orally (by mouth). Chemotherapy is usually systemic treatment, meaning that the drugs flow through the bloodstream to nearly every part of the body. Patients who need many rounds of IV chemotherapy may receive the drugs through a catheter (a thin flexible tube). One end of the catheter is placed in a large vein in the chest. The other end is outside the body or attached to a small device just under the skin. Anticancer drugs are given through the catheter.

Chest,"Chest: The area of the body located between the neck and the abdomen. The chest contains the lungs, the heart, and part of the aorta. The walls of the chest are supported by the dorsal vertebrae, the ribs, and the sternum. Also known as thorax."
Chest pain,"Chest pain: Pain in the chest that can be a result of many things, including angina, heart attack (coronary occlusion), and other important diseases. Chest pain is a warning to seek medical attention, so one should try not to ignore chest pain and 'work through it.'"
CHF,CHF: Congestive heart failure.
Chickenpox,"Chickenpox: A highly infectious viral disease also known medically as varicella -- in many countries, this disease is always called ""varicella"" -- that causes a blister-like rash, itching, fatigue and fever. The rash crops up first on the face and trunk and can spread over the entire body resulting in 250 to 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox is highly infectious. The virus spreads from person to person by direct contact or through the air by coughing or sneezing. It takes from 10-21 days after contact with an infected person for someone to develop chickenpox. People with chickenpox are contagious a day or two before the rash appears and until all blisters have formed scabs. In children, chickenpox most commonly causes an illness that lasts about 5-10 days. Children usually miss 5 or 6 days of school or childcare due to their chickenpox. Their symptoms may include high fever, severe itching, an uncomfortable rash, dehydration, and headache. About 1 child in 10 has a complication from chickenpox -- infected skin lesions, other infections, dehydration from vomiting or diarrhea, exacerbation (worsening) of asthma and pneumonia -- that is serious enough to warrant a visit to the doctor. Certain people are especially likely to have a serious illness from chickenpox. These at-risk groups include infants, adolescents, and adults and people with weak immune systems from either illnesses or from medications such long-term steroids or chemotherapy. Chickenpox has nothing at all to do with chicken. The name was meant to distinguish this ""weak"" form of the pox from smallpox. ""Chicken"" is used here, as in ""chickenhearted,"" to mean weak or timid. The ""pox"" of chickenpox is no major matter unless it becomes infected (through scratching) or occurs in an immunodeficient person. However, there can be very major problems from chickenpox including pneumonia and encephalitis and reactivation of the same herpes virus is responsible for shingles (zoster). Chickenpox is responsible for more deaths than measles (rubeola), mumps, whooping cough (pertussis) and H. flu (Haemophilus influenzae type B) meningitis combined. Contrary to what many people believe, chickenpox is by no means a mild disease. A healthy person can die from the disease. From 1990 to 1994, before there was a vaccine available, there were about 50 chickenpox deaths in children and 50 chickenpox deaths in adults every year in the US. Most of these persons were healthy or did not have a medical illness such as cancer that placed them at higher risk of getting severe chickenpox. Most of the healthy adults who die from chickenpox contract the disease from their unvaccinated children. The current aim in the US is to achieve universal (or come as close as possible to universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine. The rationale for childhood chickenpox vaccination is not just to protect the children but also to protect everyone with whom they come in contact, including adults (who can die from the chickenpox) and pregnant women (so that the unborn baby does not get chickenpox). Because chickenpox in children is usually not serious, some people think it is safe to let children get the disease. However, it is never possible to predict who will have a mild case of chickenpox and who will have a serious or even deadly case of disease. Now that there is a safe and effective vaccine available, it is not worth taking this risk. A person can get chickenpox more than once but it is uncommon to do so. For most people, one infection is thought to confer lifelong immunity."
Chikungunya virus,"Chikungunya virus: A virus that causes a disease resembling dengue fever, seen mainly in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. The Chikungunya virus is an arbovirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The most prominent frequent feature is severe arthritis with joint pain (arthralgia), and swelling. Chikungunya fever was first described in epidemic form in East Africa in 1952-1953. The virus is arthropod-borne (it is therefore an arbovirus) and belongs to the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. Human infections are acquired by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and epidemics are sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission. This epidemic cycle is similar to that of dengue and urban yellow fever. Illness from Chikungunya virus infection is characterized by sudden onset of signs and symptoms of: Symptoms begin 3-7 days after being bitten by the mosquito carrying the virus. In contrast to dengue, chikungunya is characterized by a shorter feverish episode, by persistent joint pain in some cases, and by the absence of fatalities. The Chikungunya virus is not contagious (it cannot be spread directly from person to person). Treatments are directed at relieving the symptoms, and there is no cure. Most people will feel better within a week, but some may have joint pain that lasts for months. There is no vaccine to prevent Chikungunya virus infection. Chikungunya in Swahili means ""that which bends up"" referring to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain of this disease. Pronounced chik-n-gunya with the accent on the first syllable."
Child health,"Child health: The care and treatment of children. Child health is the purview of pediatrics, which became a medical specialty in the mid-nineteenth century. Before that time the care and treatment of childhood diseases were included within such areas as general medicine, obstetrics, and midwifery."
Childbed fever,"Childbed fever: Fever due to an infection after childbirth, usually of the placental site within the uterus. If the infection involves the bloodstream, it constitutes puerperal sepsis. Childbed fever was once a common cause of death for women of childbearing age, but it is now comparatively rare in the developed world due to improved sanitary practices in midwifery and obstetrics. Also known as childbirth fever and puerperal fever."
Childhood,"Childhood: (1) The time for a boy or girl from birth until he or she is an adult. (2) The more circumscribed period of time from infancy to the onset of puberty. During childhood, the potential of a unique human person must be nurtured by parents or parent figures."
Chills,Chills: feelings of coldness accompanied by shivering. Chills may develop after exposure to a cold environment or may accompany a fever.
Chimera,"Chimera: In medicine, a person composed of two genetically distinct types of cells. Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be ""blood chimeras"" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the uterus. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a twin that died early in gestation. Twin embryos often share a blood supply in the placenta, allowing blood stem cells to pass from one and settle in the bone marrow of the other. About 8% of non-identical twin pairs are chimeras. Many more people are microchimeras and carry smaller numbers of foreign blood cells that may have passed from mother across the placenta, or persist from a blood transfusion. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is also contributing to the number of human chimeras. To improve success rates, two or more embryos are placed in the uterus so women who have IVF have more twin pregnancies than usual. More twins mean more chimeras. In Greek mythology, the Chimera was an awesome fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. The Chimera was killed by the hero Bellerophon mounted, in most versions of the tale, on Pegasus, the winged horse."
Chin,"Chin: Medically, the mentum. The lower portion of the face below the lower lip including the prominence of the lower jaw and the line of fusion of the two separate halves of the jawbone (mandible). This line of fusion (called the symphysis menti) encloses a triangular area at tip of the chin (termed the mental protuberance). On each side, below the second premolar tooth, is the mental foramen, an opening for the passage of blood vessels and a nerve that supply the chin."
Chinese restaurant syndrome,"Chinese restaurant syndrome: A syndrome first described in 1968 in people who had eaten Chinese food on which MSG (monosodium glutamate) had been lavished. The syndrome only seems to occur in some people. Their symptoms may include headache, throbbing of the head, dizziness, lightheadedness, a feeling of facial pressure, tightness of the jaw, burning or tingling sensations over parts of the body, chest pain, and back pain. Large amounts of MSG may cause arterial dilatation (widening of arteries). Many Chinese do not believe in the existence of the Chinese restaurant syndrome. It may be a hypersensitive (allergic) reaction."
Chiropractic,"Chiropractic: A system of diagnosis and treatment based on the concept that the nervous system coordinates all of the body's functions, and that disease results from a lack of normal nerve function. Chiropractic employs manipulation and adjustment of body structures, such as the spinal column, so that pressure on nerves coming from the spinal cord due to displacement (subluxation) of a vertebral body may be relieved. Practitioners believe that misalignment and nerve pressure can cause problems not only in the local area, but also at some distance from it. Chiropractic treatment appears to be effective for muscle spasms of the back and neck, tension headaches, and some sorts of leg pain. It may or may not be useful for other ailments. Modern chiropractic was founded by Daniel David Palmer, a grocer, who performed his first chiropractic adjustment in 1895. The term ""chiropractic"" derived from the Greek ""chir-"" referring to the hand + ""prassein"", to do = to do with the hands (to manipulate) dates to 1898, the year Palmer founded the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. Not all chiropractors are alike in their practice. The International Chiropractors Association believes that patients should be treated by spinal manipulation alone while the American Chiropractors Association advocate a multidisciplinary approach that combines spinal adjustment with other modalities such as physical therapy, psychological counseling, and dietary measures. For some years the American Medical Association (AMA) opposed chiropractic because of what it termed a ""rigid adherence to an irrational, unscientific approach to disease."" However, Congress amended the Medicare Act in 1972 to include benefits for chiropractic services and in 1978 the AMA modified its position on chiropractic. To become a doctor of chiropractic (D.C.) requires minimally 2 years of college and 4 years in a school of chiropractic."
Chiropractor,"Chiropractor: A chiropractic practitioner. Becoming a doctor of chiropractic (DC) requires a minimum of 2 years of college and 4 years in a school of chiropractic medicine. Some chiropractors also earn a traditional medical degree (MD) or other additional qualifications. Not all chiropractors are alike in their practice. The International Chiropractors Association believes that patients should be treated by spinal manipulation alone, whereas the American Chiropractic Association advocates a multidisciplinary approach that combines spinal adjustment with other modalities, such as physical therapy, psychological counseling, and dietary measures."
Chlamydia trachomatis,"Chlamydia trachomatis: A bacterium that causes a disease called trachoma that results in blindness so frequently that it places a huge burden a year on world health funding ($25 billion in the year 2000). The disease goes by a number of names such as sandy blight. The transmission of Chlamydia trachomatis is mainly among children and from children to women during child care. Key risk factors include low socioeconomic status and inadequate supplies of water. Trachoma affects approximately 500 million people worldwide, primarily in rural communities of the developing world and in the arid areas of tropical and subtropical zones. About 6-9 million people worldwide are currently blind and many more have suffered partial loss of vision from trachoma. Australia is the only developed country where trachoma is still a significant health problem; there it affects an estimated 100,000 people. The mass treatment of trachoma with tetracycline ointment is effective in the short term, but the disease usually returns within 6-12 months to pretreatment levels in a community. Trachoma can now also be treated with the antibiotic azithromycin (brand name: Zithromax). Promotion of increased face-washing helps further to control the disease. Surgery of the scarred eyelids can prevent continued damage to the cornea by turned-in lashes."
Chloral hydrate,"Chloral hydrate: A prescription sedative/hypnotic drug developed in the 19th century. The drug acts rapidly and induces sleep within 60 minutes, and is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Chloral hydrate can be taken orally in syrup or capsule form and is also available in the form of rectal suppositories. The medical use of chloral hydrate has declined over the years due to the development of the barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Brand names for chloral hydrate include Noctec and Aquachloral. Chloral hydrate has often been abused and misused since its development in 1832. A solution of chloral hydrate in alcohol is the ingredient in the infamous ""knockout drops"", otherwise known as a ""Mickey Finn."""
Chloride,Chloride: The major anion (negatively charged substance) in the blood and extracellular fluid (the body fluid that lies outside cells). Blood and other body fluids have almost the same concentration of chloride ion as sea water. The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious and even fatal consequences: The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.
orm,"Chloroform: A clear, volatile liquid with a strong smell similar to that of ether. Chloroform was once administered by inhalation to produce anesthesia, given to relieve pain, and used as a remedy for cough. It is quite toxic to the kidneys and the liver."
Cholangi-,Cholangi-: Relating to a bile duct. From the Greek chole meaning bile + a(n)geion meaning a vessel = a bile vessel.
Cholecalciferol,Cholecalciferol: Vitamin D3.
Cholecyst,"Cholecyst: The gallbladder. The word cholecyst is not much used today but it figures into a number of other terms to do with the gallbladder Cholecystectomy is removal of the gallbladder. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. Cholecystogram is an x-ray of the gallbladder. Cholecyst, literally, means, bilebladder. It comes from chol, referring to bile + cyst, a bladder."
Cholecystitis,"Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder. Cholecystitis is a complication of gallstones, and it is frequently associated with infection in the gallbladder. Risk factors for cholecystitis include age, obesity, female gender, multiple pregnancies, use of birth control pills, and heredity. The most common symptom is pain in the upper abdomen, although some patients have no symptoms. Diagnosis can be made with ultrasound of the abdomen. Surgery (standard or laparoscopic) is considered for patients with severe cholecystitis. In some mild cases, medication may be used instead to treat
the infection and inflammation and to dissolve the gallstones."
Cholecystokinin,Cholecystokinin: Abbreviated CCK. A polypeptide hormone that stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder with release of bile and the secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the small intestine. CCK is secreted by cells lining the upper intestine and by the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic cholecystokinin is a neurotransmitter. Called also pancreozymin.
Cholelithiasis,"Cholelithiasis: 1. The presence of stones in the gallbladder. 2. The process of formation of such stones. From the Greek roots chole, bile + lithos, stone."
Cholera,"Cholera: An infectious disease characterized by intense vomiting and profuse watery diarrhea and that rapidly leads to dehydration and often death. Cholera is caused by infection with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, which may be transmitted via infected fecal matter, food, or water. With modern sanitation, cholera is no longer as common as it once was, but epidemics still occur whenever people must live in crowded and unsanitary conditions, such as in refugee camps. The disease is treated with intravenous fluids and with antibiotics. Cholera has also been known as Asian cholera, due to its one-time prevalence in that area of the world."
Cholestasis,"Cholestasis: a decrease or blockage in the flow of bile. Bile is a fluid produced by the liver that travels through ducts to enter the digestive system in the small intestine. Diseases of the liver, pancreas, or of the bile ducts themselves can all cause cholestasis. Symptoms of cholestasis include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow), dark urine, itching, and light-colored stool."
Cholesterol,"Cholesterol: The most common type of steroid in the body. Cholesterol has a reputation for being associated with an increased risk for heart and blood vessel disease. However, cholesterol is essential to the formation of bile acids, vitamin D, progesterone, estrogens (estradiol, estrone, estriol), androgens (androsterone, testosterone), mineralocorticoid hormones (aldosterone, corticosterone), and glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol). Cholesterol is also necessary to the normal permeability and function of the membranes that surround cells. A diet high in saturated fats tends to increase blood cholesterol levels, whereas a diet high in unsaturated fats tends to lower blood cholesterol levels. Although some cholesterol is obtained from the diet, most cholesterol is made in the liver and other tissues. The treatment of elevated cholesterol involves not only diet but also weight loss, regular exercise, and medications."
Chondroitin sulfate,"Chondroitin sulfate: A glycosaminoglycan (formerly called a mucopolysaccharide) found in cartilage, bone, blood vessels and connective tissues. There are two forms: chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate C. One or both types accumulate abnormally in several of the mucopolysaccharidosis disorders. Chondroitin sulfate B is now called dermatan sulfate."
Chordae tendineae,"Chordae tendineae: Thread-like bands of fibrous tissue which attach on one end to the edges of the tricuspid and mitral valves of the heart and on the other end to the papillary muscles, small muscles within the heart that serve to anchor the valves."
Chorea,"Chorea: Ceaseless rapid complex body movements that look well coordinated and purposeful but are, in fact, involuntary. Chorea was thought suggestive of a grotesque dance. The term ""chorea"" is derived from the Greek word ""choreia"" for dancing (as is choreography)."
Choriocarcinoma,"Choriocarcinoma: A highly malignant tumor that arises from trophoblastic cells within the uterus. Choriocarcinoma tends to be invasive and to metastasize early and widely through both the venous and lymphatic systems. Choriocarcinoma is one of the two types of gestational trophoblastic tumor, the other being hydatidiform mole. Choriocarcinoma may follow any type of pregnancy. It is especially likely to occur with a hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy). About 2 to 3% of hydatidiform moles are complicated by the development of choriocarcinoma. The prognosis for women with metastatic choriocarcinoma was once grim. It has markedly improved with the advent of multidrug chemotherapy. Patients with high-risk metastatic disease usually need aggressive multidrug chemotherapy. Women with low-risk metastatic disease are sometimes treated with a single drug. Overall, the cure rate for high-risk patients is 60 to 80%."
Chromosome,"Chromosome: A carrier of genetic information that is visible under an ordinary light microscope. Each human chromosome has two arms, the p (short) arm and the q (long) arm. These arms are separated from each other only by the centromere, which is the point at which the chromosome is attached to the spindle during cell division. The 3 billion base pairs in the human genome are organized into 24 chromosomes. All genes are arranged linearly along the chromosomes. Generally the nucleus of a human cell contains two sets of chromosomes'one set given by each parent. Each set has 23 single chromosomes: 22 autosomes and an X or a Y sex chromosome. (A normal female has a pair of X chromosomes; a male has an X and Y pair.) A chromosome contains roughly equal parts of protein and DNA. The chromosomal DNA contains an average of 150 million nucleotide building blocks, called bases. DNA molecules are among the largest molecules now known."
Chromosome complement,"Chromosome complement: The whole set of chromosomes for a species. In humans, the normal chromosome complement consists of 46 chromosomes, including the 2 sex chromosomes. Also known as the karyotype."
Chromosome duplication,"Chromosome duplication: Part of a chromosome in duplicate. A particular kind of mutation involving the production of one or more copies of any piece of DNA, including sometimes a gene or even an entire chromosome. A duplication is the opposite of a deletion. Duplications have been important in the evolution of the human genome (and the genomes of many other organisms). Duplications typically arise from an event termed unequal crossing-over (recombination) that occurs between misaligned homologous chromosomes during meiosis (germ cell formation). The chance of this event happening is a function of the degree of sharing of repetitive elements between two chromosomes. The recombination products of such an event are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion. A remarkable class of duplications in which the duplicated region has popped up far away from home base has also been discovered."
Chronic,"Chronic: In medicine, lasting a long time. A chronic condition is one that lasts 3 months or more. Chronic diseases are in contrast to those that are acute (abrupt, sharp, and brief) or subacute (within the interval between acute and chronic)."
Chronic bronchitis,"Chronic bronchitis: Inflammation and swelling of the lining of the airways, leading to narrowing and obstruction generally resulting in daily cough. The inflammation stimulates production of mucus, which can cause further blockage of the airways. Obstruction of the airways, especially with mucus, increases the likelihood of bacterial lung infection. Chronic bronchitis is common in persons who have smoked for extended periods."
Chronic disease,"Chronic disease: A disease that persists for a long time. A chronic disease is one lasting 3 months or more, by the definition of the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Chronic diseases generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication, nor do they just disappear. Eighty-eight percent of Americans over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition (as of 1998). Health damaging behaviors - particularly tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and poor eating habits - are major contributors to the leading chronic diseases. Chronic diseases tend to become more common with age. The leading chronic diseases in developed countries include (in alphabetical order) arthritis, cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and stroke, cancer such as breast and colon cancer, diabetes, epilepsy and seizures, obesity, and oral health problems. Each of these conditions plague older adults in the US (and other developed nations). Arthritis and related conditions are the leading cause of disability in the US affecting nearly 43 million Americans. Although cost-effective interventions are available to reduce the burden of arthritis, they are underused. Regular, moderate exercise offers a host of benefits to people with arthritis by reducing joint pain and stiffness, building strong muscle around the joints, and increasing flexibility and endurance. Cardiovascular disease is a growing concern in the US. Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death. Three health-related behaviors--tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and poor nutrition--contribute markedly to heart disease. Modifying these behaviors is critical for both preventing and controlling heart disease. Modest changes in one or more of these risk factors among the population could have a profound public health impact. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US. Cancer is largely controllable through prevention, early detection, and treatment. Reducing the nation's cancer burden requires reducing the prevalence of the behavioral and environmental factors that increase cancer risk. It also requires ensuring that cancer screening services and high-quality treatment are available and accessible, particularly to medically underserved populations. Diabetes is a serious, costly, and increasingly common chronic disease. Early detection, improved delivery of care, and better self-management are the key strategies for preventing much of the burden of diabetes. Seven million persons aged 65 years or older (20.1% of all people in this age group) have diabetes, most of them type 2 diabetes. Epilepsy and seizures affect about 2.3 million Americans, and result in an estimated $12.5 billion in medical costs and lost or reduced earnings and production annually in the US. People of all ages are affected, but particularly the very young and the elderly. About 10% of Americans will experience a seizure, and about 3% will have or will have had a diagnosis of epilepsy by age 80. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions among Americans in all age groups. Obesity among adults has doubled since 1980. People who are obese or overweight are at increased risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis-related disabilities, and some cancers. Oral health problems are an important and often overlooked component of an older adult's general health and well-being. Oral health problems can cause pain and suffering as well as difficulty in speaking, chewing, swallowing, and maintaining a nutritious diet."
Chronic glomerulonephritis,"Chronic glomerulonephritis: One of a group of kidney diseases characterized by long-term inflammation and scarring of the glomeruli (microscopic structures in the kidney that filter blood and produce urine). This form of kidney disease usually develops slowly (over years) and may not produce symptoms at the outset. When symptoms and signs do appear, they typically include blood in the urine (hematuria), swelling (edema), high blood pressure, foamy urine (due to protein content), and frequent nighttime urination. A number of different medical conditions can cause chronic glomerulonephritis. Hereditary conditions may be responsible, or immune diseases may be the cause. In many cases, the exact cause is not apparent. Chronic glomerulonephritis may progress to kidney failure in some cases. Hypertension and diabetes are two conditions that typically result in scarring of the glomeruli and decline in kidney function. There is no specific treatment available. People with chronic glomerulonephritis may be advised to reduce consumption of protein, potassium, and salt; keep high blood pressure under control; and to take calcium supplements. Diuretic medications may be needed to treat swelling."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: COPD. Any disorder that persistently obstructs bronchial airflow. COPD mainly involves two related diseases -- chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Both cause chronic obstruction of air flowing through the airways and in and out of the lungs. The obstruction is generally permanent and progresses (becomes worse) over time. Asthma is also a pulmonary disease in which there is obstruction to the flow of air out of the lungs, but the obstruction is usually reversible and between attacks of asthma the flow of air through the airways is usually good. COPD is also called chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)."
Chronic renal failure,"Chronic renal failure: Now more commonly classified as chronic kidney disease and is listed as stages based on the patient's level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which is a measure of filtering capacity of the kidneys. Stage 1 means normal filtering function of the kidney but delineates those patients that are at risk of progressive renal disease, such as those with proteinuria or hematuria. Stage 2 is used for patients with a GFR of 60 to 90 mL per minute. Stage 3 is used for patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 60 mL per minute. Stage 4 is for patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 30 mL per minute. Stage 5 is for patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL per minute but who are not on dialysis. Stage 6 is for patients who have a glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL per minute and require dialysis intervention for their renal failure. Chronic kidney failure or chronic renal failure signifies loss of kidney function that occurs over a prolonged course of time as opposed to acute renal failure. The loss of renal function may be due to previous episodes of acute renal failure with subsequent long term kidney damage or may be due to diseases which cause progressive deterioration of the kidney such as primary kidney diseases (glomerulonephritis) or secondary disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, or auto-immune disorders. The loss of kidney function may be progressive but with therapy of the underlying cause the damage can be halted and in some cases the kidney function may actually improve. Unfortunately, many patients with chronic kidney disease, especially if they reach Stage 4 or Stage 5 will progress to point of end stage renal disease (ESRD) which is the point of needing dialysis or renal transplant. If the patient is started on dialysis, this is synonymous with chronic kidney disease Stage 6. Much work is being done to try to help halt or slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. The ability to diagnose early chronic kidney disease is very helpful in being able to prevent the progression of the patient's kidney deterioration. Slow progressive loss of kidney function over the span of years resulting in permanent kidney failure. Chronic kidney disease is common and may go undiagnosed until the process is far advanced and renal failure is on the horizon. People with permanent kidney failure need dialysis or a transplanted kidney to do the work of their failed kidneys. Chronic renal failure is in contrast to acute renal failure. It may also be referred to as chronic kidney failure."
Chronicity,"Chronicity: The state of being chronic, having a long duration."
Chyle,Chyle: A fluid consisting of a mixture of lymphatic fluid (lymph) and chylomicrons that has a milky appearance. Chylomicrons are small fat globules composed of protein and lipid (fat) which are combined in the lining of the intestine. Chylomicrons are found in the blood and in lymphatic fluid where they serve to transport fat from its port of entry in the intestine to the liver and to adipose (fat) tissue.
Chylomicron,"Chylomicron: A small fat globule composed of protein and lipid (fat). Chylomicrons are found in the blood and lymphatic fluid where they serve to transport fat from its port of entry in the intestine to the liver and to adipose (fat) tissue. After a fatty meal, the blood is so full of chylomicrons that it looks milky. The word ""chylomicron"" is made up of ""chylo-"", milky + ""micron"", small. = small milky (globules). The chylomicrons are synthesized (made) in the mucosa (the lining) of the intestine."
Ci (Curie),"Ci (Curie): Ci is the abbreviation for a Curie, a unit of radioactivity. (Specifically, the quantity of any radioactive nuclide in which the number of disintegrations per second is 3.7 X 10 to the 10th). Named for Marie and Pierre Curie who did pioneering research in radioactivity, distinguished alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, discovered polonium and radium, and isolated pure radium. They shared the Nobel Prizes in Physics (with A.H. Becquerel) in 1903 and, after Pierre's death, Marie received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911."
CIC,CIC: Completely-in-the-canal (the ear canal). See: Completely-in-the-canal hearing aid. See also: Hearing aid.
cidal,"cidal: Suffix indicating killing, as in bacteriocidal (capable of killing bacteria) and in suicidal (the killing of oneself)."
cide,"Cide: Suffix indicating killing or killer, as in bactericide (a solution capable of killing bacteria)."
Cigarette,"Cigarette: A small roll of finely cut tobacco enclosed in a wrapper of thin paper designed for smoking. ""Cigarettes are the only product sold on the free market that, when used as directed, can kill people."" (L Chasan-Taber & M Stampfer, New Engl J Med 2001;345:1841-2) The word ""cigarette"" is the French diminutive of ""cigare"" (cigar), from the Spanish ""cigarro."""
Ciguatoxin,"Ciguatoxin: A seafood toxin that is acquired by eating fish that have consumed toxic single-celled marine organisms called dinoflagellates or fish that have consumed other fish that have become toxic. When someone eats these fish, they suffer seafood poisoning. Food poisoning from ciguatoxin is called ciguatera. Ciguatera can cause gastrointestinal, neuromuscular symptoms and respiratory problems. The gastrointestinal problems include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The neuromuscular problems may include tingling around the lips, abnormal or impaired skin sensations, hot-to-cold reversal, vertigo, lack of muscle coordination, weakness and numbness, muscle pain, and itching. There may be respiratory paralysis. Ciguatera symptom strike shortly after eating tainted fish. Symptoms may recur up to 6 months. Death is uncommon, but is known. Fish with ciguatoxin come from the southeastern United States, Bahamian, and Caribbean regions, Hawaii, and subtropical and tropical areas worldwide including the central Pacific and northern Australia. Barracuda, amberjack, horse-eye jack, black jack, other large species of jack, king mackerel, large groupers, and snappers are particularly likely to contain ciguatoxin. Many other species of large fish-eating fish may also contain ciguatoxin."
Cilia,"Cilia: The fine hairlike projections from certain cells such as those in the respiratory tract that sweep in unison and help to sweep away fluids and particles. Some single-celled organisms use the rhythmical motion of cilia for locomotion. Cilia is the plural of cilium, a Latin word referring to the edge of the eyelid and, much later, to the eyelashes. Cilia came to be known fine hairlike projections from cells."
Ciliary muscle,Ciliary muscle: A circular muscle that relaxes or tightens the zonules to enable the lens to change shape for focusing. The zonules are fibers that hold the lens suspended in position and enable it to change shape during accommodation.
Ciliary neuralgia,"Ciliary neuralgia: A distinctive syndrome of headaches, better known today as cluster headache. There are two main clinical patterns of cluster headache -- the episodic and the chronic: The episodic and acute forms of cluster headache may transform into one another, so it seems most likely that they are merely different-appearing clinical patterns of one and the same disease. Although the mechanisms underlying cluster headache and migraine may have a degree of commonality, cluster headache looks to be different and distinct as a disease from migraine. For example, propranolol is effective for migraine but not cluster headache while lithium benefits cluster headache syndrome but not migraine. Cluster headache has also gone by a bevy of other confusing names including erythroprosopalgia, histamine cephalalgia, migrainous neuralgia, Raeder's syndrome, sphenopalatine neuralgia, and vidian neuralgia."
Cinacalcet,"Cinacalcet: A drug that acts as a calcimimetic and that is marketed under the trade name Sensipar. For more information, see: Calcimimetic."
Circulation,"Circulation: In medicine, the movement of fluid through the body in a regular or circuitous course. The circulatory system, composed of the heart and blood vessels, functions to produce circulation. Heart failure is an example of a problem with circulation."
Circulatory,"Circulatory: Having to do with circulation, the movement of fluid in a regular or circuitous course."
Circulatory system,"Circulatory system: The system that moves blood throughout the body. The circulatory system is composed of the heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins. This remarkable system transports oxygenated blood from the lungs and heart throughout the body via the arteries. The blood goes through the capillaries which are situated between the arteries and veins. And the blood that has been depleted of oxygen by the body is then returned to the lungs and heart via the veins."
Circum-,"Circum-: Prefix meaning around, surrounding, or encircling. As in circumcision, circumflex, and circumjacent. From the Latin preposition circum meaning round."
Circumcision,"Circumcision: Surgery that removes the foreskin (the loose tissue) covering the glans of the penis. Circumcision may be performed for religious, cultural reasons or health reasons. Newborn circumcision diminishes the risk for cancer of the penis and lowers the risk for cancer of the cervix in sexual partners. It also decreases the risk of urinary tract infections and lowers the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV. The Latin ""circum-"" means around (or about). Circumcision is, literally, a cutting around. Circumcision dates back to prehistoric times. It is one of the oldest surgical operations known to have been performed by ancient people."
Circumflex,"Circumflex: Curved like a bow. In anatomy, circumflex describes a structure that bends around like a bow. For example, the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. In linguistics, a circumflex is a caret-shaped mark (^) used over a vowel to indicate the pronunciation, length or the omission of a letter formerly pronounced. In French, it is called ""un petit chapeau"" (a little hat). From the Latin circumflexus, bent around, circumflex, past participle of circumflectere, to bend around : circum- + flectere, to bend."
Cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis: Liver disease characterized by irreversible scarring. Alcohol and viral hepatitis, including both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, are among the many causes of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can cause yellowing of the skin (jaundice), itching, and fatigue. Diagnosis is suggested by physical examination and blood tests, and it can be confirmed by liver biopsy. Complications of cirrhosis include mental confusion, coma, fluid accumulation (ascites), internal bleeding, and kidney failure. Treatment is designed to limit any further damage to the liver and to prevent complications. Liver transplantation is becoming an important option for patients with advanced cirrhosis."
Cisplatin,"Cisplatin: An anticancer drug that belongs to the family of drugs called platinum compounds. Cisplatin is used in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies, including advanced cancer of the ovary, testis, and bladder. Cisplatin is given intravenously. Its full chemical name is cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum."
Cl (chloride),"Cl (chloride): Cl is the chemical symbol for chloride, the major anion found in the fluid outside of cells and in blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid. The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences: The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L."
CLA,"CLA: 1. Conjugated linoleic acid.
2. Cervical lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes in the neck).
3. Congenital lactic acidosis.
4. Caseous lymphadenitis (cheeselike lymph nodes, usually due to TB)."
invasion,"Clark level of invasion: A method for determining the prognosis (outlook) with melanoma. The method was devised by the pathologist Wallace Clark and measures the depth of penetration of a melanoma into the skin according to anatomic layer. There are five Clark levels of invasion: Another melanoma measurement system, that of Breslow thickness, named after its originator Alexander Breslow, is in wider use today. In it, invasive tumor thickness is used to predict 5-year survival. For example, a thickness of the melanoma of less than 1.0 millimeters is associated with a 5-year survival of 97% of patients whereas a tumor thickness of more than 8.0 millimeters is associated with 5-year survival of 32%."
Claudication,"Claudication: Limping. From the Latin claudicare, which means 'to limp.' The Roman emperor Claudius was so named because he limped, probably because of a birth defect."
Claustrophobia,"Claustrophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of closed spaces, of being closed in or being shut in, as in elevators, tunnels, or any other confined space. The fear is excessive (and quite common). The word ""claustrophobia"" is an amalgam made from the Latin ""claudere"", to shut + the Greek ""phobis"", fear."
Climacteric,"Climacteric: 1. The menopause in women.
2. The corresponding time in the life of men.
From the Greek klimakter, meaning literally a rung of a ladder or figuratively a critical point."
Clinical,"Clinical: 1. Having to do with the examination and treatment of patients. 2. Applicable to patients. For example, a laboratory test may be of clinical value. The term comes through the French ""clinique"" from the Greek ""kline"" (a couch or bed)."
Clinical disease,"Clinical disease: A disease that has recognizable clinical signs and symptoms, as distinct from a subclinical illness, which lacks detectable signs and symptoms. Diabetes, for example, can be a subclinical disease for some years before becoming a clinical disease."
Clinical trial,"Clinical trial: A study that is intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medications or medical devices by monitoring their effects on large groups of people. Studies may be conducted by government health agencies (such as the National Institutes of Health [NIH]), researchers affiliated with hospital or university medical programs, independent researchers, or individuals from private industry. Usually volunteers are recruited, although in some cases research participants may be paid. For some patients, clinical research trials represent an avenue for receiving promising new therapies that would not otherwise be available. Patients with difficult-to-treat or 'incurable' diseases may pursue participation in clinical research trials if standard therapies are not effective."
Clinical trials,"Clinical trials: Trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications or medical devices by monitoring their effects on large groups of people. Clinical research trials may be conducted by government health agencies such as NIH, researchers affiliated with a hospital or university medical program, independent researchers, or private industry. Usually volunteers are recruited, although in some cases research subjects may be paid. Subjects are generally divided into two or more groups, including a control group that does not receive the experimental treatment, receives a placebo (inactive substance) instead, or receives a tried-and-true therapy for comparison purposes. Typically, government agencies approve or disapprove new treatments based on clinical trial results. While important and highly effective in preventing obviously harmful treatments from coming to market, clinical research trials are not always perfect in discovering all side effects, particularly effects associated with long-term use and interactions between experimental drugs and other medications. For some patients, clinical research trials represent an avenue for receiving promising new therapies that would not otherwise be available. Patients with difficult to treat or currently ""incurable"" diseases, such as AIDS or certain types of cancer, may want to pursue participation in clinical research trials if standard therapies are not effective. Clinical research trials are sometimes lifesaving. There are four possible outcomes from a clinical trial:"
Clinophobia,"Clinophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of going to bed. Sufferers from clinophobia experience anxiety even though they realize that going to bed normally should not threaten their well-being. However, because they worry about having nightmares or wetting the bed, they often remain awake and develop insomnia. Insomnia then can become a real threat to their well-being. ""Clinophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""klinein"" (to bend, slope or incline, as one does during sleep) and ""phobos"" (fear). Another medical term containing ""clino-""is ""clinodactyly"" meaning a finger that is curved to the side."
CLIP,"Clip: A device used to hold something or things together. For example, a surgical clip may be used to prevent a blood vessel from bleeding into the brain, or in a vasectomy to pinch together the sides of the vas deferens."
Clitoral,"Clitoral: Pertaining to the clitoris, the small elongated erectile body in the female homologous with the penis in the male."
Clitorectomy,Clitorectomy: A surgical procedure in which all or part of the clitoris and sometimes also the labia are removed. Clitorectomy is a form of female circumcision (female genital mutilation). Also called clitoridectomy or clitoral amputation.
Clitoris,"Clitoris: A small mass of erectile tissue in the female that is situated at the anterior apex of the vulva, near the meeting of the labia majora (vulvar lips). Like the penis, the clitoris is highly sensitive to stimulation during sex. The clitoris corresponds to the penis in the male."
Clostridium,"Clostridium: A group of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive in the absence of oxygen). There are 100+ species of Clostridium. They include, for examples, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens (also called Clostridium welchii), and Clostridium botulinum. Clostridium difficile is one of the most common causes of infection of the large bowel (the colon) in the US affecting millions of people yearly. Patients taking antibiotics are at risk of becoming infected with C. difficile. Antibiotics disrupt the normal bacteria of the bowel, allowing C. difficile bacteria to become established in the colon. Many persons infected with C.difficile have no symptoms. These people become carriers of the bacteria and can infect others. In other people, a toxin produced by C. difficile causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, severe inflammation of the colon (colitis), fever, an elevated white blood count, vomiting and dehydration. In severely affected patients, the inner lining of the colon becomes severely inflamed (a condition called pseudomembranous colitis). Rarely, the walls of the colon wear away and holes develop (colon perforation), which can lead to a life-threatening infection of the abdomen. Clostridium perfringens, also known as Clostridium welchii), this is the most common agent of gas gangrene and also causes food poisoning as well as a fulminant form of bowel disease called necrotizing colitis. Clostridium botulinum is the culprit responsible for the food poisoning and other problems associated with botulism."
Clostridium difficile,"Clostridium difficile: A bacterium that is one of the most common causes of infection of the colon in the US. Patients taking antibiotics are at risk of becoming infected with C. difficile as antibiotics can disrupt the normal bacteria of the bowel, allowing C. difficile to become established in the colon. In some people, a toxin produced by C. difficile causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, severe inflammation of the colon (colitis), fever, an elevated white blood cell count, vomiting, and dehydration. In severely affected patients, the inner lining of the colon becomes severely inflamed (pseudomembranous colitis) with the potential to perforate."
Cluster,"Cluster: In epidemiology, an aggregation of cases of a disease or another health-related condition, such as a cancer or birth defect, closely grouped in time and place. The number of cases in the cluster may or may not exceed the expected number. This is determined by cluster analysis, a set of statistical methods used to analyze clusters."
cm (centimeter),"cm (centimeter): A unit of measure in the metric system which is 1/100'th of a meter. There are 2.54 centimeters (cms) in one inch. The centimeter is commonly used in medicine to state the size of objects or distance between points. It may seem senseless to define a centimeter in a medical dictionary but in North American medicine (and medicine everywhere) today, length measurements are usually expressed in such metric units and not in inches or feet."
CNS (central nervous system),"CNS (central nervous system): That part of the nervous system that consists of the brain and spinal cord. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the two major divisions of the nervous system. The other is the peripheral nervous system (PNS), that part of the nervous system that lies outside the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear), other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels and glands. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and what are called the autonomic nerves that are concerned specifically with the regulation of the heart muscle, the muscles in blood vessel walls, and glands."
Coagulation,"Coagulation: In medicine, the clotting of blood. The process by which the blood clots to form solid masses, or clots. More than 30 types of cells and substances in blood affect clotting. The process is initiated by blood platelets. Platelets produce a substance that combines with calcium ions in the blood to form thromboplastin, which in turn converts the protein prothrombin into thrombin in a complex series of reactions. Thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme, converts fibrinogen, a protein substance, into fibrin, an insoluble protein that forms an intricate network of minute threadlike structures called fibrils and causes the blood plasma to gel. The blood cells and plasma are enmeshed in the network of fibrils to form the clot. Tissue can also be subjected to coagulation by various means, as by electrocoagulation, laser coagulation, or photocoagulation."
Cobalamin,"Cobalamin: Also called vitamin B12. A vitamin important for the normal formation of red blood cells and for the health of the nerve tissues. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia and permanent nerve and brain damage. Pernicious anemia is a blood disorder caused by inadequate vitamin B12 in the blood. Patients who have this disorder do not produce the protein substance in the stomach that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12. This substance is called intrinsic factor (IF). Pernicious anemia is simply treated with injections of vitamin B12. The vitamin B12 has to be administered by injection because people with PA do not have IF (or an effective form of IF) and so cannot absorb vitamin B12 taken by mouth. Pernicious anemia has also been called Addison's anemia, addisonian anemia, Biermer's anemia. Patients with Crohn's disease involving the small intestine (Crohn's ileitis) or who have undergone small intestine resection may not be able to absorb vitamin B12. Strict vegetarians who consume no animal products can develop B12 deficiency since there is a lack of B12 in vegetables. The recommended daily allowances of vitamin B12 in the United States are 2mcg for infants, 3 mcg for children under 4 years old, 6mcg for children over 4 years old and adults, and 8 mcg for pregnant women. It is recommended for adults to take one multivitamin daily. One multivitamin a day is safe and inexpensive. The multivitamin should contain 400 micrograms of folic acid, approximately 2-3 mg of vitamin B6, 6-9 micrograms of vitamin of B12, and 400 IU of vitamin D. The folic acid and the other B vitamins can help lower homocysteine. The vitamin D is one of the important factors in preventing osteoporosis. High blood homocysteine levels have been found to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and heart disease. Most doctors will treat homocysteine levels higher than 9-10umol/liter. A doctor experienced in treating coronary heart disease should supervise the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia. Treatment involves high doses of the B vitamins (1-5 mg/day of folic acid, 10mg/day of B6, and 0.4 mg/day of B12). ALL vitamin supplements, with the exception of vitamin B12 supplement, are chemically synthesized. This means that they are produced by combining separate chemical elements in a factory. Vitamin B12 is biosynthesized, which means that it is made by using bacterial enzymes."
Cocaine,"Cocaine: A substance derived from the leaves of the coca plant that is a bitter, addictive substance formerly used as an anesthetic. Safer anesthetics than cocaine were developed in the 20th century, although it is still used as an injectable anesthetic by some dentists. Synthetic alternatives, such as procaine, are used far more widely. Tragically, cocaine is a highly addictive and destructive street drug."
Coccus,"Coccus: A bacterial cell that has the shape of a sphere. Coccus is part of the name of a number of bacteria, such as enterococcus, meningococcus, pneumococcus, staphylococcus, and streptococcus."
Coccydynia,"Coccydynia: Pain in the coccyx (the tailbone). The coccyx is the small bone at the bottom of the spine very near the anus. The coccyx is made up of 3-5 rudimentary vertebrae and is the lowest part of the spinal column. The suffix -dynia comes from the Greek word ""odyne"" meaning pain."
Code black,"Code black: While there is no formal definition for a ""Code,"" doctors often use the term as slang to refer to a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest , requiring a team of providers (sometimes called a ""code team"") to rush to the specific location and begin immediate resuscitative efforts. The term ""Code"" derives from the practice at many institutions of using ""Code"" designations followed by colors (eg ""code blue""), numbers (""Code 10"") or other qualifying terms to alert personnel in the event of an emergency and to specify what type of emergency is occurring. There are no standard definitions or conventions for the use of ""Code"" designations, and each institution that uses a ""Code"" system can decide how to apply the system. For example, while ""Code blue"" refers to a cardiopulmonary arrest at many hospitals, it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing everywhere. Other types of emergencies, (for example bomb threats, terrorist activity, child abductions, or mass casualties) may also be given ""Code"" designations."
Code blue,"Code blue: An emergency situation announced in a hospital or institution in which a patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring a team of providers (sometimes called a 'code team') to rush to the specific location and begin immediate resuscitative efforts."
"Code, hospital","Code, hospital: While there is no formal definition for a ""Code,"" doctors often use the term as slang to refer to a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest , requiring a team of providers (sometimes called a ""code team"") to rush to the specific location and begin immediate resuscitative efforts. The term ""Code"" derives from the practice at many institutions of using ""Code"" designations followed by colors (""Code blue""), numbers (""Code 10"") or other qualifying terms to alert personnel in the event of an emergency and to specify what type of emergency is occurring. (Code pink is often used to alert security that a baby is missing from the hospital nursery!) There are no standard definitions or conventions for the use of ""Code"" designations, and each institution that uses a ""Code"" system can decide how to apply the system. For example, while ""Code blue"" refers to a cardiopulmonary arrest at many hospitals, it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing everywhere. Other types of emergencies, (for example bomb threats, terrorist activity, child abductions, or mass casualties) may also be given ""Code"" designations."
Coenzyme,"Coenzyme: A substance that enhances the action of an enzyme. (An enzyme is a protein that functions as a catalyst to mediate and speed a chemical reaction). Coenzymes are small molecules. They cannot by themselves catalyze a reaction but they can help enzymes to do so. In technical terms, coenzymes are organic nonprotein molecules that bind with the protein molecule (apoenzyme) to form the active enzyme (holoenzyme). A number of the water-soluble vitamins such as vitamins B1, B2 and B6 serve as coenzymes."
Coenzyme Q10,"Coenzyme Q10: A compound needed for the proper functioning of an enzyme, a protein that speeds up the rate at which chemical reactions take place in the body. Coenzyme Q10 is used to produce energy to fuel cell growth and maintenance. Coenzyme Q10 is thought to improve the function of mitochondria, the ""powerhouses"" that produce energy in cells. Coenzyme Q10 is also an antioxidant, a substance that protects cells from highly reactive chemicals called free radicals that can damage cells and their DNA. The highest amounts of coenzyme Q10 are in the heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas and the lowest amounts are in the lungs. The levels of coenzyme Q10 normally decline with age. . Coenzyme Q10 is sold in the US as a dietary supplement.The Q and the 10 in coenzyme Q10 refer to parts of the compound's chemical structure. It is also known as CoQ10, Q10, vitamin Q10, ubiquinone, or ubidecarenone."
Cognitive,"Cognitive: Having to do with thought, judgment, or knowledge."
Cognitive therapy,"Cognitive therapy: A relatively short-term form of psychotherapy based on the concept that the way we think about things affects how we feel emotionally. Cognitive therapy focuses on present thinking, behavior, and communication rather than on past experiences and is oriented toward problem solving. Cognitive therapy has been applied to a broad range of problems including depression, anxiety, panic, fears, eating disorders, substance abuse, and personality problems. Cognitive therapy is sometimes called cognitive behavior therapy because it aims to help people in the ways they think (the cognitive) and in the ways they act (the behavior). Cognitive therapy has, for instance, been used to help cocaine-dependent individuals become abstinent from cocaine and other substances. The underlying assumption is that learning processes play an important role in the development and continuation of cocaine abuse and dependence. These same learning processes can be used to help individuals reduce their drug use."
Cohort,"Cohort: In a clinical research trial, a group of study participants or patients."
Coitophobia,"Coitophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of sexual intercourse. Sufferers from coitophobia experience undue anxiety because they are preoccupied with failing in some way while having sexual intercourse. Among the symptoms of coitophobia are failure to achieve an erection (erectile dysfunction) and failure to achieve orgasm (anorgasmy). ""Coitophobia"" is a hybrid word derived from the Latin ""coitus,"" which is the past participle of the verb ""coire"" (to come together), and the Greek ""phobos"" (fear)."
Coitus,Coitus: Sexual intercourse.
Coitus interruptus,"Coitus interruptus: A method of contraception, also called withdrawal, in which the man withdraws his penis from the vagina before ejaculation. Fertilization is prevented because the sperm do not enter the vagina. The effectiveness of this maneuver depends on the man's ability to withdraw before the ejaculation of any sperm. Withdrawal does not provide protection from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV. Infectious diseases can be transmitted by direct contact with surface lesions and by pre-ejaculatory fluid."
Coke,"Coke: Street name for cocaine, the most potent stimulant of natural origin, a bitter addictive anesthetic (pain blocker) which is extracted from the leaves of the coca scrub (Erythroxylon coca) indigenous to the Andean highlands of South America. From the name of the plant came the name cocaine and its street name coke (and Coke as in Coca Cola, which once contained it). Once the American surgeon William S. Halstead (1852-1922) had injected cocaine into nerve trunks and showed it numbed feeling, cocaine came into use as an anesthetic agent. It was first employed as a spinal anesthetic in 1898 by the German surgeon August Bier. Soon thereafter the addictiveness of cocaine was discovered. Safer anesthetics were developed in the 20th century and cocaine fell into disuse in medicine as a pain blocker. Tragically, cocaine continues in use as a highly addictive and destructive street drug, an inadvertent contribution by medicine to the contemporary drug culture. Illicit cocaine is usually distributed as a white crystalline powder or as an off-white chunky material. Cocaine base is converted into the powder form, which is usually cocaine hydrochloride, by diluting it with other substances. The substances most commonly used in this process are sugars, such as lactose, inositol, and mannitol, and local anesthetics, such as lidocaine. The adulteration of cocaine increases its volume and thus multiplies profits. The major routes of administration of cocaine are snorting, injecting, and smoking (including freebase and crack cocaine). Snorting is inhaling cocaine powder through the nose where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. Injecting is using a needle to release the drug directly into the bloodstream. Smoking involves inhaling cocaine vapor or smoke into the lungs, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream as quickly as when it is injected. ""Crack"" is the street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a ready-to-use free base for smoking. Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine using ether, crack cocaine is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. The term ""crack"" refers to the crackling sound heard when the mixture is heated, presumably from the sodium bicarbonate. On the illicit market, crack, or ""rock,"" is sold in small, inexpensive dosage units. Smoking this form of the drug delivers large quantities of cocaine to the lungs, producing effects comparable to intravenous injection. These effects are felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense, and do not last long. There is great risk associated with cocaine use whether the drug is ingested by snorting, injecting, or smoking. Excessive doses of cocaine may lead to seizures and death from respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), or heart failure. There is no specific antidote for cocaine overdose. Evidence suggests that users who smoke or inject cocaine may be at even greater risk than those who snort it. Cocaine smokers suffer from acute respiratory problems including coughing, shortness of breath, and severe chest pains with lung trauma and bleeding. In addition, it appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted. The injecting cocaine user is at risk for transmitting or acquiring HIV infection/AIDS if needles or other injection equipment are shared. Colombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine. Three-quarters of the world's annual yield of cocaine is produced there from cocaine base imported from Peru and Bolivia and from locally grown coca. Colombia is the nation with the largest number of acres of coca under cultivation. To transport cocaine, traffickers have started using a new concealment method whereby they add chemical compounds to cocaine hydrochloride to produce ""black cocaine."" The cocaine in this substance is not detected by standard chemical tests or drug-sniffing canines."
COLD (chronic obstructive lung disease),"COLD (chronic obstructive lung disease): Any disorder that persistently obstructs bronchial airflow. COLD mainly involves two related diseases -- chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Both bronchitis and emphysema cause chronic obstruction of air flowing through the airways of the lungs. The obstruction is generally permanent and progresses (becomes worse) over time. By contrast, in asthma there is also obstruction of airflow out of the lungs, but the obstruction is usually reversible and between attacks of asthma the flow of air through the airways is usually good. COLD is also called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
Colectomy,"Colectomy: An operation to remove all or part of the colon (large intestine). In a partial colectomy, the surgeon removes only part of the colon. The bowel is then reconnected or an opening of the bowel (ostomy) is created on the abdominal wall to allow the contents of the bowel to exit from the body. Colectomy may be needed for treatment of diverticulitis, benign polyps of the colon, and cancer of the colon."
Coliform,"Coliform: a term used to refer to a certain group of bacteria. The coliform bacteria are rod-shaped, Gram-negative non-spore-forming bacteria. Eschericia coli (E. coli) is an example of the coliform bacteria. Coliforms are found in water, in soil, and on plants. They are common in the feces of all warm-blooded animals. Testing for coliform bacteria is commonly done to determine the quality of water supplies. While coliform bacteria themselves are not likely to cause illness, their presence in water supplies indicates that other disease-causing bacteria or organisms are present in the water supply. Note that some rare strains of E. coli, particularly the strain 0157:H7, can cause serious illness. Recent outbreaks of disease caused by E. coli 0157:H7 have primarily been described in people who have eaten undercooked hamburger. Cases of E. coli 0157:H7 caused by contaminated water supplies are rare."
Colitis,"Colitis: Inflammation of the large intestine (the colon). There are many forms of colitis, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, infectious, pseudomembranous, and spastic. For example, intermittent rectal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea can be symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Diagnosis can be made by direct visualization using (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) which is the most accurate test. Long-standing ulcerative colitis increases the risk for colon cancer. Ulcerative colitis can also be associated with inflammation in joints, spine, skin, eyes, the liver and its bile ducts. Treatment of ulcerative colitis can involve medications and surgery."
Collagen,"Collagen: The principal protein of the skin, tendons, cartilage, bone, and connective tissue. Collagen is an essential part of the framework of the design of our various body tissues."
Collateral,"Collateral: In anatomy, a collateral is a subordinate or accessory part. A collateral is also a side branch, as of a blood vessel or nerve. After a coronary artery occlusion, collaterals (that is, collateral vessels) often develop to shunt blood around the blockage. The word ""collateral"" comes from the Latin ""col-"", with + ""latus"", side = with the side, situated at the side. (The prefix ""col-"" is a variant form of ""com-"" meaning ""with"" that is used before an ""l"".) Hence, collateral means accessory, subordinate, secondary, serving to support or reinforce. In the sense of being on the side and in the sense of serving to support or reinforce, there are collateral ligaments outside of the knee joint. The collateral ligaments help provide stability and strength to the knee joint:"
Colon,"Colon: The long, coiled, tubelike organ that removes water from digested food. The remaining material, solid waste called stool, moves through the colon to the rectum and leaves the body through the anus. Also known as large bowel and large intestine."
Colonoscopy,"Colonoscopy: A procedure whereby a physician inserts a viewing tube (colonoscope) into the rectum for the purpose of inspecting the colon. During colonoscopy, polyps can be removed, bleeding can be cauterized, and a biopsy can be performed if abnormal areas of the colon are seen."
Colostomy,"Colostomy: An artificial exit from the colon created to divert waste through a hole in the colon and through the wall of the abdomen. A colostomy is commonly performed by severing the colon and then attaching the end leading to the stomach to the skin, through the wall of the abdomen. At the exterior opening (stoma), a bag can be attached for waste removal. The end of the colon that leads to the rectum is closed off and becomes dormant (known as a Hartmann colostomy). There are other types of colostomy procedures. Usually a colostomy is performed because of infection, blockage, cancer, or in rare instances, severe trauma of the colon."
Colostrum,"Colostrum: A sticky white or yellow fluid secreted by the breasts during the second half of pregnancy and for a few days after birth, before breast milk comes in. It is high in protective antibodies that boost the newborn's immune system."
Colpo-,Colpo-: Prefix referring to the vagina.
Comedones,"Comedones: The plural of comedo, the primary sign of acne, consisting of a dilated (widened) hair follicle filled with keratin squamae (skin debris), bacteria, and sebum (oil). Comedones may be closed or open. A closed comedo has an obstructed opening to the skin and may rupture to cause a low-grade skin inflammatory reaction in the area. The common name for a closed comedo is a whitehead. An open comedo has a wide opening to the skin and is capped with a blackened mass of skin debris. It is commonly known as a blackhead. Acne occurs when sebaceous glands of the skin begin to secrete oil during puberty. These glands are stimulated by male hormones that are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls. The oil lubricates and protects the skin. Under certain circumstances, cells that are close to the openings of the sebaceous glands block the openings. This causes a buildup of oil underneath the skin. Bacteria, which live in everyone's skin but generally mind their own business, feast on this oil, multiply, and cause the surrounding tissues to become inflamed after the follicle ruptures. If the inflammation is right near the surface, a pustule is formed; if it is deeper, a papule (pimple); deeper still and it becomes a cyst. If the poreis completely closed to the surface, the result is a whitehead. If the pore is wide open, oil becomes oxidized (that is, acted on by oxygen in the air), the oil changes from white to black, and the result is a blackhead. This is how the two types of comedones develop. Comedo is the Latin word for glutton. The ancients believed that the contents of a comedo were the remains of a gluttonous worm. Note that the preferred plural form of comedo is comedones."
Commensal,"Commensal: 1. Living in a relationship in which one organism derives food or other benefits from another organism without hurting or helping it. Commensal bacteria are part of the normal flora in the mouth.
2. An intimate relationship. The Norway rat, roof rat, and house mouse are considered commensal rodents because of their intimate relationships with humans. From the Latin prefix com- (with, together, jointly) + the Latin adjective mensalis (of the table). Commensal people eat together at the same table."
Common bile duct,"Common bile duct: The duct that carries bile from the gallbladder and liver into the duodenum (upper part of the small intestine). The common bile duct is formed by the junction of the cystic duct, from the gallbladder, and the common hepatic duct, from the liver."
Common cold,"Common cold: A contagious viral upper respiratory tract infection. The common cold can be caused by many different types of viruses, and the body can never build up resistance to all of them. For this reason, colds are a frequent and recurring problem. Going out into cold weather has no effect on causing a cold. Antibiotics do not cure or shorten the duration of the illness."
Complementary medicine,"Complementary medicine: A group of diagnostic and therapeutic disciplines that are used together with conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy is using acupuncture in addition to usual care to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. Complementary medicine is different from alternative medicine. Whereas complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a physician. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) can include the following:"
Complementary sequence,"Complementary sequence: Nucleic acid sequence of bases that can form a double- stranded structure by matching base pairs. For example, the complementary sequence to C-A-T-G (where each letter stands for one of the bases in DNA) is G-T-A-C."
Complete blood count,Complete blood count: A set values of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. These measurements are generally determined by specially designed machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute. The values generally included are the following: 
Complication,"Complication: In medicine, an unanticipated problem that arises following, and is a result of, a procedure, treatment, or illness. A complication is so named because it complicates the situation."
Compound heterozygote,"Compound heterozygote: The presence of two different mutant alleles at a particular gene locus, one on each chromosome of a pair. The human genome contains two copies of each gene, a paternal and a maternal allele. A mutation affecting only one allele is called heterozygous. A homozygous mutation is the presence of the identical mutation on both alleles of a specific gene. However, when both alleles of a gene harbor mutations, but the mutations are different, these mutations are called compound heterozygous. Also called a genetic compound."
Compress,"Compress: Cloth or another material applied under pressure to an area of the skin and held in place for a period of time. A compress can be any temperature, and it can be dry or wet. It may also be impregnated with medication or an herbal remedy. Most compresses are used to relieve inflammation."
Compression,"Compression: 1. The act of pressing together. As in a compression fracture, nerve compression, or spinal cord compression.
2. To shorten in time. In embryology, there may be compression of development with some stages even omitted."
Computerized axial tomography (CAT),"Computerized axial tomography (CAT): Cat scanning adds X-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views anatomy. It can identify normal and abnormal structures and be used to guide procedures. CAT scanning is painless. Iodine-containing contrast material is sometimes used in CAT scanning. If you are having a CAT scan and are allergic to iodine or contrast materials, you should notify your physicians and radiology staff."
Conception,"Conception: 1. The union of the sperm and the ovum. Synonymous with fertilization.
2. The onset of pregnancy, marked by implantation of the blastocyst into the endometrium.
3. A basic understanding of a situation or a principle.
From the Latin conceptio, conceptionis meaning conception, becoming pregnant; drawing up of legal formulae; and from the Latin conceptus meaning conceiving, pregnancy; collecting, or a collection."
Concordance,"Concordance: 1. The presence of any given condition such as HIV in both members of a couple.
2. In genetics, the presence of a phenotype such as asthma in both members of a twin pair.
3. In clinical care, agreement between physician and patient.
In all sense, concordance is as opposed to discordance. From the Latin concordare, to agree."
Condition,"Condition: The term ""condition"" has a number of biomedical meanings including the following:"
Conditioning,"Conditioning: 1) Exercise and practice to build the body up for either improved normal performance, as in physical therapy, or in preparation for sports performance. 2) A method of educating involving repetitive activities to influence behavior."
Condom,"Condom: Although the word ""condom"" usually refers to the male condom, there is also a female condom. Both male and female condoms are barrier methods of contraception. Male condoms: The male condom is a sheath placed over the erect penis before penetration, preventing pregnancy by blocking the passage of sperm. It is a barrier method of contraception. A condom can be used only once. Although some condoms have spermicide added (the spermicide is usually nonoxynol-9 in the United States) to kill sperm, spermicide has not been scientifically shown to provide additional contraceptive protection over a condom alone. Because they act as a mechanical barrier, condoms prevent direct vaginal contact with semen, infectious genital secretions, and genital sores and discharges. Most condoms are made from latex rubber, while a small percentage are made from lamb intestines (sometimes called ""lambskin"" condoms). Condoms made from polyurethane have been marketed in the United States since 1994. Except for abstinence, latex condoms are the most effective method for reducing the risk of infection from the viruses that cause AIDS, other HIV-related illnesses, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).(It does not protect against transmission of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Some condoms are pre-lubricated. These lubricants do not provide more birth control or STD protection. Non-oil-based lubricants, such as water or K-Y jelly, can be used with latex or lambskin condoms, but oil-based lubricants, such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline), lotions, or massage or baby oil, should not be used because they can weaken the material. Female condoms: The Reality Female Condom was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1993. It consists of a lubricated polyurethane sheath shaped similarly to the male condom. The closed end, which has a flexible ring, is inserted into the vagina, while the open end remains outside, partially covering the labia. The female condom, like the male condom, is available without a prescription and, like the male condom, is intended for one-time use. A female condom should not be used together with a male condom because they may not both stay in place."
Condyloma,"Condyloma: Wartlike growths around the anus, vulva, or glans penis. There are three major types of condyloma, each of which is sexually transmitted: condyloma acuminatum (warts around the vulva), condyloma latum (a form of secondary syphilis), and condyloma subcutaneum (also known as molluscum contagiosum)."
Conformal radiation therapy,"Conformal radiation therapy: A procedure that uses computers to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to target the tumor as accurately as possible and give it the highest possible dose of radiation while sparing normal tissue as much as possible. It is also known as 3-D or conformational radiation therapy. Conventional radiation therapy directs x-rays not only at the tumor but also unavoidably at nearby healthy tissue. Conformal radiation is meant to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the cancer without causing so much damage to surrounding tissues. Conformal radiation therapy is in use to treat prostate cancer and is under study with other types of cancer including lung cancer, brain tumors and cancer of the head and neck."
Congenital,"Congenital: A condition that is present at birth, whether or not it is inherited."
Congenital malformation,"Congenital malformation: A physical defect present in a baby at birth that can involve many different parts of the body, including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, bones, and intestinal tract. Congenital malformation can be genetic, it can result from exposure of the fetus to a malforming agent (such as alcohol), or it can be of unknown origin. Congenital malformations are now the leading cause of infant mortality (death) in the US and many other developed nations. Examples include heart defects, cleft lip and palate, spina bifida, limb defects, and Down syndrome."
Congestion,Congestion: An abnormal or excessive accumulation of a body fluid. The term is used broadly in medicine. Examples include nasal congestion (excess mucus and secretions in the air passages of the nose) seen with a common cold and congestion of blood in the lower extremities seen with some types of heart failure.
Congestive heart failure,"Congestive heart failure: Inability of the heart to keep up with the demands on it, with failure of the heart to pump blood with normal efficiency. When this occurs, the heart is unable to provide adequate blood flow to other organs, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys. Abbreviated CHF. CHF may be due to failure of the right or left ventricle, or both. The symptoms can include shortness of breath (dyspnea), asthma due to the heart (cardiac asthma), pooling of blood (stasis) in the general body (systemic) circulation or in the liver's (portal) circulation, swelling (edema), blueness or duskiness (cyanosis), and enlargement (hypertrophy) of the heart. The many causes of CHF include coronary artery disease leading to heart attacks and heart muscle (myocardium) weakness; primary heart muscle weakness from viral infections or toxins, such as prolonged alcohol exposure; heart valve disease causing heart muscle weakness due to too much leaking of blood or causing heart muscle stiffness from a blocked valve; hyperthyroidism; and high blood pressure."
Conjunctival,"Conjunctival: Pertaining to the conjunctiva, the clear moist membrane that covers the inner surfaces of the eyelids and the front of eyeball."
Conjunctivitis,"Conjunctivitis: Inflammation of the membrane covering the surface of the eyeball. It can be a result of infection or irritation of the eye, or it can be related to systemic diseases, such as Reiter syndrome. Also known as pinkeye."
Connective tissue,"Connective tissue: A material made up of fibers forming a framework and support structure for body tissues and organs. Connective tissue surrounds many organs. Cartilage and bone are specialized forms of connective tissue. All connective tissue is derived from mesoderm, the middle germ cell layer in the embryo."
Consanguinity,"Consanguinity: Close blood relationship, sometimes used to denote human inbreeding. Mating of closely related persons can cause significant genetic disease in offspring. Everyone carries rare recessive genes that, in the company of other genes of the same type, are capable of causing autosomal recessive diseases. First cousins share a set of grandparents, so for any particular gene in one of them, the chance that the other inherited the same allele from the same source is one in eight. For this reason, marriage between first cousins (not to mention closer relatives) is generally discouraged, and in many areas of the world is illegal. Mating between more distant relatives carries lesser risks. In families where a recessive genetic disorder is known or suspected to be present, genetic testing and counseling are advised, even if the level of consanguinity is very low (as, for example, in marriages between third or fourth cousins)."
Consolidation therapy,"Consolidation therapy: Cancer treatment given after induction therapy to consolidate the gains obtained, further reduce the number of cancer cells and enhance the likelihood of a durable complete remission. Often just called consolidation. The overall sequence of therapy may be induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy. Induction therapy is the initial step toward reducing the number of cancer cells. Consolidation is designed to further diminish the number of cancer cells and enhance the likelihood of achieving a durable complete remission. Maintenance is given to maintain the remission and further prevent a relapse."
Constipation,"Constipation: Infrequent and frequently incomplete bowel movements. Constipation is the opposite of diarrhea and is commonly caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticulosis, and medications. Paradoxically, constipation can also be caused by overuse of laxatives. Colon cancer can also narrow the colon and thereby cause constipation. A high-fiber diet can frequently relieve constipation. If the diet is not helpful, medical evaluation is warranted."
Consumption,"Consumption: An old and once common term for wasting away of the body, particularly from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Other old TB terms include the King's evil or scrofula (TB of the lymph nodes in the neck) and Pott's disease (TB of the spine). The World Health Organization (WHO) in ""L'histoire de la tuberculose"" notes that: ""In 460 BC Hippocrates identified phtisis (the Greek word meaning ""consumption"") as the most widespread disease of his day and observed that it was almost always fatal. Someone who had tuberculosis seemed literally to be consumed by the disease. That is why they used to speak of 'consumption'"" (my translation)."
Contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis: A skin condition caused by contact between skin and some substance. Includes irritant contact dermatitis (a rash brought on purely by repeated irritation from a substance such as water causing ""dish pan hands"") and allergic contact dermatitis (involving a specific sensitivity or allergy to a specific substance such as poison ivy)."
"Contraceptive device, intrauterine (IUD)","Contraceptive device, intrauterine (IUD): A device inserted into the uterus (womb) to prevent conception (pregnancy). The?IUD?can be a coil, loop, triangle, or T in shape made of?plastic?or metal.?An IUD is inserted into the uterus by a health care professional. How IUDs prevent pregnancy is not entirely clear. They seem to prevent sperm and eggs from meeting by either immobilizing the sperm on their way to the fallopian tubes or by changing the uterine lining so the fertilized egg cannot implant in it. IUDs have one of the lowest failure rates of any contraceptive method. In the population for which the IUD is appropriate -- for those in a mutually monogamous, stable relationship who are not at a high risk of infection -- the IUD is considered a safe and effective contraception method.? Today, serious complication from IUDs are rare, although IUD users may be at increased risk of developing?pelvic inflammatory disease. Other side effects can include perforation of the uterus, abnormal bleeding, and cramps. Complications occur most often during and immediately after insertion."
"Contraceptive, pill","Contraceptive, pill: Commonly called ""the pill,"" combined oral contraceptives are the most commonly used form of reversible?birth control?in the United States. This form of birth control suppresses ovulation (the monthly release of an egg from the ovaries) by the combined actions of the hormones estrogen and progestin. If a woman remembers to take the pill every day as directed, she has an extremely low chance of becoming pregnant in a year. But the pill's effectiveness may be reduced if the woman is taking some medications, such as certain antibiotics. Besides preventing?pregnancy, the pill can make periods more regular. It also has a protective effect against?pelvic inflammatory disease?(PID), an infection of the fallopian tubes or uterus that is a major cause of?infertility?in women, and against ovarian and endometrial cancers. Birth control pills are considered safe for most women but they carry some risks. Current low-dose pills have fewer risks associated with them than earlier versions. But women who smoke, especially those over 35, and women with certain medical conditions such as a history of?blood clots?or?breast?or endometrial?cancer, may be advised against taking the pill. The pill may also contribute to cardiovascular disease, including?high blood pressure, blood clots, and blockage of the arteries. The side effects of the pill include nausea,?headache, breast tenderness, weight gain, irregular bleeding, and?depression. These side effects often subside after a few months' use of the pill."
Contraction,Contraction: The tightening and shortening of a muscle.
Contraindication,Contraindication: A condition which makes a particular treatment or procedure potentially inadvisable. A contraindication may be absolute or relative. Contraindications often highlight the balance of risk versus benefit of a particular treatment or procedure.
Contralateral,"Contralateral: Of or pertaining to the other side. The opposite of ipsilateral (the same side). For example, a?stroke?involving the right side of the brain may cause contralateral paralysis of the left leg."
Contrast,"Contrast: Short for ""contrast media."" Contrast media are X-ray dyes used to provide contrast, for example, between blood vessels and other tissue."
Control (research),"Control (research): In research, control subjects or control procedures permit comparison with experimental results. The first controlled clinical research was probably done in 1875 by the British naval surgeon James Lind who, on board the HMS Salisbury, gave sailors with scurvy either oranges or lemons or cider or vinegar or nutmeg (or another treatment) and after just six days discovered that the citrus-consuming sailors had recovered from scurvy, until then the scourge of extended sea voyages, while the sailors who had been given the other treatments remained uncured."
Contusion,"Contusion: Another name for a bruise. What is a bruise ? A bruise, or contusion, is caused when blood vessels are damaged or broken as the result of a blow to the skin (be it bumping against something or hitting yourself with a hammer). The raised area of a bump or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood vessels into the tissues as well as from the body's response to the injury. A purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is referred to as an ecchymosis."
Convulsion,"Convulsion: An abnormal, involuntary contraction of the muscles most typically seen with certain seizure disorders. The term convulsion is sometimes used as a synonym for seizure, but not all seizures are characterized by convulsions. A person having convulsions appears to be shaking rapidly and without control. Other possible causes of convulsions include fever, meningitis, drug or alcohol abuse, poisoning, hypoglycemia, and head injury."
COPD,"COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Any disorder that persistently obstructs bronchial airflow. COPD is frequently related to cigarette smoking and mainly involves two related diseases -- chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Both are frequently present and cause chronic obstruction of airflow obstruction of the lungs. The obstruction is generally permanent and progresses (becomes worse) over time. Asthma is also a pulmonary disease in which there is obstruction to the flow of air out of the lungs, but the obstruction is usually reversible and between attacks of asthma the flow of air through the airways is usually good. COPD is also called chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)."
Coprolalia,"Coprolalia: The excessive and uncontrollable use of foul or obscene language, including words related to feces (bowel waste). Coprolalia is a typical symptom of Tourette syndrome, a condition that has its onset in childhood and is characterized by compulsive arm movements, facial tics, grunting, groaning and shouting. Aside from coprolalia, there is often echolalia, the involuntary parrot-like repetition (echoing) of a word or sentence just spoken by another person. Persons with Tourette syndrome do not usually curse out of anger or displeasure but out of uncontrollable compulsion. They cannot help themselves. (The disease is also called Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.) Coprolalia can upon occasion also be a symptom of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder of thought in which the sufferer loses touch with reality, withdraws from social activity and exhibits bizarre behavior. The schizophrenic may curse for no apparent reason. (There is no known relationship between Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia.) Undiagnosed victims of Tourette syndrome or schizophrenia are often subjected to public ridicule from persons within earshot of a coprolalia outburst. Observers believe the outburst is the result of a conscious and voluntary decision to swear. It is not. Medication is available to control the outbursts. Persons who swear excessively, repeatedly and deliberately -- that is, they swear because they want to --are not technically sufferers of coprolalia, although some writers may wish to apply the term loosely to them. ""Coprolalia"" is derived from the Greek words ""kopros"" (dung) and ""lalein"" (to babble). ""Kopros"" has also given us such English words as ""coprolith,"" a hard lump of feces in the intestines, and ""coprophobia"" (an abnormal and persistent fear of feces)."
Coprophobia,"Coprophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of feces (bowel waste). Sufferers of coprophobia experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. They go out of their way to avoid coming into contact with feces or sometimes even seeing feces. ""Coprophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""kopros"" (dung) and ""phobos"" (fear). Alternate names: Koprophobia, scatophobia."
CoQ10,CoQ10: See: Coenzyme Q10.
Cor,"Cor: The Latin word for the heart. For example, cor pulmonale is heart disease that results from abnormally high resistance to the passage of blood through the lungs. Cor biloculare is a two-chambered heart resulting from failure of development of the walls that normally separate the two atria from each other and separate the two ventricles from one another."
Cord,"Cord: 1. In anatomy, a long ropelike structure. 2. Short for the spinal cord or the umbilical cord."
Cornea,"Cornea: The clear front window of the eye, which transmits and focuses light into the eye. The cornea is more than a protective film; it is a fairly complex structure that has five layers."
Corns,"Corns: Small calloused areas of skin caused by local pressure irritating tissue over a bony prominence. Corns most commonly occur over a toe where they form what is referred to as a hard corn. Between the toes, pressure can form a soft corn of macerated skin which often yellows. The word corn comes from the Latin cornu meaning horn or hoof. A corn on the toe is also called a clavus."
Coronal,Coronal: A coronal plane through the body is a vertical plane from head to foot and parallel to the shoulders.
Coronary arteries,"Coronary arteries: The vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood rich in oxygen. They are called the coronary arteries because they encircle the heart in the manner of a crown. The word ""coronary"" comes from the Latin ""corona"" and Greek ""koron"" meaning crown. Like other arteries, the coronaries may be subject to arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). There are a number of coronary arteries. Those most often bypassed today include the right coronary artery, the posterior descending coronary artery, the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending coronary artery and the left circumflex coronary artery. Plaques obstructing the coronary arteries may also be treated by balloon angioplasty, stents, and other techniques."
Coronary artery disease,"Coronary artery disease: Impedance or blockage of one or more arteries that supply blood to the heart, usually due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Abbreviated CAD. A major cause of illness and death, CAD begins when hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The plaques in the coronary arteries can lead to the formation of tiny clots that can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle, producing symptoms and signs of CAD, including chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack (myocardial infarction), and sudden death. Treatment for CAD includes bypass surgery, balloon angioplasty, and the use of stents."
Coronavirus,"Coronavirus: a type of common virus that infects humans, typically leading to an upper respiratory infection (URI.)  Seven different types of human coronavirus have been identified. Most people will be infected with at least one type of coronavirus in their lifetime. The viruses are spread through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus and rarely, by fecal contamination. The illness caused by most coronaviruses usually lasts a short time and is characterized by runny nose, sore throat, feeling unwell, cough, and fever.  Examples of human coronaviruses that have been reported to cause severe symptoms include the MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS), SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and the new 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak that began in Wuhan, China."
Corporeal,Corporeal: Pertaining to the body of an organ or the entire body.
Corpus,Corpus: The body of the uterus.
Corrigan pulse,"Corrigan pulse: A pulse that is forceful and then suddenly collapses. It is usually found in patients with aortic regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky aortic valve. The left ventricle of the heart ejects blood under high pressure into the aorta. Then the aortic valve normally shuts tight so that blood cannot return to the ventricle. If, however, the aortic valve cannot close completely, the blood in the aorta comes sloshing back into the ventricle, and the pressure and the pulse collapse. Also known as water-hammer pulse."
Cortical,"Cortical: Having to do with the cortex, the outer layer of an organ."
Corticosteroid,"Corticosteroid: Any of the steroid hormones made by the outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal gland. There are two sets of these hormones: the glucocorticoids, which are produced in reaction to stress and also help in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins; and the mineralocorticoids, which regulate the balance of salt and water within the body."
Cortisol,"Cortisol: A metabolite of the primary stress hormone cortisone. Cortisol is an essential factor in the proper metabolism of starches, and it is the major natural glucocorticoid (GC) in humans."
Cortisone,"Cortisone: A naturally occurring adrenocorticoid hormone that is produced in minute amounts by the adrenal gland. Synthetic cortisone is also available; it is metabolized by the body into cortisol. Uses for synthetic oral, intramuscular, and intravenous cortisone medications include treatment of adrenocortical deficiency and treatment of conditions associated with inflammation. A popular topical form is known as hydrocortisone cream."
Coryza,Coryza: A head cold that includes a runny nose.
Cosmeceutical,"Cosmeceutical: A cosmetic product claimed to have medicinal or drug-like benefits. Cosmeceutical products are marketed as cosmetics, but reputedly contain biologically active ingredients. Examples include anti-wrinkle skin creams with ingredients such as alpha lipoic acid and dimethylaminoethanol and creams containing ""cellular replenishment serum"" that supposedly have ""antiaging properties."" The term ""cosmeceutical"" was created in 1990s from cosm(etic) + (pharma)ceutic. The cosmetic industry uses the term but the US Food and Drug Administration does not recognize the term. While drugs are subject to a review and approval process by FDA, cosmetics are not. If a product has drug properties, it must be approved as a drug. But cosmeceutics skirt this review and approval process."
Costochondritis,"Costochondritis: Inflammation and swelling of the cartilage of the chest wall, usually involving the cartilage that surrounds the breastbone (sternum) but sometimes including the adjacent tip of a rib. Costochondritis causes local pain and tenderness of the chest around the sternum. Treatment options include anti-inflammatory medications and, in severe cases, corticosteroid injections. Also known as Tietze syndrome."
Cough,"Cough: A rapid expulsion of air from the lungs, typically in order to clear the lung airways of fluids, mucus, or other material. Also known as tussis."
Cough suppressant,"Cough suppressant: A drug used to control coughing, particularly with a dry, nagging, unproductive cough."
Coughing up blood,Coughing up blood: see hemoptysis.
Counterpulsation,Counterpulsation: A technique that synchronizes the external pumping of blood with the heart's cycle to assist the circulation and decreasing the work of the heart. Counterpulsation pumps when the heart is resting to increase blood flow and oxygen to the heart. Counterpulsation stops pumping when the heart is working to decrease the heart's workload and lessen oxygen demand. See: Enhanced external counterpulsation.
Cox-1 inhibitor,"Cox-1 inhibitor: An agent that inhibits the action of the enzyme cox-1 (cyclooxygenase-1). The common anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen block the action of both cox-1 and cox-2. Cox-1 inhibitors can reduce inflammation, but they may also decrease the natural protective mucus lining of the stomach. Therefore, these medications can cause stomach upset, intestinal bleeding, and ulcers. In some cases, using a buffered form of a cox-1 inhibitor can eliminate or reduce these adverse effects."
Cox-2,"Cox-2: Cyclooxygenase-2, an enzyme that acts to speed up the production of certain chemical messengers, called prostaglandins that play a key role in in promoting inflammation. When cox-2 activity is blocked, inflammation is reduced. Unlike cox-1, cox-2 is active only at the site of inflammation, not in the stomach."
CPAP,"CPAP: Continuous positive airway pressure. CPAP is an effective treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea treated with CPAP wear a face mask during sleep which is connected to a pump (CPAP machine) that forces air into the nasal passages at pressures high enough to overcome obstructions in the airway and stimulate normal breathing. The airway pressure delivered into the upper airway is continuous during both inspiration and expiration. Nasal CPAP is currently the preferred treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. CPAP is safe and effective, even in children. Daytime sleepiness improves or resolves. Heart function and hypertension also improve. And, importantly, the quality of life improves. At first, CPAP patients should be monitored in a sleep lab to determine the appropriate amount of air pressure for them. The first few nights on CPAP tend to be difficult, with patients experiencing less sleep. Many patients at first find the mask uncomfortable, claustrophobic or embarrassing. CPAP is not a cure and must be used every night for life. Non-compliant patients experience a full return of obstructive sleep apnea and related symptoms."
CpG,"CpG: In genetics, a site where cytosine (C) lies next to guanine (G) in the DNA sequence. (The p indicates that C and G are connected by a phosphodiester bond.) Methylation of DNA occurs at any CpG site."
Crabs,"Crabs: Slang for pubic lice, parasitic insects that can infest in the genital area of humans. Pubic lice are usually spread through sexual contact. Rarely, infestation can be spread through contact with an infested person's bed linens, towels, or clothes. The key symptom of pubic lice is itching in the genital area. Lice eggs (nits) or crawling lice can be seen with the naked eye."
Crack (drug),"Crack (drug): The street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a ready-to-use free base for smoking. Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine using ether, crack cocaine is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. The term ""crack"" refers to the crackling sound heard when the mixture is heated, presumably from the sodium bicarbonate. On the illicit market, crack, or ""rock,"" is sold in small, inexpensive dosage units. Smoking this form of the drug delivers large quantities of cocaine to the lungs, producing effects comparable to intravenous injection. These effects are felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense, and do not last long. Cocaine is the most potent stimulant of natural origin, a bitter addictive anesthetic (pain blocker) which is extracted from the leaves of the coca scrub (Erythroxylon coca) indigenous to the Andean highlands of South America. (From the name of the plant came the name cocaine and its street name coke and Coke as in Coca Cola, which once contained it). There is great risk associated with cocaine use whether the drug is ingested by snorting, injecting, or smoking. Excessive doses of cocaine may lead to seizures and death from respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), or heart failure. There is no specific antidote for cocaine overdose. Evidence suggests that users who smoke or inject cocaine may be at even greater risk than those who snort it. Cocaine smokers suffer from acute respiratory problems including coughing, shortness of breath, and severe chest pains with lung trauma and bleeding. In addition, it appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted."
Cramping leg pain,"Cramping leg pain: An aching, crampy, tired, and sometimes burning pain in the legs that comes and goes -- it typically occurs with walking and goes away with rest -- due to poor circulation of blood in the arteries of the legs. Known medically as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication may occur in one or both legs and may worsen over time. However, some people complain only of weakness in the legs when walking or a feeling of ""tiredness"" in the buttocks. In very severe claudication the pain may be felt ar rest. Impotence is an occasional complaint in men. The usually intermittent nature of the pain is due to narrowing of the arteries that supply the leg with blood, limiting the supply of oxygen to the leg muscles, a limitation that is felt especially when the oxygen requirement of these muscles rises with exercise. Intermittent claudication can be due to temporary artery narrowing due to vasospasm (spasm of the artery), permanent artery narrowing due to atherosclerosis, or complete occlusion (closure) of an artery to the leg. The condition is quite common, more so in men than women. It affects 1-2% of the population under 60 years of age, 3-4% of persons age 60 to 70 and over 5% of people over 70. The pulses in the legs and feet are evaluated on the clinical exam. Diagnostic tests include blood pressure measurements to compare the arms and legs, Doppler ultrasonography on the legs, duplex Doppler/ultrasound exam of the extremities to visualize arterial blood flow, an ECG, and arteriography (injecting dye that can be visualized in the arteries). The prognosis with intermittent claudication is generally favorable because the condition often stabilizes or improves in time. Conservative therapy is advisable. Walking often helps increase the distance that the patient can walk without symptoms. A program of daily walking for short periods, and stopping for pain or cramping, often helps improve function by encouraging the development of collateral circulation, that is, the growth of new small blood vessels that bypass the area of obstruction in the artery. It is essential to stop smoking. Avoid applications of heat or cold on legs. Avoid tight shoes. Two drugs are available for the management of intermittent claudication: pentoxifylline (brand name: Trental) and cilostazol (brand name: Pletal). These drugs act differently. Trental decreases the ""stickiness"" (viscosity) of blood and thereby improves its flow to the legs. Pletal acts to dilate (widen) the arteries by decreasing the action of an enzyme, phosphodiesterase III. It also reduces the ability of blood to clot. If conservative therapy is inadequate, correction of the narrowing in the affected artery may be suggested. This option depends on the location and severity of the narrowing in the artery and the underlying medical condition of the patient. Procedures that are used to correct the narrowing of arteries include surgery (such as bypass grafting) and interventional radiology (such as balloon angioplasty). When claudication is severe and persistent, these procedures may be required to ultimately relieve the condition and the pain. The word ""claudication"" comes from the Latin ""claudicare"" meaning to limp. (The Roman emperor Claudius, who ruled from A.D. 41-54, was so named because he limped, probably because of a birth defect.) There is also venous claudication, resulting from inadequate venous drainage. Cramping leg pain: An aching, crampy, tired, and sometimes burning pain in the legs that comes and goes -- it typically occurs with walking and goes away with rest -- due to poor circulation of blood in the arteries of the legs. Known medically as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication may occur in one or both legs and may worsen over time.

Cranial,"Cranial: 1. Pertaining to the cranium or skull. 2. Toward the head. As opposed to caudad. The eye is cranial to the jaw. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Cranial nerve X,"Cranial nerve X: The tenth cranial nerve, and one of the most important, is the vagus nerve. All twelve of the cranial nerves, the vagus nerve included, emerge from or enter the skull (the cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves which emerge from the vertebral column. The vagus nerve originates in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain stem. The vagus nerve is a remarkable nerve that relates to the function of numerous structures in the body. The vagus nerve supplies nerve fibers to the pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), lungs, heart, esophagus and most of the intestinal tract (as far as the transverse portion of the colon). And the vagus nerve brings sensory information back from the ear, tongue, pharynx and larynx. The term ""vagus"" (Latin for ""wandering"") is apt because the vagus nerve wanders all the way down from the brainstem to the colon, a long wandering trek. Complete interruption of the vagus nerve causes a characteristic syndrome. The back part of the palate (the soft palate) droops on that side. The capacity to gag (the gag reflex) is also lost on that side. The voice is hoarse and nasal. The vocal cord on the affected side is immobile. The result is dysphagia and dysphonia (trouble swallowing and trouble speaking). One of the best known branches of the vagus nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve. After leaving the vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve goes down into the chest and then loops back up to supply the larynx (the voice box). Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result from diseases inside the chest (intrathoracic diseases) such as a tumor or an aneurysm (ballooning) of the arch of the aorta or of the left atrium of the heart. The consequence is laryngeal palsy, paralysis of the larynx (the voice box), on the affected side. Laryngeal palsy can also be caused by damage to the vagus nerve before it gives off the recurrent laryngeal nerve."
Cranial nerves,"Cranial nerves: The nerves of the brain, which emerge from or enter the skull (the cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves, which emerge from the vertebral column. There are 12 cranial nerves, each of which is accorded a Roman numeral and a name:"
Cranio-,"Cranio-: Referring to the cranium, the top portion of the skull, the bony vault that protects the brain. As in craniocleidodysostosis, craniology, craniopharyngioma, craniotomy, etc."
Cranium,"Cranium: The top portion of the skull, which protects the brain. The cranium includes the frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones."
Crapulence,Crapulence: Sickness or indisposition resulting from an excess of drinking (or eating). Crapulence is an almost exact synonym for a hangover. See also: Crapulent.
CRC,CRC: 1. Colorectal cancer or colorectal carcinoma. 2. Clinical Research Center. 3. Canadian Research Council.
Cream,"Cream: A water-soluble medicinal preparation applied to the skin. An ointment differs from a cream in that it has an oil base, as opposed to being water-soluble."
Creatinine,"Creatinine: A chemical waste molecule that is generated from muscle metabolism. Creatinine is produced from creatine, a molecule of major importance for energy production in muscles. Approximately 2% of the body's creatine is converted to creatinine every day. Creatinine is transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys. The kidneys filter out most of the creatinine and dispose of it in the urine. Although it is a waste, creatinine serves a vital diagnostic function. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. As the kidneys become impaired the creatinine will rise. Abnormally high levels of creatinine thus warn of possible malfunction or failure of the kidneys, sometimes even before a patient reports any symptoms. It is for this reason that standard blood and urine tests routinely check the amount of creatinine in the blood. Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dl) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. (In the metric system, a milligram is a unit of weight equal to one-thousandth of a gram, and a deciliter is a unit of volume equal to one-tenth of a liter.) Muscular young or middle-aged adults may have more creatinine in their blood than the norm for the general population. Elderly persons, on the other hand, may have less creatinine in their blood than the norm. Infants have normal levels of about 0.2 or more, depending on their muscle development. A person with only one kidney may have a normal level of about 1.8 or 1.9. Creatinine levels that reach 2.0 or more in babies and 10.0 or more in adults may indicate the need for a dialysis machine to remove wastes from the blood. Certain drugs can sometimes cause abnormally elevated creatinine levels."
Creatinine blood test,"Creatinine blood test: A test that helps determine whether the kidneys are functioning normally. The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. As the kidneys become impaired for any reason, the creatinine level in the blood will rise due to poor clearance by the kidneys. Abnormally high levels of creatinine thus warn of possible malfunction or failure of the kidneys. It is for this reason that standard blood tests routinely check the amount of creatinine in the blood. A more precise measure of the kidney function can be estimated by calculating how much creatinine is cleared from the body by the kidneys and it is referred to creatinine clearance. ""Creatinine"" is derived from the Greek word ""kreas,"" meaning ""flesh."" The suffix ""-ine"" denotes a chemical substance."
Crepitus,"Crepitus: A clinical sign in medicine that is characterized by a peculiar crackling, crinkly, or grating feeling or sound under the skin, around the lungs, or in the joints. Crepitus in soft tissues is often due to gas, most often air, that has penetrated and infiltrated an area where it should not normally be (for example, in the soft tissues beneath the skin). Crepitus in a joint can indicate cartilage wear in the joint space."
Cretinism,"Cretinism: Congenital hypothyroidism (underactivity of the thyroid gland at birth), which results in growth retardation, developmental delay, and other abnormal features. Cretinism can be due to deficiency of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy."
Crime scene investigation,"Crime scene investigation: The use of physical evidence at the scene of the crime and the use of deductive and inductive reasoning to gain knowledge of the events surrounding the crime. Crime scene investigation is multidisciplinary and involves a systematic search of the crime scene; meticulous observation and documentation of the scene; photography and sketching of the scene; the identification, processing and collection of physical evidence such as fingerprints, footwear impressions, hair, fibers, biological fluids, and materials for DNA analysis; and. perhaps most important, the application of careful reasoning to the facts."
Critical care,"Critical care: The specialized care of patients whose conditions are life-threatening and who require comprehensive care and constant monitoring, usually in intensive care units. Also known as intensive care."
Crocodile tears syndrome,"Crocodile tears syndrome: Spontaneous tearing in parallel with the normal salivation of eating. The crocodile tears syndrome occurs most often following facial paralysis when nerve fibers destined for a salivary gland are damaged and by mistake regrow into a tear gland. Also called Bogorad's syndrome, gustatolacrimal reflex, paroxysmal lacrimation."
Crohn's disease,"Crohn's disease: A chronic inflammatory disease, primarily involving the small and large intestine, but which can affect other parts of the digestive system as well. It is named for Burrill Crohn, the American gastroenterologist who first described the disease in 1932. Crohn disease is usually diagnosed in persons in their teens or twenties, but can come to the fore at any point in life. It can be a chronic, recurrent condition or can cause minimal symptoms with or even without medical treatment. In mild forms, Crohn disease causes small scattered shallow crater- like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. In more serious cases, deeper and larger ulcers can develop, causing scarring and stiffness and possibly narrowing of the bowel, sometimes leading to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs. Crohn disease comes in many forms. Involvement of the large intestine (colon) only is called Crohn colitis or granulomatous colitis, while involvement of the small intestine alone is called Crohn enteritis. The most common part of the small intestine to be affected by Crohn disease is the last portion, called the ileum. Active disease in this area is termed Crohn ileitis. When both the small intestine and the large intestine are involved, the condition is called Crohn enterocolitis (or ileocolitis). Other descriptive terms may be used as well. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss are common symptoms. Crohn disease can be associated with reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Diagnosis is commonly made by x-ray or colonoscopy. Treatment includes medications that are anti-inflammatories, immune suppressors or antibiotics. Surgery can be necessary in severe cases. Genetic factors contribute to the causation of Crohn disease. One of the genes has been shown to be on chromosome 14 in region 14q11-12. "
Cross-section,"Cross-section: In anatomy, a transverse cut through a structure or tissue. The opposite is longitudinal section."
Crotch,"Crotch: A nonmedical term in common usage for the region where the legs come together, the place where the lower limbs divide. The word ""crotch"" is thought to be related to the word ""crutch"" since the first crutches were likely fashioned from the crotch of a tree, the place where its limbs divide."
Crush injury,"Crush injury: An injury that occurs because of pressure from a heavy object onto a body part. A crush injury may also arise from squeezing of a body part between two objects. Depending upon their severity, crush injuries can be complicated by bleeding, bruising, broken bones, open wounds, poor circulation, or breakdown of muscle (rhabdomyolysis)."
Cry for help,"Cry for help: An expression of suicidal intent in the hope of receiving help and being rescued. A cry for help may take many different forms such as a telephone call, a message left on an answering phone, a note left in a conspicuous place, or an e-mail message. It may also be a symbolic gesture such as a superficial cut on the wrist."
Cryophobia,"Cryophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of cold, including cold weather and cold objects. Sufferers from cryophobia experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. To avoid cold, they may live in a warm climate, dress more warmly than necessary, stay indoors on cold days, and avoid cold foods and ice cubes. ""Cryophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""kryos"" (cold, frigid) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Kryos"" has given us English words such as ""cryometer"" (a thermometer for measuring very cold temperatures) and ""cryotherapy"" and ""cryosurgery"" (medical techniques that freeze and destroy diseased tissue). Related term: Thermophobia, fear of heat."
Cryostat,"Cryostat: A chamber that can maintain very low temperatures. Medical laboratories use a cryostat to preserve frozen tissue samples while a microtome, an extremely sharp cutting instrument mounted inside cryostats, slices the tissue into pieces thin enough to be observed under a microscope. The sliced piece must be so thin as to look nearly transparent. A pathologist, a laboratory doctor trained to identify evidence of disease in microscopic structures, then examines the slice to confirm or rule out the presence of a disease, such as cancer. Use of frozen tissue samples enables physicians to examine tissue and diagnose its condition more quickly than if the tissue had been preserved without freezing. Microtomes may be used alone, without cryostats, to yield thin microscopic samples. ""Cryostat"" is derived from the Greek ""kryos"" (cold) and ""statos"" (standing, stationary, like the cryostat chamber). ""Kryos"" gives us many English words, such as ""cryonics"" (use of coldness in medicine to bring about beneficial results) and ""cryosurgery"" (use of below- freezing temperatures to destroy disease). ""Statos"" and related Greek words give us such English words as ""static"" and ""stationary."""
Cryotherapy,"Cryotherapy: Literally, ""cold therapy."" Cryotherapy, sometimes referred to as cryosurgery, is a procedure used to destroy tissue of both benign and malignant lesions by the freezing and re-thawing process. Liquid nitrogen is the most commonly used freezing source for cryotherapy. Examples of the uses of cryotherapy in medicine are the treatment (removal) of various types of skin lesions , the treatment of dysplastic (precancerous) tissue of the uterine cervix, and the treatment of some prostate cancers. Another use of the term cryotherapy refers to the use of ice or cold packs applied to a part of the body after an injury to reduce inflammation."
Crypt,"Crypt: In anatomy, variously a blind alley, a tube with no exit, a depression, or a pit in an otherwise fairly flat surface. For example, the tonsillar crypts are little pitlike depressions in the tonsils."
Crypto,"Crypto: Popular name for both the parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum, and the disease it causes, cryptosporidiosis."
CSF (cerebrospinal fluid),"CSF (cerebrospinal fluid): A watery fluid, continuously produced and absorbed, which flows in the ventricles (cavities) within the brain and around the surface of the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, a series of infolded blood vessels projecting into the cerebral ventricles, and it is absorbed into the venous system. If production exceedes absorption, the CSF pressure rises and the result is hydrocephalus. This can also occur if the CSF pathways are obstructed and CSF accumulates."
CT,"CT: Abbreviation for: 1. Cognitive therapy; and, more often today
2. Computerized tomography, as in CT scan. CT is pronounced as the letters C and T."
CT scan,"CT scan: Computed tomography scan. Detailed images of internal organs are obtained by this type of sophisticated X-ray device. CT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater. The tomograms (""slices"") for CT can be created as thin as one millimeter or less. Images can be displayed in numerous display planes, and can also be displayed as 3-D images. The CT scanner was invented in 1972 by the British engineer Godfrey N. Hounsfield (later Sir Godfrey) and the South African (later American) physicist Alan Cormack. CT scanning was already in general use by 1979, the year Hounsfield and Cormack were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for its development. The CT scan is also known as the CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan."
CTL,CTL: Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte.
CTS,CTS: Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Cubital,"Cubital: 1. Pertaining to the elbow.
2. Pertaining to the forearm and hand.
3. Pertaining to the ulna.
From the Latin cubitum meaning elbow or cubit. The cubit was a unit of length based on the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger."
Cubitus,"Cubitus: 1. The elbow.
2. The forearm and hand.
3. The ulna.
From the Latin cubitus meaning elbow. The adjective is cubital."
Cubitus valgus,"Cubitus valgus: A deformity of the elbow resulting in an increased carrying angle (so that, with the arm extended at the side and the palm facing forward, the forearm and hand are held at greater than 15 degrees). Cubitus valgus can be due to a congenital malformation, as in Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome, or be due to a fracture. Cubitus is the Latin word for elbow and valgus means angled outward."
Cul-de-sac,"Cul-de-sac: In anatomy, a blind pouch or cavity that is closed at one end. The term cul-de-sac is used specifically to refer to the rectouterine pouch (the pouch of Douglas), an extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and back wall of the uterus."
Culdoscopy,"Culdoscopy: The introduction of a viewing tube (called an endoscope or culdoscope) through the end of the vagina into the rectouterine pouch (the pouch of Douglas), an extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and back wall of the uterus."
Culture,"Culture: In microbiology, the propagation of microorganisms in a growth medium. Any body tissue or fluid can be evaluated in the laboratory by using culture techniques to detect and identify infectious processes. Culture techniques can be used to determine sensitivity to antibiotics. Cells may also be grown in culture."
Cure,"Cure: 1. To heal, to make well, to restore to good health. 2. A time without recurrence of a disease so that the risk of recurrence is small.
3. Particularly in the past, a course of treatment. For example, take a cure at a spa. The word cure comes from the Latin cura meaning care, concern or attention."
Curettage,"Curettage: Removal of tissue with a curette from the wall of a cavity or another surface. For example, curettage may be done to remove skin cancer. After a local anesthetic numbs the area, the skin cancer is scooped out with a curette. Curettage may also be done in the uterus; dilation and curettage (D&C) refers to the dilation (widening) of the cervical canal to permit curettage of the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus."
Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome: The constellation of symptoms and signs caused by an excess of cortisol hormone. Cushing syndrome is an extremely complex hormonal condition that involves many areas of the body. Common symptoms are thinning of the skin, weakness, weight gain, bruising, hypertension, diabetes, thin weak bones (osteoporosis), facial puffiness and, in women, cessation of menstrual periods. Ironically, one of the most common causes of Cushing syndrome is the administration of ""cortisol-like medications"" for the treatment of diverse diseases. All other cases of Cushing syndrome are due to the excess production of cortisol by the adrenal gland as, for example, due to: The neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) described excessive production of cortisol by the adrenal gland due specifically to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, a benign pituitary tumor that puts out ACTH (AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone). This drives the adrenal gland to overproduce cortisol."
Cushingoid,"Cushingoid: Having the constellation of symptoms and signs caused by an excess of cortisol hormone: that is, Cushing syndrome. While facial puffiness and weight gain are typical features of a Cushingoid appearance, cushing syndrome is an extremely complex hormonal condition that involves many areas of the body. Common symptoms are thinning of the skin, weakness, weight gain, bruising, hypertension, diabetes, thin weak bones (osteoporosis), facial puffiness and, in women, cessation of menstrual periods. One of the commonest causes of Cushing syndrome is the administration of ""cortisol-like medications"" for the treatment of diverse diseases. All other cases of Cushing syndrome are due to the excess production of cortisol by the adrenal gland as, for example, due to: The neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) described excessive production of cortisol by the adrenal gland due specifically to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, a benign pituitary tumor that puts out ACTH (AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone). This drives the adrenal gland to overproduce cortisol."
Cusp,"Cusp: In reference to heart valves, one of the triangular segments of the valve which opens and closes with the flow of blood. In reference to teeth, a raised area of the biting surface."
Cut,"Cut: An area of severed skin. It is important to wash a cut with soap and water, and keep it clean and dry, but avoid putting alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine into a cut, which can delay healing. Delay in getting medical care can increase the rate of wound infection. If a cut results from a puncture wound through a shoe, there is a high risk of infection. Redness, swelling, increased pain, and pus draining from the wound also indicate an infection that requires professional care."
Cutaneous,Cutaneous: Related to the skin.
Cutis anserina,"Cutis anserina: Better known as goose bumps, a temporary local change in the skin when it becomes rougher due to erection of little muscles, as from cold, fear, or excitement. The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as cold or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of little muscles called the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps. Goose bumps are also referred to as ""gooseflesh."" Another for this familiar phenomenon is ""horripilation."" Medicine has a special term, ""cutis anserina"" for goose bumps. But it goes back to the goose again, since ""cutis"", skin + ""anser"", goose = goose skin. Some biologists believe that goose bumps evolved as part of the fight-or-flight reaction along with heart rate increases that send the heart racing while blood rushes to the muscles to give them additional oxygen. A similar phenomenon, bristling, in fur-covered animals may have made them look larger and more frightening and kept them warmer by increasing the amount of air between hairs which traps body heat."
Cutting for the stone,"Cutting for the stone: The removal of kidney or bladder stones by surgery. The procedure is today called lithotomy. In the first surgical procedure at the Newcastle Infirmary in 1751, cutting for the stone produced a bladder stone from an Edward Lough, who later gave formal thanks."
CVA,CVA: Cerebrovascular accident.
CVC,"CVC: Commonly used abbreviation for a Central Venous Catheter, a catheter (tube) that is passed through a vein to end up in the thoracic (chest) portion of the vena cava (the large vein returning blood to the heart) or in the right atrium of the heart. Central venous catheters have a number of different uses, including the delivery of fluid or medications, monitoring of special blood pressures including the central venous pressure, the pulmonary artery pressure, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and the estimation of cardiac output and vascular resistance. A central venous catheter is also called a central venous line. Sometimes, the ""venous"" is omitted and it is called a central catheter or central line."
CVS,CVS: Chorionic villus sampling.
Cyanide,"Cyanide: Poisoning with cyanide, a rapidly acting, potentially deadly chemical that can exist as a colorless gas, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or cyanogen chloride (CNCl), or a crystal form such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) or potassium cyanide (KCN). Cyanide sometimes is described as having a ""bitter almond"" smell, but it does not always give off an odor, and not everyone can detect this odor. Cyanide is also known by the military designations AN (for hydrogen cyanide) and CK (for cyanogen chloride). Cyanide is naturally present in some foods and in certain plants such as cassava. Cyanide is contained in cigarette smoke and the combustion products of synthetic materials such as plastics. In manufacturing, cyanide is used to make paper, textiles, and plastics. It is present in the chemicals used to develop photographs. Cyanide salts are used in metallurgy for electroplating, metal cleaning, and removing gold from its ore. Cyanide gas is used to exterminate pests and vermin in ships and buildings. If accidentally ingested (swallowed), chemicals found in acetonitrile-based products that are used to remove artificial nails can produce cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide, under the name Zyklon B, was used as a genocidal agent by the Germans in World War II. People may be exposed to cyanide by breathing air, drinking water, eating food, or touching soil that contains cyanide. Cyanide enters water, soil, or air as a result of both natural processes and industrial activities. In air, cyanide is present mainly as gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Smoking cigarettes is probably one of the major sources of cyanide exposure for people who do not work in cyanide-related industries. Poisoning caused by cyanide depends on the amount of cyanide a person is exposed to and the route and duration of exposure. Breathing cyanide gas causes the most harm, but ingesting cyanide can be toxic as well. Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where the gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas evaporates and disperses quickly in open spaces, making it less harmful outdoors. Cyanide prevents the cells of the body from getting oxygen. When this happens, the cells die. Cyanide is more harmful to the heart and brain than to other organs because the heart and brain use a great deal of oxygen. People exposed to a small amount of cyanide by breathing it, absorbing it through their skin, or eating foods that contain it may have some or all of the following symptoms within minutes: rapid breathing, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea and vomiting, and rapid heart rate. Exposure to a large amount of cyanide by any route may cause these other health effects as well: convulsions, low blood pressure (hypotension), slow heart rate (bradycardia), loss of consciousness, lung injury and respiratory failure leading to death. Survivors of serious cyanide poisoning may develop heart and brain damage. To protect oneself against cyanide: Cyanide poisoning is treated with specific antidotes and supportive medical care in a hospital setting. The most important thing is for victims to seek medical treatment as soon as possible."
Cyanosis,"Cyanosis: A bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to insufficient oxygen in the blood. For example, the lips can develop cynanosis when exposed to extreme cold. Cyanosis can be present at birth, as in a 'blue baby,' an infant with a malformation of the heart that permits into the arterial system blood that is not fully oxygenated."
Cyanotic,Cyanotic: Showing cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to not enough oxygen in the blood). See: Cyanosis.
Cyclic citrullinated peptide,Cyclic citrullinated peptide: A circular peptide containing the amino acid citrulline. Abbreviated CCP. Autoantibodies directed against CCP are found in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Cyclooxygenase-2,"Cyclooxygenase-2: Cyclooxygenase-2, an enzyme that acts to speed up the production of certain chemical messengers, called prostaglandins that play a key role in in promoting inflammation. When cox-2 activity is blocked, inflammation is reduced. Unlike cox-1, cox-2 is active only at the site of inflammation, not in the stomach."
Cyclops,"Cyclops: A common freshwater crustacean. Some species of Cyclops serve as hosts for parasites such as the guinea worm, the cause of dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease). The Cyclops were one-eyed giants of Greek mythology, a mythical race of lawless giant shepherds who lived in Sicily. They had a single large round eye in the center of the forehead. The word ""cyclops"" itself comes from the Greek ""kyklos"" (circle) + ""ops"" (eye). Cyclopia is a congenital malformation (birth defect) in which there is only one eye located just above the customary location of the nose."
Cymbalta,"Cymbalta: Brand name for duloxetine hydrochloride, a drug approved by the FDA to treat major depresssion in adults and to manage the pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage in diabetes. The drug acts as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, two neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, believed to be important in regulating a person's emotions as well as reducing the sensitivity to pain."
Cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis: A common grave genetic disease that affects the exocrine glands and is characterized by the production of abnormal secretions, leading to mucus buildup that impairs the pancreas and, secondarily, the intestine. Mucus buildup in lungs can impair respiration. Abbreviated CF. Without treatment, CF results in death for 95 percent of affected children before age 5; however, a few long-lived CF patients have survived past age 60. Early diagnosis is of great importance. Treatment includes physical therapy to loosen the mucus in the lungs and use of pancreatic enzymes and medications to fight dangerous infections of the lungs. One in 400 couples is at risk for having children with CF. CF is a recessive trait, so the chance of an at-risk couple having a child with CF is 25 percent with each pregnancy. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis conductance regulator) gene, which is located on chromosome 7."
Cystitis,"Cystitis: Inflammation of the bladder. Cystitis can be due for example to infection from bacteria that ascend the urethra (the canal from the outside) to the bladder. Symptoms include a frequent need to urinate, often accompanied by a burning sensation. As cystitis progresses, blood may be observed in the urine and the patient may suffer cramps after urination. In young children, attempts to avoid the pain of cystitis can be a cause for daytime wetting (enuresis). Treatment includes avoiding irritants, such as perfumed soaps, near the urethral opening; increased fluid intake; and antibiotics. Untreated cystitis can lead to scarring and the formation of stones when urine is retained for long periods of time to avoid painful urination."
Cystoscopy,Cystoscopy: A procedure in which a lighted optical instrument called a cystoscope is inserted through the urethra to look at the bladder.
Cysts,"Cysts: Cysts are abnormal, closed sac-like structures within a tissue that contain a liquid, gaseous, or semisolid substance. Cysts can occur anywhere in the body and can vary in size. The outer, or capsular, portion of a cyst is termed the cyst wall."
cyte,"cyte: A suffix denoting a cell. Derived from the Greek ""kytos"" meaning ""hollow, as a cell or container."" From the same root come the prefix ""cyto-"" and the combining form ""-cyto"" which similarly denote a cell. Cyto-, -cyto- and -cyte enter into many words and terms used in medicine, including adipocyte, agranulocytosis, cytogenetics, cytokine, cytomegalovirus, cytometry, cytoplasm, cytotoxic, elliptocytosis erythrocyte, granulocyte, histiocyte, leukocyte, lymphocyte, lymphocytosis, macrocyte, megakaryocyte, melanocyte, monocyte, oocyte, pancytopenia, phagocyte, spherocytosis, thrombocyte, and thrombocytopenia."
Cyto-,"Cyto-: Prefix denoting a cell. ""Cyto-"" is derived from the Greek ""kytos"" meaning ""hollow, as a cell or container."" From the same root come the combining form ""-cyto-"" and the suffix ""-cyte"" which similarly denote a cell. Cyto-, -cyto- and -cyte enter into many words and terms used in medicine, including adipocyte, agranulocytosis, cytogenetics, cytokine, cytomegalovirus, cytometry, cytoplasm, cytotoxic, elliptocytosis, erythrocyte, granulocyte, histiocyte, leukocyte, lymphocyte, lymphocytosis, macrocyte, megakaryocyte, melanocyte, monocyte, oocyte, pancytopenia, phagocyte, spherocytosis, thrombocyte, and thrombocytopenia."
Cytology,"Cytology: The medical and scientific study of cells. Cytology refers to a branch of pathology, the medical specialty that deals with making diagnoses of diseases and conditions through the examination of tissue samples from the body. Cytologic examinations may be performed on body fluids (examples are blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) or on material that is aspirated (drawn out via suction into a syringe) from the body. Cytology also can involve examinations of preparations that are scraped or washed (irrigated with a sterile solution) from specific areas of the body. For example, a common example of diagnostic cytology is the evaluation of cervical smears (referred to as the Papanicolaou test or Pap smear). In order for cytologic evaluation to be carried out, the material to be examined is spread onto glass slides and stained. A pathologist then uses a microscope to examine the individual cells in the sample."
Cytomegalovirus (CMV),"Cytomegalovirus (CMV): A virus that infects 50-85% of adults in the US by age 40 and is also the virus most frequently transmitted to a child before birth. Persons with symptoms have a mononucleosis-like syndrome with prolonged fever and mild hepatitis. Once a person becomes infected, the virus remains alive and usually dormant within that person's body for life. Recurrent disease rarely occurs unless the person's immune system is suppressed due to therapeutic drugs or disease. CMV infection is therefore a concern because of the risk of infection to the unborn baby, people who work with children, and immunodeficient people such as transplant recipients and those with HIV. CMV is a member of the herpesvirus group, which also includes herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox) and Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis). These viruses share a characteristic ability to remain dormant within the body over a long period. Initial CMV infection, which may have few symptoms, is always followed by a prolonged, inapparent infection during which the virus resides in cells without causing detectable damage or clinical illness. Severe impairment of the body's immune system by medication or disease consistently reactivates the virus from the latent or dormant state. Infectious CMV may be shed in the bodily fluids of any previously infected person, and thus may be found in urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. The shedding of virus may take place intermittently, without any detectable signs, and without causing symptoms. Spread of CMV is from person to person. Infection requires close contact with a person excreting the virus in their saliva, urine, or other bodily fluids. CMV can be sexually transmitted. It can also be transmitted via breast milk, transplanted organs and, rarely, blood transfusions. Although the virus is not highly contagious, it has been shown to spread in households and among young children in day care centers. Transmission of the virus is often preventable because it is most often transmitted through infected bodily fluids that come in contact with hands and then are absorbed through the nose or mouth of a susceptible person. Therefore, care should be taken when handling children and items like diapers. Simple hand washing with soap and water is effective in removing the virus from the hands. CMV infection without symptoms is common in infants and young children; therefore, it is unjustified and unnecessary to exclude from school or an institution a child known to be infected. Similarly, hospitalized patients do not need separate or elaborate isolation precautions. During pregnancy when a woman becomes infected with CMV, there is a risk that the infant may be born with CMV and have CMV-related complications. On the other hand, infants and children who acquire CMV after birth have few, if any, symptoms or complications. CMV is the most important cause of congenital viral infection in the US. For infants who are infected by their mothers before birth, two potential pictures exist: Most healthy people working with infants and children face no special risk from CMV infection. However, for women of child-bearing age who previously have not been infected with CMV, there is a potential risk to the developing unborn child (the risk is described above in the Pregnancy section). Contact with children who are in day care, where CMV infection is commonly transmitted among young children (particularly toddlers), may be a source of exposure to CMV. Since CMV is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, including urine and saliva, child care providers (meaning day care workers, special education teachers, therapists, as well as mothers) should be educated about the risks of CMV infection and the precautions they can take. Day care workers appear to be at a greater risk than hospital and other health care providers, and this may be due in part to the increased emphasis on personal hygiene in the health care setting. Primary (or the initial) CMV infection in the immunocompromised patient can cause serious disease. However, the more common problem is the reactivation of the dormant virus. Infection with CMV is a major cause of disease and death in immunocompromised patients, including organ transplant recipients, patients undergoing hemodialysis, patients with cancer, patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, and HIV-infected patients. Pneumonia, retinitis (an infection of the eyes), and gastrointestinal disease are the common manifestations of disease. Because of this risk, exposing immunosuppressed patients to outside sources of CMV should be minimized. Whenever possible, patients without CMV infection should be given organs and/or blood products that are free of the virus. Most infections with CMV are not diagnosed because the virus usually produces few, if any, symptoms and tends to reactivate intermittently without symptoms. However, persons who have been infected with CMV develop antibodies to the virus, and these antibodies persist in the body for the lifetime of that individual. A number of laboratory tests that detect these antibodies to CMV have been developed to determine if infection has occurred and are widely available. In addition, the virus can be cultured from specimens obtained from urine, throat swabs, and tissue samples to detect active infection."
Cytoplasm,Cytoplasm: The substance of a cell that lies outside the nucleus.
cytosis,"cytosis: 1. Suffix referring to cells, as in anisocytosis (inequality in the size of red blood cells), elliptocytosis (elliptical red cells), and phagocytosis (ingestion of cells).
2. Suffix connoting an increase in cells, as in leukocytosis (increase in white blood cells) and lymphocytosis (increase in lymphocytes)."
D.O.,"D.O.: Abbreviation for Doctor of Osteopathy, an osteopathic physician. Osteopathy is a system of therapy founded in the 19th century based on the concept that the body can formulate its own remedies against diseases when the body is in a normal structural relationship, has a normal environment and enjoys good nutrition."
Dacryo-,"Dacryo-: A combining form denoting tears, as in dacryocyst (tear sac) and dacryocystorhinostomy (surgery to open up a tear duct). From the Greek dakry meaning ""a tear."""
"Dactyl-, -dactyl","Dactyl-, -dactyl: Prefix or suffix denoting the digits (fingers or toes), as in dactylitis (inflammation of a finger or toe)."
Daily Value,"Daily Value: DV, a term on food labels based on the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) designed to help consumers use food label information to plan a healthy diet. The Daily Value serves as a basis for declaring on the label the percent of the DV for each nutrient that a serving of the food provides. For example, the Daily Value for fat, based on a 2,000-calorie diet, is 65 grams (g). A food that has 13 g of fat per serving would state on the label that the ""percent Daily Value"" for fat is 20 percent. The DV also provides a basis for thresholds that define descriptive words for nutrient content, called descriptors, such as ""high fiber"" and ""low fat."" For example, the descriptor ""high fiber"" can be used if a serving of food provides 20 percent or more of the Daily Value for fiber-- that is, 5 g or more."
Daltonism,"Daltonism: Colorblindness of the red-green type (also known as deuteranopia or deuteranomaly). The term ""Daltonism"" is derived from the name of the chemist and physicist, John Dalton (1766-1844). Dalton was born in a village in Cumberland, England where his father, Joseph, was a weaver in poor circumstances. He was educated by his father and John Fletcher, teacher in a Quaker school. When Fletcher retired in 1778, Dalton took his place. In 1793 he was appointed teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at New College in Manchester. In 1803 he put forth the facts embodied in his law of partial pressures: the pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures which would be exerted separately by the several constituents if each alone were present. Dalton's reputation largely rests upon his great Atomic Theory. It was said of Dalton that ""into society he rarely went, and his only amusement was a game of bowls on Thursday afternoons."" Dalton described his and his brother's affliction of colorblindness with defective perception of red and green in the first scientific paper he published. It was entitled ""Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours, with observation"" (Mem Literary Philos Soc Manchester 5: 28-45, 1798). It is the first recognized account of red-green colorblindness."
DASH diet,"DASH diet: An eating plan designed to lower the blood pressure. DASH is an acronym for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH ""combination diet"" has been shown to decrease the blood pressure and so helps prevent and control high blood pressure. The DASH ""combination diet"" is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods, and low in saturated and total fat. It also is low in cholesterol, high in dietary fiber, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and moderately high in protein. The DASH eating plan is recommended by the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) which states: ""Use the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan as a guide. DASH encourages you to eat more fresh fruits, vegetables and low fat dairy products, and to limit saturated fat and salt. The DASH eating plan can help you lose weight and maintain a healthier body. In fact, according to the report, sticking to the DASH eating plan can be as effective as some medications in lowering your blood pressure."""
daw,Daw: Abbreviation meaning 'dispense as written.'
de Musset sign,"de Musset sign: Rhythmic nodding or bobbing of the head in synchrony with the heart beat, a sign of aortic insufficiency --incompetence of the aortic valve with aortic regurgitation. The causes include syphilitic aortitis, rheumatic fever, and aortic aneurysm. Named after the French Romantic poet and playwright Alfred de Musset (1810-1857)."
DEA,"DEA: The Drug Enforcement Administration of the US Department of Justice, which regulates interstate commerce in prescription drugs to prevent them from being used as drugs of abuse. Every prescription written in the US bears the DEA number of the prescribing physician."
Deafness,"Deafness: Partial or complete hearing loss. Levels of hearing impairment vary from a mild to a total loss of hearing. Elderly adults suffer most often from hearing loss. The most common cause of hearing loss in children is otitis media. A substantial number of hearing impairments are caused by environmental factors such as noise, drugs, and toxins. Deafness can also result from inherited disorders."
Death,"Death: 1. The end of life. The cessation of life. (These common definitions of death ultimately depend upon the definition of life, upon which there is no consensus.) 2. The permanent cessation of all vital bodily functions. (This definition depends upon the definition of ""vital bodily functions."") See: Vital bodily functions. 3. The common law standard for determining death is the cessation of all vital functions, traditionally demonstrated by ""an absence of spontaneous respiratory and cardiac functions."" 4. The uniform determination of death. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1980 formulated the Uniform Determination of Death Act. It states that: ""An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards."" This definition was approved by the American Medical Association in 1980 and by the American Bar Association in 1981."
Debride,"Debride: To remove dead, contaminated, or adherent tissue and/or foreign material. To debride a wound is to remove all materials that may promote infection and impede healing. This may be done by enzymes (as with proteolytic enzymes), mechanical methods (as in a whirlpool), or sharp debridement (using intruments)."
Debridement,"Debridement: The act of debriding (removing dead, contaminated or adherent tissue or foreign material). Debridement encompasses enzymatic debridement (as with proteolytic enzymes), mechanical nonselective debridement (as in a whirlpool), and sharp debridement (by surgery). See: Debride."
Debulk,"Debulk: To remove part of the bulk, usually of a tumor as in surgery to remove as much tumor as possible to increase the likelihood of success with chemotherapy, for example, or dead tissue. Debulking may be done by surgery, irradiation, laser or chemotherapy."
Decompression,"Decompression: 1. In general, the removal of pressure.
2. In surgery, a procedure to remove pressure on a structure, as in decompression of the spinal cord.
3. The lessening of atmospheric pressure on deep-sea divers returning to the surface, or on persons ascending to great heights."
Decongestant,"Decongestant: A drug that shrinks the swollen membranes in the nose, making it easier for a person to breathe. Decongestants can be taken orally or as nasal spray. Decongestant nasal spray should not be used for more than 5 days without a physician's recommendation. Many decongestant nasal sprays cause a worsening of symptoms (a rebound effect) when they are taken for too long and then discontinued. Decongestants should not be used by people who have high blood pressure unless they are under a physician's supervision."
Decubitus,"Decubitus: Lying down. A decubitus ulcer is a bed sore, the consequence of lying or sitting in one position too long. The Latin ""decubitus"" (meaning lying down) is related to ""cubitum"" (the elbow) reflecting the fact the Romans habitually rested on their elbows when they reclined."
Decubitus ulcer,"Decubitus ulcer: A bed sore, a skin ulcer that comes from lying in one position too long so that the circulation in the skin is compromised by the pressure, particularly over a bony prominence such as the sacrum (sacral decubitus). The Latin ""decubitus"" (meaning lying down) is related to ""cubitum"" (the elbow) reflecting the fact the Romans habitually rested on their elbows when they reclined."
Deep,"Deep: In anatomy, away from the surface or further into the body. As opposed to superficial. The bones are deep to the skin. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Deep vein thrombosis,"Deep vein thrombosis: A blood clot within a deep vein, typically in the thigh or leg. The blood clot (thrombus) can break off as an embolus and make its way to the lung, where it can cause lung problems. Abbreviated DVT. Also known as economy-class syndrome."
Defecation syncope,"Defecation syncope: The temporary loss of consciousness (syncope) upon defecating (having a bowel movement). Syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, fainting. The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating (micturition syncope) or defecating, coughing or swallowing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional stress of fear or pain. Under these conditions, people often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before they lose consciousness. Situational syncope is caused by a reflex of the involuntary nervous system called the vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction leads the heart to slow down (bradycardia) and, at the same time, it leads the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels to dilate (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is then deprived of oxygen, and the fainting episode occurs. The vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. And situational syncope is also called vasovagal syncope, vasodepressor syncope, and Gower syndrome after Sir William Richard Gower (1845-1915), a famous English neurologist whose name is also associated with a sign, a solution, another syndrome, and a tract in the central nervous system."
Defibrillation,"Defibrillation: The use of a carefully controlled electric shock, administered either through a device on the exterior of the chest wall or directly to the exposed heart muscle, to normalize the rhythm of the heart or restart it."
"Deficiency, FAO","Deficiency, FAO: Also known as the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, this is a genetic (inherited) disease usually characterized by a triad of clinical findings consisting of ichthyosis (thickened fish-like skin), spastic paraplegia (spasticity of the legs) and mental retardation. The skin changes in the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome are similar to those in congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, a genetic disease that results in fish-like, reddened skin. Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) is a regular feature. Ecchymoses (bruises) are present at birth or soon after in the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. Sweating is normal. The spasticity can also affect the arms as well as the legs, resulting in spastic paraplegia. The mental retardation is significant. Most of the patients never walk. About half the patients have seizures. Eye problems are also part of the syndrome. About half of cases have pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Glistening white dots on the retina are characteristic. People with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome tend to be unusually short. Sjogren in 1956 (and Sjogren and Larsson in 1957) suggested that all Swedes with the syndrome are descended from one ancestor in whom a mutation (a genetic change) occurred about 600 years ago. This mutation is now present in at least 1% of the population in northern Sweden. This phenomenon is called founder effect (because everyone is descended from one ""founder"" within what was once a tiny group of people). The gene for the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome has been found situated on chromosome number 17 (in band 17p11.2). The presence in a person of one copy of the gene (the heterozygous state) is harmless. However, if two gene carriers (heterozygotes) mate, the risk for each of their children is one-quarter to receive both of their Sjorgren-Larsson genes and to have the syndrome. The inheritance of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is thus termed autosomal (non-sexlinked) recessive. The laboratory findings are critically important. There is a deficiency of an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase 10 (FALDH10)in the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. The syndrome is due to a deficit of FALDH10 and the gene for the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome gene is synonymous with the FALDH10 gene. Some clinical improvement has been reported to occur with fat restriction in the diet and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides. Persons of diverse and different ethnic origins are now known with the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. They include not only Swedes but, for example, members of families of other European, Arabic, and native American (AmerIndian) descent. This is evidence for genetic homogeneity (what appears clinically to be one genetic disease is in reality due to a diversity of mutations. All of the mutations causing Sjogren-Larsson syndrome have proved to be changes in the FALDH gene. The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is sometimes called the T. Sjogren syndrome to distinguish it from the sicca syndrome, which was described by Henrick Sjogren, a Swedish ophthalmologist. The Sjogren of the Sjorgren-Larsson syndrome was Torsten Sjogren (1896-1974), professor of psychiatry at the celebrated Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm and a pioneer in modern psychiatry and medical genetics. Tage Larsson was similarly a Swedish physician. The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is known variously as SLS; the ichthyosis, spastic neurologic disorder, and oligophrenia (an old word for mental retardation) syndrome; fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency (FAO deficiency); fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (FALDH deficiency); and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase 10 deficiency (FALDH10 deficiency)."
"Deficiency, iron","Deficiency, iron: An inadequate amount of iron, the most common known form of nutritional disorder in the world. Iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that transports oxygen. Iron deficiency results in anemia. The prevalence of iron deficiency is highest among young children and women of childbearing age (particularly pregnant women). In pregnant women, iron deficiency increases the risk for preterm delivery and delivery of babies with low birth weight. In children, iron deficiency causes developmental delays, behavioral disturbances, failure to thrive, and increased infections. The treatment of iron deficiency anemia includes using iron supplements and iron-containing foods in the diet. Food sources of iron include meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables, and cereals (especially those fortified with iron). However, iron supplements should not be given to children unless a physician recommends them."
"Deficiency, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase","Deficiency, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase: Underactivity of a liver enzyme that is essential to the disposal of bilirubin (the chemical that results from the normal breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells). The deficiency of this enzyme (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) results in a condition called Gilbert's disease in which there are mild elevations of bilirubin pigment in the blood. The elevated bilirubin pigment can sometimes cause mild yellowing (jaundice) of the eyes. People with Gilbert's disease are otherwise entirely normal with no other signs or symptoms and their liver enzymes in blood serum are also entirely normal. There is no need for treatment, and the prognosis (outlook) is excellent. The gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase has been mapped on a non-sex chromosome (chromosome 2). A single dose of the Gilbert version of the gene is enough to produce Gilbert's disease. The condition is said therefore to be an autosomal dominant trait. If someone has Gilbert's disease, the chance of their transmitting the Gilbert gene to each of their children is one-half (50%) and each child who gets the gene gets Gilbert's disease. Gilbert's disease is a frequent finding in people in the U.S. and Europe. The condition is usually detected in the course of routine blood screening. Gilbert's disease is an enzyme abnormality of no health consequence."
Deformation,"Deformation: A change from the normal size or shape of an anatomic structure due to mechanical forces that distort an otherwise normal structure. Deformations occur most often late in pregnancy or during delivery. A twin pregnancy can cause deformations due to crowding of the twins late in pregnancy. A well-known example of a deformation is molding of the head of a baby born by vaginal delivery. There are usually no significant lasting effects of a deformation. The effects are typically temporary. A deformation is different from a malformation in timing and impact. In a malformation, the development of a structure is arrested, delayed, or misdirected early in embryonic life and the effect is permanent."
Degenerative joint disease,"Degenerative joint disease: Also known as osteoarthritis, this type of arthritis is caused by inflammation, breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of the joints. Among the over 100 different types of arthritis conditions, osteoarthritis is the most common, affecting usually the hands, feet, spine, and large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. Also called degenerative arthritis."
Deglutition,"Deglutition: The act of swallowing, particularly of swallowing food. The muscles of deglutition are the muscles employed in the act of swallowing."
DEHP,"DEHP: A softener for polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a plastic polymer used in a wide array of products. Unplasticized PVC is hard and brittle at room temperature. A plasticizer (softener) is typically added to increase the flexibility of the polymer. DEHP is the plasticizer for most PVC medical devices. Devices that may contain DEHP-plasticized PVC include: intravenous (IV) bags and tubing, umbilical artery catheters, blood bags and infusion tubing, enteral nutrition feeding bags, nasogastric tubes, peritoneal dialysis bags and tubing, tubing used in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures, tubing used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and tubing used during hemodialysis. Everyone is exposed to small levels of DEHP in everyday life. However, some individuals can be exposed to high levels of DEHP through certain medical procedures. DEHP can leach out of plastic medical devices into solutions that come in contact with the plastic. The amount of DEHP that will leach out depends on the temperature, the lipid content of the liquid, and the duration of contact with the plastic. Seriously ill individuals often require more than one of these procedures, thus exposing them to even higher levels of DEHP. Exposure to DEHP has produced a range of adverse effects in laboratory animals. Of greatest concern are the effects on the development of the male reproductive system and the production of normal sperm in young animals. DEHP is the abbreviation for di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate."
Dehydration,"Dehydration: Excessive loss of body water. Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that cause vomiting or diarrhea may lead to dehydration. There are a number of other causes of dehydration including heat exposure, prolonged vigorous exercise, kidney disease, and medications that cause voiding (diuretics). One clue to dehydration is a rapid drop in weight. A loss of over 10% (15 pounds in a person weighing 150 pounds) is considered severe. Symptoms and signs of dehydration include increasing thirst, dry mouth, weakness or lightheadedness (particularly if worse on standing), and a darkening of the urine or a decrease in urination. Severe dehydration can lead to changes in the body's chemistry and kidney failure which may be life-threatening. Dehydration due to diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death) in children. The young child has a more rapid turnover of body fluids than an adult. In rehydrating a child, there is less margin for error than for an adult. The younger the child, the more careful the rehydration must be. Cases that demand particular attention to detail are those in which organ function (especially skin, heart, brain, or kidney) is critically compromised. Overhydration may be as serious as severe dehydration in children and rehydration should therefore be done under medical supervision. The best way to treat dehydration is to prevent it from occurring. If one suspects excessive fluid loss, notify a physician. Intravenous or oral fluid replacement may be needed."
Dehydroepiandrosterone,"Dehydroepiandrosterone: Also DHEA; a steroid hormone made by the adrenal glands, that acts on the body much like testosterone and is converted into testosterone and estrogen. The blood levels of DHEA decline with age. DHEA is sold in the US without a prescription as a 'nutritional supplement.' It has been claimed to improve mood, boost the immune system, sharpen memory, and combat aging."
Deja vu,"Deja vu: (In French, dejà vu means ""already seen."" and the word dejà has an acute accent on the e and a grave accent on the à but we have omitted the accents from the entry term for the sake of the English-speaking search engine.) Dejà vu is a disquieting feeling of having been somewhere or done something before, even though one has not. Although most people have experienced this feeling at some time or another, in certain people such sensations of deja vu are part of a seizure or migraine aura; while in others they are the seizure phenomenon itself. See also Jamais vu."
Delirium,"Delirium: A sudden state of severe confusion and rapid changes in brain function, sometimes associated with hallucinations and hyperactivity, during which the patient is inaccessible to normal contact. Delirium can be due to a number of conditions, including infection, drug toxicity or withdrawal, seizures, brain tumor, poisoning, head injury, and metabolic disturbances."
Delirium tremens,"Delirium tremens: A central nervous system symptom of alcohol withdrawal that is seen in chronic alcoholism. Symptoms include uncontrollable trembling, hallucinations, severe anxiety, sweating, and sudden feelings of terror. Abbreviated DTs. DTs can be both frightening and, in severe cases, deadly. Treatment includes observation, comfort care, and in some cases medication."
Deltoid,"Deltoid: The muscle, roughly triangular in shape, that stretches from the collarbone (clavicle) over the shoulder to the upper bone of the arm (humerus). It contracts to move the arm up from the side."
Delusion,"Delusion: A false personal belief that is not subject to reason or contradictory evidence and is not explained by a person's usual cultural and religious concepts (so that, for example, it is not an article of faith). A delusion may be firmly maintained in the face of incontrovertible evidence that it is false. Delusions are a frequent feature of schizophrenia."
Demarcation,"Demarcation: A setting of limits; a boundary; marking the limits of, delimiting; setting apart, separating. The word ""demarcation"" is used in medicine mainly in the sense of determining and marking off boundaries. For example, the surface demarcation in respect to damaged tissue can refer to the boundary between the living tissue and the necrotic (dead) tissue. ""Demarcation"" descends from the Italian verb ""marcare"" (to mark). It gave rise to the Spanish ""marcar"" (to mark) from which came ""demarcar"" (to fix the boundary of). In 1493, a Spanish noun, ""demarcacion,"" was used to name the then-new meridian dividing the Spanish Indies from the Portuguese Indies. About 1730 English speakers began calling this boundary the ""line of demarcation"" and, in time, that came to apply to other boundaries."
Dementia,"Dementia: Significant loss of intellectual abilities, such as memory capacity, that is severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning. Criteria for the diagnosis of dementia include impairment of attention, orientation, memory, judgment, language, motor and spatial skills, and function. By definition, dementia is not due to major depression or schizophrenia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Other causes include AIDS, alcoholism, brain injury, vascular dementia (damage to the blood vessels leading to the brain), dementia with Lewy bodies, brain tumors, drug toxicity, infection of brain, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, meningitis, Pick disease, syphilis, and hypothyroidism."
Demonophobia,"Demonophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of evil supernatural beings in persons who believe such beings exist and roam freely to cause harm. Those who suffer from this phobia realize their fear is excessive or irrational. Nevertheless, they become unduly anxious when discussing demons, when venturing alone into woods or a dark house, or when watching films about demonic possession and exorcism. ""Demonophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""daimon"" (deity, evil spirit) and ""phobos"" (fear). This same Greek word gives us the English word ""demonize,"" a verb widely used today to brand a person, such as a political opponent, as unfit or untrustworthy."
Demulcent,"Demulcent: An agent that forms a soothing, protective film when administered onto a mucous membrane surface. For example, mucilage and oils are demulcents that can relieve irritation of the bowel lining."
Denervation,"Denervation: Loss of nerve supply. Causes of denervation include disease, chemical toxicity, physical injury, or intentional surgical interruption of a nerve."
Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF),"Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF): A syndrome due to the dengue virus that tends to affect children under 10, causing abdominal pain, hemorrhage (bleeding) and circulatory collapse (shock). DHF starts abruptly with high continuous fever and headache plus respiratory and intestinal symptoms with sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Shock occurs after 2 to 6 days with sudden collapse, cool clammy extremities, weak thready pulse, and blueness around the mouth (circumoral cyanosis). There is bleeding with easy bruising, blood spots in the skin (petechiae), spitting up blood (hematemesis), blood in the stool (melena), bleeding gums and nosebleeds (epistaxis). Pneumonia and heart inflammation (myocarditis) may be present. The mortality is appreciable ranging from 6 to 30%. Most deaths occur in children. Infants under a year of age are especially at risk of death. DHF is also called Philippine, Thai, or Southeast Asian hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome."

Infants under a year of age are especially at risk of death. It is also called Philippine or Southeast Asian hemorrhagic fever."
Dental braces (orthodontics),"Dental braces (orthodontics): Dental braces (orthodontics):?The use of devices to move teeth or adjust underlying bone. Teeth can be moved by removable appliances or by fixed braces. Crowding of teeth can require extraction of teeth. Retainers may be necessary long after dental braces are placed, especially with orthodontic treatment of adults."
Dental pain (toothache),Dental pain (toothache): The most common cause of a toothache is a dental cavity. The second most common is gum disease. Toothache can be caused by a problem that does not originate from a tooth or the jaw.
Denver Developmental Screening Test,"Denver Developmental Screening Test: The Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) is a widely used assessment for examining children 0-6 years of age as to their developmental progress. The name ""Denver"" reflects the fact that this screening test was created at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver. There are a number of other behavioral assessments for infants and young children. These include: The purposes of developmental assessment depend on the age of the child. For a newborn, testing can detect neurologic problems, such as cerebral palsy. For an infant, testing often serves to reassure parents or to identify the nature of problems early enough hopefully to treat them. Later in childhood, testing can help delineate academic and social problems, again, hopefully in time to remedy them."
Deoxyhemoglobin,"Deoxyhemoglobin: The form of hemoglobin without oxygen, the predominant protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin forms an unstable, reversible bond with oxygen. In its oxygen-loaded form it is oxyhemoglobin and is bright red. In the oxygen-unloaded form it is called deoxyhemoglobin and is purple-blue."
Health and Human Services,"Department of Health and Human Services: The United States government's principal agency for ""protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves."" Also known as DHHS and HHS. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has two types of operating divisions: the Human Services and the Public Health Service Operating Divisions. The Public Health Service Operating Divisions include the:"
Depigmentation,"Depigmentation: Loss of color (pigment) from the skin, mucous membranes, hair, or retina of the eye. The color of the skin, mucous membranes, hair, and retina is due to the deposition of melanin, which is a coloring matter. Melanin is produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. Other terms pertaining to pigment include pigmentation (the presence of pigment), hypopigmentation and underpigmentation (too little pigment), and hyperpigmentation (too much pigment)."
Depression,"Depression: An illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts and that affects the way a person eats, sleeps, feels about himself or herself, and thinks about things. Depression is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be wished away. People with depression cannot merely 'pull themselves together' and get better. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people with depression. The signs and symptoms of depression include loss of interest in activities that were once interesting or enjoyable, including sex; loss of appetite, with weight loss, or overeating, with weight gain; loss of emotional expression (flat affect); a persistently sad, anxious, or empty mood; feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness; social withdrawal; unusual fatigue, low energy level, a feeling of being slowed down; sleep disturbance and insomnia, early-morning awakening or oversleeping; trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; unusual restlessness or irritability; persistent physical problems such as headaches, digestive disorders, or chronic pain that do not respond to treatment, and thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts. The principal types of depression are called major depression, dysthymia, and bipolar disease (manic-depressive disease)."
Dermal,Dermal: Pertaining to the skin. From the Greek word derma for skin.
Dermatitis,"Dermatitis: Inflammation of the skin, either due to an inherent skin defect, direct contact with an irritating substance, or to an allergic reaction. Symptoms of dermatitis include redness, itching, and in some cases blistering. Eczema can be particularly severe and difficult to treat once it is established. Treatment is two-fold. People who suffer from dermatitis must identify and avoid substances that cause attacks. During attacks they may use topical treatments, such as steroid creams."
Dermatitis herpetiformis,"Dermatitis herpetiformis: an autoimmune condition that results in a chronic, itchy skin rash. Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by bumps and blisters occurring primarily on the forearms, knees, elbows, buttocks, back, or scalp. Most people with the condition also have gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease). It is most common in people of Northern European ancestry. The exact cause of dermatitis herpetiformis is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the gluten sensitivity. Treatment is usually effective and consists of a gluten-free diet along with the medication dapsone."
Dermatologic,Dermatologic: Having to do with skin.
Dermatology,"Dermatology: 1. The branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the skin, hair, nails, oral cavity and genitals. 2. Sometimes also, cosmetic care and enhancement.
Dermatology is literally the study of the skin."
Dermatosis,"Dermatosis: a disease or abnormal condition of the skin. The term is often used to refer to diseases that do not feature inflammation, because inflammation of the skin is referred to as dermatitis."
the ovary,"Dermoid cyst of the ovary : A bizarre tumor, usually benign, in the ovary that typically contains a diversity of tissues including hair, teeth, bone, thyroid, etc. A dermoid cyst develops from a totipotential germ cell (a primary oocyte) that is retained within the egg sac (ovary). Being totipotential, that cell can give rise to all orders of cells necessary to form mature tissues and often recognizable structures such as hair, bone and sebaceous (oily) material, neural tissue and teeth. Dermoid cysts may occur at any age but the prime age of detection is in the childbearing years. The average age is 30. Up to 15% of women with ovarian teratomas have them in both ovaries. Dermoid cysts can range in size from a centimeter (less than a half inch) up to 45 cm (about 17 inches) in diameter. These cysts can cause the ovary to twist (torsion) and imperil its blood supply. The larger the dermoid cyst, the greater the risk of rupture with spillage of the greasy contents which can create problems with adhesions, pain etc. Although the large majority (about 98%) of these tumors are benign, the remaining fraction (about 2%) becomes cancerous (malignant). Removal of the dermoid cyst is usually the treatment of choice. This can be done by laparotomy (open surgery) or laparoscopy (with a scope). Torsion (twisting) of the ovary by the cyst is an emergency and calls for urgent surgery. Dermoid cysts of the ovary are also referred to as simply dermoids or ovarian teratomas."
DES,"DES: Diethylstilbestrol, the earliest synthetic (man-made) form of a hormone in the estrogen class. Diethylstilbestrol was once widely prescribed to prevent miscarriages and premature births. Its usage was standard practice in the 1950s and 1960s. Millions of women received the drug. Girls whose mothers were given Diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy (""DES daughters"") were discovered to be at increased risk for being born with malformations of the reproductive organs and later faced elevated rates of infertility and miscarriages themselves. Diethylstilbestrol daughters were also found to be at increased risk for cancer of the cervix and vagina, specifically for developing clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix, a relatively uncommon type of cancer, at an early age. In 2000, diethylstilbestrol daughters were reported to be 3-5 times more likely to have the more common forms of cervical cancer than women whose mothers did not take DES. Diethylstilbestrol sons are predisposed to testicular abnormalities (i.e.. small testes) and failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum, which increases the risk of testicular cancer. All women and men who believe they may have been exposed to diethylstilbestrol before birth should inform their doctor of their exposure so that they may be appropriately examined and monitored. Diethylstilbestrol is still available for prescription in the US. According to the package insert, DES ""is indicated for the treatment of"" (and we quote):"
Desiccate,"Desiccate: To remove the moisture from a thing that normally contains moisture, such as a plant; to dry out completely; to preserve by drying. The process of desiccating a thing is called desiccation; an agent used to bring about desiccation is called a desiccant or a desiccator. Manufacturers of dietary supplements and medicines desiccate some products to extend their shelf life and to maintain purity. (Moisture promotes spoilage and the growth of germs.) For example, desiccated beef liver is a dietary supplement marketed in the form of powders and tablets. Synthetic desiccated thyroid hormone is a medicine marketed in the form of pills to treat thyroid conditions such as myxedema, which can cause drowsiness, tissue swelling, tongue enlargement and other symptoms because of insufficient hormone output by the thyroid gland. Many over-the-counter (OTC) dietary products termed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as ""inert glandular preparations"" consist of desiccated animal organs, including brains, hearts, kidneys, ovaries, placentas, spleens and stomachs. FDA policy dictates that these desiccated products should not be represented as drugs or medications. ""Desiccate,"" ""desiccation,"" and ""desiccant"" are all derived from the Latin word ""desiccare"" (to dry completely)."
Designer steroid,"Designer steroid: A synthetic steroid derived by simple chemical modification from another steroid, usually an anabolic steroid. Anabolic steroids, which build muscle mass, can have serious long-term health consequences in men, women, and children."
Desmoplastic,"Desmoplastic: This term refers to the growth of fibrous or connective tissue. Some tumors elicit a desmoplastic reaction, the pervasive growth of dense fibrous tissue around the tumor. Scar tissue (adhesion) within the abdomen after abdominal surgery is another type of desmoplastic reaction. ""Desmo-"" comes from the Greek ""desmos"" meaning ""a fetter or band"" and ""-plastic"" is also borrowed from the Greek, from ""plassein"" meaning ""to form"" = to form a band or fetter."
Desmoplastic reaction,Desmoplastic reaction: A reaction that is associated with some tumors and is characterized by the pervasive growth of dense fibrous tissue around the tumor. The formation of scar tissue (adhesion) within the abdomen after abdominal surgery is another type of desmoplastic reaction.
Desquamation,"Desquamation: The shedding of the outer layers of the skin. For example, when the rash of measles fades, desquamation occurs."
Development,"Development: The process of growth and differentiation. The most important stage of human development occurs before birth, as tissues and organs arise from differentiation of cells in the embryo. This process continues until birth, and interruptions in development result in the most serious types of birth defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. The developmental process continues after birth, as an infant or child grows physically, develops basic brain-based abilities such as speech and hand'eye coordination, and learns. Interruptions in any of these processes can result in developmental delay."
Developmental disorder,"Developmental disorder: One of several disorders that interrupt normal development in childhood. They may affect a single area of development (specific developmental disorders) or several (pervasive developmental disorders). With early intervention, most specific developmental disorders can be accommodated and overcome. Early intervention is absolutely essential for pervasive developmental disorders, many of which will respond to an aggressive approach that may combine speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, behavior modification techniques, play therapy, and in some cases medication. See also autism, developmental dyspraxia, dyslexia."
Dextro-,"Dextro-: Prefix from the Latin word dexter, meaning 'on the right side.' For example, a molecule that shows dextrorotation is turning or twisting to the right. The opposite of levo-."
Dextromethorphan,"Dextromethorphan: An oral cough suppressant available in the US without a prescription but which is sometimes abused as a recreational drug. Dextromethorphan (DXM) is chemically related to codeine and acts on the brain to suppress cough, but it does not have the pain relieving and addictive properties of codeine. DXM is an ingredient in more than 125 nonprescription cough and cold medications, including forms of Robitussin, Coricidin and Vicks. Cough and cold medications containing DXM are popular among teenagers and young adults looking for a high. Overdoses with DXM doubled from 2000 to 2003 in the US. DXM is safe in the 15- to 30-milligram doses recommended for treating coughs or colds. But in large doses (eg 100 milligrams or more), DXM can cause hallucinations and feelings of unreality. The signs of DXM abuse include confusion, impaired judgment, blurred vision, dizziness, paranoia, excessive sweating, slurred speech, seizures, fever, and nausea and vomiting. In some cases, overdoses and deaths have occurred when caregivers have given cough or cold medications containing DXM to very small children in inappropriate large doses. DXM products are known in the street as Skittles, Red Devils, Robo (from Robitussin) or Triple C's. The high that dextromethorphan produces is called ""robotripping"" or ""skittling."""
the heart,"Dextroposition of the heart: The heart is displaced to the right (from its usual location in the left chest). There is no anatomic alteration in the heart itself, just in its location. Dextroposition occurs when the contents of the left side of the chest shove the heart to the right or when the contents of the right chest are reduced (for example, by collapse of the right lung) and the heart moves toward the sparsely occupied space on the right."
Dextrose,"Dextrose: Glucose, a simple sugar."
DHA,"DHA: 1. Docosahexaenoic acid, an essential fatty acid, thought to be important to the development of infants, particularly as regards their eyes and brain. DHA is present in breast milk and has been added to some infant formulas. Postnatal DHA may improve vision and some cognitive functions in infants and toddlers. DHA is an omega-3, polyunsaturated, 22-carbon fatty acid. It is present in abundance in certain fish (such as tuna and bluefish) and marine animal oils.
2. Dihydroxyacetone, the active ingredient in sunless or self-tanning lotions. DHA is a colorless sugar that darkens the skin by staining. It interacts with the dead surface cells found in the epidermis, or the outermost layer of the skin, producing a color change. As the dead skin cells are naturally sloughed off, the color gradually fades, typically within 5 to 7 days of application. People using DHA should be protected from exposure to the entire area of the eyes, the lips and all parts of the body covered by mucous membrane, and from internal exposure caused by inhaling or ingesting the product."
DHEA,DHEA: Dehydroepiandrosterone.
DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever),"DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever): A syndrome due to the dengue virus that tends to affect children under 10, causing abdominal pain, hemorrhage (bleeding) and circulatory collapse (shock). DHF starts abruptly with high continuous fever and headache plus respiratory and intestinal symptoms with sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Shock occurs after 2 to 6 days with sudden collapse, cool clammy extremities, weak thready pulse, and blueness around the mouth (circumoral cyanosis). There is bleeding with easy bruising, blood spots in the skin (petechiae), spitting up blood (hematemesis), blood in the stool (melena), bleeding gums and nosebleeds (epistaxis). Pneumonia and heart inflammation (myocarditis) may be present. The mortality is appreciable ranging from 6 to 30%. Most deaths occur in children. Infants under a year of age are especially at risk of death. DHF is also called Philippine, Thai, or Southeast Asian hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome."
DHHS,DHHS: Acronym for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Also known as HHS. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has two types of operating divisions: the Human Services and the Public Health Service Operating Divisions. The Public Health Service Operating Divisions include the:
Di-,"Di-: Prefix taken directly from the Greek meaning twice or double or twofold, as in diacid, diamelia (absence of two limbs), diandry (double male genetic contribution) and digyny (double female genetic contribution); the drugs diazepam, dicyclomine (Bentyl), and diethylstilbestrol (DES); etc. Di- should not be confused with the prefix dia- which has a wholly different meaning."
Dia-,"Dia-: Prefix meaning through, throughout, or completely, as in diachronic (over a period of time), diagnosis (to completely define the nature of a disease), and dialysis (cleansing the blood by passing it through a special machine)."
Diabetes,"Diabetes: Usually refers to diabetes mellitus or, less often, to diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus share the name ""diabetes"" because they are both conditions characterized by excessive urination (polyuria). The word ""diabetes"" is from the Greek word meaning ""a siphon"" because people with diabetes ""passed water like a siphon."" When ""diabetes"" is used alone, it refers to diabetes mellitus. The two main types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-requiring type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes -- are distinct and different diseases in themselves."
Diabetes mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus: More commonly referred to as ""diabetes"" -- a chronic disease associated with abnormally high levels of the sugar glucose in the blood. Diabetes is due to one of two mechanisms: The two main types of diabetes correspond to these two mechanisms and are called insulin dependent (type 1) and non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. In type 1 diabetes there is no insulin or not enough of it. In type 2 diabetes, there is generally enough insulin but the cells upon which it should act are not normally sensitive to its action. The signs and symptoms of both types of diabetes include increased urine output and decreased appetite as well as fatigue. Diabetes is diagnosed by blood glucose testing, the glucose tolerance test, and testing of the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (glycohemoglobin or hemoglobin A1C). The mode of treatment depends on the type of the diabetes. The major complications of diabetes include dangerously elevated blood sugar, abnormally low blood sugar due to diabetes medications, and disease of the blood vessels which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart."
Diagnosis,"Diagnosis: 1 The nature of a disease; the identification of an illness. 2 A conclusion or decision reached by diagnosis. The diagnosis is rabies. 3 The identification of any problem. The diagnosis was a plugged IV. The word diagnosis comes directly from the Greek, but the meaning has been changed. To the Greeks a diagnosis meant specifically a ""discrimination, a distinguishing, or a discerning between two possibilities."" Today, in medicine that corresponds more closely to a differential diagnosis."
Dialysis,Dialysis: The process of removing waste products and excess fluid from the body. Dialysis is necessary when the kidneys are not able to adequately filter the blood. Dialysis allows patients with kidney failure a chance to live productive lives. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Each type of dialysis has advantages and disadvantages. Patients can usually choose the type of long term dialysis that best matches their needs.
Dialysis machine,"Dialysis machine: A machine used in dialysis that filters a patient's blood to remove excess water and waste products when the kidneys are damaged,
dysfunctional, or missing. The dialysis machine itself can be thought of as an artificial kidney. Inside, it consists of more plastic tubing that carries the removed blood to the dialyser, a bundle of hollow fibers that forms a semipermeable membrane for filtering out impurities. In the dialyser, blood is diffused with a saline solution called dialysate, and the dialysate is in turn diffused with blood. When the filtration process is complete, the cleansed blood is returned to the patient. Most patients who undergo dialysis because of kidney impairment or failure use a dialysis machine at a dialysis clinic. Also, a machine called a peritoneal dialysis machine can be used chronically at home for dialysis, which eliminates the need for regular hemodialysis clinic treatments. Using this machine during the day and frequently during sleep, the patient can control his/her own dialysis."
Diaphragm (muscle),"Diaphragm (muscle): The muscle that separates the chest (thoracic) cavity from the abdomen. The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration. Contraction of the diaphragm muscle expands the lungs during inspiration when one is breathing air in. We rely heavily on the diaphragm for our respiratory function so that when the diaphragm is impaired, it can compromise our breathing. The nerve that controls the diaphragm is the phrenic nerve, which originates at vertebral level C3-C5. During development the diaphragm moves down and drags the phrenic nerve with it."
Diarrhea,"Diarrhea: A common condition that involves unusually frequent and liquid bowel movements. The opposite of constipation. There are many infectious and noninfectious causes of diarrhea. Persistent diarrhea is both uncomfortable and dangerous to the health because it can indicate an underlying infection and may mean that the body is not able to absorb some nutrients due to a problem in the bowels. Treatment includes drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and taking over-the-counter remedies. People with diarrhea that persists for more than a couple days, particularly small children or elderly people, should seek medical attention."
Diastole,"Diastole: The time period when the heart is in a state of relaxation and dilatation (expansion). The final letter in ""diastole"" is pronounced as a long ""e"" as in ""lee."" The adjective for diastole is diastolic. The diastolic pressure is specifically the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilatation of the ventricles of the heart. Diastole is the time when the ventricles fill with blood. In a blood pressure reading, the diastolic pressure is typically the second number recorded. For example, with a blood pressure of 120/80 (""120 over 80""), the diastolic pressure is 80. By ""80"" is meant 80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). A diastolic murmur is a heart murmur heard during diastole, the time the heart relaxes. ""Diastole"" came without change from the Greek diastole meaning ""a drawing apart."" The term has been in use since the 16th century to denote the period of relaxation of the heart muscle."
Diastolic,"Diastolic: Referring to the time when the heart is in a period of relaxation and dilatation (expansion). The noun for diastolic is diastole. (The final letter in ""diastole"" is pronounced as a long ""e"" as in ""lee."") The diastolic pressure is specifically the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilatation of the ventricles of the heart when the ventricles fill with blood. In a blood pressure reading, the diastolic pressure is typically the second number recorded. For example, with a blood pressure of 120/80 (""120 over 80""), the diastolic pressure is 80. By ""80"" is meant 80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). A diastolic murmur is a heart murmur heard during diastole, the time the heart relaxes. ""Diastolic"" came from the Greek diastole meaning ""a drawing apart."" The term has been in use since the 16th century to denote the period of relaxation of the heart muscle."
Diathesis,"Diathesis: An elegant term for a predisposition or tendency. For example, hemorrhagic diathesis means a tendency to bleed."
Diff dx,"Diff dx: Abbreviation for differential diagnosis, the process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases to account for a patient's condition. Dx is the medical abbreviation for diagnosis."
Differential diagnosis,"Differential diagnosis: The process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases possibly accounting for a patient's illness. The differential diagnosis of rhinitis (a runny nose) includes allergic rhinitis (hayfever), the abuse of nasal decongestants and, of course, the common cold."
Differentiated cancer,Differentiated cancer: A cancer in which the cells are mature and look like cells in the tissue from it arose. Differentiated cancers tend to be decidedly less aggressive than undifferentiated cancers composed of immature cells.
Differentiation,"Differentiation: 1 The process by which cells become progressively more specialized; a normal process through which cells mature. This process of specialization for the cell comes at the expense of its breadth of potential. Stem cells can, for example, differentiate into secretory cells in the intestine. 2 In cancer, differentiation refers to how mature (developed) the cancer cells are in a tumor. Differentiated tumor cells resemble normal cells and tend to grow and spread at a slower rate than undifferentiated or poorly differentiated tumor cells, which lack the structure and function of normal cells and grow uncontrollably."
Difficult urination,Difficult urination: See: Dysuria.
Digestive system,"Digestive system: The system of organs responsible for getting food into and out of the body and for making use of food to keep the body healthy. The digestive system includes the salivary glands, mouth, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine, colon, and rectum. The digestive system's organs are joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. Inside this tube is a lining called the mucosa. In the mouth, stomach, and small intestine, the mucosa contains tiny glands that produce juices to help digest food. Two solid organs, the liver and the pancreas (both of which are embryologically derived from the digestive tract), produce digestive juices that reach the intestine through small tubes known as ducts. In addition, parts of other organ systems (for instance, nerves and blood) play a major role in the digestive system."
Digit,Digit: A finger or toe.
Dihydrotestosterone,Dihydrotestosterone: A byproduct of the male hormone testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is considered to be the essential androgenic hormone. DHT is responsible for the formation of male primary sex characteristics during embryonic life. It is responsible for the development of most secondary sex characteristics in males at puberty. And it continues to be important to male sexual function throughout adult life. A semisynthetic analog of DHT is called stanolone.
Dilate,Dilate: To stretch or enlarge. Also known as dilatate.
Dilated cardiomyopathy,"Dilated cardiomyopathy: A disorder in which the chambers of the heart are dilated (enlarged) because the heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump effectively. There are many causes, the most common being myocardial ischemia (not enough oxygen supplied to the heart muscle) due to coronary artery disease."
Dilation,"Dilation: The process of enlargement, stretching, or expansion. The word ""dilatation"" means the same thing. Both come from the Latin ""dilatare"" meaning ""to enlarge or expand."""
Dioscorides,"Dioscorides: Dioscorides of Anazarbus. First century Greek physician, botanist and pharmacologist whose encyclopedia of materia medica was used for centuries after his death. Born in southeast Asia Minor in the Roman Empire in the first few decades C.E. During his lifetime, Dioscorides traveled extensively seeking medicinal substances from all over the Roman and Greek world. He benefited greatly from the ease of travel across wide stretches of territory under the control of the Roman Empire at the height of its growth. Between about 50-70 C.E., Dioscorides wrote his fundamental work, known in Latin as ""De materia medica."" This five book study focused upon ""the preparation, properties, and testing of drugs"" and became the most central pharmacological work in Europe and the Middle East for the next sixteen centuries. As was the case with many Greek medical texts, De materia medica was treated as dogma for many years. By the mid-16th century, however, his message that investigation and experimentation were crucial to pharmacology began to emerge and modern research into medicines began."
Diphallia,Diphallia: an extremely rare congenital abnormality (birth defect) in which a male infant is born with duplication of the penis. This condition is estimated to occur in only one out of every 5 to 6 million live births. Diphallia is often associated with other abnormalities including gastrointestinal problems and other genitourinary abnormalities. The anatomical abnormality is often referred to as diphallus.
Diphtheria,"Diphtheria: An acute infectious upper respiratory tract disease that affects the throat. It is caused by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Symptoms include sore throat and mild fever at first. As the disease progresses, a membranous substance forms in the throat that makes it difficult to breathe and swallow. Diphtheria can be deadly. It is one of the diseases that the DT (diphtheria-tetanus), DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), and DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis) vaccines are designed to prevent."
Diplopia,Diplopia: A condition in which a single object appears as two objects. Also known as double vision.
Dipper,Dipper: A person in whom there is the normal nocturnal fall (dip) in blood pressure. The opposite of a dipper is a nondipper.
Diprosopus,"Diprosopus: Two-faced conjoined twins (incompletely separated identical twins). The twins have almost complete fusion of their bodies with one set of limbs. Part or all of the face is duplicated. The condition usually results in stillbirth. The ancient two-faced Mexican figurines known as the ""pretty ladies of Tlatilco"" are now thought to represent diprosopus. It is believed these early Mesoamerican figurines may, in fact, be ""the oldest scientifically medical images in world history."" Sculpted over a period of 500 years beginning in 1200 BC, these little statues show diprosopus with two faces side by side. This degree of accuracy in documenting the anatomical and pathological features of a human head does not appear for another two millennia until the 16th-century studies of Hans Baldung Grien and Andreas Vesalius who did anatomical drawings based on dissected cadavers. The term ""diprosopus"" comes from the Greek ""di-,"" two + ""prosopon,"" face = two-faced."
Dipsophobia,"Dipsophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of drinking alcohol. Sufferers of dipsophobia experience undue anxiety about addiction to alcohol and the effect this addiction can have on their body. (However, their abstinence from alcohol certainly should not be criticized.) ""Dipsophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""dipsa"" (thirst) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Dipsa"" is also used to form the words ""dipsomania"" (an abnormal craving for alcohol) and ""dipsosis"" (a medical condition characterized by abnormal thirst)."
Dipsosis,"Dipsosis: Excessive thirst; overwhelming desire for water or another liquid. Dipsosis may occur when the amount of water in the body falls below normal. Any activity that causes perspiration can deplete the body's water supply and trigger dipsosis. So can fever, anxiety, sunburn and heat exhaustion. Other causes of water loss and dipsosis include the following: Diabetes: In diabetes, excessive levels of glucose, a type of sugar, build up in the blood. When the body disposes of some of the excess glucose through urination, the extra glucose in the urine acts as what is called an osmotic diuretic and requires more water to be added to the urine. Considerable water loss occurs. The person then becomes very thirsty. Vomiting and diarrhea: Both vomiting and diarrhea deplete the body of water holus-bolus. Illnesses that cause vomiting and diarrhea require treatment that replenishes the body's water orally (by mouth) or intravenously (IV). Rehydration also should include other substances that have been lost. For example, if sodium has been depleted, there needs to be some salt in the fluid being drunk or administered IV. Diuretic beverages: Diuretic beverages, those that promote urination, include coffee, tea, beer and other alcoholic beverages. Diuretic medicines: Too high a dose of a diuretic drug, one that promotes the formation of urine, also will cause dehydration and lead to excessive thirst (dipsosis). Taking in too much salt: Ham, canned soup, cheese, pickles, sauerkraut, lunch meats, snack foods (like pretzels and peanuts) and fast foods all tend to contain high levels of salt. These foods should be eaten sparingly to prevent dipsosis. ""Dipsosis"" is derived from the Greek ""dipsa"" (thirst) and ""-sis"" (a suffix meaning condition or state)."
Disc,"Disc: Shortened terminology for an intervertebral disc, a disk-shaped piece of specialized tissue that separates the bones of the spinal column. The center of a disc, called the nucleus, is soft, springy and receives the shock of standing, walking, running, etc. The outer ring of the disc, called the annulus (Latin for ring), provides structure and strength to the disc. The annulus consists of a complex series of interwoven layers of fibrous tissue that hold the nucleus in place. A disc can herniate. A herniated disc is often referred to as a slipped disc. This term came from the action of the nuclear tissue when it is forced from the center of the disc. The nuclear tissue located in the center of the disc can be placed under so much pressure that it can cause the annulus to rupture. When the disc has herniated or ruptured, it may create pressure against one or more of the spinal nerves which can cause pain, weakness or numbness. The terms slipped disc, herniated disc, prolapsed disc, and ruptured disc are synonymous."
Discharge,"Discharge: 1.The flow of fluid from part of the body, such as from the nose or vagina.
2. The passing of an action potential, such as through a nerve or muscle fiber.
3. The release of a patient from a course of care. The doctor may then dictate a discharge summary."
Discoid lupus,"Discoid lupus: A chronic inflammatory condition that is limited to the skin and is caused by an autoimmune disease. Up to 10 percent of persons with discoid lupus eventually develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs may"
Discordance,"Discordance: 1. The presence of any given condition such as HIV in only one member of a couple. 2. In genetics, the presence of a phenotype such as asthma in only one members of a twin pair. 3. In clinical care, lack of agreement between physician and patient.
In all sense, disconcordance is as opposed to concordance. From dis- + the Latin concordare, to agree = not to agree."
Discordant,"Discordant: 1. Showing discordance, lack of agreement. A couple may be discordant for a sexually transmitted infection, with one partner having it and the other not. 2. In transplantation genetics, between different species. A discordant xenograft is a transplant between members of very different species."
Discordant couple,Discordant couple: A pair of long-term sexual partners in which one has a sexually transmitted infection and the other does not. The CDC has guidelines for counseling discordant couples in which the woman is HIV-infected and her husband is HIV-uninfected.
Disease,Disease: Illness or sickness characterized by specific signs and symptoms.
Disease nomenclature,"Disease nomenclature: A system of classifying and naming diseases. The contemporary categories and codes for diseases are outlined in the World Health Organization's ""International Classification of Diseases."" Within some medical fields, there are standard nomenclatures. For example, DSM-IV, the 4th edition of ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" is a comprehensive classification of officially recognized psychiatric disorders. There was once no standard classification or nomenclature (system of names) for diseases. The recorded causes of death were often narratives of symptoms. The systematic classification of diseases dates back to the nineteenth century. Groundwork was done by early medical statisticians William Farr (1807-1883) and Jacques Bertillon (1851-1922). The French government invoked the first International Conference for the revision of the Bertillon or International Classification of Causes of Death in 1900."
Disease surveillance,"Disease surveillance: The ongoing systematic collection and analysis of data and the provision of information which leads to action being taken to prevent and control a disease, usually one of an infectious nature."
"Disease, Osgood-Schlatter","Disease, Osgood-Schlatter: A condition involving inflammation and sometimes tearing of ligaments within the knee and lower leg. Treatment is by rest, casting if necessary, and sometimes surgery. Osgood-Schlatter disease is caused by repetitive stress or tension on a part of the growth area of the upper tibia (the apophysis). It is characterized by inflammation of the patellar tendon and surrounding soft tissues at the point where the tendon attaches to the tibia. The disease may also be associated with an avulsion injury, in which the tendon is stretched so much that it tears away from the tibia and takes a fragment of bone with it. The disease most commonly affects active young people, particularly boys between the ages of 10 and 15, who play games or sports that include frequent running and jumping. People with this disease experience pain just below the knee joint that usually worsens with activity and is relieved by rest. A bony bump that is particularly painful when pressed may appear on the upper edge of the tibia (below the knee cap). Usually, motion of the knee is not affected. Pain may last a few months and may recur until a child's growth is completed. Osgood Schlatter disease is most often diagnosed by the symptoms. An x ray may be normal, or show an avulsion injury, or, more typically, show that the apophysis is in fragments. The disease usually disappears without treatment. Applying ice to the knee when pain first begins helps relieve inflammation and is sometimes used along with stretching and strengthening exercises. The doctor may advise the patient to limit participation in vigorous sports. Children who wish to continue participating in moderate or less stressful sports may need to wear knee pads for protection and apply ice to the knee after activity. If a great deal of pain is felt during sports activities, participation may be limited until any remaining discomfort is tolerable."
"Disease, subclinical","Disease, subclinical: An illness that stays ""below the surface"" of clinical detection. A subclinical disease has no or minimally recognizable clinical findings. It is distinct from a clinical disease, which has signs and symptoms that can be more easily recognized. Many diseases, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, infections or cancers can be subclinical before surfacing as clinical diseases."
Disordered thinking,"Disordered thinking: A failure to be able to ""think straight."" Thoughts may come and go rapidly. The person may not be able to concentrate on one thought for very long and may be easily distracted, unable to focus attention. The person may be unable to connect thoughts into logical sequences, with thoughts becoming disorganized and fragmented. This lack of logical continuity of thought, termed a ""thought disorder,"" can make conversation very difficult and may contribute to social isolation. If people cannot make sense of what an individual is saying, they are likely to become uncomfortable and tend to leave that person alone. Disorder thinking is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia."
Dissect,"Dissect: To cut apart or separate tissue, as for anatomical study or in surgery. Also, an artery is said to dissect when its wall is torn, as in a dissecting aneurysm."
Dissection,"Dissection: The process of cutting apart or separating tissue as, for example, in the study of anatomy or in the course of a surgical procedure."
Distal,"Distal: The more (or most) distant of two (or more) things. For example, the distal end of the femur (the thigh bone) is the end down by the knee; the end more distant from the torso. The distal bile duct is the far end of the cystic duct, the end away from the gallbladder. And the distal lymph node in a chain of nodes is the most distant one. The opposite of distal is proximal. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Distention,"Distention: The state of being distended, enlarged, swollen from internal pressure. For example, on inhalation there is distention of the lungs due to the increased air pressure within the lungs. The word ""distention"" comes from a Latin root ""tendere,"" to extend. The word ""tendon"" comes from the same root."
Disto-,Disto-: Distal.
Disulfaram-like reaction,"Disulfaram-like reaction: a process in the body that produces symptoms similar to those that occur when alcohol is consumed after taking disulfaram (Antabuse). Disulfiram is an oral drug used for treating alcoholism that causes unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is consumed. This happens because alcohol is first converted in the body into acetaldehyde by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. Another enzyme known as acetaldehyde dehydrogenase then converts acetaldehyde into acetic acid. Disulfiram prevents acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from converting acetaldehyde into acetic acid, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde levels in the blood. These high levels of acetaldehyde levels cause unpleasant symptoms after drinking alcohol such as headache, low blood pressure (hyoptension), severe flushing, palpitations, nausea, thirst, chest pain, and others. A ""disulfaram-like"" reaction occurs when another drug (not disulfaram) produces the same effects when alcohol is consumed. Examples of drugs that have been reported to produce disulfaram-like reactions include metronidazole (Flagyl and other brands), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Bactrim DS), tinidazole, chlorpropamide (Diabinese), tolbutamide, and others."
Diuresis,Diuresis: The increased formation of urine by the kidney. See diuretic for more detail.
Diuretic,"Diuretic: Something that promotes the formation of urine by the kidney. All diuretics cause a person to 'lose water,' but they do so by diverse means, including inhibiting the kidney's ability to reabsorb sodium, thus enhancing the loss of sodium and consequently water in the urine (loop diuretic); enhancing the excretion of both sodium and chloride in the urine so that water is excreted with them (thiazide diuretic); or blocking the exchange of sodium for potassium, resulting in excretion of sodium and potassium but relatively little loss of potassium (potassium-sparing diuretic). Some diuretics work by yet other mechanisms, and some have other effects and uses, such as in treating hypertension. Also known as water pill. Substances in food and drinks, such as coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages, may act as diuretics."
Diurnal,Diurnal: Occurring in the daytime. A patient may have a diurnal fever rather than a nocturnal one. Diurnal also refers to something that recurs every day.
Diverticulitis,"Diverticulitis: Inflammation of the diverticula (small outpouchings) along the wall of the colon, the large intestine. (One outpouching is a diverticulum; two or more are diverticula). For diverticulitis to occur, there must be diverticulosis, the presence of diverticula. Diverticulosis can occur anywhere in the colon but it is most typical in the sigmoid colon, the S-shaped segment of the colon the left lower part of the abdomen. (Sides are from the patient's perspective so the left lower part of your abdomen is nearest your left hand). The incidence of diverticulosis increases with age. Age causes a weakening of the walls of the colon and this weakening permits the formation of diverticula. By age 80, most people have diverticulosis. A key factor promoting the formation of diverticulosis is elevated pressure within the colon. The pressure within the colon is raised when a person is constipated and has to push down to pass small, hard bits of stool (""rabbit droppings""). Most patients with diverticulosis have few or no symptoms although some have mild symptoms including abdominal cramping and bloating. Diverticulosis sets the stage for inflammation and infection of the outpouching, that is for diverticulitis. (The ""-itis"" refers to inflammation.) It is potentially serious and can result in pain in the left lower abdomen, fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation and, paradoxically, diarrhea and frequent urination. Even graver consequences such as perforation of the colon and peritonitis are well known from diverticulitis. The best way to avoid developing diverticulosis in the first place (aside from the impossibility of staying young) is by eating a proper healthy diet With plenty of fiber. A diet high in fiber keeps the bowels moving, keeps the pressure within the colon within normal limits, and slows or stops the formation of diverticula. Diverticulitis can be diagnosed with barium x-rays of the colon or with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Treatment of diverticulitis is designed to combat the inflammation and infection."
Diverticulum,"Diverticulum: A small bulging sac pushing outward from the colon wall is a diverticulum. As a person ages, pressure within the large intestine (colon) causes pockets of tissue (sacs) that push out from the colon walls. The plural is diverticula. Diverticula can occur throughout the colon but are most common near the end of the left side of the colon, the sigmoid colon."
Dizziness,"Dizziness: Painless head discomfort with many possible causes including disturbances of vision, the brain, balance (vestibular) system of the inner ear, and gastrointestinal system. Dizziness is a medically indistinct term which laypersons use to describe a variety of conditions ranging from lightheadedness, unsteadiness to vertigo. See: dizziness, unsteadiness, and vertigo."
DLI,DLI: Donor lymphocyte infusion.
DM,DM: Myotonic dystrophy.
DM2,DM2: Myotonic dystrophy type 2. See also: Myotonic dystrophy.
DNA,"DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. One of two types of molecules that encode genetic information. (The other is RNA. In humans DNA is the genetic material; RNA is transcribed from it. In some other organisms, RNA is the genetic material and, in reverse fashion, the DNA is transcribed from it.) DNA is a double-stranded molecule held together by weak hydrogen bonds between base pairs of nucleotides. The molecule forms a double helix in which two strands of DNA spiral about one other. The double helix looks something like an immensely long ladder twisted into a helix, or coil. The sides of the ""ladder"" are formed by a backbone of sugar and phosphate molecules, and the ""rungs"" consist of nucleotide bases joined weakly in the middle by the hydrogen bonds. There are four nucleotides in DNA. Each nucleotide contains a base: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T). Base pairs form naturally only between A and T and between G and C so the base sequence of each single strand of DNA can be simply deduced from that of its partner strand. The genetic code in DNA is in triplets such as ATG. The base sequence of that triplet in the partner strand is therefore TAC. The first proof that DNA was the hereditary material was provided in 1944 by Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLoed. The double helical structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick with the invaluable collaboration of the X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin. Watson and Crick shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Maurice H.F. Wilkins. See also: DNA (figurative); and the Transforming principle."
DNA amplification,"DNA amplification: The production of multiple copies of a sequence of DNA. Repeated copying of a piece of DNA. DNA amplification plays a role in cancer cells. A tumor cell amplifies, or copies, DNA segments as a result of cell signals and sometimes environmental events. Amplification can occur in vivo (in the living individual) or in vitro (literally ""in glass"", or in a plastic vessel in the laboratory)."
DNA virus,"DNA virus: A virus in which the genetic material is DNA rather than RNA. The DNA may be either double- or single-stranded. Major groups of double-stranded DNA viruses (class I viruses) include the adenoviruses, the herpes viruses, and the poxviruses. Major groups of single-stranded DNA viruses (class II viruses) include the parvoviruses and coliphages."
DNS,"DNS: On a prescription, Do Not Substitute. If a physician orders a particular drug and writes DNS on the prescription, that tells the pharmacist not to substitute a generic version or any other drug for the prescribed drug."
DOB,"DOB: Date of birth, an abbreviation that is frequently used in medical charting."
Doc,"Doc: Short and informal for doctor. In a medical context, doc may refer to any medical professional with an MD, a PhD, or any other doctoral degree. The word ""doctor"" comes from the Latin ""docere"" meaning to teach. A doctor was a teacher, especially a learned or authoritative one."
Docosahexaenoic acid,"Docosahexaenoic acid: DHA. An essential fatty acid, thought to be important to the development of infants, particularly as regards their eyes and brain. DHA is present in breast milk and has been added to some infant formulas. Postnatal DHA may improve vision and some cognitive functions in infants and toddlers. DHA is an omega-3, polyunsaturated, 22-carbon fatty acid. It is present in abundance in certain fish (such as tuna and bluefish) and marine animal oils."
Doctor,"Doctor: In a medical context, any medical professional with an MD, a PhD, or any other doctoral degree. The term doctor is quite unspecific. A doctor may, for example, be a physician, psychologist, biomedical scientist, dentist, or veterinarian. In a nonmedical context, a professor of history might be addressed as doctor, an eminent theologian might be named a doctor of a church, and a person awarded an honorary doctorate by a college or university might also be called a doctor."
Doctors Without Borders,"Doctors Without Borders: A group which sends physicians and other health workers to some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of the world and encourages them not only to care for people, but also to condemn the injustices they encounter. The 1999 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Doctors Without Borders (in French, Medicins Sans Frontieres). The Nobel Committee cited the organization's rapid intervention in and reaction to natural and humanitarian disasters. ""By intervening so rapidly, Doctors Without Borders calls public attention to humanitarian catastrophes, and by pointing to the causes of such catastrophes, the organization helps to form bodies of public opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power."" In 2012, Doctors Without Borders have offices worldwide and more than 2,000 volunteers. The organization is working in roughly 80 countries. Its efforts have included intervention following the 2011 Turkish earthquake and continued assistance after the 2010 Haitian earthquake, providing healthcare to people living in tribal villages in central India caught up in the conflict between Maoist rebels and government forces, present in several countries following the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and fighting malaria in Africa. Doctors Without Borders was formed in 1971 by a group of French physicians, most of whom had worked for the International Red Cross in Biafra in 1968 and 1970. According to the group, they aimed to overcome two shortcomings of international aid, ""that it offers too little medical assistance and that aid agencies are overly reticent in the face of the many legal and administrative obstacles to the provision of effective humanitarian relief."""
Doctors' symbol,"Doctors' symbol: ?A staff or rod with a snake curled? around it.? This is the Rod?of Aesculapius (also called Asklepios), the ancient?mythical god of medicine. ?Asklepios may have been a real person who was?renowned for his gentle remedies and humane treatment of the?mentally ill.?Today, the staff of Aesculapius is a commonly used symbol of medicine.? It is the symbol of the American Medical Association (AMA) and many other? medical societies. ?A similar symbol, the caduceus, was the staff of the Greek god Hermes.? The caduceus is usually depicted with two snakes and a pair of wings and is often used mistakenly as a symbol of medicine."
Dog Bite,"Dog Bite: A bite wound inflicted by a dog. Approximately 880,000 dog bite victims seek emergency medical care at hospitals in the U.S. every year. The pressure exerted by the dog's jaws during the bite can cause significant damage to the tissues under the skin, including bones, muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves. The main medical issues to be addressed with dog bites are the skin damage; any injury to underlying tissues such as muscle, nerve, and bone; and the significant potential for infection of the wound."
Dol,"Dol: A unit of measurement of pain. The term dol was invented by James Hardy and his research colleagues Herbert Wolff and Helen Goodell at Cornell University where from 1950 to 1959, they carried out pioneering experiments on pain. Hasrdy, Wolff and Goodell used precisely calibrated radiant heat directed to the foreheads or hands of trained experimental subjects. They asked the subjects to report each ""just noticeable difference"" in the intensity of pain they experienced, and graphed their responses on the ""dol"" scale, in which one dol equals two ""just noticeable differences."" The graphs showed the effectiveness of different analgesics in relieving the pain, and the physiologic responses with different intensities of pain. From the Latin word for pain, dolor."
Dolor,"Dolor: Pain, one of the four classic signs of inflammation together with calor, rubor, and tumor (heat, redness, and swelling, respectively)."
Domain,"Domain: In biomedicine, a discrete portion of a protein that has its own function. The combination of domains in a single protein determines the overall function of the protein."
Dominant,"Dominant: A genetic trait is considered dominant if it is expressed in a person who has only one copy of that gene. (In genetic terms, a dominant trait is one that is phenotypically expressed in heterozygotes). A dominant trait is opposed to a recessive trait which is expressed only when two copies of the gene are present. (In genetic terms, a recessive trait is one that is phenotypically expressed only in homozygotes). Examples of dominant disorders include: Most dominant traits are due to genes located on the autosomes (the non-sex chromosomes). An autosomal dominant trait typically affects males and females with equal likelihood and with similar severity. The gene responsible for it can be transmitted from generation to generation and each child born to someone with the gene has a 50:50 chance of receiving the gene and manifesting the disease."
Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD),"Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD): A condition that typically begins in childhood or adolescence with progressive difficulty in walking and, in some cases, spasticity and can be successfully treated with drugs. Segawa dystonia is an important variant of dopa-responsive dystonia. In Segawa dystonia, the symptoms fluctuate during the day from relative mobility in the morning to increasing disability in the afternoon and evening and after exercise. Dopa-responsive dystonia may not only be rare but also rarely diagnosed since it mimics some forms of cerebral palsy."
Dopamine,"Dopamine: An important neurotransmitter (messenger) in the brain. Dopamine is classified as a catecholamine (a class of molecules that serve as neurotransmitters and hormones). It is a monoamine (a compound containing nitrogen formed from ammonia by replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atoms by hydrocarbon radicals). Dopamine is a precursor (forerunner) of adrenaline and a closely related molecule, noradrenaline. Dopamine is formed by the decarboxylation (removal of a carboxyl group) from dopa. Dopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease is believed to be related to low levels of dopamine in certain parts of the brain. When dopa is taken by mouth, it crosses through the blood-brain barrier. Once it has crossed from the bloodstream into the brain, it is converted to dopamine. The resulting increase in dopamine concentrations in the brain is thought to improve nerve conduction and to assist in lessening the movement disorders in Parkinson disease. In 1970 the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved dopa in the form of L-Dopa, or levodopa, for use in the US. The drug revolutionized the treatment of Parkinson disease."
Doppler ultrasound,"Doppler ultrasound: A form of ultrasound that can detect and measure blood flow. Doppler ultrasound depends on the Doppler effect, a change in the frequency of a wave resulting here from the motion of a reflector, the red blood cell. There are several kinds of Doppler ultrasound: Color Doppler depicts blood flow in a region and is used as a guide for the placement of the pulsed Doppler gate for more detailed analysis at a particular site. Doppler ultrasound has many applications including, for example, the detection and measurement of decreased or obstructed blood flow to the legs. Color Doppler ultrasound is done first to evaluate vessels rapidly for abnormalities and to guide placement of the pulsed Doppler to gain sample volume for detailed analysis of velocities. Named for Christian Johann Doppler (1803-1853), the Austrian physicist, who discovered the effect that now bears his name."
Doraphobia,"Doraphobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of fur. Sufferers of this fear avoid fur-bearing animals such as dogs, cats, foxes, beavers and rabbits because fur is repulsive to them. Perhaps some of these phobics associate fur with childhood stories about ""the big bad wolf"" and other fur-bearing predators. Their fear is not always unfounded, for many furry animals -- including bats, raccoons, dogs and cats -- can be carriers of rabies, an acute viral infection of the central nervous system. An animal can transmit this disease to a human through a bite and, in rare cases, through contact with the animal's blood or tissue or even through inhalation of the rabies virus in a bat cave. The disease is fatal unless an infected person receives rabies shots soon after contracting the illness. The word ""doraphobia"" is from Greek roots, namely ""dora"" (the hide or skin) + ""phobos"" (fear) = fear of the skin or hide (the fur of an animal)."
Dorsal,"Dorsal: Relating to the back or posterior of a structure. As opposed to the ventral, or front, of the structure. Some of the dorsal surfaces of the body are the back, buttocks, calves, and the knuckle side of the hand. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Dorsum,Dorsum: The back or posterior side of a structure. Something that pertains to the dorsum is dorsal.
DOTS,"DOTS: Stands for Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course. DOTS is a strategy used to reduce the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases. In DOTS, healthcare workers observe patients as they take their medicine. Left alone, many people with tuberculosis fail to take all their medication and contribute to the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis."
Douche,"Douche: Usually, a stream of water applied into the vagina for cleansing purposes. A douche can use a solution, such as vinegar and water, rather than simple water, and it can be directed at any body cavity or part."
,"Douglas, pouch of: An extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and the back wall of the uterus. Also known as the rectouterine pouch."
Downregulation,"Downregulation: An decrease in the number of receptors on the surface of target cells, making the cells less sensitive to a hormone or another agent. For example, insulin receptors may be downregulated in type 2 diabetes."
Doxycycline,"Doxycycline: Brand name: Vibramycin. A synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic derived from tetracycline. Doxycycline is used for many different types of infections, including respiratory tract infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is also used for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis (due to Ureaplasma), Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus, chancroid, cholera, brucellosis, syphilis, and acne. Doxycycline is also of relevance to bioterrorism since the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) recommends it as ""the drug of choice"" for anyone who may have been exposed to anthrax. Doxycycline has fewer side effects, costs less and is more available than Cipro."
DPT,DPT: Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus vaccine. Today the more frequent abbreviation is DTP (for Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine).
DPT immunization,"DPT immunization: Immunization to protect against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus. DPT immunizations are given in a series of 5 shots at 2, 4, 6, 18 months of age and 4-6 years of age. Thanks to vaccination programs, these diseases have become less common. However, there are still unvaccinated individuals capable of carrying and passing diphtheria and pertussis to others who are not vaccinated. Tetanus bacteria are prevalent in natural surroundings, such as contaminated soil. See also: DTaP immunization."
DR syndrome,DR syndrome: See: Okihiro syndrome.
Drain,"Drain: A device for removing fluid from a cavity or wound. A drain is typically a tube or wick. As a verb, to allow fluid to be released from a confined area."
DRE (digital rectal exam),"DRE (digital rectal exam): An exam done to detect abnormalities that can be felt (palpated) from within the rectum. The doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels for anything that is not normal. The digital rectal exam is an important screening test for the detection of tumors of the rectum and prostate abnormalities, including benign enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and cancer of the prostate."
Dreams,"Dreams: Thoughts, visions, and other sensations that occupy the mind in sleep. Dreams occur during that part of sleep when there are rapid eye movements (REMs). We have 3 to 5 periods of REM sleep per night. They usually come at intervals of 1-2 hours and are quite variable in length. An episode of REM sleep may be brief and last but 5 minutes. Or it may be much longer and go for over an hour. About 20% of sleep is REM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, perhaps an hour and half of that time, 90 minutes, is REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by a number of other features besides REM, including rapid, low-voltage brain waves on the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, irregular breathing and irregular heart rate and -- what may be most evident to someone else -- involuntary muscle jerks. Non-REM (NREM) sleep is dreamless sleep. During NREM, the brain waves on the EEG are typically slow and of high voltage, the breathing and heart rate are both slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth. About 80% of sleep is NREM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, all but maybe an hour and a half is spent in dreamless NREM sleep. Dreams are penetrable; it has been found experimentally that one can communicate with a person who is dreaming. The content of dreams is sometimes the topic of psychoanalysis. While this method of therapy is less common than it once was, some doctors still look at dreams as a diagnostic clue to medical disorders. For example, children with bipolar disorders have been found to frequently have a particular type of nightmares, and especially lucid dreams are a side-effect of certain medications. These clues indicate that chemicals in the brain, as well as life events and our own preoccupations, influence our dreams. Dreaming is not uniquely human. Cats and dogs dream, judging from the physiologic features. So apparently do many other animals."
Drip,"Drip: Short for intravenous drip, a device for administering a fluid drop-by-drop into a vein via an intravenous (IV) route."
Drop Hand Syndrome,"Drop hand syndrome is also known as wrist drop or finger drop, a condition caused by paralysis of or damage to the radial nerve of the arm. The radial nerve supplies the muscles that extend the wrist and fingers. The end result is that the hand hangs flaccidly in a position of flexion during attempts to bring the arm to a horizontal position. Causes of drop hand or wrist drop can include trauma, external compression, or systemic nutritional deficiencies. Persistent compression from the use of crutches is one possible cause of damage to the radial nerve that results in wrist drop."
Dropsy,"Dropsy: An old term for the swelling of soft tissues due to the accumulation of excess water. In years gone by, a person might have been said to have dropsy. Today one would be more descriptive and specify the cause. Thus, the person might have edema due to congestive heart failure. Edema is often more prominent in the lower legs and feet toward the end of the day as a result of pooling of fluid from the upright position usually maintained during the day. Upon awakening from sleeping, people can have swelling around the eyes referred to as periorbital edema. The Middle English dropesie came through the Old French hydropsie from the Greek hydrops which in turn came from the Greek ""hydro"" meaning water."
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),"Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA): Every prescription written in the United States bears a DEA number, that of the prescribing doctor, the DEA being the Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Department of Justice. Historically, the DEA's roots go back to the founding in 1930 of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. During World War II, international drug trafficking was effectively suppressed in the U.S. and many addicts sought paregoric, an anti-diarrheal containing powdered opium. The heroin shortage resulted in a rise of thefts from pharmacies, hospitals, and other sources of legitimate drugs. And for the first time, barbiturates became recognizable as a potential drug abuse problem. The U.S. Congress in 1970 passed the comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which replaced more than 50 pieces of drug legislation. Title II of the Act, known as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), gave Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce for drugs. It also established five schedules that classify controlled substances according to their potential for abuse. Drugs were placed into categories according to how dangerous they were, how great their potential for abuse, and whether they have any legitimate medical value. Under the CSA the DEA licenses individual physicians to prescribe drugs for medical purposes. This entry is based in part upon information from the DEA of the United States of America."
"Drug, prescription","Drug, prescription: A drug requiring a prescription, as opposed to an over-the-counter drug, which can be purchased without one. The word ""prescription"" comes from the Latin ""praescriptus"" compounded from ""prae"", before + scribere, to write = to write before. Historically, a prescription was written before the drug was prepared and administered. A prescription has several parts. There are: Seen on a prescription, b.i.d. means twice (two times) a day. It is an abbreviation for ""bis in die"" which in Latin means, not too surprisingly, twice a day. The abbreviation b.i.d. is sometimes written without a period either in lower-case letters as ""bid"" or in capital letters as ""BID"". However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
"Drug, sulfa","Drug, sulfa: One of the sulfonamides, the sulfa-related antibiotics which are used to treat bacterial and some fungal infections. The first sulfa drug was prontosil. It was discovered by the German physician and chemist Gerhard Domagk in 1935. The sulfa family of drugs includes sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole (brand name: Thiosulfil Forte), sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin), and various high-strength combinations of three sulfonamides. Sulfa drugs kill bacteria and fungi by interfering with their metabolism. They were the ""wonder drugs"" before penicillin and are still used today. Because sulfa drugs concentrate in the urine before being excreted, treating urinary tract infections is one of their most common uses. Sulfa drugs can have a number of interactions with prescription and over-the-counter drugs (including PABA sunscreens), and are not appropriate for people with some health conditions."
"Drugs, statin","Drugs, statin: A class of drugs that lower cholesterol. There are currently at least 5 statin drugs on the market in the U.S., including: The major effect of the statins is to lower LDL-cholesterol levels, and they lower LDL-cholesterol more than other types of drugs. Statins inhibit an enzyme, HMG- CoA reductase, that controls the rate of cholesterol production in the body. These drugs lower cholesterol by slowing down the production of cholesterol and by increasing the liver's ability to remove the LDL-cholesterol already in the blood. The large reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol produced by these drugs in research studies resulted in large reductions in heart attacks and heart disease deaths. Thanks to their track record in these studies and their ability to lower LDL-cholesterol, statins have become the drugs most often prescribed when a person with heart disease needs a cholesterol- lowering medicine. Studies using statins have reported 20 to 60% lower LDL-cholesterol levels in patients on these drugs. Statins also produce a modest increase in HDL- cholesterol and reduce elevated triglyceride levels. The statins are usually given in a single dose at the evening meal or at bedtime. It is important that these medications be given in the evening to take advantage of the fact that the body makes more cholesterol at night than during the day. Results from the statins start to be seen after several weeks, with a maximum effect in 4 to 6 weeks. The statins are generally well tolerated by most patients, and serious side effects are rare. A few patients will experience an upset stomach, gas, constipation, and abdominal pain or cramps. These symptoms usually are mild to moderate in severity and generally go away as your body adjusts. Rarely a patient will develop abnormalities in blood tests of the liver. Also rare is the side effect of muscle problems. The symptoms are muscle soreness, pain, and weakness. Statins may also strengthen bone tissue. Thus, people over 50 taking statins (to lower cholesterol) had fewer hip fractures, as was reported in 2000 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)."
Dry mouth,"Dry mouth: The condition of not having enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. This is due to inadequate function of the salivary glands. Everyone has dry mouth once in a while when they are nervous, upset or under stress. But if someone has a dry mouth most all of the time, it can be uncomfortable and lead to serious health problems. Dry mouth can cause difficulties in tasting, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. If it goes untreated, severe dry mouth can also lead to increased levels of tooth decay and infections of the mouth such as thrush. Severe dry mouth is not a normal part of aging. It can be a clue to systemic diseases such as Sjogren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and hypothyroidism. Some medications can also cause dry mouth. Dry mouth is medically termed xerostomia. From the Greek ""xeros"" (dry) + ""stoma"" (mouth)."
DSM,"DSM: Abbreviation for the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,"" a comprehensive classification of officially recognized psychiatric disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association , for use by mental health professionals to ensure uniformity of diagnosis. DSM describes symptoms and does not discuss the causes of the disorders. DSM-IV designates the 4th edition. Issued in 1993, DSM-IV is currently the latest edition (as of 2001)."
DT,DT: Diphtheria-Tetanus vaccine.
DTaP,DTaP: Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis vaccine.
DTC,"DTC: Direct-to-consumer, as in DTC advertising of prescription drugs."
DTP,DTP: Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy: The best-known form of muscular dystrophy, due to mutation in a gene on the X chromosome that prevents the production of dystrophin, a normal protein in muscle. DMD affects boys and, very rarely, girls. DMD typically appears between the ages of two with weakness in the pelvis and upper limbs, resulting in clumsiness, frequent falling, an unusual gait and general weakness. Some patients also have mild mental retardation. As DMD progresses, a wheelchair may be needed. Most patients with Duchenne MD die in their early twenties because of muscle-based breathing and heart problems. There is no cure for DMD. Current treatment is directed toward symptoms, such as assisting with mobility, preventing scoliosis, and providing pulmonary therapy (respiratory toilet). Gene replacement with dystrophin minigenes is being investigated but no cure appears around the corner. The DMD gene: The muscular dystrophies associated with defects in dystrophin range greatly from the very severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to the far milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). DMD and BMD result from different mutations in the gigantic gene that encodes dystrophin. The DMD gene contains 79 exons spanning at least 2,300 kb. Deletions cause deficiencies in 1 or more of these, which may explain why mental retardation and cardiomyopathy sometimes accompany DMD, for there are clearcut differences in clinical presentation depending on what the deletions remove from the dystrophin gene. The DMD gene encodes a 3,685-amino acid protein product. From its amino acid sequence, dystrophin is similar to spectrin and other cytoskeletal proteins. It is rather like an I-beam with globular domains at each end, joined by a rod-like segment in the middle. History: The disease is named for the pioneering 19th century French neurologist Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne. After graduating in medicine, he practiced in the provinces but returned to Paris in 1842 to pursue medical research where he became known under the name of Duchenne de Boulogne to avoid confusion with edouard Adolphe Duchesne, a fashionable society physician. Duchenne was a diligent clinical investigator, meticulous in recording the patient's history. He followed his patients from hospital to hospital to complete his studies. In this way he developed an exceptionally rich resource of clinical research material, far superior to that available to a single physician or hospital. Duchenne described a boy with the form of muscular dystrophy that now bears his name in the 1861 edition of his book ""Paraplegie hypertrophique de l'enfance de cause cerebrale."" A keen photographer, he depicted his patient a year later in his ""Album de photographies pathologiques."" In 1868 he gave an account of 13 affected children under the designation ""paralysie musculaire pseudohypertrophique."" The term ""pseudohypertrophic"" stuck to this form of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne was the first to do a biopsy to obtain tissue from a living patient for microscopic examination. This aroused a deal of controversy in the lay press concerning the morality of examining living tissues. Duchenne used his biopsy needle on boys with DMD and concluded correctly that the disease was one of muscle."
Duct,"Duct: A walled passageway, such as a lymph duct, that carries fluid from one place to another. Also known as a ductus."
Duloxetine,Duloxetine: See: Cymbalta.
Dumdum fever,"Dumdum fever: Also called kala-azar, a chronic, potentially fatal parasitic disease of the viscera (the internal organs) due to infection by an agent called Leishmania donovani. Leishmania donovani is transmitted by sandfly bites in parts of Asia (primarily India), Africa (primarily Sudan) and South America (primarily Brazil) where all together there are an estimated half million cases per year. There are also several hundred cases yearly in Europe (primarily in the Mediterranean region) and a few in North America. The infection can cause no or few symptoms but typically it is associated with fever, loss of appetite (anorexia), fatigue, enlargement of the liver, spleen and nodes and suppression of the bone marrow. The disease also increases the risk of other secondary infections. The first oral drug found to be effective for treating it is miltefosine. The term ""kala-azar"" comes from India where it is the Hindi for black fever. The disease is also known as Indian leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leishmania infection, black sickness, and black fever. The name ""Leishmania donovani"" honors two men: the British pathologist William Boog Leishman who in 1903 wrote about the protozoa that causes kala-azar and the researcher C. Donovan, who made the same discovery independently the same year."
Duodenal,"Duodenal: Pertaining to the duodenum, part of the small intestine. As in duodenal ulcer or duodenal biliary drainage."
Duodenal ulcer,"Duodenal ulcer: A crater (ulcer) in the lining of the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum). Ulcer formation is caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori. Other factors predisposing a person to ulcers include anti-inflammatory medications and cigarette smoking. Ulcer pain may not correlate with the presence or severity of ulceration. Diagnosis is made with barium X-ray or endoscopy. Complications of ulcers include bleeding, perforation, and blockage. Treatment involves using antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori, eliminating risk factors, and preventing complications."
"Dupuytren, Guillaume","Dupuytren, Guillaume: (1777-1835) The leading French surgeon of the early part of the 19th century. Dupuytren reported the condition in 1832 that now bears his name: Dupuytren contracture. He was not the first to describe the condition but he was the first to recognize that this form of finger contracture was due to scarring of the fascia tissue in the palm. Born to a poor lawyer near Limoges in central France, Dupuytren had an unusual childhood. He was kidnapped at age 4 by a wealthy lady but later restored to his family, only to be taken away again at age 12, this time by a cavalry officer who paid for his education in Paris. Despite great hardship, he attended medical school and, in time, became a surgeon. At the height of his career Dupuytren's saw 10,000 patients a year, became wealthy, was surgeon to the kings of France (Louis XVIII and Charles X) and was made a baron. Reportedly a surgeon of unbridled ambition and cynical disregard for his colleagues and known as the ""Napoleon"" of surgery. Aside from Dupuytren contracture, the name of Dupuytren was associated with a number of other phenomena in medicine, including: Dupuytren disease of the foot (plantar fibromatosis, the growth of nodules in the plantar fascia of the foot), Dupuytren fascia (the thick central portion of the fascia ensheathing the hand, also called the palmar aponeurosis), and Dupuytren sign (up and down movement of the head of the femur upon pulling on the leg, a sign of congenital dislocation of the hip). There was also Dupuytren amputation, Dupuytren canal, Dupuytren fracture, Dupuytren hydrocele, Dupuytren suture, and Dupuytren tourniquet."
Dura,"Dura: The outermost, toughest, and most fibrous of the three membranes (meninges) covering the brain and the spinal cord. Dura is short for dura mater (from the Latin for hard mother). Also called the pachymeninx (singular) or pachymeniges (plural). Epidural means outside the dura. An accumulation of blood outside the dura is an epidural hematoma. Subdural means under the dura. A bleed under the dura may result in a subdural hematoma."
attorney,"Durable power of attorney: A type of advance medical directive in which legal documents provide the power of attorney to another person in the case of an incapacitating medical condition. A durable power of attorney allows another person to make bank transactions, sign Social Security checks, apply for disability, or write checks to pay utility bills while an individual is medically incapacitated. Such documents are recommended for any patient who may be unable to make his or her wishes known during a long medical confinement."
Dural sac,"Dural sac: The membranous sac that encases the spinal cord within the bony structure of the vertebral column. Dural refers to the dura, the name of the membrane around the spinal cord (and brain, too)."
DV,DV: Abbreviation for Daily Value.
Dwarf,"Dwarf: Someone with dwarfism, which is now more correctly called short stature. People with dwarfism (short stature) also consider themselves little people, as in the Little People of America."
Dx,"Dx: Abbreviation for diagnosis, the determination of the nature of a disease."
Dyad,"Dyad: The word ""dyad"" comes from the Greek ""dyas"" meaning the number two. In psychology, a dyad refers to a pair of persons in an interactional situation. For example, a patient and therapist, a woman and her husband, a girl and her stepfather, etc. In chemistry, a dyad is a bivalent element. And in biology, a dyad is a double chromosome resulting from the splitting of a tetrad (a quadruple chromosome) during meiosis (germ cell formation)."
DYS,DYS: Symbol for familial dysautonomia. See: Familial dysautonomia.
Dys-,"Dys-: Prefix denoting bad or difficult, as in dyspepsia (difficult digestion)."
Dysarthria,"Dysarthria: Speech that is characteristically slurred, slow, and difficult to understand. A person with dysarthria may also have problems controlling the pitch, loudness, rhythm, and voice qualities of his or her speech. Dysarthria is caused by paralysis, weakness, or inability to coordinate the muscles of the mouth. Dysarthria can occur as a developmental disability. It may be a sign of a neuromuscular disorder such as cerebral palsy or Parkinson's disease. It may also be caused by a stroke, brain injury, or brain tumor. Treatment of dysarthria includes intensive speech therapy with a focus on oral-motor skill development."
Dyscrasia,"Dyscrasia: Any disease condition, especially in hematology, as in ""blood dyscrasias."" The term ""dyscrasia"" was borrowed from the Greek meaning ""a bad mixture"" referring to the ancient belief that an imbalance between the four humors - blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile- which caused disease."
Dysfunction,"Dysfunction: Difficult function or abnormal function. There is, for example:"
Dysgeusia,"Dysgeusia: a disruption or disorder in the sense of taste. Symptoms of dysgeusia include a persistent metallic, rancid, foul, or salty taste in the mouth. There are a number of medications and conditions that can cause dysgeusia, including certain medications, cancer treatments, zinc deficiency, undiagnosed diabetes, poor oral hygiene, physiological changes like aging or pregnancy, and head injuries."
Dyskinesia,"Dyskinesia: The presence of involuntary movements, such as the choreaform movements seen in some cases of rheumatic fever or the characteristic movements of tardive dyskinesia. Some forms of dyskinesia are side effects of certain medications, particularly L-dopa and, in the case of tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic drugs."
Dyslexia,"Dyslexia: A specific developmental disability that alters the way the brain processes written material. Because dyslexia is due to a defect in the brain's processing of graphic symbols, it is thought of primarily as a learning disability. The effects of dyslexia vary from person to person. The only common trait among people with dyslexia is that they read at levels significantly lower than are typical for people of their age and intelligence. Dyslexia is different from reading retardation which may, for example, reflect mental retardation or cultural deprivation. Treatment of dyslexia should be directed to the specific learning problems of the affected individual. The usual course is to modify teaching methods and the educational environment to meet the specific needs of the individual with dyslexia. The outlook varies. The prognosis is generally good, however, for individuals whose dyslexia is identified early, who have supportive families and friends and a strong self-image, and who are involved in appropriate remediation programs."
Dyslipidemia,"Dyslipidemia: A disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, including lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency. Dyslipidemias may be manifested by elevation of the total cholesterol, the ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the triglyceride concentrations, and a decrease in the ""good"" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration in the blood. Dyslipidemia comes under consideration in many situations including diabetes, a common cause of hyperlipidemia. For adults with diabetes, it has been recommended that the levels of LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol, and triglyceride be measured every year. Optimal LDL cholesterol levels for adults with diabetes are less than 100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L), optimal HDL cholesterol levels are e4qual to or greater than 40 mg/dL (1.02 mmol/L), and desirable triglyceride levels are less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). From dys- + lipid (fat) + -emia (in the blood) = essentially, disordered lipids in the blood."
Dyspepsia,"Dyspepsia: Indigestion. A condition characterized by upper abdominal symptoms that may include pain or discomfort, bloating, feeling of fullness with very little intake of food , feeling of unusual fullness following meals, nausea, loss of appetite, heartburn, regurgitation of food or acid, and belching. The term dyspepsia is often used for these symptoms when they are not typical of a well-described disease (for example, gastrointestinal reflux) and the cause is not clear. After a cause for the symptoms has been determined, the term dyspepsia is usually dropped in favor of a more specific diagnosis."
Dyspeptic,"Dyspeptic: Pertaining to dyspepsia, a term that is probably more often encountered today in advertising than in medicine. ""Dyspepsia"" refers to nondescript, nonspecific upper abdominal symptoms which may include discomfort, bloating, a feeling of unusual fullness with very little intake of food (early satiety) or following meals (postprandial fullness), nausea, loss of appetite, heartburn, regurgitation of food or acid, and belching. The term ""dyspepsia"" may be used for these symptoms when they are not typical of a specific disease as, for example, gastrointestinal reflux (GERD), and the cause of the upper abdominal symptoms is not clear. Once a cause for the symptoms has been determined, the term ""dyspepsia"" usually is dropped in favor of a more specific diagnosis such as gastric ulcer, GERD, etc. Attempts have been made to subcategorize dyspepsia into ulcer-like, dysmotility-like, reflux-like, and unspecified; however, the utility of this categorization is unclear. Subdividing such a nebulous condition is a dubious endeavor. A French writer (1862) called dyspepsia ""the remorse of a guilty stomach."" The word ""dyspepsia"" came into English usage in 1706. It was contrived by cementing ""dys-"" to the Greek ""pepsis"" (digestion) = dysdigestion = indigestion."
Dysphagia,"Dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing. Dysphagia is due to abnormal nerve or muscle control. It is common, for example, after a stroke. Dysphagia can compromise nutrition and hydration and may lead to aspiration pneumonia and dehydration."
Dysphasia,"Dysphasia: One in a group of speech disorders in which there is impairment of the power of expression by speech, writing, or signs, or impairment of the power of comprehension of spoken or written language. More severe forms of dysphasia are called aphasia. From dys- meaning difficult, painful, bad, disordered, abnormal + the Greek phasis meaning speech."
Dysphonia,Dysphonia: An impairment of the voice. Difficulty in speaking. Hoarseness caused by a virus is a common form of dysphonia.
Dysphoria,Dysphoria: Anxiety.
Dysplasia,"Dysplasia: Abnormality in form or development. For example, retinal dysplasia is abnormal formation of the retina during embryonic development."
Dyspnea,"Dyspnea: Difficult or labored breathing; shortness of breath. Dyspnea is a sign of serious disease of the airway, lungs, or heart. The onset of dyspnea should not be ignored; it is reason to seek medical attention."
Dyspnoea,"Dyspnoea: Difficult or labored breathing; shortness of breath. Dyspnoea may be a sign of serious disease of the airway, lungs, or heart. The onset of dyspnoea should not be ignored and is reason to seek medical attention. Dyspnoea is the British spelling. The American spelling is dyspnea."
Dysthymia,"Dysthymia: A type of depression involving long-term, chronic symptoms that are not disabling, but keep a person from functioning at ""full steam"" or from feeling good. Dysthymia is a less severe type of depression than what is accorded the diagnosis of major depression. However, people with dysthymia may also sometimes experience major depressive episodes, suggesting that there is a continuum between dysthymia and major depression."
Dystonia,"Dystonia: Involuntary movements and prolonged muscle contraction that result in twisting body motions, tremors, and abnormal posture. These movements may involve the entire body or only an isolated area. Dystonia can be inherited, may occur sporadically without any genetic pattern, may be associated with medications (particularly antipsychotic drugs), or may be a symptom of certain diseases (for example, a specific form of lung cancer). Some types of dystonia respond to dopamine. Dystonia can sometimes also be controlled with sedative-type medications or surgery."
Dystrophic calcification,"Dystrophic calcification: deposition of calcium (as calcium phosphate crystals) in body tissues in areas that have been injured or damaged. Calcium deposits may form when there is necrosis (tissue death) due to injury or other damage, such as infiltration by a tumor. Calcium may also be present in surgical sites or areas where devices have been implanted in the body. Examples of areas in the body where dystrophic calcification occurs include atherosclerotic plaques, damaged heart valves, and lymph nodes in the presence of tuberculosis infection."
Ear,"Ear: The hearing organ. There are three sections of the ear, according to the anatomy textbooks. They are the outer ear (the part we see along the sides of our head behind the temples), the middle ear, and the inner ear. But in terms of function, the ear has four parts: those three and the brain. Hearing thus involves all parts of the ear as well as the auditory cortex of the brain. The external ear helps concentrate the vibrations of air on the ear drum and make it vibrate. These vibrations are transmitted by a chain of little bones in the middle ear to the inner ear. There they stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve to transmit impulses to the brain. The outer ear looks complicated but it is the simplest part of the ear. It consists of the pinna or auricle (the visible projecting portion of the ear), the external acoustic meatus (the outside opening to the ear canal), and the external ear canal that leads to the ear drum. In sum, there is the pinna, the meatus and the canal. That's all. And the external ear has only to concentrate air vibrations on the ear drum and make the drum vibrate. The middle ear consists of the ear drum (the tympanum or tympanic membrane) and, beyond it, a cavity. This cavity is connected via a canal (the Eustachian tube) to the pharynx (the nasopharynx). The Eustachian tube permits the gas pressure in the middle ear cavity to adjust to external air pressure (so, as you're descending in a plane, it's the Eustachian tube that opens when your ears ""open"").) The middle ear cavity also contains a chain of 3 little bones (ossicles) that connect the ear drum to the internal ear. The ossicles are named (not the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria but) the malleus, incus, and stapes. In sum, the middle ear communicates with the pharynx, equilibrates with external pressure and transmits the ear drum vibrations to the inner ear. The internal ear is highly complex. The essential component of the inner ear for hearing is the membranous labyrinth where the fibers of the auditory nerve (the nerve connecting the ear to the brain) end. The membranous labyrinth is a system of communicating sacs and ducts (tubes) filled with fluid (the endolymph). The membranous labyrinth is lodged within a cavity called the bony labyrinth. At some points the membranous labyrinth is attached to the bony labyrinth and at other points the membranous labyrinth is suspended in a fluid (the perilymph) within the bony labyrinth. The bony labyrinth has three parts: a central cavity (the vestibule), semicircular canals (which open into the vestibule) and the cochlea (a snail-shaped spiral tube). The membranous labyrinth also has a vestibule which consists of two sacs (called the utriculus and sacculus) connected by a narrow tube. The utriculus, the larger of the two sacs, is the principal organ of the vestibular system (which informs us about the position and movement of the head). The smaller of the two sacs, the sacculus (literally, the little sac) is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing the organ of Corti. It is in the organ of Corti that are situated the hair cells, the special sensory receptors for hearing."
Ear cleaning (by a doctor),"Ear cleaning (by a doctor): When ear wax accumulates enough, it may block the ear canal (and hearing). A health care professional may have to wash it out, vacuum it, or remove it with special instruments. Alternatively, your physician may prescribe ear drops that are designed to soften the wax."
Ear thermometer,"Ear thermometer: A thermometer that registers body temperature via the ear canal. The ear thermometer was invented in 1964 by Dr. Theodor H. Benzinger. Dr. Benzinger worked from 1947 to 1970 at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland where he studied temperature regulation and helped create the field of biothermodynamics. He created the ear thermometer while looking for a way to take a person's temperature and get a reading as close as possible to the temperature center of the brain temperature, the hypothalamus. Because the hypothalamus and the eardrum share blood vessels, Benzinger decided to use the ear canal to take a reading. (Until that time, attaching electrodes to the hypothalamus was the only way to get a brain temperature reading.) Prior to Benzinger's invention of the ear thermometer, temperature readings were typically obtained by placing a thermometer in the mouth, rectum or under the arm. The ear temperature most closely correlates with the brain temperature and is therefore, if properly taken, the best body temperature reading. Theodor Hannes Benzinger was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1905 and died in Bethesda in 1999 at the age of 94. He was also the inventor of a device to measure calorie loss and made many other important contributions to medicine and science including the Planck-Benzinger modification of the second law of thermodynamics."
"Ear, low-set","Ear, low-set: A minor anomaly involving an ear situated down below its normal location. The ear is low-set when the helix (of the ear) meets the cranium at a level below that of a horizontal plane through both inner canthi (the inside corners of the eyes). ."
Eardrum,"Eardrum: The tympanic membrane of the ear, or tympanum. The eardrum separates the middle ear from the external ear."
EB (epidermolysis bullosa),EB (epidermolysis bullosa): See: Epidermolysis bullosa.
EBCT (electron beam computerized tomography),"EBCT (electron beam computerized tomography): A new (and controversial) noninvasive test for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). EBCT, or Ultrafast CT (as the technique will be termed here) is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. In patients with CAD, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with Ultrafast CT. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiologic stress testing. The importance of detecting such mild blockages is controversial, however, because the only ""treatment"" that is used for such blockages typically involves risk factor modification (especially cholesterol reduction and smoking cessation as well as aspirin and certain vitamins). A potential limitation of Ultrafast CT is that only a total calcium score is reported. This means that two or three separate blockages of about 30% each will result in the same score as a single 70-80% blockage. The Ultrafast CT does not give an image of specific separate areas of calcification. The major value of Ultrafast CT appears to be in screening young patients with one or more risk factors for the development of CAD. Ultrafast CT scanning is of limited value for older patients in whom some degree of calcification is commonly found. Additionally, for the reasons described above, the detection of some calcification may not be reflective of significant CAD. Ultrafast CT was reported to be a better test than treadmill-ECG or technetium-stress test for detecting CAD (J Am Coll Cardiol 2000;36:32-38,326-340). The authors favored it as ""a reasonable alternative to traditional stress testing"" (pointing also to its cost, brief test time and the fact that a physician does not usually need to be present during the scan). In the same journal, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a consensus statement opposing the widespread use of Ultrafast CT. The controversy continues."
EC,"EC: 1. Endocannabinoid.
2. Extracranial.
3. Embryonal carcinoma."
Ecchymosis,"Ecchymosis: Nonraised skin discoloration caused by the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels. Ecchymoses can occur in mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth)."
ECG,ECG: Electrocardiogram.
Echinacea,"Echinacea: An herb that has been claimed to boost the body's immune system and help fight off infections. Echinacea has been widely used to treat the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), including colds and the flu. The herb is derived from the purple coneflower, Echinacea purpurea, a drought-tolerant perennial plant native to North America with large purple flowers surrounding a large cone. However, the efficacy of echinacea in treating URIs has not been established. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, echinacea was found not to shorten the duration of a cold or lessen its severity in children (JAMA 2003;290:2824-2830). The most common side effect of echinacea is an unpleasant taste. Echinacea can cause liver toxicity. It should be avoided in combination with other medications that can affect the liver (such as ketoconazole, leflunomide /Arava, methotrexate /Rheumatrex, isoniazide/Inh/Nizoral). Another side effect is rash. Echinacea is sold over the counter without a prescription. It is one of the most popular alternative therapies."
Echocardiography,"Echocardiography: Echocardiography is a diagnostic test which uses ultrasound waves to make images of the heart chambers, valves and surrounding structures. It can measure cardiac output and is a sensitive test for fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion). It can also be used to detect abnormal anatomy or infections of the heart valves."
Echopraxia,"Echopraxia: The involuntary imitation of the movements of another person. Echopraxia is a feature of schizophrenia (especially the catatonic form), Tourette syndrome, and some other neurologic diseases. From echo + the Greek praxia meaning action."
Eclampsia,Eclampsia: Convulsions (seizures) occurring with pregnancy-associated high blood pressure and having no other known cause.
Eclosion,"Eclosion: The emergence of an adult insect from its pupal case, or the hatching of an insect larva from an egg. From the French eclosion, from eclore, to open."
Economy class syndrome,"Economy class syndrome: The formation of blood clots in veins deep within the legs -- deep vein thrombosis -- occurring during (or just after) a long airplane flight, especially in economy class (tourist class) where there is the least space allotted per passenger and ones legs tend especially to be immobilized for lack of leg room. The economy class syndrome is directly related to immobility for long periods during which blood pools in the legs, raising the risk of clot formation. The tendency to immobility is often compounded by the fasten-seat belt sign, the presence of carts in the aisles, etc. Other risk factors contributing to the syndrome include lower oxygen pressure and dehydration. Changes in oxygen pressure in the cabin tend to decrease the oxygen level in the blood. The air in the cabin lacks the normal degree of humidity which contributes to dehydration. The serving of coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages (all of which are diuretics) further causes passengers to become dehydrated. The economy class syndrome is not confined to that class on a plane. It is recommended that all persons traveling on air flights, irrespective of which class they are in, drink lots of water and move their legs by walking whenever possible and by periodically flexing and extending their ankles, knees, and hips to minimize the risk of economy class syndrome. Deep vein thrombosis is potentially serious and can even have fatal consequences."
Ecstasy,"Ecstasy: 1. A state of rapture and trancelike elation.
2. A street name for 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), best known on the street as ""Ecstacy."" An illicit drug, considered a recreational or party drug. It acts as both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. Ecstasy achieves its high by preventing the brain from reabsorbing the chemical serotonin, thereby prolonging its effects in the body. Ecstasy also appears to impair the thought process. German researchers studied 28 ecstasy users (who had used the drug an average of 3.5 times a month for about 2 years) and found they performed significantly worse on tests of memory, learning, and general intelligence than nondrug users and than pot smokers. (Ref.: Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry 2000;68:719-725). Ecstasy is also considered a ""possible"" teratogen, an agent that can disturb the development of the embryo or fetus. British researchers have reported that of 136 pregnancies during which the mothers took Ecstasy, 78 babies were born alive and of these, 15.4% had birth defects including clubfoot, skull defects, toe malformations and two cases of congenital heart defects. By comparison, the malformation rate for pregnant women in the general population is about 3%. This study was not large enough to prove a link between Ecstasy and birth defects, but these findings are good evidence that Ecstasy should be completely avoided by pregnant women. (Ref.: Lancet 1999;354:1441-1442.) See also: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine."
ectomy,"Ectomy: The surgical removal of something. For example, a lumpectomy is the surgical removal of a lump, a tonsillectomy is the removal of the tonsils, and an appendectomy is removal of the appendix."
Ectoparasite,Ectoparasite: A parasite that lives on or in the skin but not within the body. Fleas and lice are ectoparasites. Infestation with an ectoparasite is called an ectoparasitosis.
Ectopic,"Ectopic: In the wrong place, out of place. For example, an ectopic kidney is a kidney that is not in the usual 'location."
Ectopic pregnancy,"Ectopic pregnancy: A pregnancy that is not in the uterus. The fertilized egg settles and grows in any location other than the inner lining of the uterus. The large majority (95%) of ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tube. However, they can occur in other locations, such as the ovary, cervix, and abdominal cavity. An ectopic pregnancy occurs in about 1 in 60 pregnancies. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in women 35 to 44 years of age. The term ""ectopic"" comes from the Greek ""ektopis"" meaning ""displacement"" (""ek"", out of + ""topos"", place = out of place). The first person to use ""ectopic"" in a medical context was the English obstetrician Robert Barnes (1817-1907) who applied it to an extrauterine pregnancy: an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are frequently due to an inability of the fertilized egg to make its way through a Fallopian tube into the uterus. Risk factors predisposing to an ectopic pregnancy include: A major concern with an ectopic pregnancy is internal bleeding. If there is any doubt, seek medical attention promptly. Pain is usually the first symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. The pain is usually sharp and stabbing. It is often on one side and may be in the pelvis, abdomen or even in the shoulder or neck (due to blood from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy building up under the diaphragm and the pain being ""referred"" up to the shoulder or neck). Weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness, and a sense of passing out upon standing can represent serious internal bleeding, requiring immediate medical attention. Diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy includes a pelvic exam to test for pain, tenderness or a mass in the abdomen. The most useful laboratory test is the measurement of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). In a normal pregnancy, the level of hCG doubles about every two days during the first 10 weeks whereas in an ectopic pregnancy, the hCG rise is usually slower and lower than normal. Ultrasound can also help determine if a pregnancy is ectopic, as may sometimes culdocentesis, the insertion of a needle through the vagina into the space behind the uterus to see if there is blood there from a ruptured Fallopian tube. Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is surgery, often by laparoscopy today, to remove the ill-fated pregnancy. A ruptured tube usually has to be removed. If the tube has yet not burst, it may be possible to repair it. The prognosis (outlook) for future pregnancies depends on the extent of the surgery. If the Fallopian tube has been spared, the chance of a successful pregnancy is usually better than 50%. If a Fallopian tube has been removed, an egg can be fertilized in the other tube, and the chance of a successful pregnancy drops somewhat below 50%. "
Ectrodactyly,"Ectrodactyly: The congenital absence of all or part of one or more fingers or toes. The term ectrodactyly has been applied to a variety of malformations of the fingers or toes. It is probably best reserved for: Cases of ectrodactyly defined in this way are usually sporadic (with no family history of this malformation). As a rule, one hand is involved and the feet are not affected. Congenital constriction rings (""amniotic bands"") are sometimes associated with the malformation. The hereditary condition called split-hand/split-foot malformation and sometimes called lobster-claw deformity is also termed ectrodactyly, as does another hereditary disorder called the EEC syndrome. (EEC stands for ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial cleft.) The word ectrodactyly is derived from the Greek ektroma (abortion) and daktylos (finger) = literally, abortion (of a) finger."
Eczema,"Eczema (dermatitis) is a particular type of inflammatory reaction of the skin in which there is erythema (reddening), edema (swelling), papules (bumps), and crusting of the skin followed, finally, by lichenification (thickening) and scaling of the skin. Eczema characteristically causes itching and burning of the skin. Atopic eczema, which is also called atopic dermatitis, is a very common skin problem. It may start in infancy, later in childhood, or in adulthood. Once it gets underway, it tends not to go quickly away. There are numerous types of eczema:"
Edema,Edema: The swelling of soft tissues as a result of excess fluid accumulation. Edema is often most prominent in the lower legs and feet toward the end of the day because fluid pools while people maintain an upright position.
Edentulous,"Edentulous: Being without teeth. Complete loss of all natural teeth can substantially reduce quality of life, self-image, and daily functioning."
Effacement,"Effacement: Thinning of the cervix, which occurs before and while the cervix dilates."
Effective dose,Effective dose: The dose of a drug that will achieve the desired effect.
Efferent,"Efferent: Carrying away. For example, an artery is an efferent vessel that carries blood away from the heart, and an efferent nerve carries impulses away from the central nervous system. The opposite of efferent is afferent."
Effusion,"Effusion: Too much fluid, an outpouring of fluid. For example, a pleural effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the lungs and the chest wall, while a knee effusion is an abnormal amount of fluid in the knee joint. A hemorrhagic effusion contains blood in the fluid."
EGFR,"EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor. A protein found on the surface of cells to which epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds. When EGF attaches to EGFR, it activates the enzyme tyrosine kinase, triggering reactions that cause the cells to grow and multiply. EGFR is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, which may divide excessively in the presence of EGF. The drug Iressa attaches to EGFR and thereby inhibits the attachment of EGF and stops cell division. The gene for EGFR is on chromosome 7p12.3-p12.1. The EGFR molecule has 3 regions -- one projects outside the cell and contains the site for binding EGF; the second is embedded in the cell membrane; and the third projects into the cytoplasm of the cell's interior. EGFR is a kinase that attaches phosphate groups to tyrosine residues in proteins. EGFR is also known confusingly as ErbB1, ErbB, oncogene ErbB, and HER1."
Eisoptrophobia,"Eisoptrophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of mirrors. Sufferers experience undue anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. Because their fear often is grounded in superstitions, they may worry that breaking a mirror will bring bad luck or that looking into a mirror will put them in contact with a supernatural world inside the glass. Mirrors and other reflective surfaces have long been associated with the strange or the bizarre. For example, in Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own image reflected in the water of a fountain. He thought he was seeing the image of a beautiful nymph. Unable to embrace or call forth the image, he pined away and was eventually transformed into a flower. In The Picture of Dorian Gray, a novel by Oscar Wilde, a portrait of a handsome young man begins to deteriorate, reflecting the corruption of the man's inner being. The portrait becomes a mirror reflecting the state of the young man's soul. The man eventually commits murder and suicide. ""Eisoptrophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""eis"" (into) and ""optikos"" (vision, image, sight). Other English words derived from ""optikos"" include ""optic"" (relating to vision) and ""optician,"" a technician who designs eyeglasses according to a prescription."
Ejaculation,Ejaculation: Ejection of sperm and seminal fluid during an orgasm in a male.
Ejection fraction,"Ejection fraction: The percentage of blood that is pumped out of a filled ventricle as a result of a heartbeat. The heart does not eject all the blood in the ventricle. Only about two-thirds of the blood is normally pumped out with each beat, and that fraction is referred to as the ejection fraction. The ejection fraction is an indicator of the heart's health. If the heart is diseased from a heart attack or another heart condition, the ejection fraction may decrease."
Elavil,Elavil: See: Amitriptyline.
Elbow,"Elbow: The juncture of the long bones in the middle portion of the upper extremity. The bone of the arm (humerus) meets both the ulna (the inner bone of the forearm) and radius (the outer bone of the forearm) to form a hinge joint at the elbow. The radius and ulna also meet one another in the elbow to permit a small amount of rotation of the forearm. The elbow therefore functions to move the arm like a hinge (forward and backward) and in rotation (outward and inward). The biceps muscle is the major muscle that flexes the elbow hinge, and the triceps muscle is the major muscle that extends it. The primary stability of the elbow is provided by the ulnar collateral ligament, located on the medial (inner) side of the elbow. The outer bony prominence of the elbow is the lateral epicondyle, a part of the humerus bone. Tendons attached to this area can be injured, causing inflammation or tendonitis (lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow). The inner portion of the elbow is a bony prominence called the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Additional tendons from muscles attach here and can be injured, likewise causing inflammation or tendonitis (medial epicondylitis, or golfer's elbow)."
the,"Elbow, cellulitis of the: Inflammation of the skin around the elbow due to infection (cellulitis) commonly occurs as a result of abrasions or puncture wounds permitting bacteria on the surface of the skin to invade the deeper layers of the skin. This causes inflamed skin characterized by heat, redness, warmth, and swelling. The most common bacteria that cause cellulitis include Staphylococcus (""Staph"") and Streptococcus (""Streop""). One can have an associated low-grade fever. Cellulitis generally requires antibiotic treatment, either orally or intravenously. Heat application can help in the healing process."
the,"Elbow, tip of the: The bony tip of the elbow is called the olecranon. It is formed by the near end of the ulna, one of the two long bones in the forearm (the other is the radius). The triceps muscle tendon of the back of the arm attaches to the tip of the elbow (the olecranon). Diseases can affect the olecranon. For example, inflammation of the tiny fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the tip of the elbow van occur; it is referred to as olecranon bursitis. And also, for example, a firm nodule can form at the tip of the elbow; it is referred to as an olecranon nodule (and can be found in gout or rheumatoid arthritis). The olecranon is also called the olecranon process of the ulna."
Elective,"Elective: In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time."
Elective surgery,"Elective surgery: Surgery that is subject to choice (election). The choice may be made by the patient or doctor. For example, the time when a surgical procedure is performed may be elective. The procedure is beneficial to the patient but does not need be done at a particular time. As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery."
Electrocardiogram,"Electrocardiogram: A recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Abbreviated ECG and EKG. An ECG is a simple, noninvasive procedure. Electrodes are placed on the skin of the chest and connected in a specific order to a machine that, when turned on, measures electrical activity all over the heart. Output usually appears on a long scroll of paper that displays a printed graph of activity on a computer screen. The initial diagnosis of heart attack is usually made through observation of a combination of clinical symptoms and characteristic ECG changes. An ECG can detect areas of muscle deprived of oxygen and/or dead tissue in the heart. If a medication is known to sometimes adversely affect heart function, a baseline ECG may be ordered before the patient starts taking the medicine, and follow-up testing may occur at regular intervals to look for any changes."
Electrogastrogram,"Electrogastrogram: A test in which the electrical current generated by the muscle of the stomach is sensed and recorded in a manner very similar to that of an electrocardiogram of the heart. Abbreviated EGG. An EGG is performed by taping electrodes to the skin on the upper abdomen over the stomach. Recordings from the muscle are stored and analyzed by a computer. An EGG is performed to diagnose motility disorders of the stomach, conditions that prevent the muscles of the stomach from working normally."
Electrolyte,"Electrolyte: A substance that dissociates into ions in solution and acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as lytes. Electrolyte replacement is needed when a patient has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and as a response to strenuous athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, particularly for sick children (solutions such as Pedialyte) and athletes (sports drinks, such as Gatorade). Electrolyte monitoring is important in treatment of anorexia and bulimia."
Electrophysiology,"Electrophysiology: The biomedical field dealing with the study of electric activity in the body. Electrophysiology includes the study of the production of electrical activity and the effects of that electrical activity on the body. See, for example: Electrophysiologic retinal testing ; and Electrophysiologic study of the heart."
Elevated hemidiaphragm,"Elevated hemidiaphragm: Elevation of half of the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and that serves as the main muscle of respiration. The elevation of a hemidiaphragm is a significant sign of a problem. That problem may lie below, within or above the diaphragm:"
Emboli,"Emboli: Something that travels through the bloodstream, lodges in a blood vessel and blocks it. Examples of emboli are a detached blood clot, a clump of bacteria, and foreign material such as air. Pulmonary emboli are blood clots that have been carried through the blood into the pulmonary artery (the main blood vessel from the heart to the lung) or one of its branches, plugging that vessel. Emboli is the plural of embolus, a word that comes from the Greek ""embolos"" meaning a wedge or plug. ""Embolos"" was derived from ""en"" (in) + ""ballein"" (to throw) so emboli are something thrown in."
Embolism,"Embolism: The obstruction of a blood vessel by a foreign substance or a blood clot that travels through the bloodstream, lodging in a blood vessel, plugging the vessel. Foreign substances that can cause embolisms include air bubbles, amniotic fluid, globules of fat, clumps of bacteria, chemicals (such as talc), and drugs (mainly illegal ones). Blood clots are the most common causes of embolisms. A pulmonary embolus is a blood clot that has been carried through the blood into the pulmonary artery (the main blood vessel from the heart to the lung) or one of its branches, plugging that vessel within the lung."
Embolus,"Embolus: A blockage or plug that obstructs a blood 'vessel. Examples of emboli are detached blood clots, clumps of bacteria, and clumps of other foreign material, such as air."
Embryo,"Embryo: An organism in the early stages of growth and differentiation, from fertilization to the beginning of the third month of pregnancy (in humans). After that point in time, an embryo is called a fetus."
Emergency code,"Emergency code: While there is no formal definition for a ""Code,"" doctors often use the term as slang to refer to a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest , requiring a team of providers (sometimes called a ""code team"") to rush to the specific location and begin immediate resuscitative efforts. The term ""Code"" derives from the practice at many institutions of using ""Code"" designations followed by colors (""Code blue""), numbers (""Code 10"") or other qualifying terms to alert personnel in the event of an emergency and to specify what type of emergency is occurring. (Code pink is often used to alert security that a baby is missing from the hospital nursery!) There are no standard definitions or conventions for the use of ""Code"" designations, and each institution that uses a ""Code"" system can decide how to apply the system. For example, while ""Code blue"" refers to a cardiopulmonary arrest at many hospitals, it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing everywhere. Other types of emergencies, (for example bomb threats, terrorist activity, child abductions, or mass casualties) may also be given ""Code"" designations."
Emergency department,Emergency department: The department of a hospital responsible for the provision of medical and surgical care to patients arriving at the hospital in need of immediate care. Emergency department personnel may also respond to certain situations within the hospital such cardiac arrests. The emergency department is also called the emergency room or ER.
Emesis,Emesis: Vomiting.
emia,"emia: Suffix meaning blood or referring to the presence of a substance in the blood. As for example, anemia (lack of blood) and hypervolemia (too high a volume of blood). The ending -emia is one of the building blocks derived from Greek (in this case) or Latin used to construct medical terms. From the Greek haima blood + -ia."
Emphysema,"Emphysema: is a lung condition featuring an abnormal accumulation of air due to enlargement and destruction of the lung's many tiny air sacs resulting in the formation of scar tissue. The destruction of the air sacs and formation of scar tissue is permanent and the disease is incurable, however medication may be helpful to ease symptoms. Emphysema is strongly associated with smoking cigarettes. The best response to the early warning signs of emphysema is to stop smoking."
Empiric risk,"Empiric risk: The chance that a disease will occur in a family, based on experience with the diagnosis, past history, and medical records rather than theory."
Empirical,"Empirical: Based on experience and observation rather than on systematic logic. Experienced physicians often use empirical reasoning to make diagnoses, based on having seen many cases over the years. Less-experienced physicians are more likely to use diagnostic guides and manuals. In practice, both approaches (if properly applied) can lead to the same diagnosis."
Empyema,"Empyema: Empyema is a condition in which pus and fluid from infected tissue collects in a body cavity. The name comes from the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing (suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to collections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cavity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in the gall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema may have a number of causes but is most frequently a complication of pneumonia. Its development can be divided into three phases: an acute phase in which the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containing some pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens and a fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumulate within the cavity, and a third or chronic stage in which the lung or other organ is encased within a thick covering of fibrous material."
Enanthem,"Enanthem: Or enanthema, is a rash inside the body. An example: the spots in measles (Koplik's spots) inside the mouth that look like a tiny grains of white sand surrounded by a red ring. By contrast, a rash on the outside of the body is called an exanthem. A patient with measles may have both an exanthem and an enanthem or enanthema."
Encapsulated,"Encapsulated: Confined to a specific area. For example, an encapsulated tumor remains in a compact form."
Encephalitis,"Encephalitis: Inflammation of the brain, which may be caused by a bacterium, a virus, or an allergic reaction. Some forms of viral encephalitis are contagious. Encephalitis usually runs a short course, with full recovery within a week, but can cause brain damage and death. Treatment of encephalitis must begin as early as possible to avoid potentially serious and lifelong effects. Depending on the cause of the inflammation, treatment may include use of antibiotics, antiviral medications, and anti-inflammatory drugs. If brain damage results from encephalitis, therapy (such as physical therapy or cognitive restoration therapy) may help patients regain lost functions."
Encephalopathy,"Encephalopathy: Disease, damage, or malfunction of the brain. In general, encephalopathy is manifested by an altered mental state that is sometimes accompanied by physical changes. Although numerous causes of encephalopathy are known, the majority of cases arise from infection, liver damage, anoxia, or kidney failure. The term encephalopathy is very broad and, in most cases, is preceded by various terms that describe the reason, cause, or special conditions of the patient that leads to brain malfunction. For example, anoxic encephalopathy means brain damage due to lack of oxygen, and hepatic encephalopathy means brain malfunction due to liver disease. Depending upon the cause and severity of the condition, symptoms may range from mild alterations in mental status to severe and potentially fatal manifestations such as dementia, seizures, and coma."
End stage,"End stage: The last phase in the course of a progressive disease. As in end-stage liver disease, end-stage lung disease, end-stage renal disease, end-stage cancer, etc. The term ""end stage"" has come to replace ""terminal""."
End-stage renal disease,End-stage renal disease: ESRD. Chronic irreversible renal failure.
Endemic,"Endemic: A characteristic of a particular population, environment, or region. Examples of endemic diseases include chicken pox that occurs at a predictable rate among young school children in the United States and malaria in some areas of Africa. The disease is present in a community at all times but in relatively low frequency. By contrast, there are the related terms ""epidemic"" and ""pandemic"": The word ""endemic"" comes from the Greek ""en-"", ""in"" + ""demos"", ""people or population"" = ""endemos"" = ""in the population."" An endemic is in the people. By contrast, ""epi-"" means ""upon."" An epidemic is visited upon the people. And ""pan-"" means ""all."" A pandemic affects all the people."
Endocarditis,"Endocarditis: an inflammation of one or more of the heart valves and lining tissues of the heart. Having existing congenital defects or damage to the heart valves increases the risk of developing endocarditis. The most common cause of endocarditis is bacterial infection, but fungi can also cause the condition. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, chills, and weakness. Long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy, up to 4 to 6 weeks, is the treatment for bacterial endocarditis. In severe cases, valve damage may occur that necessitates surgical replacement of a valve. Complications can include heart failure, stroke, and brain abscess."
Endocrine,"Endocrine: Pertaining to hormones and the glands that make and secrete them into the bloodstream through which they travel to affect distant organs. The endocrine sites include the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids, heart (which makes atrial-natriuretic peptide), the stomach and intestines, islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, the adrenal glands, the kidney (which makes renin, erythropoietin, and calcitriol), fat cells (which make leptin). the testes, the ovarian follicle (estrogens) and the corpus luteum in the ovary). Endocrine is as opposed to exocrine. (The exocrine glands include the salivary glands, sweat glands and glands within the gastrointestinal tract.) "

Endometrial hyperplasia,Endometrial hyperplasia: A condition characterized by overgrowth of the lining of the uterus.
Endometrioma,"Endometrioma: : Part of the condition known as endometriosis. Endometrioma is a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue (the mucous membrane that makes up the inner layer of the uterine wall) grows in the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelvic pain associated with menstruation. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and tissue outside the uterus. Women with endometriosis may have problems with fertility. Endometrioid cysts, often filled with dark, reddish-brown blood, may range in size from 0.75-8 inches. Endometrioma is also referred to as an endometrioid cyst."
Endometriosis,"Endometriosis: The presence of tissue that normally grows inside the uterus (womb) in an abnormal anatomical location. Endometriosis is very common and may not produce symptoms, or it may lead to painful menstruation. It has also been associated with infertility. Endometriosis occurs most commonly within the Fallopian tubes and on the outside of the tubes and ovaries, the outer surface of the uterus and intestines, and anywhere on the surface of the pelvic cavity. It can also be found, less often, on the surface of the liver, in old surgery scars or, very rarely, in the lung or brain. Endometriosis occurs in the reproductive years. The average age at diagnosis is 25-30.Endometriosis may be suspected by during a physical examination; it is confirmed by surgery, usually laparoscopy; available treatments include medication for pain, hormone therapy, and surgery. Common Misspellings: andrometriosis, endometreosis, endometrisis, edometriosis, indometriosis"
Endopeptidase,"Endopeptidase: An enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds within a polypeptide or protein. Peptidase refers to the fact that it acts on peptide bonds and endopeptidase refers to the fact that these are internal bonds. An exopeptide catalyzes the cleavage of the terminal or penultimate peptide bond, releasing a single amino acid or dipeptide from the peptide chain."
Endoscope,"Endoscope: A lighted optical instrument that is used to get a deep look inside the body. An endoscope, which may be rigid or flexible, can be used to examine organs, such as the throat or esophagus. Specialized endoscopes are named for where they are intended to look. Examples include the cystoscope (bladder), nephroscope (kidney), bronchoscope (bronchi), laryngoscope (larynx), otoscope (ear), arthroscope (joint), laparoscope (abdomen), and gastrointestinal endoscopes."
Endoscopy,"Endoscopy: Examination of the inside of the body by using a lighted, flexible instrument called an endoscope. In general, an endoscope is introduced into the body through a natural opening such as the mouth or anus. Although endoscopy can include examination of other organs, the most common endoscopic procedures evaluate the esophagus, stomach, and portions of the intestine."
Endothelial,Endothelial: Relating to the endothelium.
Endothelium,"Endothelium: A layer of flat cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the inside of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels (that convey the lymph, a milky fluid) and the heart. By contrast, the outside layer of cells that covers all the free, open surfaces of the body including the skin, and mucous membranes that communicate with the outside of the body is called the epithelium. The word ""endothelium"" is derived from the Greek ""endon,"" within + G. ""thele,"" nipple."
Endotracheal tube,"Endotracheal tube: A flexible plastic tube that is put in the mouth and then down into the trachea (airway). A physician inserts an endotracheal tube under direct vision, with the help of a laryngoscope, in a procedure called endotracheal intubation. The purpose of using an endotracheal tube is to ventilate the lungs."
Endourologist,"Endourologist: A urologist with special expertise in navigating inside the kidneys, ureter, and bladder, using endoscopic optical instruments and other tools. Endourologists are specialists in diagnosing and treating diseases of these organs."
Endovaginal ultrasound,"Endovaginal ultrasound: This type of imaging test is a special form of ultrasound developed to examine the pelvic organs and is the best test for diagnosing an ovarian cyst. A cyst can be diagnosed based on its appearance on the ultrasound. An endovaginal ultrasound is a painless procedure that resembles a pelvic exam. A thin, covered wand or probe is placed into the vagina, and the examiner directs the probe toward the uterus and ovaries. This type of ultrasound produces a better image than a scan through the abdominal wall can because the probe can be positioned closer to the ovaries. Using an endovaginal ultrasound, the internal cystic structure may be categorized as simple (just fluid filled), complex (with areas of fluid mixed with solid material), or completely solid (with no obvious fluid)."
Enema,Enema: Liquid injected into the rectum. An enema may be used for therapeutic (such as to stimulate evacuation of the bowels or heal inflammation of colon called colitis ) or diagnostic (such as imaging studies of the gastrointestinal tract - barium enema) purposes.
Enervate,"Enervate: 1. To remove part or all of a nerve, a procedure also called a neurectomy. 2. To lose nervous energy and feel sapped of energy.
From the Latin enervare (e-, out of + nervare from nervus, nerve) = out of nerve."
Engagement,"Engagement: The sensation that a pregnant woman feels when the lowermost part of the fetus descends and is engaged in the mother's pelvis, an event that typically occurs 2 to 3 weeks before labor begins. Women who have had two or more prior viable pregnancies (multiparas) may not experience engagement until labor actually begins. When engagement occurs, there is a visible change in the shape of the woman's stomach because the baby drops lower in the abdomen. Also known as lightening because the pregnant woman feels lighter after this event. Most women feel more comfortable after engagement, but some may experience lower back pain as the fetus presses close to the tailbone and the sciatic nerve. Others may find movement more difficult due to the lower center of gravity caused by engagement."
Enlarged heart,"Enlarged heart: Enlargement of the heart. An enlarged heart is a descriptive term that is used to refer to the physical finding of an enlarged heart and is not a disease itself. Heart enlargement can be caused by a number of different conditions including diseases of the heart muscle or heart valves, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. Enlarged heart can also sometimes accompany longstanding anemia and thyroid disease, among other conditions. Treatment and prognosis are dependent upon the underlying cause. Also referred to medically as cardiomegaly."
ENT,"ENT: 1. Abbreviation for ears, nose and throat. A field of medicine also called otolaryngology. 2. Abbreviation for electronystagmogram, a recording of the eye movements."
ENT physician,"ENT physician: A medical specialist who is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the head and neck, including particularly the ears, nose, and throat. ENT doctors are also called otolaryngologists."
Entamoeba histolytica,"Entamoeba histolytica: The agent of amebic dysentery, a disorder with inflammation of the intestine and ulceration of the colon. Entamoeba histolytica is a single-celled parasite that is transmitted to humans via contaminated water and food. It can also infect the liver and other organs."
Enteral,Enteral: Pertaining to the small intestine. As in enteral nutrition. Also called enteric.
Enteric,Enteric: Of or relating to the small intestine.
Enteric-coated,"Enteric-coated: Coated with a material that permits transit through the stomach to the small intestine before the medication is released. The term ""enteric"" means ""of or relating to the small intestine."""
Entero-,"Entero-: Prefix referring to the intestine, as in enteropathy (a disease of the intestine) and enterospasm (a painful, intense contraction of the intestine)."
Enterospasm,"Enterospasm: A painful, intense contraction of the intestine."
Enterostomy,"Enterostomy: A surgical operation that opens the small intestine and brings it through the abdominal wall to create a new opening (a stoma) to permit intestinal draining. Like a colostomy, an enterostomy is a type of ostomy."
Enterovirus,"Enterovirus: A virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and thrives there, often moving on to attack the nervous system. The polioviruses are enteroviruses.

Enteroviruses are small viruses that are made of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein. In addition to the three different polioviruses, there are a number of non-polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans, including the Coxsackieviruses (Coxsackie A viruses and Coxsackie B viruses), echoviruses, and other enteroviruses. Enteroviruses can be found in the respiratory secretions (for example, saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person. Other people may become infected by direct contact with secretions from an infected person or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as a drinking glass or telephone. Parents, teachers, and child-care-center workers may also become infected by contamination of the hands with stool from an infected infant or toddler during diaper changes. Infections caused by enteroviruses are most likely to occur during the summer and fall. Most people who are infected with an enterovirus have no disease at all. Infected people who become ill usually develop either mild upper respiratory symptoms (a ""cold""), a flu-like illness with fever, and muscle aches, or an illness with rash. Less commonly, some people have aseptic or viral meningitis. Rarely, a person may develop an illness that affects the heart (myocarditis) or the brain (encephalitis) or causes paralysis. In early fall 2014, an outbreak of infection with a non-polio enterovirus known as enterovirus D68, or EV-D68, sickened many children across multiple U.S. states, many of whom required care in a hospital intensive-care unit. Enterovirus infections have been suspected to play some role in the development of type 1 diabetes, although they do not directly cause the condition. Newborns who become infected with an enterovirus may rarely develop an overwhelming infection of many organs, including the liver and heart, and die from the infection. There are usually no long-term complications from the mild illnesses or from aseptic meningitis. Some patients who have paralysis or encephalitis, however, do not fully recover. People who develop heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy) from myocarditis require long-term care for their conditions. No vaccine is currently available for the enteroviruses, aside from poliovirus. General cleanliness and frequent handwashing are probably effective in reducing the spread of these viruses. In 2014 there was a widespread outbreak of respiratory infections due to the Enterovirus D68 strain. This caused severe wheezing and coughing in affected individuals. In 2015 and 2016, the incidence of this virus has decreased dramatically."
Entomophobia,"Entomophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of insects. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize that most insects pose no threat. To avoid insects, they may frequently clean rooms and carpets, sweep hallways, spray insect-killer or seal off doors and windows. Entophobia (insect phobia) includes acarophobia (mites: scabies) and arachnophobia (spiders). A true insect phobia is defined by a persistent irrational fear of and compelling desire to avoid insects, mites, spiders, or similar phobic objects and significant distress from the disturbance despite recognition by the phobic person that their fear is inappropriate, unreasonable, and excessive. ""Entomophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""entomos"" (insect) and ""phobos"" (fear). The study of insects is called entomology."
Enucleation,"Enucleation: The surgical removal of an eye. Enucleation is done under drastic circumstances such as to remove a malignant tumor in the eye or to relieve intolerable pain in a blind eye. Following enucleation, an artificial eye (ocular prosthesis) is implanted as a cosmetic substitute for the real eye."
Enuresis,"Enuresis: Involuntary urination, which may be caused by a variety of factors. These include disorders of the kidneys, bladder, or ureter and/or poor control of the muscles that control the release of urine. Enuresis is also occasionally associated with neurological disorders, such as Tourette's syndrome, particularly in children. Nighttime (nocturnal) enuresis may be related to any of the above, or may be a symptom of a sleep disorder. Treatment options include regularly scheduled toileting, increasing awareness of the need to urinate, exercises intended to strengthen the muscles that control release of urine (see Kegel exercises), pads and in some cases special devices that alert the patient to initial signs of wetness. Cognitive behavioral therapy or behavior modification techniques can be helpful. Prescription medication, most often desmopressin (a tablet) can also be helpful in certain circumstances in children over the age of 5. See also Bedwetting."
Environment,"Environment: The sum of the total of the elements, factors and conditions in the surroundings which may have an impact on the development, action or survival of an organism or group of organisms."
Enzootic,"Enzootic: Endemic in animals. An enzootic disease is constantly present in an animal population, but usually only affects a small number of animals at any one time."
Enzyme,"Enzyme: Proteins that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction in a living organism. An enzyme acts as catalyst for specific chemical reactions, converting a specific set of reactants (called substrates) into specific products. Without enzymes, life as we know it would not exist."
EOS,"EOS: The gene for familial eosinophilia. EOS has been mapped to chromosome region 5q31-33 containing the cytokine gene cluster which includes the genes for interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and all of which are thought play roles in the development, proliferation, and activation of eosinophils."
Eosinophilia,"Eosinophilia: An abnormally high number of eosinophils in the blood. Normally, eosinophils constitute 1 to 3% of the peripheral blood leukocytes, at a count of 350 to 650 per cubic millimeter. Eosinophilia can be categorized as mild (less than 1500 eosinophils per cubic millimeter), moderate (1500 to 5000 per cubic millimeter), or severe (more than 5000 per cubic millimeter). In areas of the world where parasitic diseases are common, they are the usual cause of eosinophilia. In developed nations, eosinophilia is most often due to allergy or, less often, a drug reaction. There are numerous other causes of eosinophilia, but individually they are quite uncommon. Eosinophilia may be primary or secondary. In primary eosinophilia, the increased production of eosinophils is due to an abnormality in a hematopoietic stem cell as, for example, in eosinophilic leukemia. In secondary eosinophilia, the increased production of eosinophils is a reactive process driven by cytokines, as is the case in allergy."
EPA,"EPA: 1. The Environmental Protection Agency, a US government agency.
2. Eicosapentaenoic acid, one of the principal omega-3 fatty acids."
Epi-,"Epi-: Prefix taken from the Greek that means ""on, upon, at, by, near, over, on top of, toward, against, among."" As in epicanthal fold (a fold of skin that comes down across the inner angle, the canthus, of the eye; epicardium (a layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great blood vessels); episclera (a thin membrane on top of the sclera, the white of the eye); epidural anesthetic (an anesthetic injected into the epidural space surrounding the fluid-filled sac, called the dura, around the spine which partially numbs the abdomen and legs); etc."
Epicardium,"Epicardium: The inner layer of the pericardium, a conical sac of fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great blood vessels. The pericardium has outer and inner coats. The outer coat is tough and thickened, loosely cloaks the heart, and is attached to the central part of the diaphragm and the back of the sternum (breastbone). The inner coat is double with one layer closely adherent to the heart while the other lines the inner surface of the outer coat with the intervening space being filled with fluid. This small amount of fluid, the pericardial fluid, acts as a lubricant to allow normal heart movement within the chest. The word ""pericardium"" means around the heart. The outer layer of the pericardium is called the parietal pericardium. The inner part of the pericardium that closely envelops the heart is, as stated, the epicardium; it is also called the visceral pericardium."
Epidemic,"Epidemic: The occurrence of more cases of a disease than would be expected in a community or region during a given time period. A sudden severe outbreak of a disease such as SARS. From the Greek ""epi-"", ""upon"" + ""demos"", ""people or population"" = ""epidemos"" = ""upon the population."" See also: Endemic; Pandemic."
Epidermal,"Epidermal: Pertaining to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin."
Epidermis,"Epidermis: The upper or outer layer of the two main layers of cells that make up the skin. The epidermis is mostly made up of flat, scale-like cells called squamous cells. Under the squamous cells are round cells called basal cells. The deepest part of the epidermis also contains melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, which gives the skin its color. The other main layer of the skin is the dermis, the inner layer of skin, that contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands. These glands produce sweat, which helps regulate body temperature, and sebum, an oily substance that helps keep the skin from drying out. Sweat and sebum reach the skin's surface through tiny openings called pores."
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV),"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV): a rare genetic condition that leads to susceptibility to infection of the skin by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and the development of squamous cells carcinomas (a type of cancer) of the skin. Symptoms include flat-to-raised, wart-like bumps and reddish-brown raised plaques on the trunk, hands, upper and lower extremities, and the face. Patients with this condition are typically infected with multiple types of HPV. The genetic defect responsible for epidermodysplasia verruciformis leads to a defective immune response to HPV infection, which leads to the characteristic symptoms. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both parents must carry a defective copy of the gene for the offspring to develop the condition. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis has also been referred to as Lewandowsky-Lutz dysplasia, tree-man illness, or tree-man disease."
Epididymis,Epididymis: A structure within the scrotum that is attached to the back side of the testis. The epididymis is a coiled segment of the spermatic ducts that stores spermatozoa while they mature and then transports the spermatozoa between the testis and the tube connecting the testes with the urethra (vas deferens).
Epididymitis,"Epididymitis: Inflammation of the epididymis. Epididymitis can be caused by sexually acquired bacteria, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia; or by bacteria that come from somewhere else, such as E. coli from the bowel. Sometimes no bacteria are found to be associated. Bacterial epididymitis is treated with antibiotics. If no bacterial cause is detected, medications to reduce inflammation are sometimes helpful."
Epidural,"Epidural: Outside the dura, the outermost, toughest, and most fibrous of the three membranes (meninges) covering the brain and the spinal cord. An epidural hematoma is a collection of blood beneath the skull but outside the dura."
Epidural hematoma,"Epidural hematoma: A hematoma between the skull and the brain's tissue-like covering, which is known as the dura. Epidural hematoma is usually caused by a full-on blow to the head and is often associated with skull fracture. Diagnosis is usually made via MRI or CT scan. Treatment is trepanation: drilling through the skull to drain the excess blood."
Epilepsy,"Epilepsy (seizure disorder): When nerve cells in the brain fire electrical impulses at a rate of up to four times higher than normal, this causes a sort of electrical storm in the brain, known as a seizure. A pattern of repeated seizures is referred to as epilepsy. Known causes include head injuries, brain tumors, lead poisoning, maldevelopment of the brain, genetic and infectious illnesses. But in fully half of cases, no cause can be found. Medication controls seizures for the majority of patients."
Epinephrine,"Epinephrine: Also known as adrenaline. A substance produced by the medulla inside of the adrenal gland. The name epinephrine was coined in 1898 by the American pharmacologist and physiologic biochemist John Jacob Abel who isolated it from the adrenal gland which is located above (epi-) the kidney ""nephros"" in Greek). (Abel is also crystallized insulin.) Technically speaking, epinephrine is a sympathomimetic catecholamine. It causes quickening of the heart beat, strengthens the force of the heart's contraction, opens up the airways (bronchioles) in the lungs, and has numerous other effects. The secretion of epinephrine by the adrenal gland is part of the fight-or-flight reaction. Adrenaline is a synonym of epinephrine and is the official name in the British Pharmacopoeia."
EpiPen,"Epipen®: a brand name for an epinephrine auto-injector device used to manage potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to allergens. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for life-threatening allergic reactions. Patients are recommended to have an epinephrine auto-injector immediately available if they have a history of life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to things like bee stings, peanuts or seafood, or are at increased risk for a severe allergic reaction. Those at high risk are recommended to have two sources of epinephrine available at all times. Epipens contain a single dose of epinephrine that is injected into the outer thigh if signs of a serious allergic reaction are present."
Epispadias,Epispadias: Congenital (at birth) malformation in which the opening of the urethra (from whence comes the urinary stream) is on the dorsum (topside) of the penis. Hypospadias is the corresponding malformation in which the opening of the urethra is on the ventral surface (underside) of the penis.
Epistaxis,"Epistaxis: Medical term for nosebleed. The nose is a part of the body that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a result, any trauma to the face can cause bleeding, which may be profuse. Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from household heaters. People are more susceptible if they are taking medications which prevent normal blood clotting (warfarin [Coumadin], clopidogrel bisulfate [Plavix], aspirin, or any anti-inflammatory medication). Other predisposing factors include infection, trauma, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and inherited bleeding problems. ""Epistaxis"" is a Greek word meaning ""a dripping,"" especially of blood from the nose."
Epithelium,"Epithelium: The outside layer of cells that covers all the free, open surfaces of the body including the skin, and mucous membranes that communicate with the outside of the body. By contrast the endothelium is the layer of cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels (that convey the lymph, a milky fluid)."
Epizootic,"Epizootic: An epidemic outbreak of disease in an animal population, often with the implication that it may extend to humans. For example, Rift Valley fever (RVF) primarily affects livestock and can cause disease in a large number of domestic animals -- an ""epizootic"" -- and the presence of an RVF epizootic can lead to an epidemic among humans who are exposed to diseased animals. The word ""epizootic"" is pronounced ep'i-zo-ot'ik. It has Greek roots: epi- meaning ""on"" among other things, + zoon, ""animal."""
EPO test,EPO test: A test of the hormone EPO (erythropoietin) level in the blood. Testing EPO blood levels may be of value in:
Eponym,"Eponym: Something named after someone. For example, a condition called Shiel syndrome might be named after (an eponym for) someone named Shiel who discovered it or who was the first to describe and clearly delineate it."
EPR,EPR: Abbreviation for Electrophrenic respiration. Also known as diaphragm pacing. See: Diaphragm pacing.
EPT,EPT: Estrogen/progestin therapy.
ER,ER: 1. Emergency room. 2. Endoplasmic reticulum. 3. Estrogen receptor. 4. Extended release.
Erectile dysfunction,"Erectile dysfunction: A consistent inability to sustain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. Commonly known as impotence. Medically, the term erectile dysfunction is used to properly differentiate this form of impotence from other problems that interfere with sexual intercourse, such as disease, injury, drug side effects, or a disorder that impairs the nerve supply or the blood flow to the penis. Other forms of impotence include lack of sexual desire and problems with ejaculation and orgasm. Erectile dysfunction is treatable in all age groups, and treatment includes using medication (notably Viagra) and penile implants. Abbreviated ED."
Ergonomics,"Ergonomics: The science of making things fit people. Ergonomics uses knowledge from the fields of anatomy, mechanics, physiology, and psychology to utilize human energy most effectively. Something that is ergonomic is designed for safe, comfortable, and efficient use. For example, a computer keyboard with an ergonomic design is intended to help the user avoid carpal tunnel syndrome and wrist pain."
Ergophobia,"Ergophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of work. Sufferers of ergophobia experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may actually be a combination of fears, such fear of failing at assigned tasks, fear of speaking before groups at work, or fear of socializing with co-workers. ""Ergophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""ergon"" (work) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Ergo"" is also used to form other English words, including ""ergometer"" (a device that measures the amount of work done by muscles) and ""ergonomics"" (an applied science that designs office equipment and furniture with the aim of maximizing functionality and improving worker comfort)."
Ergot,"Ergot: A fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that contaminates rye and wheat and that produces substances (alkaloids) called ergotamines. Ergotamines constrict blood vessels and cause the muscle of the uterus to contract. They have been much used for the treatment of migraines. They have also been used and misused to induce abortion. In excess, ergotamines can cause symptoms such as hallucinations, severe gastrointestinal upset, a type of dry gangrene, and a painful burning sensation in the limbs and extremities. Chronic ergot poisoning (ergotism) was rife during the Middle Ages due to the consumption of contaminated rye. Because of the burning pain, it was known as ignis sacer (holy fire) and ignis infernalis (hell's fire), and was one of the causes of St. Anthony's fire. A form of ergot was also the original basis for the illicit drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)."
Erosion,"Erosion: An erosion is an eating away of a surface. (""Erodere"" in Latin means to eat out.) For example, a skin erosion is a loss of part or all of the epidermis (the outer layer) leaving a denuded surface. For another example, tooth erosion is a gradual loss of the normally hard surface of the tooth because of chemical processes."
ERT (estrogen replacement therapy),"Therapy, estrogen replacement (ERT): a form of therapy with estrogen hormones most commonly used to treat the symptoms of menopause. It reduces or stops the short-term changes of menopause such as hot flashes, disturbed sleep, and vaginal dryness. ERT is today typically referred to as hormone therapy (HT). HT is thought to help prevent osteoporosis, a consequence of lowered estrogen levels. Estrogen therapy has more recently been referred to without the use of the term ""replacement"" and is simply referred to as estrogen therapy or estrogen therapy. While estrogen therapy may help prevent osteoporosis, it has been reported to be associated with health risks in some populations. Specifically, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data in 2002 showed that estrogen therapy alone in menopause led to an increased risk for strokes and blood clots. However, the women in this study were older and other research has suggested a possible protective effect against heart disease when taken early in the postmenopausal years. The definitive health risks and benefits of estrogen therapy have yet to be fully characterized. Vaginal estrogen therapy products help with vaginal dryness, more severe vaginal changes, and bladder effects but, since very little vaginal estrogen enters the circulation, it may not help with hot flashes or prevent osteoporosis . The use of unopposed estrogen therapy (estrogen therapy alone without progesterone) is associated with an increase in the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus). However, by taking the hormone progestogen along with estrogen, the risk of endometrial cancer is reduced substantially. Progestogen protects the uterus by keeping the endometrium from thickening (an effect caused by estrogen). The decision to take combined or single hormone therapy is best made together with a healthcare practitioner who can help explain the potential risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis. Estrogen therapy may not be appropriate for all women, for example, women with breast cancer, heart disease, or a history of blood clots."
Eructation,Eructation: Better known as burping or belching. Casting up wind (expelling air) from the stomach through the mouth.
Erythema,"Erythema: Redness of the skin that results from capillary congestion. Erythema can occur with inflammation, as in sunburn and allergic reactions to drugs."
Erythema chronicum migrans,"Erythema chronicum migrans: The classic initial rash of Lyme disease. In the early phase of the illness, within hours to weeks of the tick bite, the local skin develops an expanding ring of unraised redness. There may be an outer ring of brighter redness and a central area of clearing. For more information, see Lyme Disease."
Erythema dose,"Erythema dose: The amount of radiation which, applied to the skin, makes it turn temporarily red (erythematous)."
Erythema multiforme,Erythema multiforme: See: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Erythrocyte,"Erythrocyte: A cell that contains hemoglobin and can carry oxygen to the body. Also called a red blood cell (RBC). The reddish color is due to the hemoglobin. Erythrocytes are biconcave in shape, which increases the cell's surface area and facilitates the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This shape is maintained by a cytoskeleton composed of several proteins. Erythrocytes are very flexible and change shape when flowing through capillaries. Immature erythrocytes, called reticulocytes, normally account for 1-2 percent of red cells in the blood."
Erythromycin,"Erythromycin: Erythromycin is a common antibiotic for treating bacterial infection. Sold under many brand names, including EES, Erycin and Erythromia."
Eschar,Eschar: The scab formed when a wound or skin is sealed by the heat of cautery or burning. Also the dark crusted ulcer (tache noire) at the site of the chigger (mite larva) bite in scrub typhus.
Escherichia coli,"Escherichia coli: Full term for E. coli, the colon bacillus."
Esophagitis,Esophagitis: Inflammation of the esophagus.
Esophagogastric tamponade,"Esophagogastric tamponade: A procedure in which a balloon is inflated within the esophagus and stomach to apply pressure on bleeding blood vessels, compress the vessels, and stop the bleeding. Used in the treatment of bleeding veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach. The balloon used in the esophagus is shaped like a sausage while that in the stomach is rounded. Esophagogastric tamponade is also called balloon tamponade. The word ""tamponade"" is direct from the French. The French verb ""tamponner"" means to plug up."
Esophagus,"Esophagus: The tube that connects the pharynx (throat) with the stomach. The esophagus lies between the trachea (windpipe) and the spine. It passes down the neck, pierces the diaphragm just to the left of the midline, and joins the cardiac (upper) end of the stomach. In an adult, the esophagus is about 25 centimeters (10 inches) long. When a person swallows, the muscular walls of the esophagus contract to push food down into the stomach. Glands in the lining of the esophagus produce mucus, which keeps the passageway moist and facilitates swallowing. Also known as the gullet or swallowing tube. From the Greek oisophagos, from oisein meaning to bear or carry + phagein, to eat."
ESR,"ESR: Abbreviation for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a blood test that detects and monitors inflammation in the body. It measures the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) in a test tube separate from blood serum over time, becoming sediment in the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate increases with more inflammation. Also commonly called the sed rate."
Essential,"Essential: In medicine, of unknown cause, as in essential hypertension (high blood pressure of unknown cause). Also known as idiopathic."
Essential fatty acid,"Essential fatty acid: An unsaturated fatty acid that is essential to human health, but cannot be manufactured in the body. Abbreviated EFA. There are three types of EFAs: arachnoidic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. When linoleic acid is obtained in the diet, it can be converted to both arachnoidic and linolenic acid. Linoleic acid is commonly found in cold-pressed oils, especially oils extracted from cold-water fish and certain seeds. Supplementation with EFAs appears to be useful as a treatment for certain neurological disorders. However, arachnoidic acid may lower the seizure threshold. For that reason, it is important to consult a physician before starting a program of EFA supplementation."
Essential tremor,"Essential tremor: Uncontrollable shaking (tremor) of the hands and arms and sometimes other parts of the body. Essential tremor is the most common of all movement disorders and is estimated to affect up to 5% of people in the US. In approximately half of cases, essential tremor is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Several different genetic defects may play a role in this condition. The degree of severity of symptoms is variable among affected people. It most often affects the hands and arms but may also involve the legs, trunk, head, voice, and chin. Also known as familial tremor, heredofamilial tremor, and hereditary essential tremor. See: ETM1;  ETM2."
EST (expressed sequence tag),"EST (expressed sequence tag): A unique stretch of DNA within a coding region of a gene that is useful for identifying full-length genes and serves as a landmark for mapping. An EST is a sequence tagged site (STS) derived from cDNA. An STS is a short segment of DNA which occurs but once in the genome and whose location and base sequence are known. STSs are detectable by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are helpful in localizing and orienting mapping and sequence data, and serve as landmarks in the physical map of the genome."
confinement (EDC),Estimated date of confinement (EDC): The due date or estimated calendar date when a baby will be born.
Estrogen,"Estrogen: A female steroid hormone that is produced by the ovaries and, in lesser amounts, by the adrenal cortex, placenta, and male testes. Estrogen helps control and guide sexual development, including the physical changes associated with puberty. It also influences the course of ovulation in the monthly menstrual cycle, lactation after pregnancy, aspects of mood, and the aging process. Production of estrogen changes naturally over the female lifespan, reaching adult levels with the onset of puberty (menarche) and decreasing in middle age until the onset of menopause. Estrogen deficiency can lead to lack of menstruation (amenorrhea), persistent difficulties associated with menopause (such as mood swings and vaginal dryness), and osteoporosis in older age. In cases of estrogen deficiency, natural and synthetic estrogen preparations may be prescribed. Estrogen is also a component of many oral contraceptives. An overabundance of estrogen in men causes development of female secondary sexual characteristics (feminization), such as enlargement of breast tissue."
Estrogens,Estrogens: Female hormones produced by the ovaries. Estrogen deficiency can lead to osteoporosis. Estrogen therapy preparations include: The brand names of estrogen therapy preparations include:
Ethylene glycol poisoning,"Ethylene glycol poisoning: Poisoning from ethylene glycol (a clear, colorless, odorless liquid with a sweet taste) that can produce dramatic and dangerous toxicity. Ethylene glycol is found most commonly in antifreeze, automotive cooling systems, and hydraulic brake fluid. In an industrial setting it is also used as a solvent and in a variety of processes. Many cases of ethylene glycol poisoning are due to the accidental ingestion of it by children. They may take in large amounts since the substance tastes good. Alcoholics may also drink it as a substitute for alcohol (ethanol). Ethylene glycol is itself relatively nontoxic. However, it is metabolized (changed) in the body by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase into glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid, which are highly toxic compounds. Renal failure, acidosis and hypocalcemia may follow the intake of ethylene glycol. There can be widespread tissue injury in the kidney, brain, liver, and blood vessels. The result can be fatal. The traditional treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning has been ethanol which competes for the attention of the enzyme (as a competitive substrate of alcohol dehydrogenase) and hemodialysis which removes ethylene glycol and its toxic metabolites from the blood. A new alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, fomepizole (brand name: Antizol), was approved in 1997 for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning in patients at least 12 years old. It has also been used successfully with younger children."
Etiology,"Etiology: The study of causes, as in the causes of a disease. The form aetiology is generally used in the UK."
Euphoria,"Euphoria: Elevated mood. Euphoria is a desirable and natural occurrence when it results from happy or exciting events. An excessive degree of euphoria that is not linked to events is characteristic of hypomania or mania, abnormal mood states associated with bipolar disorders. See also bipolar disease."
Eustachian tube,"Eustachian tube: The tube that runs from the middle ear to the pharynx. The function of the Eustachian tube is to protect, aerate, and drain the middle ear and mastoid. The Eustachian tube permits the gas pressure in the middle ear cavity to adjust to external air pressure. When you are descending in an airplane, the Eustachian tube opens when your ears 'pop.' It is harder to get air into the middle ear than get it out, which is why we have more trouble with our ears when a plane is descending than when it takes off. Occlusion of the Eustachian tube can lead to the development of middle ear infection (otitis media). The Eustachian tube opens into the nasopharynx. The Eustachian tube measures only 17 to 18 mm, and it is horizontal at birth. As it grows to double that length, it grows
to be positioned at an incline of 45 degrees in
adulthood. For this reason the nasopharyngeal opening in an adult is significantly below the tympanic opening, found in the middle ear near the eardrum. The shorter length and the horizontal orientation of the Eustachian tube in infancy protects the middle ear poorly, makes for poor drainage of fluid from the middle ear, and predisposes infants and young children to middle ear infection. The greater length and particularly the slope of the tube as it grows serve more effectively to protect, aerate, and drain the middle ear. The Eustachian tube in the adult is opened by two muscles, the tensor palati and the levator palati, but the anatomy of children permits only the tensor palati to work. Also known as otopharyngeal tube because it connects the ear to the pharynx and auditory tube."
Euthyroid,Euthyroid: The state of having normal thyroid gland function. As opposed to hyperthyroid (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroid (underactive thyroid).
Event,"Event: A set of outcomes. Cardiovascular events might include a heart attack and gastrointestinal events a GI bleed. The use of the term ""event"" in medicine comes from probability theory."
Evolutionarily conserved gene,"Evolutionarily conserved gene: A gene that has remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution. Conservation of a gene indicates that it is unique and essential: There is not an extra copy of that gene with which evolution can tinker, and changes in the gene are likely to be lethal."
Exacerbate,"Exacerbate: To make worse. For example, smoking may exacerbate lung disease."
Exacerbation,"Exacerbation: A worsening. In medicine, exacerbation may refer to an increase in the severity of a disease or its signs and symptoms. For example, an exacerbation of asthma might occur as a serious effect of air pollution, leading to shortness of breath."
Exanthem,"Exanthem: A rash. The word ""exanthem"" comes from the Greek ""exanthema"" which means ""a breaking out."" ""Anthos"" in Greek is ""a flower,"" particularly a flower blossom, so a child breaking out with an rash is likened to a flower bursting into bloom."
Excise,"Excise: To cut out entirely. For example, a scalpel or laser beam may be used to excise a tumor. The terms excise and resect are not synonymous. Excise implies total removal, whereas resect does not."
Excision,"Excision: 1. Surgical removal, as in the excision of a tumor. 2. The removal as if by surgery, as in excision of a tumor; implying at least partial, if not complete, removal."
Exclamation point hair,"Exclamation point hair: Exclamation point hair is a key diagnostic finding in a disorder called alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is patchy baldness (alopecia means baldness and areata means occurring in patches), which typically begins with patchy hair loss on the scalp and sometimes progresses to complete baldness and even loss of body hair. The hair loss tends to be rather rapid and asymmetrical and is different than male pattern baldness. Alopecia areata affects both males and females. It tends to occur most often in children and young adults but older individuals can also be affected. The most common pattern of alopecia areata is one or more spots of hair loss on the scalp. There is also a form with more generalized thinning. When all of the scalp hair is lost, it is called alopecia totalis. Loss of all of the hairs on the body is called alopecia universalis. The cause appears to involve an autoimmune mechanism. The body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Biopsies of affected skin show lymphocytes (one of the body's immune system cells) inside of hair follicles where lymphocytes normally are not present. What causes this is unknown. Alopecia areata is sometimes associated with other conditions (allergic disorders, thyroid disease, vitiligo, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis). Some cases occur within family members and indicate a genetic basis. The characteristic diagnostic finding of alopecia areata is the exclamation point hair. These can be found in areas of hair loss and are short broken off hairs that are narrower closer to the scalp and therefore mimic an exclamation point. In some cases a biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. In about half of cases, the hair regrows within a year without any treatment. The longer the period of time of hair loss, the less chance that it will regrow and a variety of treatments can be tried. Steroid injections and cream to the scalp have been used for many years. Other drugs include minoxidil, irritants, and topical immunotherapy which may be used in different combinations."
Excoriate,"Excoriate: To scratch or wear off the skin resulting in an abrasion. Skin picking disorder (SPD) (also called excoriation disorder) is characterized by deliberate and repetitive picking, scratching, rubbing, digging, or squeezing of skin, resulting in tissue damage. It is a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)."
Exhibitionism,"Exhibitionism: Exhibitionism is characterized by intense, sexually arousing fantasies, urges or behaviors involving exposure of the individual's genitals to an unsuspecting stranger. The individual with this problem, sometimes called a ""flasher,"" feels a need to surprise, shock or impress his victims. The condition usually is limited to the exposure, with no other harmful advances made, although ""indecent exposure"" is illegal. Actual sexual contact with the victim is rare. However, the person may masturbate while exposing himself or while fantasizing about exposing himself."
Exocrine,"Exocrine: Pertaining to the secretion of a substance out through a duct. The exocrine glands include the salivary glands, sweat glands and glands within the gastrointestinal tract. Exocrine is as opposed to endocrine which refers to the secretion of a substance (a hormone) into the bloodstream. The exocrine glands are the ""glands of external secretion"" while the endocrine glands are ""glands of internal secretion."""
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI),"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI): a condition characterized by a deficiency of the digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas, leading to impaired digestion of food. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can occur in association with other diseases that affect the pancreas, like chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis. The symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are related to the defect in digestion and include abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, and unusually foul-smelling stools. Weight loss and vitamin deficiencies can also result from EPI. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) medications are the primary treatment."
Exogenous,Exogenous: Originating from outside the organism. Insulin taken by a diabetic is exogenous insulin.
Expectorant,"Expectorant: A medication that helps bring up mucus and other material from the lungs, bronchi, and trachea. An example of an expectorant is guaifenesin, which promotes drainage of mucus from the lungs by thinning the mucus, and also lubricates the irritated respiratory tract."
Explant,Explant: 1. The original meaning: to transfer tissue from the body and place it in a culture medium for growth; and the tissue that is transferred. To remove a device that had been implanted.
,"Expulsion, stage of: The second stage of labor, lasting from the full dilation of the cervix until the baby is completely out of the birth canal."
Extension,Extension: The process of straitening or the state of being strait. Extension of the hip and knee joints is necessary to stand up from the sitting position.
External fixation,"External fixation: A procedure that stabilizes and joins the ends of fractured (broken) bones by a splint or cast. External fixation is as opposed to internal fixation in which the ends of the fractured bone are joined by mechanical devices such as metal plates, pins, rods, wires or screws."
Extracorporeal,"Extracorporeal: Outside the body, in the anatomic sense. As in extracorporeal circulation, extracorporeal dialysis, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. From extra- + corpus, meaning body."
Extracranial,"Extracranial: Outside the cranium, the bony dome that houses and protects the brain. As opposed to intracranial, inside the cranium."
Extracranial hematoma,Extracranial hematoma: A hematoma (a collection of blood) outside the cranium (skull). 
Extrasystole,"Extrasystole: A premature contraction of the heart that is independent of the normal rhythm of the heart and that arises in response to an impulse in some part of the heart other than the normal impulse from the sinoatrial (SA) node. The extrasystole is followed by a pause, as the heart electrical system ""resets"" itself and the contraction following the pause is usually more forceful than normal. These more forceful contractions are frequently perceived as palpitations. Systole refers to the time when the left ventricle of the heart contracts. Extrasystole is also known as extra systole, premature beat, premature contraction, premature systole, premature ventricular beat or PVB, premature ventricular contraction or PVC."
Extrauterine pregnancy,"Extrauterine pregnancy: A pregnancy that is not in the usual place and is located outside the inner lining of the uterus. A fertilized egg settles and grows in any location other than the inner lining of the uterus. The large majority (95%) of extrauterine pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tube. However, they can occur in other locations, such as the ovary, cervix, and abdominal cavity. An extrauterine pregnancy, also called an ectopic pregnancy, affects about 1 in 60 pregnancies. The term ""ectopic"" comes from the Greek ""ektopis"" meaning ""displacement"" (""ek"", out of + ""topos"", place = out of place). The first person to use ""ectopic"" in a medical context was the English obstetrician Robert Barnes (1817-1907) who applied it to an extrauterine pregnancy: an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are frequently due to an inability of the fertilized egg to make its way through a Fallopian tube into the uterus. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in women 35 to 44 years of age. Risk factors predisposing to ectopic pregnancies include: A major concern with an ectopic pregnancy is internal bleeding. If there is any doubt, seek medical attention promptly. Pain is usually the first symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. The pain, often one-sided, may be in the pelvis, abdomen or even in the shoulder or neck (due to blood from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy building up under the diaphragm and the pain being ""referred"" up to the shoulder or neck). The pain is usually sharp and stabbing. Weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness, and a sense of passing out upon standing can represent serious internal bleeding, requiring immediate medical attention. Diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy includes a pelvic exam to test for pain, tenderness or a mass in the abdomen. The most useful laboratory test is the measurement of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). In a normal pregnancy, the level of hCG doubles about every two days during the first 10 weeks whereas in an ectopic pregnancy, the hCG rise is usually slower and lower than normal. Ultrasound can also help determine if a pregnancy is ectopic, as may sometimes culdocentesis, the insertion of a needle through the vagina into the space behind the uterus to see if there is blood there from a ruptured Fallopian tube. Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is surgery, often by laparoscopy today, to remove the ill-fated pregnancy. A ruptured tube usually has to be removed. If the tube has yet not burst, it may be possible to repair it. The prognosis (outlook) for future pregnancies depends on the extent of the surgery. If the Fallopian tube has been spared, the chance of a successful pregnancy is usually better than 50%. If a Fallopian tube has been removed, an egg can be fertilized in the other tube, and the chance of a successful pregnancy drops somewhat below 50%."
Extremity,"Extremity: An uttermost part of the body, such as a hand or a foot."
Extubate,"Extubate: To remove a tube from a hollow organ or passageway, often from the airway. The opposite of extubate is intubate."
Exudate,"Exudate: A fluid rich in protein and cellular elements that oozes out of blood vessels due to inflammation and is deposited in nearby tissues. The altered permeability of blood vessels permits the passage of large molecules and solid matter through their walls. The vessels seem to weep, to sweat, in keeping with the Latin ""exsudare"", to sweat out, from which exudate is derived. By comparison, a transudate is a fluid that passes through a membrane which filters out much of the protein and cellular elements and yields a watery solution. The process of transudatation is due to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries pressure forcing fluid through the vessel walls or low levels of protein in the serum. The transudate is a filtrate of blood."
Eye,"Eye: The organ of sight. The eye has a number of components. These components include but are not limited to the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, macula, optic nerve, choroid and vitreous.  The cornea is the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye. The iris is the colored part of the eye that helps regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil is the dark aperture in the iris that determines how much light is let into the eye. The lens is the transparent structure inside the eye that focuses light rays onto the retina. The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the eye, senses light and creates impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain. The macula is a small area in the retina that contains special light-sensitive cells and allows us to see fine details clearly. The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to the brain and carries the impulses formed by the retina to the visual cortex of the brain. The choroid is a thin vascular layer between the sclera and the retina that supplies blood to the retina and conducts arteries and nerves to other structures in the eye. The vitreous humor is a clear, jelly-like substance that fills the middle of the eye. The word ""eye"" come from the Teutonic ""auge."""
Eye bleed,"Eye bleed: Medically called a subconjunctival hemorrhage. A very common cause of a painless bloody eye usually first noticed by somebody else or by the person with it when they look in the mirror. The bleeding results from a break in a small blood vessel in the sclera, the white of the eye. This releases a tiny amount (less than a drop) of blood which is trapped underneath the conjunctiva, much like the blood in a bruise is trapped in the skin. It is called a subconjunctival hemorrhage since it occurs beneath the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane covering the sclera. A subconjunctival hemorrhage can occur with heavy lifting, coughing, sneezing, vomiting or for no apparent reason. It looks bad and may be frightening, but is not dangerous and leaves no residual change in vision. There is no discharge from the eye. The redness may turn brown or green and everything returns to normal within 3 weeks as the blood is absorbed. Subconjunctival hemorrhage does not require treatment. Any features not characteristic of subconjunctival hemorrhage (such as pain in the eye, a change in vision, or failure to clear up within 3 weeks, or recurrent hemorrhage) are reasons to see a doctor. Medical conditions that can upon occasion cause subconjunctival hemorrhages include bleeding disorders, blood-thinner (such as heparin and Coumadin), and high blood pressure."
Eye color,"Eye color: The color of the iris. The genetics of eye color are complicated. Eye color is polygenic. It is determined by multiple genes. The eye color genes include EYCL1 (a green/blue eye color gene located on chromosome 19), EYCL2 (a brown eye color gene) and EYCL3 (a brown/blue eye color gene located on chromosome 15). There are clearly other genes that influence eye color. The once-held view that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be wrong. The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur."
Eyelid,"Eyelid: The lid or cover of the eye, a movable fold of skin and muscle that can be closed over the eyeball or opened at will. Each eye has an upper and a lower lid. Also known as a palpebra."
Fahrenheit,"Fahrenheit: Thermometer scale in which the freezing point of water is 32?F and the boiling point of water 212?F. The Fahrenheit scale is still obstinately in use in the US. This anachronism requires conversion from Centigrade (?C) to Fahrenheit (?F), and vice versa. One degree ?C = (5/9)(?F - 32). One degree ?F = (9/5)(?C) + 32. Named for Gabriel Fahrenheit, a German-Dutch physicist, who devised the scale in 1724. 0?F was the lowest temperature that Fahrenheit could obtain using a mixture of ice and salt."
Failure to thrive (FTT),"Failure to thrive (FTT): Refers to a child whose physical growth is significantly less than that of peers. There is no official consensus on what constitutes failure to thrive (FTT). It usually refers to a child whose growth is below the 3rd or 5th percentiles for their age or whose growth has fallen off precipitously and crossed two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile). Failure to thrive in early infancy sometimes results in death, and in older infancy or childhood is an important marker for underlying disease. Causes of failure to thrive are probably many, including unrecognized food allergies leading to refusal of food and vomiting, undiagnosed metabolic disorders, and disease. A specific type of failure to thrive is sometimes seen in abandoned or institutionalized infants who seem to ""give up"" and become listless and unwilling to nurse. It is assumed that this phenomenon is emotional in nature, although other factors may also be at work. Treatment of failure to thrive requires discovering and treating its underlying cause(s). In the interim, IV feeding is required some cases, while in others supplemental high-calorie feedings can help."
Fainting (syncope),"Fainting (syncope): Partial or complete loss of consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in nonmedical quarters, fainting. Syncope accounts for one in every 30 visits to an emergency room. It is pronounced sin-ko-pea. Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness or a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions that do not directly involve the heart: Non-cardiac causes: Syncope is most commonly caused by conditions that do not directly involve the heart. These conditions include: Cardiac causes: Heart conditions that can cause syncope or fainting due to temporary loss of consciousness include: To be sure, many of the causes of temporary loss of consciousness can be detected by a careful history. Dizziness after standing up in an older person suggests postural hypotension. Temporary loss of consciousness after urinating, defecating, or coughing suggests situational syncope. Cardiac causes of temporary loss of consciousness such as aortic stenosis or cardiomyopathy are suggested by the occurrence of the event during exercise. Signs of weakness localized to certain areas of the body with temporary loss of consciousness suggest stroke. The blood pressure and pulse are tested in the lying, sitting, and standing positions. Unequal blood pressures in each arm is a sign of aortic dissection. The heart is examined with a stethoscope to listen for sounds that can indicate valve abnormalities. The nervous system is tested for sensation, reflexes, and motor function to detect conditions of the nerves and brain. An EKG is done to check for abnormal heart rhythms. Other tests may include echocardiograms, rhythm monitoring tests (heart event recorders), and electrophysiologic testing for abnormalities of the heart's electrical system. When heart conditions are not suspected, tilt-table testing can be used to detect causes of temporary loss of consciousness. Tilt-table testing involves placing the patient on a table with a foot-support. The table is tilted upward and blood pressure and pulse is measured while symptoms are recorded in various positions. No treatment is needed for many non-cardiac causes of syncope (such as postural hypotension, vasovagal reaction, and situational syncope). The person regains consciousness by simply sitting or lying down. The person is thereafter advised to avoid trigger situations, to not strain while eliminating, to sit when coughing, to lie down for blood drawing, etc. Older people should have their medications reviewed and caution is advised to slow the process of changing positions from lying to standing. This simple technique can allow the body to adjust to the new position (as the nerves to circulation of the legs adjust slower in older persons)."
Falciparum malaria,"Falciparum malaria: The most dangerous type of malaria, which is caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Falciparum malaria is associated with high levels of parasites in the blood and has the highest death rate and rate of complications of all types of malaria. Red blood cells that are infected with the parasite tend to sludge and lead to microinfarctions (tiny areas of dead tissue due to lack of oxygen) in capillaries in the brain, liver, adrenal gland, intestinal tract, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Patients should be treated in a hospital setting, using intravenous medications."
Fallopian tube,"Fallopian tube: One of the two Fallopian tubes that transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus (the womb). In the diagram, the Fallopian tubes are not labeled but are well shown running between the uterus and ovaries. The Fallopian tubes have small hair-like projections called cilia on the cells of the lining. These tubal cilia are essential to the movement of the egg through the tube into the uterus. If the tubal cilia are damaged by infection, the egg may not get 'pushed along' normally but may stay in the tube. Infection can also cause partial or complete blockage of the tube with scar tissue, physically preventing the egg from getting to the uterus. Any process (such as infection, endometriosis, tumors, or scar tissue in the pelvis (pelvic adhesions) that cause twisting or chinking of the tube) that damages the Fallopian tube or narrows its diameter increases the chance of an ectopic pregnancy: a pregnancy developing in the Fallopian tube or another abnormal location outside the uterus. These tubes bear the name of Gabriele Falloppio (also spelled Falloppia), a 16th-century (c. 1523-62) Italian physician and surgeon who was expert in anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. He was an early expert on syphilis and one of the great surgeons of the age. Of the various works by Falloppio only the ""Observationes anatomicae"", a work of great originality, was published during his lifetime. In it he made a number of contributions to the knowledge of centers of ossification, to the detailed account of muscles, and to the understanding of the vascular system and the kidneys. His description of the uterine tubes was sufficiently accurate that they bear his name. With Vesalius and Eustachi, Fallopio is often seen as one of the three heroes of anatomy."
False labor,"False labor: Intermittent non-productive muscular contractions of the womb (uterus) during pregnancy, most commonly in the last two months before full term. These contractions are non-productive in the sense that they do not produce any flattening (effacement) or dilation (opening up) of the cervix. It is often said that false contractions are for ""practice,"" for getting the woman ready for true labor, but this is pure speculation since there is no convincing evidence that these contractions aid in the delivery of the baby in any way. An episode of false labor can surprise and concern a pregnant woman, especially when she experiences these contractions for the first time. But, by definition, these contractions are of limited duration and do not indicate the onset of active labor."
Familial,Familial: A condition that tends to occur more often in family members than is expected by chance alone. A familial disease may be genetic (such as cystic fibrosis) or environmental (such as chicken pox).
Familial hypercholesterolemia,"Familial hypercholesterolemia: The most common inherited type of hyperlipidemia (high lipid levels in the blood). Familial hypercholesterolemia is recognizable in childhood and is due to genetic defects in the receptor (target) for low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The most common autosomal dominant form of hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutation in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR) on chromosome 19. There are also a number of other less frequent forms of this disorder. Familial hypercholesterolemia predisposes a person to premature arteriosclerosis, including coronary artery disease, and can lead to heart attacks at an unusually young age. Treatment involves dietary modifications and the use of cholesterol-lowering medications."
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF),"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): An inherited disorder featuring short recurring crises of severe abdominal pain and bouts of fever. Other symptoms include arthritis, chest pain from inflammation of the lung cavity, and skin rashes. Between attacks, the patient seems healthy. Amyloidosis (the abnormal deposition of a particular protein, called amyloid, in various tissues of the body) is a potentially serious complication and can develop without overt attacks of FMF. The kidney is a prime target for the amyloid. Daily use of the drug colchicine prevents attacks of fever in 60% of patients and significantly reduces the number of attacks in another 20-30% of patients. Compliance in taking colchicine every day is quite important, because discontinuance of the drug can result in an attack within a few days. Even if colchicine does not prevent the fever attacks, it still prevents the amyloidosis. FMF is an autosomal recessive trait that affects males and females alike who have received the gene from both of their parents. The gene is on the short (p) arm of chromosome 16. The gene has been cloned and is called MEFV. The mutant protein it produces is pyrexin. The precise function of pyrin is still unclear. MEFV is in what is called the ""myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway."" It is an ""interferon-gamma immediate early gene."" At least 28 mutations in the MEFV gene are known to cause FMF. Familial Mediterranean fever is so named because it was originally described and is most often found in families of Mediterranean ancestry, including Sephardic Jews, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians. Two of the most common MEFV mutations are thought to have originated in common ancestors (""founders"") who lived some 2500 years ago in the Middle East. This phenomenon is called founder effect."
Family,Family: 1. A group of individuals related by blood or marriage or by a feeling of closeness. 2. A biological classification of related plants or animals that is a division below the order and above the genus. 3. A group of genes related in structure and in function that descended from an ancestral gene. 4. A group of gene products similarly related in structure and function and of shared genetic descent. 5. Parents and their children. The most fundamental social group in humans.
Family therapy,"Family therapy: A type of psychotherapy designed to identify family patterns that contribute to a behavior disorder or mental illness and help family members break those habits. Family therapy involves discussion and problem-solving sessions with the family. Some of these sessions may be as a group, in couples, or one on one. In family therapy, the web of interpersonal relationships is examined and, ideally, communication is strengthened within the family."
Fart,"Fart: This is not an accepted medical word for passing gas. Excess gas in the intestinal is medically termed ""flatulence."" (But what is excess gas is difficult to define since symptom-free individuals have recorded approximately 14 passages of gas per 24 hours!) The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), in its inimitable way, notes that the word ""fart"" is ""not in decent use."" The OED defines the transitive verb form of fart: ""To send forth as wind from the anus 1632."" The word comes from the Old English ""feortan"" (meaning ""to break wind""). Although the word ""fart"" is ""not in decent use,"" it was used by the likes of the great English poet Geoffrey Chaucer."
Fasciculation,"Fasciculation: Involuntary contractions or twitchings of groups of muscle fibers. Fasciculations can occur in normal individuals without an associated disease or condition, or as a result of illness, such as muscle cramps, nerve diseases, and metabolic imbalances."
Fasting,"Fasting: : going without food or drink. Patients may be advised to fast for a certain period of time prior to surgery, medical procedures, or certain blood tests."
Fasting blood glucose,"Fasting blood glucose: A test to determine how much glucose (sugar) is in a blood sample after an overnight fast. The fasting blood glucose test is commonly used to detect diabetes mellitus. A blood sample is taken in a lab, physician's office, or hospital. The test is done in the morning, before the person has eaten. The normal range for blood glucose is 70 to 100 mg/dl. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dl are referred to as impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. Diabetes is typically diagnosed when fasting blood glucose levels are 126 mg/dl or higher."
Fat,"Fat:1: Along with proteins and carbohydrates, one of the three nutrients used as energy sources by the body. The energy produced by fats is 9 calories per gram. Proteins and carbohydrates each provide 4 calories per gram. 2: Total fat; the sum of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help reduce blood cholesterol when substituted for saturated fats in the diet. 3: A slang term for obese or adipose. 4: In chemistry, a compound formed from chemicals called fatty acids. These fats are greasy, solid materials found in animal tissues and in some plants."
Fatigue,"Fatigue: A condition characterized by a lessened capacity for work and reduced efficiency of accomplishment, usually accompanied by a feeling of weariness and tiredness. Fatigue can be acute and come on suddenly or chronic and persist."
Fatty acids,"Fatty acids: Molecules that are long chains of lipid-carboxylic acid found in fats and oils and in cell membranes as a component of phospholipids and glycolipids. (Carboxylic acid is an organic acid containing the functional group -COOH.) Fatty acids come from animal and vegetable fats and oils. Fatty acids play roles outside the body; they are used as lubricants, in cooking and food engineering, and in the production of soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. Related terms include the following: Essential fatty acid: An essential fatty acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid needed by the body that is synthesized by plants but not by the human body and is therefore a dietary requirement. Free fatty acids: By-products of the metabolism of fat in adipose tissues. Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids are a class of fatty acids found in fish oils, especially in salmon and other cold-water fish, that lowers the levels of cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoproteins) in the blood. (LDL cholesterol is the ""bad"" cholesterol.) Trans fatty acid:Trans fatty acids (trans fats) are made through hydrogenation to solidify liquid oils. They increase the shelf life of oils and are found in vegetable shortenings and in some margarines, crackers, cookies, and snack foods. Intake of trans fatty acids increases blood LDL-cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) levels and raises the risk of coronary heart disease."
Favism,"Favism: A condition characterized by hemolytic anemia (breakup of red blood cells) after eating fava beans (Vicia fava) or being exposed to the pollen of the fava plant. This dangerous reaction occurs exclusively in people with a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an X-linked genetic trait. However, not all G6PD-deficient families appear at risk for favism, indicating the additional need for a single autosomal (not X-linked) gene to create the susceptibility to favism of G6PD-deficient persons. The active hemolytic principle in fava beans is > likely DOPA-quinone. Differences in susceptibility to favism may be related to differences in the enzymatic system that converts L-DOPA to DOPA-quinone."
FCC,"FCC: In medicine, familial colorectal cancer (not the Federal Communications Commission)."
FDA,FDA: Food and Drug Administration.
age,"Fear of age: An abnormal and persistent fear of growing old is termed gerascophobia. Sufferers of gerascophobia feel undue anxiety about aging even though they may be in good health -- physically, economically and otherwise. They may worry about the loss of their looks, the loss of independence, inactivity after retirement, impaired mobility, the onset of disease, and confinement in a nursing home. Modern society's preoccupation with youthful beauty does nothing to alleviate their fears. The desire to remain young had an interesting consequence after the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le?n traveled to America with Columbus on the latter's second voyage to the New World. Native Americans told Ponce de Le?n tales of a ""fountain of youth"" on an island called Bimini north of Cuba. In 1513, Ponce de Le?n set out to find the fabled island--and discovered Florida. ""Gerascophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""geras"" (old age) and ""phobos"" (fear). Other English words derived from ""geras"" include ""geriatrics"" (the branch of medicine focusing on the elderly) and ""gerontology"" (the study of aging)."
children,"Fear of children: An abnormal and persistent fear of babies and children. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is groundless. Rearing a child or being around active children can both produce anxiety. Fear of children is termed ""pedophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""pais"" (child) and ""phobos"" (fear). Related terms include: androphobia, an abnormal and persistent fear of men; gynephobia, a comparably irrational and excessive fear of women."
crossing streets,"Fear of crossing streets: Abnormal and persistent fear of crossing streets, highways and other thoroughfares; fear of thoroughfares themselves. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize that streets, highways and other thoroughfares pose no threat commensurate with their fear. Fear of crossing streets is termed ""agyrophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""gyrus"" (turning or whirling) and the Greek ""phobos"" (fear). The first letter, ""a,"" is privative--that is, it creates a negative. Thus, an agyrophobiac shuns or avoids the whirl of traffic."
demons,"Fear of demons: An abnormal and persistent fear of evil supernatural beings in persons who believe such beings exist and roam freely to cause harm. Those who suffer from this phobia realize their fear is excessive or irrational. Nevertheless, they become unduly anxious when discussing demons, when venturing alone into woods or a dark house, or when watching films about demonic possession and exorcism. Fear of evil spirits is termed ""demonophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""daimon"" (deity, evil spirit) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Daimon"" also gives us the English word ""demonize,"" a verb widely used today to brand a person, such as a political opponent, as unfit or untrustworthy."
drinking alcohol,"Fear of drinking alcohol: An abnormal and persistent fear of drinking alcohol. Sufferers of this fear experience undue anxiety about addiction to alcohol and the effect this addiction can have on their body. (However, their abstinence from alcohol certainly should not be criticized.) Fear of alcohol is termed ""dipsophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""dipsa"" (thirst) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Dipsa"" is also used to form the words ""dipsomania"" (an abnormal craving for alcohol) and ""dipsosis"" (a medical condition characterized by abnormal thirst)."
dust,"Fear of dust: An abnormal and persistent fear of dust. Sufferers of this fear experience anxiety even though they realize dust poses no threat. Fear of dust is termed ""amathophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""amathos"" (sand) and ""phobos"" (fear)."
feces,"Fear of feces: An abnormal and persistent fear of feces (bowel waste). Sufferers of this fear experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. They go out of their way to avoid coming into contact with feces or sometimes even seeing feces. Fear of feces is termed ""coprophobia,"" a word derived from the Greek ""kopros"" (dung) and ""phobos"" (fear). Alternate names: Koprophobia, scatophobia."
fur,"Fear of fur: An abnormal and persistent fear of fur is called doraphobia. Sufferers of this fear avoid fur-bearing animals such as dogs, cats, foxes, beavers and rabbits because fur is repulsive to them. Perhaps some of these phobics associate fur with childhood stories about ""the big bad wolf"" and other fur-bearing predators. Their fear is not always unfounded, for many furry animals -- including bats, raccoons, dogs and cats -- can be carriers of rabies, an acute viral infection of the central nervous system. An animal can transmit this disease to a human through a bite and, in rare cases, through contact with the animal's blood or tissue or even through inhalation of the rabies virus in a bat cave. The disease is fatal unless an infected person receives rabies shots soon after contracting the illness. The word ""doraphobia"" is from Greek roots, namely ""dora"" (the hide or skin) + ""phobos"" (fear) = fear of the skin or hide (the fur of an animal)."
heat,"Fear of heat: Thermophobia. An abnormally excessive and persistent fear of heat, including hot weather and hot objects. Sufferers from this fear experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. To avoid heat, they may live in a cold climate, wear light clothing, stay indoors on warm days, and avoid hot water and hot foods. Thermophobia is derived from the Greek ""therme"" (heat) and ""phobos"" (fear). The opposite of thermophobia is cryophobia, fear of the cold."
nudity,"Fear of nudity: An abnormal and persistent fear of nudity is called gymnophobia. Sufferers of this phobia experience undue anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. They may worry about seeing others naked or being seen naked, or both. Their fear may stem from anxiety about sexuality in general, from a fear that their bodies are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves their bodies--and their personalities--exposed and unprotected. ""Gymnophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""gymnos"" (naked) and ""phobos"" (fear). The word ""gymnasium"" comes from the Greek ""gymnasion"" (a place for athletic exercises) and the Greek ""gymnasein"" (to train naked)."
oneself,"Fear of oneself: An irrational fear of oneself, an intense self-fear that is groundless. Fear of oneself is termed ""autophobia"" which comes from two Greek words: ""autos"" (self) and ""phobos"" (fear) = literally, self-fear, fear of oneself. ""Autos"" has given us many English words such as ""automatic"" and ""automotive"" (self-moving) and ""autonomy"" (self-governing). And ""phobos"" has bequeathed us a vast number of phobias such as ""claustrophobia"" (fear of closed places) and ""acrophobia"" (fear of heights)."
worms (parasitic),"Fear of worms (parasitic): An abnormal and persistent fear of being infested with parasitic worms called helminths. The technical term for this fear is helminthphobia. The eggs of parasitic worms can contaminate air and water, particularly where hygiene is poor. They can also contaminate foods such as pork and beef as well as pets and wild animals, objects such as toilet seats, and feces (bowel waste). Pinworms, roundworms and tapeworms are examples of helminths. After helminth eggs enter the body, they hatch and live there, usually in the intestines. The diseases they cause are often mild, but sometimes serious. Trichinosis, a disease caused by helminth eggs that may contaminate pork, can have serious complications and cause death. Sufferers of helminthphobia worry excessively about trichinosis and other helminth diseases even though proper measures may have been taken to prevent a helminth infestation. For example, they may avoid eating pork altogether even though they know such entrees as pork chops and sausage have been thoroughly cooked. In addition, even though their living environment is spotless, they may fret unduly about helminths. ""Helminthphobia"" is derived from the Greek ""helmins"" (worm) and ""phobos"" (fear)."
Febrile,Febrile: Feverish.
Fecalith,"Fecalith: A hard stony mass of feces in the intestinal tract. A fecalith can obstruct the appendix, leading to appendicitis. Fecaliths can also obstruct diverticuli. Also known as coprolith and stercolith."
Feedback,"Feedback: In order to maintain a stable internal environment, or homeostasis, the body uses negative and positive feedback. In negative feedback, the body works to correct a deviation from a set point, it tries to get back to normal. Examples include body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and thirst sensation. In positive feedback, the body changes from the normal point and amplifies it. Examples include blood clot formation, lactation, contractions during childbirth, and fever."
Female,"Female: The traditional definition of female was ""an individual of the sex that bears young"" or ""that produces ova or eggs"". However, things are not so simple today. Female can be defined by physical appearance, by chromosome constitution (see Female chromosome complement), or by gender identification. Female chromosome complement: The large majority of females have a 46, XX chromosome complement (46 chromosomes including two X chromosomes). A minority of females have other chromosome constitutions such as 45,X (45 chromosomes including only one X chromosome) and 47,XXX (47 chromosomes including three X chromosomes)."
Female genitalia,"Female genitalia: The genital organs of the female. These are usually separated by convention into the external and internal genitalia. The female external genitalia comprise the pudendum, the clitoris, and the female urethra. The female internal genitalia comprise the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, the uterus (womb), the cervix, and the vagina. These are, collectively, the female organs of reproduction. See also: Female external genitalia; and Female internal genitalia"
Female gonad,"Female gonad: The female gonad, the ovary or ""egg sac"", is one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries have two functions: they produce eggs (ova) and female hormones. Each month, during the menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone). These hormones control the development of female body characteristics, such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy."
Female pelvis,"Female pelvis: The lower part of the abdomen that is located between the hip bones in a female. The female pelvis is usually more delicate than, wider than, and not as high as the male pelvis. The angle of the female pubic arch is wide and round. The female sacrum is wider than the male's, and the iliac bone is flatter. The pelvic basin of the female is more spacious and less funnel-shaped than the male's. From a purely anatomic viewpoint, the female pelvis is better suited than the male pelvis to accommodate a fetus during pregnancy and permit the baby to be born."
Female urethral opening,Female urethral opening: The external opening of the transport tube that leads from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body in a female. The urethra in a female is shorter than the urethra in the male. The meatus (opening) of the female urethra is below the clitoris and just above the opening of the vagina.
Femoral,Femoral: Having to do with the femur.
Fertility,"Fertility: The ability to conceive and bear children, the ability to become pregnant through normal sexual activity."
Fertilization,"Fertilization: The process of combining the male gamete, or sperm, with the female gamete, or ovum. The product of fertilization is a cell called a zygote."
Fetal circulation,"Fetal circulation: The blood circulation in the fetus (an unborn baby). Before birth, blood from the fetal heart that is destined for the lungs is shunted away from the lungs through a short vessel called the ductus arteriosus and returned to the aorta. When this shunt is open, it is said to be a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The PDA usually closes at or shortly after birth, allowing blood to course freely to the lungs."
Fetal distress,"Fetal distress: Compromise of a fetus during the antepartum period (before labor) or intrapartum period (during the birth process). The term fetal distress is commonly used to describe fetal hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the fetus), which can result in fetal damage or death if it is not reversed or if the fetus is not promptly delivered. Fetal distress can be detected via abnormal slowing of labor, changes in fetal heart rate, the presence of meconium (dark green fecal material from the fetus) or other abnormal substances in the amniotic fluid, or fetal monitoring with an electronic device that shows a fetal scalp pH of less than 7.2."
Fetishism,"Fetishism: Fetishism is a problem in which a person has sexual urges associated with non-living objects. The person becomes sexually aroused by wearing or touching the object. For example, the object of a fetish could be an article of clothing, such as underwear, rubber clothing, women's shoes, or women's underwear or lingerie. The fetish may replace sexual activity with a partner or may be integrated into sexual activity with a willing partner. When the fetish becomes the sole object of sexual desire, sexual relationships often are avoided. A related disorder, called partialism, involves becoming sexually aroused by a body part, such as the feet, breasts or buttocks."
Fetoscope,Fetoscope: A device used to obtain information about a fetus within the uterus. There are two types of fetoscopes: A fiberoptic scope for looking directly at the fetus within the uterus and a stethoscope designed for listening to the fetal heart beat.
Fetus,"Fetus: An unborn offspring, from the embryo stage (the end of the eighth week after conception, when the major structures have formed) until birth."
Fever,"Fever: Although a fever technically is any body temperature above the normal of 98.6 F (37 C), in practice a person is usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 F (38 C). Fever is part of the body's own disease-fighting arsenal: rising body temperatures apparently are capable of killing off many disease- producing organisms. For that reason, low fevers should normally go untreated, although you may need to see your doctor to be sure if the fever is accompanied by any other troubling symptoms. As fevers range to 104 F and above, however, there can be unwanted consequences, particularly for children. These can include delirium and convulsions. A fever of this sort demands immediate home treatment and then medical attention. Home treatment possibilities include the use of aspirin or, in children, non-aspirin pain-killers such as acetaminophen, cool baths, or sponging to reduce the fever while seeking medical help. Fever may occur with almost any type of infection of illness. The temperature is measured with a thermometer."
Fever blister,"Fever blister: A small sore situated on the face or in the mouth that causes pain, burning, or itching before bursting and crusting over. The favorite locations are on the lips, chin or cheeks and in the nostrils. Less frequented sites are the gums or roof of the mouth (the palate). Fever blisters are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. It lies latent (dormant) in the body and is reawakened (reactivated) by factors such as stress, sunburn, or fever from a wide range of infectious diseases including colds. Recurrences are less common after age 35. Sunscreen (SPF 15 or more) on the lips prevents recurrences of herpes from sunburn. The virus is highly contagious when fever blisters are present. It is spread by kissing. Children become infected by contact with someone who has a fever blister and then they spread the virus by rubbing their cold sore and touching other children. A person with fever blisters should be careful not to touch the blisters and spread the virus to new sites, such as the eyes or genitals. There is no cure for fever blisters. Medications that can relieve some of the pain and discomfort include ointments that numb the blisters, antibiotics that control secondary bacterial infections, and ointments that soften the crests of the sores. Acyclovir, an antiviral drug, prevents the herpes simplex virus from multiplying and, in pill form, has been reported to reduce the symptoms and frequency of recurrence. Fever blisters have plagued people for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, an epidemic of fever blisters prompted Emperor Tiberius to ban kissing in public ceremonies. Today, fever blisters still occur in epidemic proportions. About 100 million episodes of recurrent fever blisters occur yearly in the United States alone. Fever blisters are also called cold sores, labial herpes (herpes labialis, in Latin) and febrile herpes (herpes febrilis, in Latin)."
"Fever, shin bone","Fever, shin bone: Called shin bone fever because it characteristically causes fever and pain in the legs, this disease is also known as trench fever. It is a disease borne by body lice that was first recognized in the trenches of World War I, when it is estimated to have affected more than a million people in Russia and on the fronts in Europe. Trench fever was again a major problem in the military in World War II and is seen endemically in Mexico, Africa, E. Europe, and elsewhere. Urban trench fever occurs among the homeless people and people with alcoholism today. Outbreaks have been documented, for example, in Seattle, Baltimore (among injection-drug users), Marseilles (France) and Burundi. The cause of trench fever is Bartonella quintana (also called Rochalimaea quintana), an unusual bacterial organism that multiplies in the gut of the body louse. Transmission of the rickettsia to people can occur by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded (scuffed) skin or into the conjunctivae (whites of the eyes). The disease is classically a 5-day fever. The onset of symptoms is sudden with high fever, severe headache, back pain and leg pain and a fleeting rash. Recovery takes a month or more. Relapses are common. The organism (B. quintana) that causes trench fever also has been found responsible for a disease called bacillary angiomatosis in people infected with HIV and for infection of the heart and great vessels (endocarditis) with bloodstream infection. Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever, quintan fever, five-day fever, Meuse fever, His' disease, His-Werner disease, Werner-His disease."
FFI,FFI: Fatal familial insomnia.
Fiber,"Fiber: The parts of fruits and vegetables that cannot be digested. Fiber is of vital importance to digestion; it helps the body move food through the digestive tract, reduces serum cholesterol, and contributes to disease protection. Also known as bulk and roughage."
Fibrillation,"Fibrillation: In cardiology, an abnormal and erratic twitching of the heart muscle."
Fibroma,Fibroma: A benign tumor consisting of a mass of connective tisue cells that have a spindle shape.
Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia: A disease characterized by chronic pain, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles, tendons, and joints, without detectable inflammation. Fibromyalgia does not cause body damage or deformity. However, undue fatigue plagues 90 percent of patients with fibromyalgia. Sleep disorder is also common in patients with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia can be associated with other rheumatic conditions, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can occur with fibromyalgia. There is no definitive medical test for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, so diagnosis is made by eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms. The most effective treatment is a combination of education, stress reduction, exercise, and medication. Formerly known as fibrositis."
Fields' disease,"Fields' disease: an extremely rare neuromuscular disease that causes muscular degeneration. The condition affects the nerves causing involuntary muscle movements. There are only two diagnosed cases, in twins Kirstie and Catherine Fields. It is believed to be congenital and appears to be progressive. There are no apparent effects on cognitive or intellectual abilities. The condition is still being studied."
Filial,"Filial: 1. In genetics, the first generation that results from the crossing of two parental lines, as the filial generation. 2. In general, pertaining to the relationship of children, both sons and daughters, to their parents. From the Latin filialis, from filius (son) and filia (daughter)."
Filler,"Filler: An inactive substance used to make the active medicine easier to measure. For example, fillers are often used in tablets or capsules because the amount of active drug is too small to be handled conveniently."
Finger stick,Finger stick: A procedure in which a finger is pricked with a lancet to obtain a small quantity of capillary blood for testing. Also called a finger prick.
Fingernail,"Fingernail: A fingernail is produced by living skin cells in the finger. A fingernail consists of several parts including the nail plate (the visible part of the nail), the nail bed (the skin beneath the nail plate), the cuticle (the tissue that overlaps the plate and rims the base of the nail), the nail folds (the skin folds that frame and support the nail on three sides), the lunula (the whitish half-moon at the base of the nail) and the matrix (the hidden part of the nail unit under the cuticle). Fingernails grow from the matrix. The nails are composed largely of keratin, a hardened protein (that is also in skin and hair). As new cells grow in the matrix, the older cells are pushed out, compacted and take on the familiar flattened, hardened form of the fingernail. The average growth rate for nails is 0.1 mm each day (or 1 centimeter in 100 days). The exact rate of nail growth depends on numerous factors including the age and sex of the individual and the time of year. Fingernails generally grow faster in young people, in males, and in the summer. Fingernails grow faster than toenails. The fingernails on the right hand of a righthanded person grow faster than those on their left hand, and vice versa."
FISH,"FISH: Fluorescence in situ hybridization, a molecular cytogenetic technique that tags genetic material with fluorescent molecules. FISH is useful for identifying chromosomes and parts of chromosomes, deciphering chromosome rearrangements, detecting chromosome abnormalities, and detecting and mapping genes. For example, a FISH probe to chromosome 21 allows the detection of cells with trisomy 21 (an extra chromosome 21, which is the cause of Down syndrome)."
Fissure,Fissure: A cleft or groove. A fissure can be normal or abnormal. A fissure in the cerebral cortex is a normal feature. It is a deep fold that involves the entire thickness of the brain wall. A fissure in the anus is abnormal. It is a painful crack in the edge of the anus and is very painful. Also called an anal fissure or fissure in ano.
Fistula,"Fistula: An abnormal passageway in the body. The fistula may go from the body surface into a blind pouch or into an internal organ or go between two internal organs.?For a common example, an anal fistula has an opening in the skin near the?anus?that leads into a blind pouch or may connect through a tunnel with the?rectal?canal.?For a rare example, a gastropericardial fistula is a passageway between the?stomach and the?pericardial sac?(that surrounds the heart). There are numerous types of fistulas. They are usually designated by the organs or parts they connect (anovaginal, bronchoesophageal, etc.)."
"Fistula, anal","Fistula, anal: See: Anal fistula."
"Fixation, internal","Fixation, internal: A surgical procedure that stabilizes and joins the ends of fractured (broken) bones by mechanical devices such as metal plates, pins, rods, wires or screws. Internal fixation is as opposed to external fixation of a fracture by a splint or cast."
Fixative,"Fixative: A medium such as a solution or spray that preserves specimens of tissues or cells. Most biopsies and specimens removed at surgery are fixed in a solution such as formalin (dilute formaldehyde) before further processing takes place. Other common ingredients used in fixatives are alcohol, mercuric chloride, potassium dichromate and sodium sulfate. ""Fixative"" is derived from the Latin ""figere"" (to fix, fasten, make stable). Related English words include ""fixture"" (that which remains stable and in place) and ""fixity"" (state of being stable, steady, permanent)."
Flank,Flank: a term used to describe the part of the body in humans on the side between the ribs and hip. The term flank is also used to describe the side part of an animal's body.
FLAP,"FLAP: A gene that helps make a leukotriene, a signal that activates the white blood cells involved in inflammation. FLAP stands for 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein. FLAP has been implicated in a number of inflammatory responses, including asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, heart attack and stroke. FLAP was the first gene discovered to be a major risk factor for the common form of heart attack and the second major genetic factor identified in the common form of stroke. Also known, confusingly, as 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, five-lipoxygenase-activating protein, five-lipoxygenase activating protein, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, and ALOX5AP."
Flare,"Flare: 1. an exacerbation of a chronic disease. Sometimes referred to as a flare-up, a flare occurs when symptoms of a disease that has been present for a time suddenly worsen. A flare is a transient worsening in severity of a disease or condition that eventually subsides or lessens. For example, in many arthritis conditions the joints can flare with worsening of stiffness, pain, and swelling. 2. An area of skin redness surrounding a site of an injection or other irritation."
Flashing,"Flashing: ""Flashing,"" or exhibitionism is characterized by intense, sexually arousing fantasies, urges or behaviors involving exposure of the individual's genitals to an unsuspecting stranger. The individual with this problem, sometimes called a ""flasher,"" feels a need to surprise, shock or impress his victims. The condition usually is limited to the exposure, with no other harmful advances made, although ""indecent exposure"" is illegal. Actual sexual contact with the victim is rare. However, the person may masturbate while exposing himself or while fantasizing about exposing himself."
Flat affect,"Flat affect: A severe reduction in emotional expressiveness. People with depression and schizophrenia often show flat affect. A person with schizophrenia may not show the signs of normal emotion, perhaps may speak in a monotonous voice, have diminished facial expressions, and appear extremely apathetic. Also known as blunted affect."
Flatulence,"Flatulence: Excess gas in the intestinal tract. But excess flatulence is difficult to define without a yardstick to measure the ""normal"" frequency of gas passages. Symptom-free individuals have recorded approximately 14 passages of gas per 24 hours. From the Latin flastus, meaning blowing, as a breeze or snort."
Flatus,"Flatus: Gas in the intestinal tract or gas passed through the anus. Intestinal gas contains numerous gases including oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and methane. The foul smell usually is caused by small traces of gases such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and methane."
Flexion,"Flexion: The process of bending, or the state of being bent. For example, flexion of the fingers results in a clenched fist."
Floater,"Floater: A blurry spot that seems to drift in front of the eyes but does not block vision. The blur is the result of debris from the vitreous of the eye casting a shadow on the retina. The spot is the image formed by a deposit of protein drifting in the vitreous, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the middle of the eye. Floaters are often described by patients as spots, strands, or little flies. Floaters are usually benign (not serious). They often occur as the result of separation of the vitreous gel from the retina. This condition is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Although a PVD occurs commonly, retinal tears associated with the condition. The onset of new floaters particularly with flashing lights is an indication for an urgent eye exam to be sure there is no retinal tear. No treatments are available for floaters although they tend to become less noticeable over time. Remember that although floaters are usually not associated with serious eye problems, new ones are an indication for an eye examination. Permanent or recurring white or black spots in the same area of your field of vision may, however, be an early warning sign of cataracts or another serious eye problem. If you experience a shadow or curtain that affects any part of your vision, this can indicate that a retinal tear has occurred and has progressed to a detached retina. In this situation, you should immediately consult an ophthalmologist since time is of the essence."
Floating rib,"Floating rib: One of the last two ribs. A rib is said to be ""floating"" if it does not attach to the sternum (the breast bone) or to another rib. There are usually 12 pairs of ribs in all. Each pair of ribs is attached to the building blocks of the spine (the vertebrae) in the back. The 12 pairs of ribs consist of: The upper three false ribs connect to the costal cartilages of the ribs just above them. The last two false ribs, however, usually have no ventral attachment (no anchor at all in front) and are called floating, fluctuating or vertebral ribs."
Floppy baby syndrome,Floppy baby syndrome: A general medical reference to an abnormal condition of newborns and infants manifested by inadequate tone of the muscles. It can be due to a multitude of different neurologic and muscle problems. See also Hypotonia.
Flora,"Flora: The population of microbes inhabiting the outside or inside surfaces of people (or other animals). Also, the population of plants including flowers, usually in a particular area. The word ""flora"" is the name of the Roman goddess of flowers."
Flush,"Flush: (1) A redness of the skin, typically over the cheeks or neck. A flush is usually temporary and brought on by excitement, exercise, fever, or embarrassment. Flushing is an involuntary (uncontrollable) response of the nervous system leading to widening of the capillaries of the involved skin. Also referred to as a blush (or, as a verb, to blush). Flushing may also be caused by medications or other substances that cause widening of the capillaries, such as niacin. (2) Flush also means to wash out a wound or body area."
Flutter,"Flutter: Flutter is a rapid vibration or pulsation. The difference between flutter and fibrillation is that flutter is well organized while fibrillation is not. For example, atrial flutter consists of well-organized but over-rapid contractions of the atrium of the heart (usually at a rate of 250-350 contractions per minute). Atrial flutter is a serious and potentially unstable cardiac rhythm."
Focal,"Focal: Pertaining to a focus which in medicine may refer to:
1. The point at which rays converge as, for example, in the focal point.
2. A localized area of disease. A focal cancer is limited to one specific area."
Focal sclerosis,Focal sclerosis: See: Multiple sclerosis.
FODMAPs,"FODMAPs: an acronym for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are a group of sugar-related carbohydrates that have been termed ""indigestible"" because they are poorly broken down in the intestine and absorbed into the body. The FODMAPs are fermented by bacteria within the intestine with the production of gas and the secretion of fluid into the intestine. Lactose, the sugar in milk, is the most common example of a FODMAP that is poorly digested and absorbed by many people. FODMAPs also are found in foods including pears, apples, honey, artichokes, garlic, onions, wheat, rye, stone fruits, some vegetables, and artificial sweeteners. Restricting the intake of foods high in FODMAPs reduces the amount of intestinal gas and fluid. A diet low in these compounds has been proposed as a way to manage irritable bowel-related symptoms, since reducing these fermentable substances decreases the amount of gas and water in the intestine that leads to bloating, and loose bowel movements."
Folic acid,"Folic acid: One of the B vitamins that is a key factor in the synthesis (the making) of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA). A deficiency of folic acid after birth causes a kind of anemia, namely, megaloblastic anemia in which there is a paucity of red blood cells and those that are made are unusually large and immature (so-called blast cells). Lack of adequate folic acid during pregnancy was first found to increase the risk for the baby to have a birth defect involving the spinal cord and brain -- a neural tube defect such as spina bifida (meningomyelocele) or anencephaly. The association was then investigated between the mother's use of drugs that act as folic acid antagonists in the first trimester of pregnancy and the birth of a child with a congenital malformation (birth defect). It was found that folic acid antagonists increased the risk not only of neural tube defects but also of congenital heart malformations, cleft lip and palate, and urinary tract defects. Folic acid, it now is clear, reduces the risks for a remarkably broad gamut of birth defects. In order for folic acid to be effective in preventing these birth defects, the vitamin must be consumed every day beginning before conception and continuing through the first three months of pregnancy. Educating women (and their doctors) about the importance of folic acid is going to require a major effort. According to one study, only 10% of women know that folic acid should be taken before pregnancy. An adequate intake of folic acid appears important to the health of arteries, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and strokes (it may do so by lowering the level of homocysteine). Folic acid also may lower the risk of stomach cancer."
Folliculitis,"Folliculitis: An infection or inflammation of the hair follicles of the skin. Inflammation of the hair follicles can occur when the skin is disrupted or inflamed due to a number of conditions, including acne, or injuries, friction from clothing, excessive sweating, or exposure to toxins. The symptoms vary and include small, red bumps or blisters around hair follicles, blisters filled with pus, or itching and tenderness of the involved area. When the deeper parts of the hair follicle are involved a painful lump or mass may be felt. ""Hot tub folliculitis"" refers to a folliculitis arising from infection with Pseudomonas bacteria which can be present in hot tubs where the acidity and chlorine levels are not well controlled."
Fomentation,"Fomentation: A quaint old term for the application of hot packs or the substance so applied. From the Latin ""fovimentum"" which meant, no surprise, to ""a warm application."" To ""foment"" means, literally, to warm or heat up. It is, figuratively, to incite. For example, to forment fear."
Fontanel (fontanelle),"Fontanel (fontanelle): The word fontanel comes from the French fontaine for fountain. The medical term fontanel is a ""soft spot"" of the skull. The ""soft spot"" is soft precisely because the cartilage there has not yet hardened into bone between the skull bones. There are normally two fontanels, both in the midline of the skull, one (the anterior fontanel) well in front of the other (the posterior fontanel). The posterior fontanel closes first, at latest by the age of 8 weeks in a full-term baby. The anterior fontanel closes at 18 months of age on the average but it can close normally as early as 9 months. If fontanels close too early or too late, that may be a sign of a problem."
Food,Food: Any substance that is eaten to provide nutritional support for the body.
Food and Drug Administration,"Food and Drug Administration: An agency within the US Public Health Service that provides a number of health-related services. Abbreviated FDA. The FDA's services include inspecting food and food-processing facilities to ensure wholesomeness and safety; scrutinizing food and drugs for pets and farm animals; ensuring that cosmetics will not cause harm; monitoring the health of the nation's blood supply; ensuring that medicines, medical devices, and biologicals (such as insulin and vaccines) are safe and effective; and testing radiation-emitting products such as microwave ovens to protect the public. The FDA also oversees health and safety labeling of these products. All new prescription and over-the-counter drugs are subject to FDA approval. The FDA must determine that a new drug produces the benefits it's supposed to produce, without causing side effects that would outweigh the benefits. It does so by looking at the results of clinical trials done outside the FDA. When serious adverse effects from a medication are reported, the FDA has the power to force the manufacturer to make changes in the drug, change its safety labeling or marketing practices, or remove the medication from the market."
Food poisoning,"Food poisoning: The illness resulting from eating food or drinking water containing poisonous substances including bacteria, viruses, pesticides, or toxins. Symptoms generally begin within 2 to 6 hours and include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness."
"Food poisoning, Campylobacter","Food poisoning, Campylobacter: Now a leading cause of bacterial food poisoning, caused by an Campylobacter jejuni, most often spread by contact with raw or undercooked poultry. A single drop of juice from a contaminated chicken is enough to make someone sick with Campylobacteriosis (disease due to Campylobacter bacteria). Campylobacteriosis usually strikes only one person or a few people at a time. A common way to become infected is to cut poultry meat on a cutting board, and then use the unwashed cutting board or utensil to prepare vegetables or other raw or lightly cooked foods. The Campylobacter organisms from the raw meat can then spread to the other foods. The organism is not usually spread from person to person, but this can happen if the infected person is a small child or is producing a large volume of diarrhea. Many chicken flocks are silently infected with Campylobacter; that is, the chickens are infected with the organism but show no signs of illness. When an infected bird is slaughtered, Campylobacter can be transferred from the intestines to the meat. More than half of the raw chicken in the US market has Campylobacter on it. Campylobacter is also present in the giblets, especially the liver. Larger outbreaks of Campylobacteriosis are not usually associated with raw poultry but with drinking unpasteurized milk or contaminated water. Unpasteurized milk can become contaminated if the cow has an infection with Campylobacter in her udder or if the milk is contaminated with manure. Surface water and mountain streams can become contaminated from infected feces from cows or wild birds. This infection is common in the developing world, and travelers to foreign countries are also at risk for becoming infected with Campylobacter. Animals can also be infected, and some people are known to have acquired their infection from contact with the infected stool of an ill dog or cat. Symptoms tend to start 2 to 5 days after exposure and typically last a week. They resemble viral gastroenteritis -- diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, cramping, nausea and vomiting -- but with campylobacter, fever is typical and the diarrhea is often bloody. Most people get better within 2 to 5 days after the onset of symptoms without specific treatment, although sometimes recovery can take up to 10 days. People with immune deficiencies may benefit from two weeks of antibiotics such as erythromycin or a fluoroquinolone. And, as all types of diarrhea, one should maintain a high intake of fluids for as long as the diarrhea persists. To prevent campylobacteriosis, Most people who have campylobacteriosis recover completely. However, some suffer long-term consequences. One is arthritis. Another is a condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome. Both are thought to occur when a person's immune system is ""triggered"" by the Campylobacter to attack the person's own body. In arthritis, the attack is mounted against joints while in Guillain-Barre syndrome the attack is against nerves leading to ascending paralysis that typically lasts several weeks and usually requires intensive care. It is estimated that approximately one in every 1000 campylobacteriosis cases leads to Guillain-Barre syndrome. As many as 40% of Guillain-Barre syndrome cases may be triggered by campylobacteriosis."
Foodborne disease,"Foodborne disease: A disease caused by consuming contaminated food or drink. Myriad microbes and toxic substances can contaminate foods. There are more then 250 known foodborne diseases. The majority are infectious and are caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Other foodborne diseases are essentially poisonings caused by toxins, chemicals contaminating the food. All foodborne microbes and toxins enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract and often causes the first symptoms there. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea are frequent in foodborne diseases. Many microbes can spread in more than one way, so it may not be immediately evident that a disease is foodborne. The distinction matters, because public health authorities need to know how a particular disease is spreading to take the appropriate steps to stop it. For example, infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) can be acquired through contaminated food, contaminated drinking water, contaminated swimming water, and from toddler to toddler at a day care center. Depending on which means of spread cause a case, the measures to stop other cases from occurring could range from removing contaminated food from stores, chlorinating a swimming pool, or closing a child day care center. The most common foodborne infections are caused by three bacteria -- Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7 -- and by a group of viruses called calicivirus, better known as Norwalk-like virus: Common diseases that are usually transmitted by other routes are occasionally foodborne. These include infections caused by Shigella, hepatitis A, and the parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidia. Food toxins -- Some foodborne diseases are caused by a toxin in the food that was produced by a microbe in the food. For example, staph bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) can grow in food and produce a toxin that causes intense vomiting. The rare but deadly disease botulism occurs when the bacterium Clostridium botulinum grows and produces a powerful paralytic toxin in foods. These toxins can produce illness even if the microbes that produced them are no longer there. Other foodborne diseases -- Among the many other foodborne diseases are the following: amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica infection), Blastocystis hominis infection, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), cholera, cryptosporidiosis (crypto), cyclospora cayetanensis, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (E. coli), viral gastroenteritis, giardiasis, listeriosis, marine toxins shigellosis, travelers' diarrhea, trichinosis (trichinellosis), typhoid, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus infection. Magnitude of the problem -- An estimated 76 million cases of foodborne disease occur each year in the US alone. The great majority of these cases are mild and cause symptoms for only a day or two. Some cases are more serious, and CDC estimates that there are 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to foodborne diseases each year in the US. The most severe cases tend to occur in the very old, the very young, those who have an illness already that reduces their immune system function, and in healthy people exposed to a very high dose of an organism."
Foot,"Foot: The end of the leg on which a person normally stands and walks. The foot is an extremely complex anatomic structure made up of 26 bones and 33 joints that must work together with 19 muscles and 107 ligaments to execute highly precise movements. At the same time the foot must be strong to support more than 100,000 pounds of pressure for every mile walked. Even small changes in the foot can unexpectedly undermine its structural integrity and cause pain with every step. Foot function has been in conflict with fashion for many years. In China, girls once had their feet bound to shorten them by bending the toes backward. Nowadays, high heels can and often do cause foot problems as well as knee, hip, and back pain. Too narrow shoes make the big toe bend outward, forming a bunion or swollen big-toe joint. Some shoes scrunch up the smaller toes, causing claw or hammer toes with painful corns or calluses on the tops of these toes. Shoes, first and foremost, should fit the feet. Cosmetic surgery on the feet done purely to permit the person to wear fashionable shoes runs a serious risk of producing more harm than good. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society advises against cosmetic surgery on the feet. The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgery notes; ""Surgery performed solely for the purpose of improving the appearance or size of the foot or ankle carries risks without medical benefit, and therefore should not be undertaken."" The foot as a measure of length is 12 inches or a third of a yard or, metrically, 30.48 centimeters. The abbreviation for foot is ft."
Foot-drop,"Foot-drop: Dropping of the front of the foot due to weakness or paralysis of the anterior muscles of the lower leg. Foot-drop results in what is called a steppage gait in which the advancing foot is lifted high in order that the toes may clear the ground. Foot drop can be due to a number of conditions including injury to the muscles that dorsiflex the foot or to the nerves to those muscles, a neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, a stroke, drug toxicity, and diabetes. Treatment may include an ankle-foot orthosis."
Forearm,Forearm: The portion of the upper limb from the elbow to the wrist. The forearm has two bones: the radius and ulna.
Foreign body airway obstruction,"Foreign body airway obstruction: a partial or complete blockage of the breathing tubes to the lungs due to a foreign body (for example, food, a bead, toy, etc.). The onset of respiratory distress may be sudden with cough. There is often agitation in the early stage of airway obstruction. The signs of respiratory distress include labored, ineffective breathing until the person is not longer breathing (apneic). Loss of consciousness occurs if the obstruction is not relieved. Treatment of airway obstruction due to a foreign body includes:"
Forensic,"Forensic: Dealing with the application of scientific knowledge to legal problems and legal proceedings as, for example, in forensic anthropology, forensic dentistry, forensic experts, forensic medicine (legal medicine), forensic pathology, forensic science, etc. The word ""forensic"" has an unusual history. It comes from the Latin word ""forensis"" pertaining to a forum. In ancient Rome the forum was a market place where people gathered, not just to buy things, but also to conduct all kinds of business, including that of public affairs. The meaning of ""forensic"" later came to be restricted to refer to the courts of law. The word entered English usage in 1659."
Forensic genetics,"Forensic genetics: The branch of genetics that deals with the application of genetic knowledge to legal problems and legal proceedings. Forensic genetics is also a branch of forensic medicine which deals more broadly with the application of medical knowledge to legal matters. Forensic genetics today tends to conjure up DNA. However, even the term ""DNA fingerprinting"" is reminiscent of older methods of police identification. Forensic genetics is not a new field. Long before the era of DNA fingerprinting, blood grouping, HLA typing and other tests of genetic markers in blood were done to try to determine who did it (and, more often, who did not do it)."
Forensic medicine,"Forensic medicine: The branch of medicine dealing with the application of medical knowledge to establish facts in civil or criminal legal cases, such as an investigation into the cause and time of a suspicious death. Also known as forensic pathology."
Foreskin,"Foreskin: The fold of skin which covers the head (the glans) of the penis. Also called the prepuce. Only about 1 in every 20 boys is born with a retractable foreskin. This reflects the fact that the histologic (tissue) development of the foreskin is usually not complete at birth. The foreskin is thus not fully separable from the glans in about 96% of newborn boys. By a year of 1 year, the foreskin can be retracted in 50% of boys and by 3 years, the foreskin can be retracted in 80% to 90% of uncircumcised boys. Newborn circumcision diminishes the risk for cancer of the penis and lowers the risk for cancer of the cervix in sexual partners. It also decreases the risk of urinary tract infections and lowers the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including especially HIV."
Formalin,"Formalin: A 37% aqueous (water) solution of formaldehyde, a pungent gas, with the chemical formula HCHO, used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and especially today as a fixative for histology (the study of tissues under the microscope)."
Formication,"Formication: The illusion or hallucination that ants or other insects are creeping on or under the skin. Formication is a feature of some psychotic states as well as drug and alcohol abuse. From the Latin formicatio, from formicare meaning to creep like an ant. Not to be confused with fornication."
Formula feeding,"Formula feeding: Feeding an infant or toddler prepared formula instead of or in addition to breastfeeding. Formula feeding is indicated when the mother has an illness that could be passed on to the baby through breast milk or through the close physical proximity required for breastfeeding. Otherwise, experts in infant nutrition agree that breastfeeding is best."
Formulary,"Formulary: 1. A collection of formulas, recipes, or prescriptions. 2. In medicine, a listing of prescription drugs approved for use."
Fourth Disease (Dukes' Disease),"Fourth disease is a disorder characterized by a rash due to a toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus (Staph aureus bacteria). Measles and scarlet fever were differentiated from one another in the 17th century. Rubella was accepted as the third distinct pediatric exanthem (rash) in 1881. What were thought to be two distinct forms of rubella were then described and it was proposed that one of these forms of rubella was a separate entity that was called fourth disease. For many years, fourth disease was considered a non-entity, perhaps a mild form of scarlet fever, but certainly not a distinct disease. Now it is clear that fourth disease is caused by exotoxin-producing Staph aureus. Fourth disease is also known as Filatov-Dukes disease or Dukes' disease."
labor,"Fourth stage of labor: The hour or two after delivery when the tone of the uterus is reestablished as the uterus contracts again, expelling any remaining contents. These contractions are hastened by breastfeeding, which stimulates production of the hormone oxytocin."
Fracture,"Fracture: A break in bone or cartilage. Although usually a result of trauma, a fracture can be the result of an acquired disease of bone, such as osteoporosis, or of abnormal formation of bone in a congenital disease of bone, such as osteogenesis imperfecta ('brittle bone disease'). Fractures are classified according to their character and location (for example, greenstick fracture of the radius)."
Frankenfood,Frankenfood: Perjorative term for genetically modified food whether it be derived from genetically engineered plants or animals.
Freckle,"Freckle: A flat circular spot on the skin about the size of the head of a nail that develops after repeated exposure to sunlight, particularly in someone of fair complexion. Freckles may be yellow, tan, light-brown, brown, or black. They are always darker than the skin around them since they are due to deposits of the dark melanin, a dark pigment. There are two basic types of freckles -- ephelides and lentigines. Ephelides (singular: ephelis) are flat light-brown spots that typically appear during the sunny months and fade in the winter. Lentigines (singular: lentigo) are small tan, brown, or black spots which tend to be darker than an ephelis-type freckle and which do not fade in the winter. The sun is not the only factor that induces freckles. Heredity also influences freckling, as witnessed by the striking similarity in the total number of freckles on identical twins. Such similarities are considerably less marked in fraternal twins. A gene for freckles has been mapped to chromosome 4q32-q34. Freckles are harmless. They may sometimes be confused with more serious skin problems. Conversely, more serious problems such as skin cancer may at times be passed over as a mere freckle. Anyone who has one or more pigmented spots of which they are not certain should be seen by a dermatologist. Treatments are available to lighten or eliminate those freckles whose appearance bothers their owners. See also: Ephelis; Lentigo; LEOPARD syndrome."
French disease,"French disease: Syphilis. Depending upon someone's thoughts as to where the disease came from, syphilis was also known as the Italian, Spanish, German and Polish disease. The name ""syphilis"" was coined by Hieronymus Fracastorius (Girolamo Fracastoro). Fracastorius was a true Renaissance man; he wrote on the temperature of wines, the rise of the Nile, poetry, the mind, and the soul; he was an astronomer, geographer, botanist, mathematician, philosopher and, last but not least in the present context, a physician. In 1530 he published the poem ""Syphilis sive morbus gallicus"" (Syphilis or the French Disease) in which the name of the disease first appeared. Perhaps more importantly, Fracastorius went on in 1546 to write ""On Contagion"" (""De contagione et contagiosis morbis et curatione""), the first known discussion of the phenomenon of contagious infection: a landmark in the history of infectious disease."
"Frequency, urinary","Frequency, urinary: Urinating too often, at too frequent intervals, not due to an unusually large volume of urine, but rather to a decrease in the capacity of the bladder to hold urine."
Frigidity,"Frigidity: Failure of a female to respond to sexual stimulus; aversion on the part of a woman to sexual intercourse; failure of a female to achieve an orgasm (anorgasmia) during sexual intercourse. This disorder can stem from psychological or emotional problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, worry, guilt, fear of painful intercourse and fear of pregnancy. It can also develop from the undesirability of a partner, the undesirability of the setting, and the use of alcohol or drugs. ""Frigid-"" is derived from the Latin word ""frigidus"" (cold.) The suffix ""-ity"" is derived from the Latin ""-itas"" (condition, state)."
Frontal,"Frontal: In anatomy, pertaining to the forehead. As, for example, the frontal bone, frontal sinus, and frontal nerve. From the Latin ""frons"" meaning the forehead or brow."
Fructose,Fructose: A sugar that occurs naturally in fruits and honey. Fructose has 4 calories per gram.
ft.,"Ft.: Abbreviation for foot, a measure of length."
FTA-ABS test,"FTA-ABS test: FTA-ABS stands for fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed, a blood serum screening test for syphilis designed to demonstrate the presence or absence of specific antibodies directed against the organism (Treponema pallidum) responsible for syphilis. FTA-ABS detects the majority but not all cases of the disease. It is thus a way of screening for the disease. A negative FTA-ABS test result is consistent with a person not having syphilis. However, a person may have a negative FTA-ABS test result while in the early (primary) and late (tertiary) stages of the disease. In the middle (secondary) stage of syphilis, the FTA-ABS test is most reliable and is reportedly positive in 100% of cases. ."
Fundus,"Fundus: In medicine, the bottom or base of an organ. For example, the fundus of the eye is the retina. However, the fundus of the stomach is inexplicably the upper portion. From the Latin for 'the bottom.'"
"Fundus, retinal","Fundus, retinal: The interior lining of the eyeball, including the retina (the light-sensitive screen), optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula (the small spot in the retina where vision is keenest). The fundus is the portion of the inner eye that can be seen during an eye examination by looking through the pupil. ""Fundus"" is the Latin word for the bottom. In medicine, fundus refers to the bottom or base of an organ."
Fungal,"Fungal: Pertaining to a fungus. For example, a fungal skin infection."
Fungus,"Fungus: A single-celled or multicellular organism. Fungi can be true pathogens (such as histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis) that cause infections in healthy persons or they can be opportunistic pathogens (such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis) that cause infections in immunocompromised persons (including cancer patients, transplant recipients, and persons with AIDS). An example of a common fungus is the yeast organism which causes thrush and diaper rash (diaper dermatitis). Fungi are also used for the development of antibiotics, antitoxins, and other drugs used to control various human diseases."
Furuncle,"Furuncle: Is also known as a ""boil."" A boil is a tender, dome-shaped skin lesion caused by an infection around a hair follicle with Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotics are often not very helpful in treating abscesses. The main treatments include hot packs and draining (""lancing"") the abscess, but only when it is soft and ready to drain. If you develop an abscess and. have fever, a long-term illness (such as cancer or diabetes) or are on medication that suppresses the immune system, you should contact your healthcare practitioner."
Fusiform,"Fusiform: Formed like a spindle: wider in the middle and tapering toward the ends. For example, a fusiform aneurysm is a vascular outpouching that is shaped like a spindle."
G6PD deficiency,"G6PD deficiency: Deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the most common enzyme defect of medical importance. About 10 percent of American black males have G6PD deficiency, as do a lesser percent of black females. G6PD deficiency is also increased in frequency in people of Mediterranean origin (including Italians, Greeks, Arabs, and Jews). The gene encoding G6PD is on the X chromosome. Males with this enzyme deficiency may develop anemia due to the breakup of their red blood cells when they are exposed to oxidant drugs, naphthalene moth balls, or fava beans. The offending drugs include the antimalarial primaquine, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, nitrofurans, phenacetin, and some vitamin K derivatives. Fever, viral and bacterial infections, and diabetic acidosis can also precipitate a hemolytic crisis (when the red blood cells break up), resulting in anemia and jaundice. The concentration of G6PD deficiency in certain populations is believed to reflect a protective effect it afforded (much like sickle cell trait) against malaria."
GAD,GAD: Generalized anxiety disorder.
#NAME?,"Gain-of-function mutation: A mutation that confers new or enhanced activity on a protein. Loss-of-function mutations, which are more common, result in reduced or abolished protein function."
Gait,"Gait: A manner of walking. Observation of gait can provide early diagnostic clues for a number of disorders, including cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and Rett syndrome."
Galactorrhea,"Galactorrhea: The spontaneous flow of milk from the nipple at any time other than during nursing. Galactorrhea can be due to ""normal"" factors such as an unrecognized pregnancy, trauma, surgery, overexercise or one of a number of drugs (including amphetamine, cimetidine, female hormone replacement therapy, hydroxyzine, methyldopa, nicotine, narcotics, reserpine, antidepressants of the so-called tricyclic type, or verapamil). Galactorrhea can also be due to ""abnormal"" factors of a pathologic nature such as cirrhosis of the liver, a false pregnancy (pseudocyesis), renal (kidney) failure, disorders of the spinal cord, or a prolactinoma (a benign pituitary tumor that secretes the hormone prolactin which stimulates milk production). The word ""galactorrhea"" comes from the Greek ""galaktos"" meaning ""milk"" + ""rhein"" meaning ""to flow"" = ""to flow milk."" (The naturally occurring sugar in breast milk is called galactose.) Galactorrhea is also sometimes called witch's milk."
Galen,"Galen: Greek physician and philosopher (born about 129 AD, died about 210 AD) known among other things for his discovery of blood in human arteries and for his dissection of the human cranial nerves, the nerves that supply key areas of the head, face, and upper chest. The son of Nicon, a well-to-do architect and builder in Pergamum (Asia Minor), Galen had all the world open to him. He first studied philosophy, one of the traditional fields for a boy of his background. Nicon then had a dream in which Asclepius, the god of healing, told him to permit his son to study medicine. Galen began his medical studies in Pergamum at the age of 16-17. In search of medical knowledge, he then roamed about much of the eastern Mediterranean studying medicine in various cities including Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) and Corinth (Greece). He completed his studies at the famous medical school in Alexandria (Egypt). Galen returned to Pergamum and at age 28 was appointed physician to the school of gladiators, a post he occupied for four years and that some say made him ""the first sports medicine specialist."" After that, a career in Rome was in the cards. There he went at age 32 and became a famous and influential physician, taking on cases that no one else could handle. The consultant's consultant, so to speak. He accompanied the Roman legions of Marcus Aurelius on their campaigns, and served as the personal physician to several emperors. Galen performed surgical dismantling (dissection) of animals and humans and described what he saw (not always the practice of the day). He identified the majority (seven of the twelve) of the cranial nerves. He also did experiments such as severing a nerve and observing the effects. He is thus regarded as ""the founder of experimental physiology."" Galen was the first to determine that arteries carried blood and not air! (For over 400 years the Alexandrian school of medicine had taught that arteries are full of air). Galen's theories about the blood circulation, however, were well off the mark and it was not until the 17th century that the great English physician William Harvey would challenge Galen's ideas in this regard. With Hippocrates who preceded him by some 500 years, Galen was preeminent among the most distinguished physicians of antiquity. He knew all of the medical knowledge of his day, gathered it together, and wrote voluminously (and well) about it. Galen summed up the medicine of antiquity. His writing were a blessing to the ancient world. But they became a curse when, for more than a millennium, they were held to be the unassailable authority on medicine and this paralyzed the progress of medicine, something Galen would have greatly deplored."
Galeophobia,"Galeophobia: An abnormally large and persistent fear of sharks. Sufferers from this phobia experience anxiety even though they may be safe on a boat or in an aquarium or on a beach. Hollywood films depicting sharks as calculating, vengeful diabolical monsters have no doubt enkindled the fear of sharks in many persons. So have validated reports of sharks venturing into rivers and lakes. ""Galeophobia"" is derived from the Greek words ""galeos"" (shark with markings resembling those on a weasel) and ""phobos"" (fear). ""Galeophobia"" is also sometimes used as alternate term for ailurophobia, fear of cats, because the Greek word ""galeos"" is derived from ""galee,"" a Greek meaning ""polecat"" and ""weasel."""
Gallbladder,"Gallbladder: A pear-shaped organ located below the liver that stores the bile secreted by the liver. During and after a fatty meal, the gallbladder contracts, delivering the bile through the bile ducts into the intestines to help with digestion."
Gallbladder absence,"Gallbladder absence: This condition, also known as agenesis (failure of development) of the gallbladder, occurs in approximately one out of every 1,000 people. Gallbladder agenesis is an isolated abnormality in more than two-thirds (70%) of people with agenesis. The person with isolated agenesis of the gallbladder is healthy. No treatment is needed. The prognosis (outlook) is excellent. Gallbladder agenesis occurs in association with additional malformations in the remaining (30%) of cases which fall into two groups: one (9%) with atresia (failure of opening) of the bile ducts and the other (21%) with normal bile ducts but distant abnormalities such as ventricular septal defect (a hole between the ventricles of the heart), imperforate anus (blind rectum with no anus), malrotation of the gut (failure of the intestines to rotate normally during embryonic development), renal agenesis (absence of a kidney), and syndactyly (fusion of fingers). Agenesis of the gallbladder is most often a sporadic (unpredictable) occurrence with no clear cause. However, there are families in which the condition has occurred in several members suggesting that there are hereditary forms of gallbladder agenesis. Children with gallbladder agenesis plus distant malformations tend to have trisomy 13 or another chromosomal abnormality that carries a poor prognosis."
Gallop rhythm,Gallop rhythm: An abnormal heart rhythm that pounds in the chest resembling the gallop of a horse when heard during examination with a stethoscope.
Gallstones,"Gallstones: Stones that form when substances in the bile harden. Gallstones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. There can be just one large stone, hundreds of tiny stones, or any combination. Gallstones can block the normal flow of bile if they lodge in any of the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. That includes the hepatic ducts, which carry bile out of the liver; the cystic duct, which takes bile to and from the gallbladder; and the common bile duct, which takes bile from the cystic and hepatic ducts to the small intestine. Bile trapped in these ducts can cause inflammation in the gallbladder, the ducts, or, rarely, the liver. Other ducts open into the common bile duct, including the pancreatic duct, which carries digestive enzymes out of the pancreas. If a gallstone blocks the opening to that duct, digestive enzymes can become trapped in the pancreas and cause an extremely painful inflammation called gallstone pancreatitis. If any of these ducts remain blocked for a significant period of time, severe damage or infections can occur, affecting the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas. Gallstone attacks often occur after eating a meal, especially a fatty one. Symptoms can include pain for up to several hours in the upper, back, or under the right shoulder together with nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating or indigestion. These symptoms can mimic those of other problems, including heart attack, so accurate diagnosis is important. There are two types of gallstones -- cholesterol stones and pigment stones. Cholesterol stones account for about 80 percent of gallstones in N. America and Europe. Pigment stones have a high content of bilirubin (a colored pigment) and account for over 90 percent of gallstones in Asia. Gallstones are more common among women, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, and people who are overweight. Laparoscopic surgery to remove the gallbladder is the most common treatment. The surgery is called cholecystectomy. Open surgery is done if there are obstacles to laparoscopy. The gallbladder is a dispensable organ. Without it, the bile flows directly into the small intestine, instead of being stored in the gallbladder."
GALT,"GALT: The lack of the enzyme to break down the sugar (galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase) causes the genetic metabolic disease called galactosemia. Galactosemia is an elevated level of galactose in the blood. GALT is also the acronym for the gene that encodes the enzyme. Galactosemia causes liver dysfunction, susceptibility to infections, failure to thrive, ovarian problems, and cataracts."
Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT),"Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): A technique in which the male and female germ cells required to begin formation of a human embryo are injected into a woman's fallopian tubes of the female for fertilization. This technique is one of the methods doctors use to overcome infertility, the inability of couples to produce offspring on their own. Gametes (germ cells) in males are the spermatozoa, or sperm, and those in females are ova, or eggs. After a sperm fertilizes an egg in the fallopian tubes, the egg implants itself in the uterus (womb), a hollow organ that lodges and nourishes the embryo during its development. The term ""intrafallopian"" means ""inside the fallopian tubes."" (""Intra,"" a Latin word, means ""within"" or ""inside."") Thus, in the GIFT technique, fertilization takes place inside the body of the female. By contrast, in the technique of in vitro fertilization (IVF), eggs are fertilized outside the body. ""Gamete"" is derived from the Greek word ""gamete"" (wife) and ""gamein"" (to marry)."
Gametogenesis,"Gametogenesis: The development and production of the male and female germ cells required to form a new individual. The male and female germ cells are called gametes. The gametes in human males are produced by the testes, two globe-shaped reproductive organs just below the penis. Male gametes are what most people refer to as sperm. Gametes in human females are produced by the ovaries, two oblong organs on each side of the uterus in the lower abdomen. Female gametes are what most people refer to as eggs or ova. After sexual intercourse, an ejaculated sperm cell penetrates an egg and unites with it (fertilizes it). The fertilized egg is called the zygote. The reproductive organs in both males and females (testes and ovaries, respectively) begin gametogenesis with a primitive germ cell. A primitive germ cell is a seed cell. Like a seed planted in a garden, a primitive germ cell initiates the process that eventually results in a new being. The primitive germ cell contains 46 pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures that hold the genetic information (the DNA) that determine the makeup of the new being. In humans, chromosomes influence hair, eye and skin color, height, bone structure, and all of the characteristics that prompt people to say that a child ""takes after"" his mother or father. Chromosomes occur in pairs because they reflect the makeup of the previous generation -- 23 chromosomes from the father and 23 from the mother. However, the gametes produced by the testes and the ovaries cannot each contain 46 chromosomes. Otherwise, after they unite, they will contain 92 chromosomes. Thus, the germ cells produced by the testes and ovaries each divide once, then divide again, in a reduction process that creates cells containing 23 chromosomes, or half the original number. This reduction process is known as meiosis. Then, after a male ejaculates sperm into a female and fertilizes her egg, a new individual with 46 chromosomes begins to form. This is the beginning of pregnancy. ""Gamete"" is derived from the Greek word ""gamete"" (wife) and ""gamein"" (to marry). ""Genesis"" is derived from the Greek word ""genein"" (to produce). Thus, in gametogenesis, cells marry (""gamein"") and produce (""genein"") a new being."
Gamma globulin,"Gamma globulin: A major class of immunoglobulins found in the blood, including many of the most common antibodies circulating in the blood. Also called immunoglobulin G (IgG)."
Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB),"Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB): Known in Europe as Gamma-OH, gamma hydroxybutyrate is a colorless and odorless drug used illicitly for ""recreational"" purposes and for ""date rape."" GBH is a central nervous system depressant. It tends therefore to increase sociability and function as something of a transient antidepressant. Some persons who have sustained adverse effects of GHB have reported being given the drug surreptitiously (e.g., having it slipped into their drink), while others have admitted to intentional use. GHB has been marketed as a liquid or powder and has been sold on the street under numerous names such as ""Grievous Bodily Harm,"" ""Georgia Home Boy,"" ""Liquid Ecstasy,"" ""Liquid X,"" ""Liquid E,"" ""GHB,"" ""GBH,"" ""Soap,"" ""Scoop,"" ""Easy Lay,"" ""Salty Water,"" ""G-Riffick,"" ""Cherry Menth,"" and ""Organic Quaalude."" In February, 2000, federal legislation was passed in U.S. that toughened the penalties for the distribution and possession of drugs used in date rapes. The principal drug covered by the law was GHB. A few drops of GHB added to a drink are enough to make the victim lose consciousness within 15-20 minutes. At the time GHB had been implicated in more than 5,700 recorded cases of overdose and in at least 57 deaths. The combination of GHB with alcohol or other CNS depressants is especially deadly. A teaspoon (5 cc) of GHB mixed with alcohol can render a person unconscious and drastically depress respiration within 20 minutes of ingesting it. The use of GHB can also be physically addictive. In the U.S., GHB has been produced clandestinely in widely varying degrees of purity. ""Liquid"" GHB varies in concentration according to preparation. Improper preparation of GHB can result in a mixture of GHB and sodium hydroxide that can be severely toxic because of the combined effects of the GHB and the direct caustic effects of sodium hydroxide. GHB increases dopamine levels in the brain and has effects through the endogenous opioid system; most GHB is excreted during the first hours after ingestion. The features of acute GHB toxicity include coma, seizures, respiratory depression, and vomiting. Other documented effects of GHB include amnesia and hypotonia (associated with doses of 10 mg/kg body weight); a normal sequence of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep (doses of 20-30 mg/kg body weight); and anesthesia (doses of approximately 50 mg/kg body weight). Doses of >50 mg/kg body weight can decrease cardiac output and produce severe respiratory depression, seizure-like activity, and coma. There is no antidote for GHB overdose, and treatment is restricted to nonspecific supportive care. Patients have required urgent emergency care; many of those hospitalized have required ventilatory support and intensive care. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of the U.S. Department of Justice has issued the following statement: ""Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), known as liquid x, Georgia home boy, Goop, gamma-oh, and grievous bodily harm, is a central nervous system depressant abused for its ability to produce euphoric and hallucinatory states and its alleged ability to release a growth hormone and stimulate muscle growth. Although GHB was originally considered a safe and ""natural"" food supplement and was sold in health food stores, the medical community soon became aware that it caused overdoses and other health problems. GHB can produce drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, unconsciousness, seizures, severe respiratory depression, and coma. GHB can be found in liquid form or as a white powdered material. It is taken orally and is frequently combined with alcohol. Abusers include high school and college students and rave party attendees who use GHB for its intoxicating effects. Some body builders also abuse GHB for its alleged anabolic effects. Several cases have documented the use of GHB to incapacitate women for the commission of sexual assault."""
Gangrene,"Gangrene: Tissue death due to loss of adequate blood supply. Sometimes bacteria invade such tissue and accelerate its decay. Dry gangrene is the death of tissue due to vascular insufficiency without bacterial invasion in which the tissue dies, loses sensation and simply dries up, blackens, and shrivels. Dry gangrene eventually requires amputation. Gas gangrene occurs when body tissue is invaded by bacteria that thrive in areas of low oxygen content. These bacteria are called anaerobic bacteria and include the Clostridium family of bacteria. The bacteria generate gas and pus; the tissues swells and can become painful. Wet gangrene requires urgent antibiotic treatment and sometimes surgical drainage."
Garlic,"Garlic: A perennial herb of the lily family cultivated for its pungent, edible bulbs. Garlic has been used with the intention of lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. Preliminary studies suggest that garlic consumption may reduce the risk of developing several types of cancer, especially cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Side effects include breath and body odor, heartburn, upset stomach, and allergic reactions. These effects are more common with raw garlic. Garlic can decrease normal blood clotting in a manner similar to aspirin. Caution should be used if surgery or dental work is planned and in patients taking medications to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulants) such as warfarin /Coumadin. Garlic has been found to interfere with the effectiveness of saquinavir, a drug used to treat HIV infection. Effects on other drugs has not been well studied."
Gas chromatography (GC),"Gas chromatography (GC): A type of automated chromatography (a technique used to separate mixtures of substances) in which the mixture to be analyzed is vaporized and carried by an inert gas through a special column and thence to a detection device. The special column can contain an inert porous solid (in gas-solid chromatography) or a liquid coated on a solid support (in gas-liquid chromatography). The basic aim with GC is to separate each component that was in the mixture so that it produces a different peak in the detection device output which is graphed on a chart recorder. GC is a valuable tool in biochemistry (and other fields of chemistry, as in the analysis of perfumes)."
Gas exchange,Gas exchange: The primary function of the lungs involving the transfer of oxygen from inhaled air into the blood and the transfer of carbon dioxide from the blood into the exhaled air.
Gastric,Gastric: Having to do with the stomach.
Gastric ulcer,"Gastric ulcer: A hole in the lining of the stomach corroded by the acidic digestive juices which are secreted by the stomach cells. Ulcer formation is related to H. pyloridus bacteria in the stomach, anti-inflammatory medications, and smoking cigarettes. Ulcer pain may not correlate with the presence or severity of ulceration. Diagnosis is made with barium x-ray or with the use of a viewing tube slipped through the throat to the stomach (endoscopy)."
Gastritis,Gastritis: Inflammation of the stomach.
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis: Inflammation of the stomach and the intestines. Gastroenteritis can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Gastroenteritis has numerous causes, including infections (viruses, bacteria, and parasites), food poisoning, and stress."
Gastroenterology,"Gastroenterology: The medical specialty devoted to the study, diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the digestive system. These disorders may affect the esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Gastroenterology is popularly (and incorrectly) known as ""GI"" (which stands for gastrointestinal)."
Gastroesophageal,"Gastroesophageal: Pertaining to both the stomach and the esophagus, as in the gastroesophageal junction, the place where the esophagus connects to the stomach."
Gastroesophageal reflux,"Gastroesophageal reflux: The return of stomach contents back up into the esophagus This frequently causes heartburn because of irritation of the esophagus by stomach acid. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to scarring and stricture of the esophagus, requiring stretching (dilating) of the esophagus. 10% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease develop Barrett's esophagus which increases the risk of cancer of the esophagus. 80% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease also have a hiatal hernia."
Gastrointestinal,"Gastrointestinal: Adjective referring collectively to the stomach and small and large intestines. The commonly used abbreviation for gastrointestinal is GI. (Outside of medicine, GI can also stand for galvanized iron, general issue or government issue - as in GI Joe)."
Gastrointestinal tract,Gastrointestinal tract: The stomach and intestines. Abbreviated GI tract.
Gastrostomy,"Gastrostomy: A surgical opening into the stomach. A gastrostomy may be used for feeding, usually via a feeding tube called a gastrostomy tube. Feeding can also be done through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube."
GBV-C,"GBV-C: GB virus C, a virus first identified in 1995 that is genetically related to the hepatitis C virus but which does not cause hepatitis in humans. The exact role of GBV C in producing disease in humans remains unclear. Infection with GB virus C (GBV-C) may be beneficial to HIV-infected patients. There are studies suggesting that these patients enjoy longer survival if they are coinfected with this virus and HIV than if they have HIV alone. GB virus C (GBV-C) is also called hepatitis G. However, the designation GB virus C (GBV-C) is preferred because the virus is not a cause of hepatitis."
GD,GD: Gaucher's disease.
Gelineau syndrome,"Gelineau syndrome: A neurological disorder marked by a sudden recurrent uncontrollable compulsion to sleep. Named for a French neurologist, JBE Gelineau (1859-1906). Also known as narcolepsy. The disorder is often associated with cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone and paralysis of voluntary muscles associated with a strong emotion), sleep paralysis (immobility of the body that occurs in the transition from sleep to wakefulness), what are called hypnagogic hallucinations (pre-sleep dreams) and automatic behaviors (such as doing something ""automatically"" and not remembering afterwards how one did it). It is estimated 200,000 Americans have narcolepsy. It strikes males and females and all races. Symptoms most commonly appear in a person's teens and early twenties. The disease can vary in severity. Some persons with it have mild sleepiness or rare cataplexy (less than one episode per week). Other persons may have moderate sleepiness or infrequent cataplexy (less than one episode a day). Still other persons with narcolepsy may experience severe sleepiness or have severe cataplexy (with one or more episodes of cataplexy per day). The cause(s) of narcolepsy are unknown. It is not a fatal disorder in itself but it can lead to fatalities. For example, a narcoleptic may fall asleep while driving. Narcolepsy is usually treated with a medication to improve alertness and an anti-depressant that helps control cataplexy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 approved Provigil (modafinil), a non-amphetamine drug for treating the excessive sleepiness of narcolepsy. Other names for this disorder include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypnolepsy, sleeping disease, and paroxysmal sleep."
Gene,"Gene: The basic biological unit of heredity. A segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) needed to contribute to a function. An official definition: According to the official Guidelines for Human Gene Nomenclature, a gene is defined as ""a DNA segment that contributes to phenotype/function. In the absence of demonstrated function a gene may be characterized by sequence, transcription or homology."" DNA: Genes are composed of DNA, a molecule in the memorable shape of a double helix, a spiral ladder. Each rung of the spiral ladder consists of two paired chemicals called bases. There are four types of bases. They are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). As indicated, each base is symbolized by the first letter of its name: A, T, C, and G. Certain bases always pair together (AT and GC). Different sequences of base pairs form coded messages. The gene: A gene is a sequence (a string) of bases. It is made up of combinations of A, T, C, and G. These unique combinations determine the gene's function, much as letters join together to form words. Each person has thousands of genes -- billions of base pairs of DNA or bits of information repeated in the nuclei of human cells --which determine individual characteristics (genetic traits). The chromosome: Genes are arranged in precise arrays all along the length of 23 pairs of much larger structures: the chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the mother and the other one from the father. The chromosomes in any particular pair look like each other, except in a boy. There is one pair of chromosomes, which usually settles the sex of the individual. This pair has two X chromosomes in females and one X and one Y chromosome in males. The X and Y chromosomes: These chromosomes -- the X and Y are always capitalized -- are the sex chromosomes. All the other chromosomes in the human chromosome complement are numbered from 1 to 22 and are called the autosomes (literally, the other chromosomes). History of the gene: 1869-1970:"
General anesthesia,"General anesthesia: a combination of medications administered by a physician anesthesiologist that put patients in a sleep-like state before surgery. While under general anesthesia, a patient is unconscious and feels no pain. General anesthesia is usually given through a mask or intravenously (IV) by a needle placed in a vein, and an anesthesiologist monitors heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vital signs."
Generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder: Abbreviated GAD. A condition characterized by 6 months or more of chronic, exaggerated worry and tension that is unfounded or much more severe than the normal anxiety most people experience. People with GAD usually expect the worst. They worry excessively about money, health, family, or work, even when there are no signs of trouble. They are unable to relax and often suffer from insomnia. Sometimes the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. Many people with GAD also have physical symptoms, such as fatigue, trembling, muscle tension, headaches, irritability or hot flashes. People with GAD may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They also may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Nearly 3% of the adult US population age 18 to 54 has GAD during the course of a given year. GAD most often strikes in childhood or adolescence, but can also begin in adulthood. It affects women more often than men, may run in families, and may also grow worse with stress. GAD often coexists with depression, substance abuse, and other anxiety disorders. Irritable bowel syndrome, often accompanies GAD. Treatment for GAD includes medications and cognitive-behavioral therapy."
Generic,"Generic: 1. The chemical name of a drug. 2. A term referring to the chemical makeup of a drug rather than to the advertised brand name under which the drug may be sold. 3.A term referring to any drug marketed under its chemical name without advertising. Generic drugs marketed without brand names are generally less expensive than brand-name drugs, even though they are chemically identical to brand-name drugs and meet the same standards of the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) for safety, purity and effectiveness. Generic drugs can be legally produced in the US if a patent has expired, or for drugs which have never been patented. The expiration of a patent removes the monopoly of the patent holder on drug sales licensing."
Generic drug,"Generic drug: The term ""generic"" has several meanings as regards drugs: ""Diazepam"" is an example of the chemical (generic) name of a sedative. It is marketed by some companies under its generic name and by other companies under brand names such as Valium or Vazepam. Generic drugs marketed without brand names are generally less expensive than brand-name drugs, even though they are chemically identical to brand-name drugs and meet the same standards of the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) for safety, purity and effectiveness. Generic drugs can be legally produced in the US if a patent has expired, or for drugs which have never been patented. The expiration of a patent removes the monopoly of the patent holder on drug sales licensing."
"Generic name, drug","Generic name, drug: The term ""generic name"" has several meanings as regards drugs: ""Diazepam"" is an example of the chemical (generic) name of a sedative. It is marketed by some companies under its generic name and by other companies under brand names such as Valium or Vazepam. Generic drugs marketed without brand names are less expensive than brand-name drugs even though they are chemically identical to brand-name drugs and meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for safety, purity and effectiveness."
genesis,"genesis: A suffix referring to the beginning, development, or production of something. For example, gametogenesis is the development and production of the male and female germ cells (the gametes) required to form a new individual. Osteogenesis is the production of bone. Pathogenesis is the development of a disease, the sequence of events leading up to that disease. The Latin word ""genesis"" is derived from the Greek ""gignesthai"" meaning ""to be born."""
Genetic,"Genetic: Having to do with genes and genetic
information."
Genetic disease,"Genetic disease: A disease caused by an abnormality in an individual's genome. There are a number of different types of genetic inheritance: The sequence of the human genome provides the first holistic view of our genetic heritage. While not yet complete, continued refinement of the data bring us ever closer to a complete human genome reference sequence. The 46 human chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes) between them house almost 3 billion base pairs of DNA that contains about 30 to 40,000 protein-coding genes. The coding regions make up less than 5% of the genome (the function of the remaining DNA is not clear) and some chromosomes have a higher density of genes than others. Most genetic diseases are the direct result of a mutation in one gene. However, one of the most difficult problems ahead is to find out how genes contribute to diseases that have a complex pattern of inheritance, such as in the cases of diabetes, asthma, cancer and mental illness. In all these cases, no one gene has the yes/no power to say whether a person has a disease or not. It is likely that more than one mutation is required before the disease is manifest, and a number of genes may each make a subtle contribution to a person's susceptibility to a disease; genes may also affect how a person reacts to environmental factors."
Genetics,"Genetics: The scientific study of heredity. Genetics pertains to humans and all other organisms. So, for example, there is human genetics, mouse genetics, fruit fly genetics, etc. Human genetics today comprises a number of overlapping fields, including:"
Genital,Genital: Pertaining to the external and/or internal organs of reproduction.
Genitalia,"Genitalia: The male or female reproductive organs. The genitalia include internal and external structures. The female internal genitalia are the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. The female external genitalia are the labia minora and majora (the vulva) and the clitoris. The male internal genitalia are the testes, epididymis, and vas deferens. The male external genitalia are the penis and scrotum."
Genitourinary (GU),Genitourinary (GU): Pertaining to the genital and urinary systems.
Genotype,"Genotype: The genetic constitution (genome) of a cell, an individual, or an organism. The genotype is distinct from the expressed features, or phenotype, of the cell, individual, or organism. The genotype of a person is that person's genetic makeup. It can pertain to all genes or to a specific gene."
Genu,"Genu: The Latin word for the knee. When the knee is referred to in medicine, it is just called the knee. However, the word ""genu"" is also used in medicine as in: genu recurvatum (hyperextension of the knee), genu valgum (knock knee) and genu varum (bowleg). The knee (or genu, if you are into Latin) is a joint which has three parts. The thigh bone (femur) meets the large shin bone (tibia) forming the main knee joint. This joint has an inner (medial) and an outer (lateral) compartment. The kneecap (patella) joins the femur to form a third joint, called the patellofemoral joint. The knee joint is surrounded by a joint capsule with ligaments strapping the inside and outside of the joint (collateral ligaments) as well as crossing within the joint (cruciate ligaments). These ligaments provide stability and strength to the knee joint. The large muscles of the thigh move the knee. In the front of the thigh the quadriceps muscles extend the knee joint. In the back of the thigh, the hamstring muscles flex the knee. The knee also rotates slightly under guidance of specific muscles of the thigh. The knee functions to allow movement of the leg and is critical to normal walking. The knee flexes normally to a maximum of 135 degrees and extends to 0 degrees. The bursae, or fluid-filled sacs, serve as gliding surfaces for the tendons to reduce the force of friction as these tendons move. The knee is a weightbearing joint. Each meniscus serves to evenly load the surface during weight- bearing and also adds in disbursing joint fluid for joint lubrication."
Gephyrophobia,"Gephyrophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of crossing bridges. Sufferers of this phobia experience undue anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may result partly from the fear of enclosure (claustrophobia) or the fear of heights (acrophobia). Phobic drivers may worry about being in an accident in busy traffic or losing control of their vehicles. High bridges over waterways and gorges can be especially intimidating, as can be very long or very narrow bridges. Fear of bridges is a relatively common phobia although most people with it do not know they have something called ""gephyrophobia."" However, the derivation of the word ""gephyrophobia"" is perfectly straightforward (if you know Greek); it is derived from the Greek words ""gephyra"" (bridge) and ""phobos"" (fear)."
Gerascophobia,"Gerascophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of growing old. Sufferers of this fear experience undue anxiety about aging even though they may be in good health--physically, economically and otherwise. They may worry about the loss of their looks, the loss of independence, inactivity after retirement, impaired mobility, the onset of disease, and confinement in a nursing home. Modern society's preoccupation with youthful beauty does nothing to alleviate their fears. The desire to remain young had an interesting consequence after the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le?n traveled to America with Columbus on the latter's second voyage to the New World. Native Americans told Ponce de Le?n tales of a ""fountain of youth"" on an island called Bimini north of Cuba. In 1513, Ponce de Le?n set out to find the fabled island--and discovered Florida. ""Gerascophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""geras"" (old age) and ""phobos"" (fear). Other English words derived from ""geras"" include ""geriatrics"" (the branch of medicine focusing on the elderly) and ""gerontology"" (the study of aging)."
GERD,GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Geriatric medicine,"Geriatric medicine: The branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in older people and the problems specific to aging. Also called geriatrics. From the Greek ""geron"" meaning ""old man"" + ""iatreia"" meaning ""the treatment of disease.""."
Geriatrics,"Geriatrics: The branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in older people and the problems specific to aging. From the Greek ""geron"" meaning ""old man"" + ""iatreia"" meaning ""the treatment of disease.""."
Germ,"Germ: 1. A cell or group of cells (called a primordium) capable of developing into an organ, a part or an organism in its entirety. Eggs and sperm are germ cells.

2. A pathogenic a microorganism. A microbe capable of causing disease. The germ theory of disease held, correctly, that these minute bodies can cause disease.

3. The figurative source or wellspring. Dr. Watson told Holmes he had the germ of an idea. Germ is a deceptively simple word that came to us from Latin germen, meaning a sprout, bud, or offshoot. In all of its meanings, the term germ retains the idea of developing into something more mature."
Germline mutation,"Germline mutation: A heritable change in the DNA that occurred in a germ cell (a cell destined to become an egg or in the sperm) or the zygote (the conceptus) at the single-cell stage. When transmitted to a child, a germline mutation is incorporated in every cell of their body. Germline mutations play a key role in genetic diseases. They play a role, too, in certain types of cancer as, for example, the eye tumor retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor, a childhood malignancy of the kidney. A germline mutation is in contrast to a somatic mutation which is acquired in a single body cell."
Gerontology,"Gerontology: the study of aging, including its social, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects. Gerontology is broader than geriatrics, which is the medical specialty devoted to treatment and care of older people (seniors health). The term is derived from the Greek geron, ""old man"" and -logia, ""study of."""
Gesell Developmental Schedules,"Gesell Developmental Schedules: A measure of child development devised by the American child psychologist and pediatrician Arnold Gesell (1880-1961) who founded the Clinic of Child Development at Yale in 1911 and directed it for many years. There he pioneered the use of motion-picture cameras to study the development of normal infants and young children. He filmed the children, analyzed their functioning frame-by-frame, and learned the normal stages in early human behavioral development. The Gesell Developmental Schedules are a gauge of the status of a child's motor and language development and personal-social and adaptive behaviors. Since the brilliant studies by Gesell, a number of other behavioral assessments have been established for children. These include: The purposes of developmental assessment depend on the age of the child. For a newborn, testing may detect neurologic problems, such as cerebral palsy. For an infant, testing often serves to reassure parents or to identify the nature of problems early enough hopefully to treat them. Later in childhood, testing can help delineate academic and social problems, again, hopefully in time to remedy them."
Gestation period,"Gestation period: Fetal development period from the time of conception until birth. For humans, the full gestation period is normally 9 months. The word ""gestation"" comes from the Latin ""gestare"" meaning ""to carry or to bear."""
Gesundheit,"Gesundheit: Interjection used to wish ""good health,"" especially to someone who has sneezed. In this situation, Gesundheit is roughly equivalent to ""God bless you."" In German ""Gesundheit"" means ""health"" (and ""sanity""). Wishing ""good health"" was once thought to hold off the illness that might follow a sneeze. ""God bless you"" came into comparable usage to prevent the escape of the soul from the body, which was thought to occur with a sneeze. (Soullessness was believed to cause ill health.)"
GI,"GI: 1. In medicine, commonly used abbreviation for gastrointestinal, referring collectively to the stomach and the small and large intestine.
2. Outside of medicine, GI may stand for galvanized iron, general issue or government issue (as in GI Joe)."
Giant hypertrophic gastritis,"Giant hypertrophic gastritis: A premalignant disorder of the stomach characterized by overgrowth of the stomach lining (the gastric mucosa) and hypoalbuminemia (low blood serum level of albumin) due to loss of albumin by the stomach. The abnormalities of the stomach are highly characteristic with giant folds, excess mucus secretion by the lining of the stomach, and hypochlorhydria (decreased acid secretion by the stomach). The disease tends to lead to stomach cancer. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, swelling, poor appetite, and weight loss. The cause of the disease is not known, although infections with cytomegalovirus and Helicobacter pylori have been suspected to play a role. In some families, siblings have had the disease, due possibly to autosomal recessive inheritance. The overgrowth of the stomach lining (gastric hypertrophy) appears to be due to activation of the receptor for epidermal growth factor in the stomach. Treatment of severe disease can involve partial or complete removal of the stomach. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor has been reported to result in marked reduction in the frequency of nausea and vomiting, an increase in the serum albumin concentration, and improvement in the abnormalities of the stomach. The disease is also known by a confusing number of other names including giant hypertrophy of gastric mucosa, hypertropic gastritis, hypertrophic hypoproteinemic gastropathy, hypoproteinemic hypertrophic gastropathy, Menetrier disease, Menetrier disease, Menetrier's disease, and Menetrier's disease (after the French physician Pierre E, Menetrier (1859-1935) who first described it in 1888)."
Giant platelet syndrome,"Giant platelet syndrome (Bernard-Soulier syndrome): This condition is a primary problem of platelets in which the platelets lack the ability to stick adequately to injured blood vessel walls and as a result of this problem there is abnormal bleeding. The giant platelet syndrome usually presents in the newborn period, infancy, or early childhood with bruises, nose bleeds (epistaxis), and/or gum (gingival) bleeding. Later problems can occur with anything which can induce bleeding such as menstruation, trauma, surgery, or stomach ulcers. This is an inherited disease transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both parents must carry a gene for the giant platelet syndrome and transmit that gene to the child for the child to have the disease. The molecular basis is known and is due to a deficiency in platelet glycoproteins Ib, V, and IX. The parents have a decrease in the glycoprotein but no impairment of platelet function and no abnormal bleeding. The gene responsible for the syndrome has been mapped to the short (p) arm of chromosome 17. There is no specific treatment for the giant platelet syndrome. Bleeding episodes may require platelet transfusions. The abnormal platelets in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome are usually considerably larger than normal platelets when viewed on blood films or sized by automated instruments. However, this is not the only syndrome with large platelets. Specific platelet function tests as well as tests for the glycoproteins can confirm the diagnosis. This disease was first recognized in 1948 by two French hematologists, Jean Bernard and Jean-Pierre Soulier, and so is also known as the Bernard-Soulier syndrome."
Giardia lamblia,"Giardia lamblia: A parasite responsible for a contagious form of diarrhea. The parasite is most commonly transmitted through direct contact with infected feces or by eating food or drinking water contaminated by feces. Giardia is one of the most common intestinal parasites in the world. The disease is most prevalent in developing countries, where infections are associated with poor sanitary conditions, poor water quality control, and overcrowding. Giardia is also a major cause of waterborne outbreaks of diarrhea in the US, primarily in mountainous areas where water supplies may be contaminated with feces from humans or animals such as beavers. Campers and backpackers should therefore avoid drinking untreated water from mountain streams. Giardiasis affects three times as many children as adults. It particularly affects diapered children and toddlers being toilet-trained. Families with young children who attend day-care centers are at greater risk of developing giardiasis than is the general population. The parasite lives in two stages: trophozoites and cysts. Trophozoites are the active form of the parasite inside the body. Cysts represent the resting stage that enables the parasite to survive outside the body. Infection begins from swallowing the Giardia cysts. The acid in the stomach activates the cysts, which in turn release the trophozoites. The parasites attach to the lining of the small intestine, reproduce, and are swept down the intestine in the fecal stream. Cysts form in the lower intestines and are then passed in the feces. The symptoms of giardiasis include: a sudden explosive, watery, foul-smelling diarrhea; excessive gas; abdominal pain; bloating; nausea; tiredness; and loss of appetite. In some patients, vomiting is the major symptom. Fever is unusual. If not treated, giardiasis can last for months, or even years. The illness can cause recurrent mild or moderate symptoms such as: impaired digestion, especially lactose intolerance; intermittent diarrhea; tiredness and weakness; and significant weight loss. For diagnosis, stool specimens are collected and examined over a period of at least 3 days. The diagnosis is made by microscopic identification of the parasite in stool. Tests that detect antigens (proteins) to Giardia in the feces are especially useful for screening children in day-care settings, and for testing adults after treatment. Treatment may be with metronidazole (Flagyl). Pregnant women are advised not to take metronidazole during the first trimester of pregnancy. Paromomycin is an alternative and safer drug. If relapses occur, re-treatment with the same drug is usually effective. Furazolidone (Furoxone) may be given to infants and to children under 5 years old, since it comes in a liquid form."
Giardiasis,Giardiasis: Infection with Giardia lamblia.
Gingivitis,"Gingivitis: Gum disease with inflammation of the gums. On inspection, the gums will appear red and puffy, and will usually bleed during tooth-brushing or dental examination. Treatment is by improved cleaning, with more-frequent and longer brushing and flossing, and/or the use of electronic tooth-cleaning equipment. Antiseptic mouthwashes may also be recommended. See also acute membranous gingivitis, gum disease."
Ginseng,"Ginseng: Ginseng has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Today, ginseng"" refers to both American (Panax quinquefolius) and Asian or Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng). These plants have a similar chemical makeup and contain steroid-like components, ginsenosides, which are believed to be the active ingredients. On the other hand, Siberian ginseng or Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus), on the other hand, is a completely unrelated plant and without the active ginsenosides. Panax ginseng may improve cognitive performance, aid in diabetes management, and improve erectile dysfunction. Studies have found Panax ginseng ineffective for hot flashes, improving mood and athletic performance. More research is needed concerning depression, chronic fatigue, cancer, colds and flu, bronchitis, fever, digestive problems, fibromyalgia and anemia. Ginseng can cause elevation in blood pressure, headache, vomiting, insomnia, and nose bleeding. Ginseng can also cause falsely abnormal blood tests for digoxin level in persons taking the drug for heart disease. It is unclear whether ginseng may affect female hormones. Its use in pregnancy is not recommended. Ginseng may affect the action of the normal blood clotting element (platelets). It should be avoided in patients taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin] or naproxen [Aleve]), or medications to prevent blood clotting (anticoagulants) such as warfarin (Coumadin). Ginseng may also cause headaches, tremors, nervousness, and sleeplessness. It should be avoided in persons with manic disorder and psychosis."
Glabella,"Glabella: 1. The area between the eyebrows, just above the nose. 2. The corresponding area on the frontal bone between the eyebrow ridges. From the Latin glabellus, hairless, from glaber, bald."
Gland,"Gland: A group of cells that secrete a substance for use in the body. For example, the thyroid gland."
Glaucoma,"Glaucoma: A common eye condition in which the fluid pressure inside the eye rises to a level higher than healthy for that eye. If untreated, it may damage the optic nerve, causing the loss of vision or even blindness. The elderly, African-Americans, and people with family histories of the disease are at greatest risk. There are no symptoms in the early stage of glaucoma. Glaucoma is often called ""the sneak thief of sight."" Often, by the time the patient notices vision loss, glaucoma can only be halted, not reversed. There are several different types of glaucoma, including open-angle glaucoma and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the common adult-onset type of glaucoma. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a less common form of glaucoma that can rapidly impair vision. The treatment of glaucoma may include medication, surgery, or laser surgery. Eyedrops or pills alone can usually control glaucoma, although they cannot cure it. Some drugs are designed to reduce pressure by slowing the flow of fluid into the eye, while others help to improve fluid drainage. Surgery to help fluid escape from the eye, and laser surgery is now often used for the same purpose. In laser surgery for glaucoma, a laser beam of light is focused on the part of the anterior chamber where the fluid leaves the eye. This results in a series of small changes, making it easier for fluid to exit. Over time, the effect of laser surgery may wear off. See also: Acute angle-closure glaucoma, Glaucoma detection, Normal tension glaucoma, Open-angle glaucoma."
Gliadin,"Gliadin: A glycoprotein (a carbohydrate plus a protein) within gluten. Gliadin is found in wheat and some other grains, including oats, rye, barley, and millet. People with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and other conditions may be sensitive to gliadin in the diet. In these conditions, antibodies to gliadin can often be detected in the blood. See also: Gluten enteropathy."
Glial cell,"Glial cell: A supportive cell in the central nervous system. Unlike neurons, glial cells do not conduct electrical impulses. The glial cells surround neurons and provide support for and insulation between them. Glial cells are the most abundant cell types in the central nervous system. Types of glial cells include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, Schwann cells, microglia, and satellite cells."
Gliosis,"Gliosis: A process leading to scars in the central nervous system that involves the production of a dense fibrous network of neuroglia (supporting cells) in areas of damage. Gliosis is a prominent feature of many diseases of the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis and stroke. After a stroke, neurons die and disappear with replacement gliosis."
Glisson's capsule,"Glisson's capsule: The capsule of the liver. A layer of connective tissue surrounding the liver and ensheathing the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile ducts within the liver. Named for the British physician, anatomist, physiologist, and pathologist Francis Glisson (1597-1677)."
Globus,"Globus: A word straight from the Latin, meaning (not unexpectedly) a globe or sphere. The word ""globus"" is used in a number of different contexts in medicine. Globus hystericus, sometimes just called globus, is the sensation of having a lump in the throat. This is a symptom of hysterical neurosis (conversion hysteria) as well as of diseases such as reflux laryngitis. The globus major is the head of the epididymis, the structure just behind the testis. The globus minor is the lower end of the epididymis. The globus pallidus is a pale-appearing spherical area in the brain."
Globus hystericus,"Globus hystericus: The sensation of having a lump in the throat when there is nothing there. Sometimes simply called globus. Globus hystericus is a symptom of some physical disorders such as reflux laryngitis as well as a classic sign of hysterical neurosis, a psychosomatic disorder characterized by a change or loss of physical function (such as blurred vision or paralysis of the legs) that suggests a physical disorder but instead is an expression of a psychological conflict or need. Globus is a Latin word meaning, not surprisingly, a globe or sphere. The adjective is globoid or spheroid."
Glomerulus,"Glomerulus: 1.In the kidney, a tiny ball-shaped structure composed of capillary blood vessels actively involved in the filtration of the blood to form urine. The glomerulus is one of the key structures that make up the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney.
2. In the olfactory bulb, an anatomically discrete module receiving input from an olfactory sensory neuron. The glomerulus in the kidney was so named by the Italian anatomist Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694). The structure was once called a malphigian corpuscle. ""Glomerulus"" is the diminutive of the Latin ""glomus"" meaning ""ball of yarn."" It is literally a ""little ball of yarn."" Plural: glomeruli."
Glossal,"Glossal: Of or pertaining to the tongue. Glossal is used as both an adjective and a compound word, as in hypoglossal nerve and thyroglossal cyst. From the Greek glossa meaning tongue."
Glossitis,"Glossitis: Inflammation of the tongue. There are many possible causes of glossitis, including vitamin B12 deficiency, Sjogren's syndrome, and side effects of medications or chemotherapy."
Glu,Glu: Glutamic acid. See also: Amino acid symbols.
Glucocorticoid,"Glucocorticoid: A hormone that predominantly affects the metabolism of carbohydrates and, to a lesser extent, fats and proteins (and has other effects). Glucocorticoids are made in the outside portion (the cortex) of the adrenal gland and chemically classed as steroids. Cortisol is the major natural glucocorticoid. The term glucocorticoid also applies to equivalent hormones synthesized in the laboratory."
Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens,"Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens is a bacterium that infects plants. The bacterium can cause spoilage of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and spirits. No cases of animal infection have been reported, and only one case of human infection has been described. This was reported in 2020 in a patient with immunodeficiency and liver cirrhosis. The patient eventually recovered from the infection."
Glucosamine,"Glucosamine: A molecule derived from the sugar glucose by the addition of an amino group. Glucosamine is a component of a number of structures, including the blood group substances and cartilage. Glucosamine is currently in use as a nutritional supplement (often in combination with chondroitin) and is touted as a remedy for arthritic symptoms."
Glucose,"Glucose: The simple sugar that is the chief source of energy. Glucose is found in the blood and is the main sugar that the body manufactures. The body makes glucose from all three elements of food'protein, fats, and carbohydrates'but the largest amount of glucose derives from carbohydrates. Glucose serves as the major source of energy for living cells. However, cells cannot use glucose without the help of insulin. Also known as dextrose."
Glucose tolerance test,"Glucose tolerance test: A test of carbohydrate metabolism that is used primarily in the diagnosis of type II?diabetes?and?gestational diabetes. Abbreviated GTT. After the patient has fasted overnight, but before breakfast, a specific amount of?glucose?is given by mouth, and the blood levels of this sugar are measured at intervals. The GTT result depends on a number of factors, including the ability of the intestines to absorb glucose, the power of the liver to take up and store glucose, the capacity of the pancreas to produce?insulin, and the amount of 'active' insulin."
Glutamic acid,"Glutamic acid: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. A nonessential amino acid, glutamic acid is present in many animal and plant proteins. It is involved in ammonia metabolism and serves as a neurotransmitter. Glutamic acid was isolated from wheat gluten in 1866 and first synthesized in 1890. Symbol: Glu."
Gluteal,"Gluteal: Pertaining to the buttocks region, which is formed by the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles."
Glycine,"Glycine: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. A nonessential amino acid, glycine is part of many proteins, participates in purine synthesis, and is a neurotransmitter. Symbol: Gly."
Glycohemoglobin,"Glycohemoglobin: Also known as glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin to which glucose is bound, a measure of the long-term control of diabetes mellitus. The level of glycohemoglobin is increased in the red blood cells of persons with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Since the glucose stays attached to hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell (normally about 120 days), the level of glycohemoglobin reflects the average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. The normal level for glycohemoglobin is less than 7%. Diabetics rarely achieve such levels, but tight control aims to come close to it. Levels above 9% show poor control, and levels above 12% show very poor control. It is commonly recommended that glycohemoglobin be measured every 3 to 6 months in diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that diabetics who keep their glycohemoglobin levels close to 7% have a much better chance of delaying or preventing diabetes complications that affect the eyes, kidneys, and nerves than people with levels 8% or higher. A change in treatment is almost always needed if the level is over 8%. Lowering the level of glycohemoglobin by any amount improves a person's chances of staying healthy. Glycohemoglobin is also known as hemoglobin A1C (its main fraction)."
Glycoprotein,"Glycoprotein: A molecule that consists of a carbohydrate plus a protein. Glycoproteins play essential roles in the body. For instance, in the immune system almost all of the key molecules involved in the immune response are glycoproteins. A glycopeptide is similar in structure to a glycoprotein but has a shorter chain of amino acids."
Glycosylated hemoglobin,"Glycosylated hemoglobin: Hemoglobin to which glucose is bound. Glycosylated hemoglobin is tested to monitor the long-term control of diabetes mellitus. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin is increased in the red blood cells of persons with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Since the glucose stays attached to hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell (normally about 120 days), the level of glycosylated hemoglobin reflects the average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. The normal level for glycosylated hemoglobin is less than 7%. Diabetics rarely achieve such levels, but tight control aims to come close to it. Levels above 9% show poor control, and levels above 12% show very poor control. It is commonly recommended that glycosylated hemoglobin be measured every 3 to 6 months in diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that diabetics who keep their glycosylated hemoglobin levels close to 7% have a much better chance of delaying or preventing diabetes complications that affect the eyes, kidneys, and nerves than people with levels 8% or higher. A change in treatment is almost always needed if the level is over 8%. Lowering the level of glycosylated hemoglobin by any amount improves a person's chances of staying healthy. Glycosylated hemoglobin is also known as glycohemoglobin or as hemoglobin A1C (the main fraction of glycosylated hemoglobin)."
gm (gram),"gm (gram): The abbreviation gm stands for gram, a unit of measurement of weight and mass in the metric system. In weight, a gram is equal to a thousandth of a kilogram. In mass, a gram is equal to a thousandth of a liter (one cubic centimeter) of water at 4 degrees centigrade. The word ""gram"" comes from the Late Latin ""gramma"" meaning a small weight via the French ""gramme."" The symbol for gram is g."
Goiter,"Goiter: A noncancerous enlargement of the thyroid gland. With a goiter, the levels of thyroid hormones may be normal (euthyroid), elevated (hyperthyroidism), or decreased (hypothyroidism)."
Goitrogenic foods,"Goitrogenic foods: Goitrogenic are foods that can affect thyroid function by inhibiting synthesis of thyroid hormones, resulting in enlargement of the gland (goiter). Goitrogenic foods include Brussel sprouts, kohlrabi, turnips, rutabaga, radishes, cabbage, kale, and cauliflower."
Gonorrhea,"Gonorrhea: A bacterial infection that is transmitted by sexual contact. Gonorrhea is one of the oldest known sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and it is caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria. Men with gonorrhea may have a yellowish discharge from the penis accompanied by itching and burning. More than half of women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include burning or frequent urination, yellowish vaginal discharge, redness and swelling of the genitals, and a burning or itching of the vaginal area. If untreated, gonorrhea can lead to severe pelvic infections and even sterility. Complications in later life can include inflammation of the heart valves, arthritis, and eye infections. Gonorrhea can also cause eye infections in babies born of infected mothers. Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics."
Good Samaritan,"Good Samaritan: Someone who voluntarily helps someone else who is in distress. The term ""Good Samaritan"" comes from the parable of the Good Samaritan related in the Book of Luke in the New Testament of the Bible. The parable tells of a Samaritan (a resident of Samaria) who stopped to help a man who had been injured and robbed, while others passed him by. A number of hospitals and medical centers bear the name ""Good Samaritan."" See also Good Samaritan law."
Good Samaritan law,Good Samaritan law: A law designed to protect a Good Samaritan from legal liability. Such laws usually specify that whoever in good faith provides emergency (and sometimes non-emergency) medical services shall not be civilly liable unless their acts constitute wanton misconduct. See also Good Samaritan.
Goose bump,"Goose bump: Also known as Cutis anserina, a temporary local change in the?skin when it becomes rougher due to erection of little muscles, as from?cold, fear, or excitement. The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as cold or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of little muscles called the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps."
Gooseflesh,"Gooseflesh: Also known as Cutis anserina, a temporary local change in the?skin when it becomes rougher due to erection of little muscles, as from?cold, fear, or excitement. The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as cold or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of little muscles called the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps."
Gout,"Gout: Condition characterized by abnormally elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, recurring attacks of joint inflammation (arthritis), deposits of hard lumps of uric acid in and around the joints, and decreased kidney function and kidney stones. Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines, that are part of many foods we eat. The tendency to develop gout and elevated blood uric acid level (hyperuricemia) is often inherited and can be promoted by obesity, weight gain, alcohol intake, high blood pressure, abnormal kidney function, and drugs. The most reliable diagnostic test for gout is the identification of crystals in joints, body fluids and tissues. Although this is rare, young children can develop gout within any joints (juvenile gout). In most cases, as with adults, signs and symptoms of gout occur in the feet. Genetic conditions that cause an overproduction of uric acid including Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and PRPP synthetase overactivity may cause juvenile gout. Certain kidney diseases can also lead to gout in children."
Gouty arthritis,"Gouty arthritis: An attack that is usually extremely painful of joint inflammation due to deposits of uric acid crystals in the joint fluid (synovial fluid) and joint lining (synovial lining). Intense joint inflammation occurs as white blood cells engulf the uric acid crystals, causing pain, heat, and redness of the joint tissues. The term ""gout"" commonly is used to refer to these painful arthritis attacks but gouty arthritis is only one manifestation of gout."
Gower syndrome (situational syncope),"Gower syndrome (situational syncope): The temporary loss of consciousness in particular kinds of situations. (Syncope is temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, fainting). The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating or defecating or coughing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional stress of fear or pain. With Gower syndrome, people often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before they lose consciousness. Gower syndrome is caused by a reflex of the involuntary nervous system called the vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction leads the heart to slow down (bradycardia) and, at the same time, it leads the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels to dilate (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is deprived of oxygen and the fainting episode occurs. A vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. Gower syndrome is synonymous with situational syncope, vasovagal syncope, and vasodepressor syncope. Sir William Richard Gower (1845-1915) was a famous English neurologist whose name is also associated with a sign, a solution, another syndrome, and a tract in the central nervous system."
GPO,GPO: A medical group purchasing organization might be able to bring the purchasing power and negotiating leverage of large medical consortiums or hospital systems to doctors' offices.
Graft,"Graft: Healthy skin, bone, kidney, liver, or other tissue that is taken from one part of the body to replace diseased or injured tissue removed from another part of the body. For example, skin grafts can be used to cover areas of skin that have been burned."
Gram (measure),"Gram (measure): A unit of measurement of weight and mass in the metric system. In weight, a gram is equal to a thousandth of a kilogram. In mass, a gram is equal to a thousandth of a liter (one cubic centimeter) of water at 4 degrees centigrade. The word ""gram"" comes from the Late Latin ""gramma"" meaning a small weight via the French ""gramme."" The abbreviation for gram is gm. Its symbol is g."
Calorie,"Calorie: A unit of food energy. The word calorie is ordinarily used instead of the more precise, scientific term kilocalorie. A kilocalorie represents the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a liter of water 1' centigrade at sea level. Technically, a kilocalorie represents 1,000 true calories of energy."
Gram-negative,"Gram-negative: Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet stain (and take the color of the red counterstain) in Gram's method of staining. This is characteristic of bacteria that have a cell wall composed of a thin layer of a particular substance (called peptidoglycan). The Gram-negative bacteria include most of the bacteria normally found in the gastrointestinal tract that can be responsible for disease as well as gonococci (venereal disease) and meningococci (bacterial meningitis). The organisms responsible for cholera and bubonic plague are Gram-negative. The Danish bacteriologist J.M.C. Gram (1853-1938) devised this method of staining bacteria using a dye called crystal (gentian) violet. Gram's method helps distinguish between different types of bacteria. The gram-staining characteristics of bacteria are denoted as positive or negative, depending upon whether the bacteria take up and retain the crystal violet stain or not."
Gram-positive,"Gram-positive: Gram-positive bacteria retain the color of the crystal violet stain in the Gram stain. This is characteristic of bacteria that have a cell wall composed of a thick layer of a particular substance (called peptidologlycan). The Gram-positive bacteria include staphylococci (""staph""), streptococci (""strep""), pneumococci, and the bacterium responsible for diphtheria (Cornynebacterium diphtheriae) and anthrax (Bacillus anthracis). The Danish bacteriologist J.M.C. Gram (1853-1938) devised a method of staining bacteria using a dye called crystal (gentian) violet. Gram's method helps distinguish between different types of bacteria. The gram-staining characteristics of bacteria are denoted as positive or negative, depending upon whether the bacteria take up and retain the crystal violet stain or not."
Grand mal,"Grand mal: A form of epilepsy characterized by tonic-clonic seizures. involving two phases -- the tonic phase in which the body becomes rigid, and clonic phase in which there is uncontrolled jerking. Tonic-clonic seizures may or may not be preceded by an aura, and are often followed by headache, confusion, and sleep. They may last for mere seconds, or continue for several minutes. If a tonic-clonic seizure does not resolve or if such seizures follow each other in rapid succession, seek emergency help. The person could be in a life-threatening state known as status epilepticus. Treatment is with antiseizure medications. Grand mal means big illness in French and is in contrast to another type of epilepsy known as petit mal."
Grand multipara,"Grand multipara: The term ""multipara"" applies to any woman who has given birth 2 or more times. A woman who has given birth 5 or more times is called a grand multipara. For a pregnancy to count as a ""birth"", it must go to at least 20 weeks' gestation (the mid-point of a full-term pregnancy) or yield an infant that weighs at least 500 grams, irrespective of whether the infant is liveborn or not. The term ""multipara"" is composed of two Latin words: ""multi-"" from ""multus"", much + ""-para"" from ""pario"", to bring forth = to bring forth much (in the way of children)."
Grand rounds,Grand rounds: A formal meeting at which physicians discuss the clinical case of one or more patients. Grand rounds originated as part of residency training wherein new information was taught and clinical reasoning skills were enhanced. Grand rounds today are an integral component of medical education. They present clinical problems in medicine by focusing on current or interesting cases. They are also sometimes utilized for dissemination of new research information.
Granular leukocyte,"Granular leukocyte: A type of white blood cell filled with microscopic granules (tiny sacs) containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Granular leukocytes -- they are better known as granulocytes -- are part of the innate immune system and have somewhat non specific, broad-based activity. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do B-cells and T-cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are all types of granulocytes. They are named by the staining features of their granules in the laboratory: This classification dates back to a time when certain structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of these intracellular structures were still not yet fathomed. However, the classification of granulocytes into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils is still widely used (and quite useful)."
Granulation,"Granulation: That part of the healing process in which lumpy, pink tissue containing new connective tissue and capillaries forms around the edges of a wound. Granulation of a wound is normal and desirable."
Granulocytopenia,"Granulocytopenia: A marked decrease in the number of granulocytes. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell filled with microscopic granules that are little sacs containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Granulocytes are part of the innate, somewhat non specific infection-fighting immune system. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do B-cells and T-cells. Granulocytopenia or, as it is also called, agranulocytosis results in a syndrome of frequent chronic bacterial infections of the skin, lungs, throat etc. Although ""agranulocytosis"" literally means no granulocytes, there may, in fact, be some granulocytes but too few of them, i.e. granulocytopenia. Granulocytopenia can be genetic and inherited or it can be acquired as, for example, an aspect of leukemia. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are all types of granulocytes. They are named by the staining features of their granules in the laboratory: This classification dates back to a time when certain structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of these intracellular structures were still not yet fathomed. However, the classification of granulocytes into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils is still widely used (and quite useful). Granulocytopenia can therefore more specifically involve neutropenia (shortage of neutrophils), eosinopenia and/or basopenia. The term ""neutropenia"" is sometimes used interchangeably with granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis."
Granuloma,"Granuloma: A granuloma is one of a number of forms of localized nodular inflammation found in tissues. The fact that a granuloma is localized is important. So is its nodularity. Granulomas have a typical pattern when examined under a microscope. Granulomas can be caused by a variety of biologic, chemical and physical irritants of tissue. A calcified granuloma is a granuloma containing calcium deposits. Since it usually takes some time for calcium to be deposited in a granuloma, it is generally assumed that a calcified granuloma is an old granuloma. For example, a calcified granuloma in the lung may be due to tuberculosis contracted years earlier that is now dormant."
Granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare: The definition of granuloma annulare in one of the standard print medical dictionaries begins: ""a benign, usually self-limited granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, chiefly involving the dermis."" Translation: This condition usually clears up by itself (it is ""usually self-limited); it is not malignant (it is ""benign""); we don't have a clue as to what causes it (it is ""of unknown etiology""); it affects the layer (the ""dermis"") of the skin just below the outside layer (the epidermis). A granuloma is a localized nodular inflammation which has a typical pattern when the involved tissue examined under a microscope. Annulare comes from the Latin word ""anulus"" meaning ring. Granuloma annulare is thus a ring-like granuloma in the skin. Granuloma annulare tends to occur in children, predominantly girls."
Granulomatous colitis,"Granulomatous colitis: Crohn's disease of the colon (the large intestine). Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily involving the small and large intestine, but which can affect other parts of the digestive system as well. It is named for the doctor who first described the disease in 1932. The disease is usually diagnosed in persons in their teens or twenties, but can occur at any point in life. Crohn's disease can be a chronic, recurrent condition or can cause minimal symptoms with or even without medical treatment. In mild forms, Crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. In more serious cases, deeper and larger ulcers can develop, causing scarring and stiffness and possibly narrowing of the bowel, sometimes leading to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs. Crohn's disease has many forms: Involvement of the large intestine (colon) only is called Crohn's colitis or granulomatous colitis, while involvement of the small intestine alone is called Crohn's enteritis. The most common part of the small intestine to be affected by Crohn's disease is the last portion, called the ileum. Active disease in this area is termed Crohn's ileitis. When both the small intestine and the large intestine are involved, the condition is called Crohn's enterocolitis (or ileocolitis). Other descriptive terms may be used as well. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss can be symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Diagnosis is commonly made by x-ray or colonoscopy. Treatment includes medications that are anti-inflammatories, immune suppressors, or antibiotics. Surgery can be necessary in severe cases. Crohn's disease is an area of active research around the world and new treatment approaches are being investigated which have promise to improve the lives of affected patients."
Gray baby syndrome,"Gray baby syndrome: A syndrome due to toxicity of the antibiotic chloramphenicol in the newborn, especially the premature newborn, because of lack the necessary liver enzymes to metabolize this drug. Chloramphenicol accumulates in the baby, causing hypotension (low blood pressure), cyanosis (blue coloring of lips, nail beds, and skin from lack of oxygen in the blood), and often death. Chloramphenicol is therefore usually not given to newborns or premature babies."
Gray's Anatomy,"Gray's Anatomy: A book entitled Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical by Henry Gray appeared in 1858. It is still in print today and be perhaps the best known of all medical books. The English anatomist Henry Gray was born in 1825 or 1827. He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London. He died young in 1861, just 3 years after the publication of his Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical which generations of medical students have renamed ""Gray's Anatomy"". Gray's Anatomy is a scientific and artistic masterpiece. Gray let the natural beauty and grace of the body's interconnected systems and structures shine forth. The illustrations are superb. It is one of the great reference works of all time, used by physicians, students, artists, and anyone interested in human anatomy."
Grief,"Grief: The normal process of reacting to a loss. The loss may be physical (such as a death), social (such as divorce), or occupational (such as a job). Emotional reactions of grief can include anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness, and despair. Physical reactions of grief can include sleeping problems, changes in appetite, physical problems, or illness. See also: Anticipatory grief; Complicated grief; Grief therapy; Unresolved grief."
Groin,Groin: The area where the thigh meets the hip.
Gross hematuria,"Gross hematuria: Blood in the urine that can be seen with the naked eye. Hematuria may or may not be accompanied by pain, but it is always abnormal and should be further investigated."
Growth hormone,"Growth hormone: A hormone made in the pituitary gland that stimulates the release of another hormone called somatomedin by the liver, thereby causing growth. Also known as somatotropin. Growth hormone is produced by the anterior pituitary gland, the front section of the gland, and is a polypeptide that consists of 191 amino acids. Growth hormone is given to children with pituitary dwarfism (short stature due to underfunction of the anterior pituitary) to help them grow. Excessive growth hormone production in children can lead to gigantism, and in adults it can lead to acromegaly. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 approved a new use for Humatrope, a biosynthesized brand of human growth hormone, for the long-term treatment of children with idiopathic (of unknown origin) short stature, also called non-growth hormone deficient short stature. ""Short stature"" has been defined by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Growth Hormone Research Society as height more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for age and sex. This corresponds to the shortest 2.3% of children. This new indication restricts therapy to children who are even shorter, specifically more than 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex, or the shortest 1.2% of children. For example, for 10-year old boys and girls, this would correspond to heights of less than 4' 1"" inch. This would further correspond to heights of less than 5' 3"" and 4' 11"" in adult men and women, respectively. In clinical studies, the drug added several inches to the children's eventual height."
gtt.,"gtt.: Abbreviation meaning drops (from the Latin ""guttae"", drops). One of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have traditionally been used in prescriptions."
Guevedoces,"Guevedoces: individuals reported to apparently change gender naturally at puberty, from female to male. These people have been observed in an isolated village in the Dominican Republic and in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. Infants with female appearance at birth begin to develop physical characteristics of a male during puberty. These individuals have been referred to by different names in their own regions, including guevedoces, translated to mean ""penis at age twelve,"" and machihembras, which means ""first a woman, then a man."" In Papua New Guinea, the locals called these individuals turnims, meaning ""expected to become men."" Affected individuals are born with male (XY) chromosomes. Because of a deficiency of the 5 a-reductase enzyme, testosterone is not converted to the biologically active form, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In the absence of DHT, the infant's external genitalia appear to be an ambiguous clitoris and labia. Studies have shown this condition to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that to be affected, an individual must receive a copy of the genetic defect from each parent."
Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is a disorder characterized by progressive symmetrical paralysis and loss of reflexes, usually beginning in the legs. The paralysis characteristically involves more than one limb (most commonly the legs), is progressive, and is usually proceeds from the end of an extremity toward the torso. Areflexia (loss of reflexes) or hyporeflexia (diminution of reflexes) may occur in the legs and arms. Guillain-Barré syndrome is not associated with fever, an important fact in differentiating Guillain-Barré from other diseases. Guillain-Barré usually occurs after a respiratory infection, and it is apparently caused by a misdirected immune response that results in the direct destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the peripheral nerves or of the axon of the nerve itself. The syndrome sometimes follows other triggering events, including vaccinations. Among the vaccines reportedly associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome are the swine flu vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine, and tetanus toxoid. Aside from vaccinations, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and viral infections can trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome. There is presently no test to prove the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other conditions such as polio that may mimic Guillain-Barré need to be ruled out before the diagnosis is made. Treatment includes plasmapheresis and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG). In most cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, the patient makes a complete or nearly complete recovery. See also: Demyelination; Landry ascending paralysis; Polio."
Gullet,"Gullet: The esophagus. The words esophagus and gullet differ in origin. Esophagus comes from the Greek whereas gullet is a diminutive of the Latin gula meaning throat. The idea was that the esophagus, being narrower than the throat, was the little throat."
Gustatory sweating,"Gustatory sweating: Sweating on the forehead, face, scalp, and neck occurring soon after ingesting food. Some gustatory sweating is normal after eating hot, spicy foods. Otherwise, gustatory sweating is most commonly a result of damage to a nerve that goes to the parotid gland, the large salivary gland in the cheek. In this setting, referred to as Frey syndrome, the sweating is usually on one side of the head. Gustatory sweating is also a rare complication of diabetes mellitus. In this case sweating may occur on both sides of the head, with mild or substantial severity. This distressing problem can be difficult to treat. Treatments used include oxybutynin chloride, propantheline bromide, and clonidine (brand name: Catapres). Recently, some success has been reported using topical applications of glycopyrrolate: the lotion was applied to the skin of the forehead and face, sparing the eyes and mouth. See also Frey syndrome, diabetes."
Guthrie test,"Guthrie test: A simple screening blood test for phenylketonuria (PKU). The Guthrie test was the original impetus to newborn metabolic screening. In 1958-59 Dr. Robert Guthrie (1916-95) was asked if he might to develop a simple method to monitor the blood phenylalanine (phe) level. He developed a test in 3 days. It was a ""bacterial inhibition assay."" A spot of blood on a filter paper disc is placed on the surface of an agar plate containing a substance that inhibits the growth of bacteria. However, the inhibition can be overcome by high phe. After incubating the agar plate overnight, the diameter of the growth zone around the test disc is compared to that of a control disc of blood serum to which a known quantity of phe has been added. This permits one to estimate the amount of phe in the test disc. Bob Guthrie used a common, standardized strain of soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. The inhibitor was -2-thienylalanine, which inhibits the growth of B. subtilis, an effect that was relieved by phe. Guthrie's original agar dish was a Pyrex baking pan. Guthrie went on to develop bacterial inhibition assays for other inherited disorders of metabolism, including maple syrup urine, galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease and homocystinuria. These assays are simple, inexpensive, and suited to screening large numbers of individual specimens. The three main laboratory methods now used in the US are the Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay (BIA), fluorometric analysis, and tandem mass spectrometry. Each of these methods can reliably detect PKU. See phenylketonuria."
Gymnophobia,"Gymnophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of nudity. Sufferers of this phobia experience undue anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. They may worry about seeing others naked or being seen naked, or both. Their fear may stem from anxiety about sexuality in general, from a fear that their bodies are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves their bodies--and their personalities--exposed and unprotected. ""Gymnophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""gymnos"" (naked) and ""phobos"" (fear). The word ""gymnasium"" comes from the Greek ""gymnasion"" (a place for athletic exercises) and the Greek ""gymnasein"" (to train naked)."
Gyne-,"Gyne-: Combining form pertaining to women. From the Greek gyno, gynaikos meaning woman."
Gynecoid pelvis,"Gynecoid pelvis: The gynecoid pelvis is one that is generally characteristic of a woman in its bone structure and therefore its shape. Gynecoid means like a woman, womanly, female. The gynecoid pelvis is more delicate, wider than, and not as high as the male pelvis. The angle of the female pubic arch is wide and round. The female sacrum is wider than the male's and the iliac bone is flatter. The pelvic basin of the female is more spacious and less funnel-shaped. From a purely anatomic viewpoint, the female pelvis is better suited to accommodate the fetus during pregnancy and permit the baby to be born."
Gynecologist,Gynecologist: A physician who specializes in treating diseases of the female reproductive organs and providing well-woman health care that focuses primarily on the reproductive organs.
Gynecomastia,"Gynecomastia: Excessive development of the male breasts. Temporary enlargement of the breasts is not unusual or abnormal in boys during adolescence or during recovery from malnutrition. Gynecomastia may be abnormal as, for example, in Klinefelter's syndrome. "
H and P,"H and P: Medical shorthand for history and physical, the initial clinical evaluation and examination of the patient."
HAART,"HAART: Stands for highly active antiretroviral therapy. Treatment with a very potent drug ""cocktail"" to suppress the growth of HIV, the retrovirus responsible for AIDS."
Habitual abortion,Habitual abortion: The miscarriage of 3 or more consecutive pregnancies. The abortion of 3 or more miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) with no intervening pregnancies is also termed recurrent abortion. Habitual or recurrent abortion is a form of infertility. It is sometimes due to chromosome abnormalities or other genetic causes.
Habitus,"Habitus: The physique or body build. Also the posture. For example, corticosteroid therapy can produce a characteristic cushingoid habitus with a moon face, ""buffalo hump"" at the back of the neck, and obesity of the trunk. From the Latin for ""condition"" from the Latin verb ""habere"" meaning ""to hold."""
Hair follicle,"Hair follicle: A sac from which a hair grows and into which the sebaceous (oil) glands open. The follicle is lined by cells derived from the epidermal (outside) layer of the skin. Each follicle normally goes through a five-year cycle of growth and rest, with about 90% of the follicles growing hair at any one time, averaging about six inches (15 cm) of growth per year. Derived from the Latin word follis, for bag. ""The human hair follicle is a dynamic structure that generates hair through a complex and exquisitely regulated cycle of growth and remodelling governed by numerous genes,"" Siobh?n A. Jordan has noted in Molecular Medicine Today."
Hair loss,"Hair loss: Hair loss is the thinning of hair on the scalp. The medical term for hair loss is alopecia. Alopecia can be temporary or permanent. The most common form of hair loss occurs gradually and is referred to as ""androgenetic alopecia,"" meaning that a combination of hormones (androgens are male hormones) and heredity (genetics) is needed to develop the condition. Other types of hair loss include alopecia areata (patches of baldness that usually grow back), telogen effluvium (rapid shedding after childbirth, fever, or sudden weight loss); and traction alopecia (thinning from tight braids or ponytails). Hair loss normally occurs gradually with age in both men and women, but is typically more pronounced in men."
the dog,"Hair of the dog: An alcoholic chaser reputed to relieve a hangover, usually needed the morning after imbibing too much alcohol. There is no scientific evidence as to the efficacy of this time-honored treatment for a hangover. The saying originated in the belief that a cure for hydrophobia (rabies) or any disease contracted from a dog bite consisted of taking a hair of the dog that bit you and placing it in the wound."
"Hair, lanugal","Hair, lanugal: The downy hair on the body of the fetus and newborn baby. The lanugal hair (or lanugo) is the first hair to be produced by the fetal hair follicles. It is very fine, soft and usually is unpigmented. The lanugal hair is prenatal hair. It appears at about 5 months of gestation and begins to be shed at 7 and 8 months of gestation. The postnatal hair that succeeds the lanugal hair is conventionally divided into vellus and terminal hair. The vellus resembles the lanugal hair in that it is short, soft and usually unpigmented. The terminal hair is longer, coarser and usually pigmented. There are intermediate types of hair. Any given follicle can change the type of hair it is making. ""Lanugo"" is the Latin word for down, like the fine small hairs of plants."
Halitosis,"Halitosis: An unpleasant odor from the mouth, commonly referred to as bad breath. Halitosis can be caused by the consumption of certain foods, poor oral hygiene, alcohol or tobacco use, dry mouth, or by certain chronic medical conditions."
Hallucination,"Hallucination: A profound distortion in a person's perception of reality, typically accompanied by a powerful sense of reality. An hallucination may be a sensory experience in which a person can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel something that is not there. The types of hallucinations include:"
Hallux,Hallux: The big toe.
Hamartoma,Hamartoma: A benign (noncancerous) tumor-like growth consisting of a disorganized mixture of cells and tissues normally found in the area of the body where the growth occurs.
Hand-arm vibration syndrome,"Hand-arm vibration syndrome: A disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to vibration, specifically to the hands and forearms while using vibrating tools. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and loss of nerve sensitivity. The hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) is a painful and potentially disabling condition of the fingers, hands, and arms due to vibration. There is initially a tingling sensation with numbness in the fingers. The fingers then become white and swollen when cold and then red and painful when warmed up again. Cold or wet weather may aggravate the condition. Picking up objects such as pins or nails becomes difficult as the feeling in the fingers diminishes and there is loss of strength and grip in the hands. The pain, tingling, and numbness in the arms, wrists and hands may interfere with sleep. Sources of vibration that can cause HAVS are very varied and include pneumatic drills, jackhammers, asphalt breakers, power chain saws, chipping tools, concrete vibrators and levelers, needle guns and scabblers, polishers, power jigsaws, sanders and angle grinders, riveters, compactors, power lawnmowers and even electronic games in which the hand controls vibrate. HAVS was first widely recognized as a potential occupational hazard in the mid-1980s. It was first known as ""vibration white finger."""
Hangover,"Hangover: A common nonmedical term for the disagreeable physical effects following excessive consumption of alcohol (or the use of other psychoactive drugs). Veisalgia is the little-used medical name for the condition. Symptoms may include headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and concentration difficulties. Hangovers been known since Biblical times (or before): ""Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink"" (Isaiah 5:11)."
HAPE,"HAPE: Acronym for High Altitude pulmonary edema, the accumulation in the lungs of extravascular fluid (fluid outside of blood vessels) at high altitude, a consequence of rapid altitude ascent, especially when that ascent is accompanied by significant exercise. HAPE leads to dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, tachycardia (fast heart rate) and decreased arterial oxygen levels. HAPE varies in degree from very mild to potentially fatal. Some people may be genetically susceptible to HAPE. People who develop HAPE have smaller lungs, higher pulmonary artery pressures, and higher pulmonary artery wedge pressures during exercise at sea level than those who do not develop HAPE. The incidence of HAPE has been analyzed in a prospective study of people climbing a 4500-meter mountain. 15% of climbers had clearcut evidence of HAPE from examination of the chest (by stethoscope or X-ray) after their climb. There is probably a risk of HAPE for most climbers if the rate of ascent and degree of physical effort are great enough. (Lancet Jan. 24, 2002). The planning and pacing of ascents is of critical importance. HAPE tends to be less frequent on well-planned ascents to much greater heights, despite the greater degree of hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels)."
Haploinsufficiency,"Haploinsufficiency: A situation in which the total level of a gene product (a particular protein) produced by the cell is about half of the normal level and that is not sufficient to permit the cell to function normally. Another way to define haploinsufficiency is as a condition that arises when the normal phenotype requires the protein product of both alleles, and reduction of 50% of gene function results in an abnormal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency can be due to a number of problems. One of the two copies of the gene may be missing due to a deletion. A mutation (change) in the gene may have wiped out production of message. Or the message or the protein produced by the cell may be unstable or degraded by the cell. The term ""haploinsufficiency"" is of recent vintage. It was cobbled together for use in genetics, cell biology, and molecular medicine from ""haploid"" (one instead of two chromosomes or two genes) + ""insufficiency."" Haploinsufficiency is related to hemizygosity."
HAV,HAV: Hepatitis A virus.
Hay fever,"Hay fever: A seasonal allergy to airborne particles characterized by itchy eyes, runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy throat, and excess mucus. Hay fever is a misnomer because it is not caused by hay and it does not produce a fever. It is also known as allergic rhinitis or pollinosis."
Hb (hemoglobin),Hb (hemoglobin): Hb is the standard abbreviation for hemoglobin.
HBV,"HBV: Hepatitis B virus. A virus which primarily causes inflammation of the liver. The hepatitis B virus can be transmitted in several ways including blood transfusion, needle sticks, body piercing and tattooing using unsterile instruments, dialysis, sexual and even less intimate close contact, and childbirth. Symptoms include fatigue, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, and light stools. Diagnosis is by blood test(s). Treatment is with anti-viral drugs and/or hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). Chronic hepatitis B may be treated with interferon. Healthcare workers accidentally exposed to materials infected with hepatitis B and individuals with known sexual contact with hepatitis B patients are usually given both HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine to provide both immediate and long-term protection. HBV infection can be prevented by the hepatitis B vaccine, and by avoiding activities that could lead to contracting the virus."
Hct (hematocrit),Hct (hematocrit): Abbreviation for hematocrit.
HCV PCR,"HCV PCR: HCV PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a test for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). There are three types of HCV PCR tests: The three different HCV PCR tests serve different purposes. The qualitative test is done to confirm the presence of HCV in the blood of a person with positive HCV antibody test. The quantitative test is done to monitor the effectiveness of that treatment. The genotype test is usually done before the start of treatment because it can differentiate each of the major subtypes of HCV. Knowing the subtype can be important because, for example, treatment with interferon is more often effective for people with genotype subtypes 2 or 3 than for those with genotype 1. See also : PCR; RT-PCR."
HDL,"HDL: High density lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are combinations of lipids (fats) and proteins. They are the form in which lipids are transported in the blood. The high density lipoproteins transport cholesterol from the tissues of the body to the liver so it can be gotten rid of in the bile. HDL cholesterol is therefore considered the ""good"" cholesterol. The higher the HDL cholesterol level, the lower the risk of coronary artery disease."
HDL cholesterol,"HDL cholesterol: High density lipoprotein cholesterol. Lipoproteins, which are combinations of fats (lipids) and proteins, are the form in which lipids are transported in the blood. HDLs transport cholesterol from the tissues of the body to the liver, so the cholesterol can be eliminated in the bile. HDL cholesterol is therefore considered the 'good' cholesterol: The higher the HDL cholesterol level, the lower the risk of coronary artery disease.The average man has an HDL cholesterol level of 40 to 50 mg/dL. In the average woman, HDL levels range from 50 to 60 mg/dL. An HDL cholesterol of 60 mg/dL or higher gives some protection against heart disease. Regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight (fat), and cessation of cigarette smoking increase HDL cholesterol levels. When lifestyle modifications are insufficient, medications can be used."
HDR syndrome,"HDR syndrome: The syndrome of familial Hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural Deafness, and Renal dysplasia. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, the syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of the GATA3 gene in chromosome 10p. The hypoparathyroidism causes hypocalcemia (a low level of calcium in blood) and lifelong fatigue and depression. The deafness is congenital (present at birth). The kidney dysplasia (malformations) can lead to nephrosis and progressive renal failure. Some patients have micrognathia (small chin) and no teeth. Haploinsufficiency is caused by changes in the GATA3 gene that render it physically or functionally inactive. These changes include deletions, some of them large enough to be detected under the microscope, and point mutations of a single nucleotide base in GATA3. The GATA3 gene appears essential to the embryonic development of the ears, parathyroid glands, and kidneys. Diagnosis of this syndrome (as with many diseases) can make a great difference in a patient's life. (Sometimes seemingly difficult diagnoses need simple treatments.) Supplemental calcium and calcidiol (vitamin D) can increase the calcium, relieve the fatigue and depression (and transform the quality of life) for the patient."
Headache,"Headache: A pain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. All headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. Migraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. Cluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. Secondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from ""mixed"" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. The treatment of the headache depends on the type and severity of the headache and on other factors such as the age of the patient. Headache is also referred to as cephalgia."
Health,"Health: As officially defined by the World Health Organization, a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
Health for All,"Health for All: A global health movement undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the late 20th century. In 1977, the World Health Assembly decided that the major social goal of governments and WHO should be the attainment by all people of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that would permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. In 1981, the Assembly unanimously adopted a Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000. This was the birth of the ""Health for All"" movement. According to WHO, ""'Health for All' does not mean an end to disease and disability, or that doctors and nurses will care for everyone. It means that resources for health are evenly distributed and that essential health care is accessible to everyone. It means that health begins at home, in schools, and at the workplace, and that people use better approaches for preventing illness and alleviating unavoidable disease and disability. It means that people recognize that ill-health is not inevitable and that they can shape their own lives and the lives of their families, free from the avoidable burden of disease."" Some progress toward these goals has been made, but the goals have clearly not yet been attained on a global level. In many countries including the United States, for example, it cannot be said that the ""resources for health are evenly distributed and that essential health care is accessible to everyone."""
Health risk,"Health risk: an adverse event or negative health consequence due to a specific event, disease, or condition. For example, the health risks of obesity include diabetes, joint disease, increased likelihood of certain cancers, and cardiovascular disease. All of these consequences are related to obesity and are therefore health risks associated with obesity. A health risk may be related to genetic conditions, chronic diseases, certain occupations or sports, lifestyle factors, or any number of events or situations."
Hearing aid,"Hearing aid: An instrument to help in hearing. There are four common styles of hearing aids. From largest to smallest, they are: There is also a body hearing aid for very severe hearing loss. In general, hearing aids should ideally be binaural (in both ears), if the hearing loss involves both ears."
Heart,"Heart: The muscle that pumps blood received from veins into arteries throughout the body. The heart is positioned in the chest behind the sternum (breastbone); in front of the trachea, esophagus, and aorta; and above the diaphragm. A normal heart is about the size of a closed fist and weighs about 298 grams or 10.5 ounces. It is cone-shaped, with the point of the cone pointing down to the left. Two-thirds of the heart lies in the left side of the chest, with the balance in the right side of the chest. The heart is composed of specialized cardiac muscle, and it is four-chambered, with a right atrium and ventricle, and an anatomically separate left atrium and ventricle. The blood flows from the systemic veins into the right atrium, thence to the right ventricle, from which it is pumped to the lungs and then returned into the left atrium, thence to the left ventricle, from which it is driven into the systemic arteries. The heart is thus functionally composed of two hearts: the right heart and the left heart. The right heart consists of the right atrium, which receives deoxygenated blood from the body, and the right ventricle, which pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs under low pressure; and the left heart, which consists of the left atrium, which receives oxygenated blood from the lung, and the left ventricle, which pumps the oxygenated blood out to the body under high pressure."
Heart attack,"Heart attack: The death of heart muscle due to the loss of blood supply. The loss of blood supply is usually caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery, one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle. Death of the heart muscle, in turn, causes chest pain and electrical instability of the heart muscle tissue. The electrical instability of the heart causes ventricular fibrillation (chaotic electrical disturbances affecting the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart). Orderly transmission of electrical signals in the heart is important for the regular beating (and the efficient pumping) of the heart. A heart undergoing ventricular fibrillation simply quivers and can not pump or deliver oxygenated blood to the brain. Permanent brain damage and death can occur unless oxygenated blood flow is restored within five minutes. Many heart attack deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation that occurs before the victim can reach any medical assistance or the emergency room. These electrical disturbances of the heart can often be successfully treated with medications or other means by paramedics in the ""field,"" or upon arrival to the hospital. Approximately 90-95% of heart attack victims who reach the hospital survive. The 5-10% who later die are those who have suffered major heart muscle damage, or who suffer an ""extension"" or enlargement of their heart attack. Early heart attack deaths can be avoided if a bystander starts CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) within five minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation. CPR involves breathing for the victim and applying external chest compression to make the heart pump. When paramedics arrive, medications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion) to the heart can be administered to convert ventricular fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm. Therefore, prompt CPR and rapid paramedic response can improve the survival chances from a heart attack. The treatment of a heart attack may include the prompt administration of drugs to dissolve and prevent blood clots; an angioplasty or intracoronary stenting to open an obstructed artery; and medications that open (dilate) blood vessels. Early reopening of a blocked coronary artery reduces the amount of heart muscle damage, lessens the size of the heart attack, and improves prognosis. Patients suffering a heart attack are usually hospitalized for several days to detect heart rhythm disturbance, and observe for shortness of breath and chest pain. A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction or an MI. Myocardial refers to the myocardium, the heart muscle. Infarction is tissue death due to a local lack of oxygen."
Heart block,"Heart block: A blockage in the conduction of the normal electrical impulses in the heart. Heart block is not uncommon and is detected with an electrocardiogram. Heart block occurs from degeneration or scarring of the electrical pathways in the heart muscle, either naturally or as a result of disease. Heart block typically requires no treatment, but can be a factor in the decision of whether or not to put a pacemaker in a heart that is failing or irregularly beating."
Heart disease,"Heart disease: Any disorder that affects the heart. Sometimes the term ""heart disease"" is used narrowly and incorrectly as a synonym for coronary artery disease. Heart disease is synonymous with cardiac disease but not with cardiovascular disease which is any disease of the heart or blood vessels. Among the many types of heart disease, see, for example: Angina; Arrhythmia; Congenital heart disease; Coronary artery disease (CAD); Dilated cardiomyopathy; Heart attack (myocardial infarction); Heart failure; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Mitral regurgitation; Mitral valve prolapse; and Pulmonary stenosis."
Heart failure,"Heart failure: Inability of the heart to keep up with the demands on it and, specifically, failure of the heart to pump blood with normal efficiency. When this occurs, the heart is unable to provide adequate blood flow to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Heart failure may be due to failure of the right or left or both ventricles. The signs and symptoms depend upon which side of the heart is failing. They can include shortness of breath (dyspnea), asthma due to the heart (cardiac asthma), pooling of blood (stasis) in the general body (systemic) circulation or in the liver's (portal) circulation, swelling (edema), blueness or duskiness (cyanosis), and enlargement (hypertrophy) of the heart. There are many causes of congestive heart failure including: (1) coronary artery disease leading to heart attacks and heart muscle weakness, (2) primary heart muscle weakness from viral infections or toxins such as prolonged alcohol exposure, (3) heart valve disease causing heart muscle weakness due to too much leaking of blood or heart muscle stiffness from a blocked valve, and (4) hypertension (high blood pressure). Rarer causes include hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone), vitamin deficiency, and excess amphetamine (""speed"") use. The aim of therapy is to improve the pumping function of the heart. General treatment includes salt restriction, diuretics (to get rid of excess fluid), digoxin (to strengthen the heart), and other medications. A drug called spironolactone has been found to be a major help in treating congestive heart failure Its beneficial effects are additive to those from ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs commonly relied on in treating heart failure. A pacemaker-like device is also now available to treat heart failure. The implantable device delivers synchronized electrical stimulation to three chambers of the heart, enabling the heart to pump blood more efficiently throughout the body."
Heart murmur,"Heart murmur: An unusual, 'whooshing' heart sound that may be innocent or may reflect disease or malformation. A heart murmur is created by blood flow through a heart valve, by blood flow through a narrowed chamber, or by an unusual connection between the chambers, as seen with congenital heart disease. Sometimes a heart murmur does not represent any disease or condition and is, therefore, referred to as a functional heart murmur. There are many forms of heart murmurs representing a variety of heart conditions. Each type of murmur is characterized by its location, timing, duration, as well as the intensity and quality of the sound it makes. A heart murmur is usually heard by a physician while he or she listens to the chest with a stethoscope. While the heart murmur itself is never treated, sometime the condition it represents may require treatment."
Heart muscle,"Heart muscle: A type of muscle with unique features only found in the heart. The heart muscle, or cardiac muscle, is medically called the myocardium (""myo-"" being the prefix denoting muscle)."
Heart rate,"Heart rate: The number of heartbeats per unit of time, usually per minute. The heart rate is based on the number of contractions of the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). The heart rate may be too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia). The pulse is a bulge of an artery from waves of blood that course through the blood vessels each time the heart beats. The pulse is often taken at the wrist to estimate the heart rate."
Heart rhythm disorders,"Heart rhythm disorders: Abnormal rhythm of the heartbeat due to irregularities in transmission of the electrical signals that normally control heart rate and rhythm. Also known as arrhythmias. With an arrhythmia, the heartbeats may be irregular or too slow (bradycardia), too rapid (tachycardia), or occur too early. When a single heartbeat occurs earlier than normal, it is called a premature contraction. An abnormal heart rhythm can be due to electrical disturbances in the upper chambers of the heart (atria), the atrioventricular (AV) node, or the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). Examples of atrial arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation."
"Heart test, EPS","Heart test, EPS: ElectroPhysiologic Study of the heart, a test of the electrical conduction system of the heart (the system that generates the heart beat). EPS is done by threading thin plastic tubes (catheters) into a vein where the leg connects to the abdomen. A local anesthetic is given as well as a mild sedative. The procedure is not painful and the patient is not put to sleep. After being placed into the vein, the catheters are then passed under fluoroscopic guidance into the heart. These catheters measure the electrical signals generated by the heart. They can a much more detailed analysis of these signals than a simple electrocardiogram (ECG). The catheters are used to rapidly pace the heart -- to make the heart beat quickly. The electrical conduction system of the heart is also measured during this rapid pacing and the heart is observed to see if any abnormal heart rhythms develop. The reason for doing EPS may to determine:"
Heartburn,"Heartburn: An uncomfortable feeling of burning and warmth occurring in waves rising up behind the breastbone (sternum) toward the neck. It is usually due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the rise of stomach acid back up into the esophagus. Heartburn has nothing whatsoever to do with the heart. It is a popular nonmedical term. It is medically called pyrosis."
Heat prostration,"Heat prostration: Overheating of the body due to extreme weather conditions. Unrelieved hyperthermia can lead to collapse and death, particularly in the elderly. Prevention via air conditioning, ventilation, and drinking extra water is the key for vulnerable persons. In emergency cases, injections of saline solution and rapid cooling of the body may be needed. Also known as heatstroke or hyperthermia."
Heat rash (Pictures),"Heat rash (Pictures): Heat rash is an irritation of the skin that results from excessive sweating during hot and humid weather. Heat rash appears as clusters of red papules or blisters on the skin. It is more likely to occur on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in elbow creases. Children are more likely than adults to develop heat rash. Heat rash is not a serious condition and can be easily treated by keeping the affected area cool and dry. "
Hecht's pneumonia,"Hecht's pneumonia: Also known as giant cell pneumonia, this is a deadly but fortunately rare complication of measles. It tends to strike children who are immunodeficient as from leukemia or HIV/AIDS. The postmortem examination (autopsy) shows multinucleated giant cells lining the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs. Named for the early 20th-century Austrian pathologist Victor Hecht."
Hedonophobia,"Hedonophobia: An abnormal, excessive, and persistent fear of pleasure. Sufferers with this most puritanical of phobias typically feel guilty about experiencing pleasure even though they usually realize rationally there is nothing at all wrong with taking pleasure. Their guilt usually arises from the fact that they are participating a pleasurable activity while others around them or in the world at large are experiencing nothing but illness, grief, economic hardship and other painful problems. Their guilt may also arise from the belief that life is best lived ascetically (similar to the idea that, for a medicine to do good, it must taste bad). ""Hedonophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""hedone"" (pleasure, delight) and ""phobos"" (fear). Other words derived from ""hedone"" include ""hedonism"" (a philosophy that emphasizes pleasure as the main aim of life) and ""hedonist"" (a pleasure-seeker)."
Heebie-jeebies,Heebie-jeebies: Extreme nervousness. A term coined by the America cartoonist Billy DeBeck (1890-1942) in his comic strip Barney Google.
Hejama,Hejama: Alternate Arabic term for cupping. The preferred Arabic term for this practice is al-hijamah. See: Cupping.
Helicobacter pylori,"Helicobacter pylori: A bacterium that causes stomach inflammation (gastritis) and ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. This bacterium is the most common cause of ulcers worldwide. H. pylori infection may be acquired from contaminated food and water or through person-to-person contact. It is common in people who live in crowded conditions with poor sanitation. This bacterium is also believed to be associated with stomach cancer (gastric adenocarcinoma) and a rare type of lymphoid tumor called gastric MALT lymphoma. Infected persons usually carry H. pylori indefinitely, often without symptoms, unless treated with antibiotics to eradicate the bacterium. Also known as ulcer bug."
Helminth,"Helminth: A worm classified as a parasite. (A parasite is a disease-causing organism that lives on or in a human or another animal and derives its nourishment from its host.) Lice are examples of parasites that live on humans; bacteria and viruses are examples of parasites that live either on humans or in humans; helminths are examples of parasites that live in humans. Helminth eggs contaminate food, water, air, feces, pets and wild animals, and objects such as toilet seats and door handles. The eggs enter the body of a human through the mouth, the nose and the anus. Once inside the body, helminth eggs usually lodge in the intestine, hatch, grow and multiply. They can sometimes infest other body sites. Diagnosis of helminth diseases in humans usually requires a medical history and physical examination, a laboratory analysis of stools, and sometimes other tests. Treatment in most cases involves the use of highly effective anti-worm drugs known as vermifuges that kill the worms. Prevention of helminth diseases usually requires frequent washing of hands, frequent cleaning of bathrooms and kitchens, and thorough cooking of the foods they infest -- mainly beef, pork, sausage and bear meat. Water supplies should be chlorinated, if possible. Common helminths and the problems they cause include the following: The word ""helminth"" is derived from the Greek ""helmins"" (worm). Helminthology is the study of parasitic worms."
Hematochezia,"Hematochezia: Bright red blood in the stool, usually from the lower gastrointestinal tract -- the colon or rectum -- or from hemorrhoids. The term ""hematochezia"" is rarely used. ""Bright red blood in the stool"" is more widely used (and understood)."
Hematocrit,"Hematocrit: The proportion of the blood that consists of packed red blood cells. The hematocrit is expressed as a percentage by volume. The red cells are packed by centrifugation. For example, an hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood. The red cells make up a quarter of the blood. The normal ranges for the hematocrit are dependant on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges for the hematocrit are: These values may vary slightly between laboratories. The term ""hematocrit"" was coined in 1903 and comes from the Greek roots hemat-, blood + krites, judge = to judge or gauge the blood. The abbreviation for hematocrit is hct. In medical slang the hematocrit is called the crit."
Hematology,"Hematology: The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood and bone marrow as well as of the immunologic, hemostatic (blood clotting) and vascular systems. Because of the nature of blood, the science of hematology profoundly affects the understanding of many diseases."
Hematology-oncology,"Hematology-oncology: The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of blood diseases (hematology) and cancer (oncology) and research into them. Hematology-oncology includes such diseases as iron deficiency anemia, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, the thalassemias, leukemias and lymphomas, as well as cancers of other organs. Abbreviated hem-onc."
Hematoma,"Hematoma: A localized swelling that is filled with blood caused by a break in the wall of a blood vessel. The breakage may be spontaneous, as in the case of an aneurysm, or caused by trauma. The blood is usually clotted or partially clotted, and it exists within an organ or in a soft tissue space, such as muscle. Treatment depends on the location and size of the hematoma but usually involves draining the accumulated blood. A hematoma in or near the brain is particularly dangerous."
Hematophobia,"Hematophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of blood is called hematophobia. Sufferers of this very common phobia dread the sight of their own blood, the sight of the blood of another person or an animal, and sometimes printed or filmed images of blood or even thoughts of blood. Blood may remind them of their own vulnerability to injury and of the eventuality of death. Some sufferers of hematophobia experience a typical phobic reaction characterized by an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Other sufferers experience an atypical phobic reaction characterized by a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate, causing paleness and weakness. They may even faint. Those with the latter reaction may develop a new fear: the fear of fainting. Through the ages, writers have done little to calm the fear of blood. In Homer's Iliad, waterways run red with blood as a wrathful Achilles harvests his crop of Trojans. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, blood becomes a terrifying symbol of guilt to Lady Macbeth, and she washes her hands raw to rid them of blood, real or imagined. In Bram Stoker's Dracula blood becomes the nurture of a vampire. ""Hematophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""haima"" (blood) and ""phobos"" (fear). Other English words derived from ""haima"" include ""hemodialysis"" (a procedure that removes impurities from the blood), ""hemoglobin"" (a blood component that transports oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body) and ""hemorrhage"" (rapid blood loss). Alternate name for hematophobia: hemophobia."
Hematopoiesis,"Hematopoiesis: The production of all types of blood cells including formation, development, and differentiation of blood cells. Prenatally, hematopoiesis occurs in the yolk sack, then in the liver, and lastly in the bone marrow. In the normal situation, hematopoiesis in adults occurs in the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues. All types of blood cells are derived from primitive cells (stem cells) that are pluripotent (they have the potential to develop into all types of blood cells)."
Hematuria,"Hematuria: Blood in the urine. Hematuria may or may not be accompanied by pain, but it is always abnormal and should be further investigated. Painful hematuria can be caused by a number of disorders, including infections and stones in the urinary tract. Painless hematuria can also be due to many causes, including cancer."
Hemi-,"Hemi-: Prefix meaning one half, as in hemiparesis, hemiplegia, and hemithorax. From the Greek hemisus meaning half and equivalent to the Latin semi-. As a general rule, not always followed, hemi- goes with words of Greek origin and semi- with those of Latin origin."
Hemidiaphragm,"Hemidiaphragm: Half of the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and that serves as the main muscle of respiration. Both hemidiaphragms are visible on X-ray studies from the front or back. The right hemidiaphragm is protected by the liver and is stronger than the left. The left hemidiaphragm is more often subject to rupture and hernia than the right. This may also reflect weaknesses at the points of embryologic fusion of the left hemidiaphragm. See also: Elevated hemidiaphragm."
Hemiparesis,Hemiparesis: Weakness on one side of the body.
Hemiplegia,Hemiplegia: Paralysis on one side of the body.
Hemithorax,"Hemithorax: Half of the thorax or, more simply, one side of the chest."
Hemizygous,Hemizygous: Having only a single copy of a gene instead of the customary two copies. All the genes on the single X chromosome in the male are 'hemizygous.
Hemodialysis,"Hemodialysis: A medical procedure to remove fluid and waste products from the blood and to correct electrolyte imbalances. This is accomplished using a machine and a dialyzer, also referred to as an ""artificial kidney."" Hemodialysis is used to treat both acute (temporary) and chronic (permanent) kidney failure."
Hemoglobin,"Hemoglobin: The oxygen-carrying pigment and predominant protein in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin forms an unstable, reversible bond with oxygen. In its oxygenated state it is called oxyhemoglobin and is bright red. In the reduced state it is called deoxyhemoglobin and is purple-blue. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of four heme groups surrounding a globin group. Heme contains iron and gives a red color to the molecule. Globin consists of two linked pairs of polypeptide chains. The development of each chain is controlled at a separate genetic locus. Changes in the amino acid sequence of these chains results in abnormal hemoglobins. For example, hemoglobin S is found in sickle-cell disease, a severe type of anemia in which the red cells become sickle-shaped when oxygen is in short supply. When red blood cells die, the hemoglobin within them is released and broken up: the iron in hemoglobin is salvaged, transported to the bone marrow by a protein called transferrin and used again in the production of new red blood cells; the remainder of the hemoglobin becomes a chemical called bilirubin that is excreted into the bile which is secreted into the intestine, where it gives the feces their characteristic yellow-brown color."
Hemoglobin A1C,"Hemoglobin A1c: A minor component of hemoglobin to which glucose is bound. Abbreviated HbA1c. HbA1c levels depend on the blood glucose concentration: The higher the glucose concentration in blood, the higher the level of HbA1c. Levels of HbA1c are not influenced by daily fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration but reflect the average glucose levels over the prior 6 to 8 weeks. Measurement of HbA1c is a useful indicator of how well the blood glucose level has been controlled in the recent past and may be used to monitor the effects of diet, exercise, and drug therapy on blood glucose in patients with diabetes. In healthy people without diabetes, the HbA1c level is less than 7 percent of total hemoglobin. Also known as glycosylated or glucosylated hemoglobin."
Hemoglobin normal values,"Hemoglobin normal values: Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment in the blood, the predominant protein in the red blood cells. In the routine laboratory test for hemoglobin (Hb), it is usually measured as total hemoglobin and the result is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dl) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the sex of the person. The normal ranges are: All of these values may vary slightly between laboratories. Some laboratories do not differentiate between adult and ""after middle age"" hemoglobin values."
Hemoglobin S,Hemoglobin S: The most common type of abnormal hemoglobin and the basis of sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia. Hemoglobin S differs from normal adult hemoglobin (called hemoglobin A) only by a single amino acid substitution (a valine replacing a glutamine in the 6th position of the beta chain of globin). Recognition of this tiny change in the hemoglobin molecule marked the opening of molecular medicine.
Hemoglobinuria,"Hemoglobinuria: The presence of free hemoglobin in the urine may make the urine look dark. Normally, there is no hemoglobin in the urine. Hemoglobinuria is a sign of a number of abnormal conditions, such as bleeding and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria."
Hemolysis,"Hemolysis: The destruction of red blood cells which leads to the release of hemoglobin from within the red blood cells into the blood plasma. Etymology: The word ""hemolysis"" is made up of ""hemo-"", blood + ""lysis"", the disintegration of cells."
Hemolytic,"Hemolytic: Referring to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells which leads to the release of hemoglobin from within the red blood cells into the blood plasma. Hemolytic anemia, for example, is anemia (""low blood"") due to the destruction (rather than the underproduction) of red blood cells. Etymology: The word ""hemolytic"" is made up of ""hemo-"", blood + ""lytic"", the disintegration of cells."
Hemolytic anemia,"Hemolytic anemia: Anemia due to the destruction, rather than underproduction, of red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia can result from a medication reaction, from the immune system attacking the red blood cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), from destruction of blood cells passing through diseased heart valves, and other causes."
"Hemolytic jaundice, congenital","Hemolytic jaundice, congenital: Known also as hereditary spherocytosis (HS), this is a genetic disorder of the red blood cell membrane clinically characterized by anemia, jaundice (yellowing) and splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen). In HS the red cells are smaller, rounder, and more fragile than normal. The red cells have a spherical rather than the biconcave-disk shape of the normal red cell. These rotund red cells (spherocytes) are osmotically fragile and less flexible than normal red cells and tend to get trapped in narrow blood passages, particularly in the spleen, and there they break up (hemolyze) leading to hemolytic anemia. The clogging of the spleen with red cells almost invariably causes splenomegaly. The breakup of the red cells releases hemoglobin and the heme part gives rise to bilirubin, the pigment of jaundice. The excess bilirubin leads to the formation of gallstones, even in childhood, There is also often iron overload due to the excess destruction of iron-rich red cells. Hereditary spherocytosis is most common in people of northern European ancestry. It often shows up in infancy or early childhood, causing anemia and jaundice. The bone marrow has to work extra hard to make more red cells. So, if in the course of an ordinary viral illness, the bone marrow stops making red cells, the anemia can quickly become profound. This is termed an aplastic crisis. Laboratory studies show evidence not only of many spherocytes but also increased numbers of reticulocytes (young red blood cells), hyperbilirubinemia (increased blood levels of the jaundice pigment bilirubin due to the breakup of the red cells) and increased osmotic fragility of the red cells. HS is due to a deficiency of a protein called ankyrin. Ankyrins are cell membrane proteins (thought to interconnect integral proteins with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton.) The ankyrin of red blood cells (erythrocytic ankyrin) is called ankyrin-R or ankyrin-1. It is represented by the symbol ANK1. The HS gene, that for ANK1, has been mapped to chromosome 8 and, specifically, to chromosome band 8p11.2. HS is inherited as a dominant trait so, if a person with HS reproduces, their child (irrespective of whether it is a boy or girl) has a 50:50 chance to have HS. The treatment of hereditary spherocytosis is to remove the spleen (splenectomy). Although the red cell defect persists, the breakup of the red cells (hemolysis) ceases. Splenectomy, however, is a hazard in young children. Young children without a spleen are at increased risk for overwhelming sepsis (bloodstream infection), particularly with the pneumococcus bacteria. Splenectomy is therefore usually postponed if possible until the age of 3 years. Before having a splenectomy, anyone with HS should have the pneumococcal vaccine. Persons with HS (or another cause of brisk ongoing hemolysis) should take supplemental folic acid. The prognosis (outlook) after splenectomy is for a normal life and a normal life expectancy. HS is also known as severe atypical spherocytosis, spherocytosis type II, ankyrin deficiency, erythrocyte ankyrin deficiency, ankyrin-R deficiency, and ankyrin1 deficiency."
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH),"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, cancer-like disorder in which certain types of immune system cells (histiocytes and lymphocytes) start to proliferate and damage body tissues or organs. It can be an inherited condition, or it can occur as a result of immunosuppression (as in organ transplants) or infection. Most patients are young children; signs and symptoms include Treatment is by chemotherapy and in some cases bone-marrow transplantation. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is also known as HLH disease. See also histiocytosis."
Hemophilia,Hemophilia: An inherited disorder in which the ability of blood to clot normally is impaired. There are two types of hemophilia: hemophilia A and hemophilia B.
Hemophobia,"Hemophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of blood. Sufferers of this very common phobia dread the sight of their own blood, the sight of the blood of another person or an animal, and sometimes printed or filmed images of blood or even thoughts of blood. Blood may remind them of their own vulnerability to injury and of the eventuality of death. Some sufferers of hemophobia experience a typical phobic reaction characterized by an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Other sufferers experience an atypical phobic reaction characterized by a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate, causing paleness and weakness. They may even faint. Those with the latter reaction may develop a new fear: the fear of fainting. Through the ages, writers have done little to calm the fear of blood. In Homer's Iliad, waterways run red with blood as a wrathful Achilles harvests his crop of Trojans. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, blood becomes a terrifying symbol of guilt to Lady Macbeth, and she washes her hands raw to rid them of blood, real or imagined. In Bram Stoker's Dracula blood becomes the nurture of a vampire. ""Hemophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""haima"" (blood) and ""phobos"" (fear). Other English words derived from ""haima"" include ""hemodialysis"" (a procedure that removes impurities from the blood), ""hemoglobin"" (a blood component that transports oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body) and ""hemorrhage"" (rapid blood loss). Alternate name for hemophobia: hematophobia."
Hemoptysis,"Hemoptysis: Spitting up blood or blood-tinged sputum from the respiratory tract. Hemoptysis occurs when tiny blood vessels that line the lung airways are broken. Hemoptysis can be harmless such as from irritated bronchial tubes with bronchitis, or be serious such as from cancer of the lung."
Hemorrhage,"Hemorrhage: Bleeding or the abnormal flow of blood. A hemorrhage may be ""external"" and visible on the outside of the body or ""internal,"" where there is no sign of bleeding outside the body. Bleeding from a cut on the face is an external hemorrhage. Bleeding into the spleen or liver are examples of internal hemorrhage. The term ""hemorrhagic"" comes from the Greek ""haima,"" blood + rhegnumai,"" to break forth; a free and forceful escape of blood."
Hemorrhagic,"Hemorrhagic: Pertaining to bleeding or the abnormal flow of blood. The patient may have an internal hemorrhagic problem that is not be visible or the patient may have an external hemorrhagic problem that is therefore visible on the outside of the body. The term ""hemorrhagic"" comes from the Greek ""haima,"" blood + rhegnumai,"" to break forth = a free and forceful escape of blood."
Hemorrhoid,"Hemorrhoid: A dilated (enlarged) vein in the walls of the anus and sometimes around the rectum, usually caused by untreated constipation but occasionally associated with chronic diarrhea. The symptoms start with bleeding after defecation. If untreated, hemorrhoids can worsen, protruding from the anus. In their worst stage, they must be returned to the anal cavity manually. Fissures can develop, and these may cause intense discomfort. Treatment is by changing the diet to prevent constipation and avoid further irritation, the use of topical medication, and sometimes surgery or sclerotherapy. Also known as piles."
Hemorrhoidectomy,"Hemorrhoidectomy: Surgical removal of hemorrhoids (enlarged and dilated veins in and around the anus). Hemorrhoidectomy is usually reserved for severe hemorrhoids if more conservative treatment measures fail to alleviate the symptoms (burning, itching, swelling, protrusion, bleeding, and pain). Hemorrhoidectomy may be done with a standard scalpel or with an ultrasonic scalpel to cut away hemorrhoids (a method that does not require sutures). Another sutureless method involves staples. Tissue from further in the anus is used to close the wound with surgical staples after the hemorrhoids are removed."
Hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids: Dilated (enlarged) veins in the walls of the anus and sometimes around the rectum, usually caused by untreated constipation but occasionally associated with chronic diarrhea. Symptoms start with bleeding after defecation. If untreated, hemorrhoids can worsen, protruding from the anus. Treatment involves changing the diet to prevent constipation and avoid further irritation, the use of topical medication, and sometimes surgery. Also known as piles."
Hemostasis,"Hemostasis: The stoppage of bleeding or hemorrhage. Also, the stoppage of blood flow through a blood vessel or organ of the body. Hemostasis is the arrest of bleeding, whether it be by normal vasoconstriction (the vessel walls closing temporarily), by an abnormal obstruction (such as a plaque) or by coagulation or surgical means (such as ligation). The term comes from the Greek roots heme, blood + stasis, halt = halt of the blood."
HEPA,"HEPA: Acronym that stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air and for High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestor. HEPA filters are used for isolation and immunocompromise units, operating rooms, removal of allergens from the air (for hay fever, asthma, etc.) and other applications where maximum reduction or removal of submicron particulate matter from air is required."
Hepar,"Hepar: The liver or a preparation made from it. The term hepar is not often used today. It is a direct borrowing of the Greek hepar, liver."
Heparin,Heparin: An anticoagulant (anti-clotting) medication. Heparin is useful in preventing thromboembolic complications (clots that travel from their site of origin through the blood stream to clog up another vessel). Heparin is also used in the early treatment of blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolisms).
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Low blood platelet count as a result of the medication heparin. HIT (Heparin induced thrombocytopenia) is caused by the body forming antibodies to Heparin when it is bound to platelet factor4 (PF4) - a protein in the blood. These antibodies bind to the combination of Heparin and PF4 and activate platelets which in turn clump together and cause small clots in the blood stream and the platelet count falls. If major clots develops and block vessels - called thrombosis, the condition is even more serious and is called HITT (Heparin induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis). Heparin is used to treat and prevent abnormal blood clotting. In the face of HIT or HITT other agents must be used for this purpose. Direct thrombin (a blood clotting factor) inhibitors may be used. An oral direct thrombin inhibitor is under investigation for HIT as well. It is unsafe to give the standard oral anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin) to patients with HIT and a platelet count under 150,000 as it can lead to warfarin induced skin necrosis (death of skin). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can be mild or serious and fatal."
Hepat-,"Hepat-: Prefix or combining form used before a vowel to refer to the liver. From the Greek hepar, liver."
Hepatic,Hepatic: Having to do with the liver.
Hepatic artery,"Hepatic artery: An artery that distributes blood to the liver, pancreas and gallbladder as well as to the stomach and duodenal portion of the small intestine."
Hepatic biopsy,Hepatic biopsy: See: Liver biopsy.
Hepatic duct,Hepatic duct: A duct that carries bile from the liver into the common bile duct which conveys it to the duodenum (the upper part of the small intestine). There are three hepatic ducts: the right hepatic duct (which drains bile from the right half of the liver); the left hepatic duct (which drains bile from the left half of the liver); and the common hepatic duct (which is formed by the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts).
Hepatic encephalopathy,"Hepatic encephalopathy: Brain dysfunction directly due to liver dysfunction, most often recognized in advanced liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy may cause disturbances of consciousness and progress to coma. Hepatic encephalopathy is sometimes said to be synonymous with hepatic coma but this is incorrect. Hepatic coma is the end-stage of the process. In minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), there may be subtle impairment of behavior, intelligence, and neuromuscular function. Driving ability in MHE may be diminished."
Hepatic steatosis,"Hepatic steatosis: a term used to refer to the buildup of fat within cells of the liver. This is a general term that simply refers to fat in the liver. Fatty liver can be due to alcohol use disorder and heavy consumption of alcohol as well as a group of other conditions referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common form of chronic liver disease in the US, affecting around 80 to 100 million people. Obesity and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a potentially serious type of NAFLD associated with liver inflammation that can develop into scarring (cirrhosis), liver damage, which can lead to liver cancer. Fatty liver itself typically does not cause symptoms, but in some people, it may cause tiredness, an enlarged liver, and right upper abdominal pain."
Hepatitis,"Hepatitis: Inflammation of the liver, irrespective of the cause. Hepatitis is caused by a number of conditions, including drug toxicity, immune diseases, and viruses."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C: Inflammation of the liver due to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is usually spread via blood transfusion (rare), hemodialysis, and needle sticks. The damage hepatitis C does to the liver can lead to cirrhosis and its complications as well as cancer. Transmission of the virus by sexual contact is rare. At least half of hepatitis C patients develop chronic hepatitis C infection. Diagnosis is made by blood test. Treatment and probably cure is via antiviral drugs and is effective in over 90% of patients. Chronic hepatitis C was frequently treated with injectable interferon, in combination with antiviral oral medications, but now is most often treated with oral antivirals alone. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Previously known as non-A, non-B hepatitis."
Hepatitis F,"Hepatitis F: It was formerly believed that a virus isolated from rare blood samples was able to cause hepatitis, and this virus was designated hepatitis F virus. Further investigation has failed to confirm the existence of this virus. There is no known hepatitis F virus."
Hepato-,"Hepato-: Prefix or combining form used before a consonant to refer to the liver. From the Greek hepar, liver."
Hepatobiliary,"Hepatobiliary: Having to do with the liver plus the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile. For example, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can be applied to the hepatobiliary system. Hepatobiliary makes sense since ""hepato-"" refers to the liver and ""-biliary"" refers to the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile."
Hepatology,"Hepatology: The field of liver disease. The liver is the body's largest organ and hepatology is a large field. It includes, but is not limited to, the study of acute and chronic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, genetic and metabolic liver diseases and their complications, liver cancer, liver transplantation, drug metabolism (which depends largely upon the liver), and immunology as it pertains to the liver. Historically, hepatology grew out of gastroenterology and so became a subfield of it, although today it appears to be emerging as a freestanding medical specialty. The hepato- part comes from the Latin hepaticus derived from the Greek hepatikos meaning (not too surprisingly) the liver. The -logy part comes from the Greek logos meaning the study of, or field. History: Dr. Sheila Sherlock (1918-2001), was a pioneer in the science of liver disease, is considered the ""mother of hepatology."" Her book, ""Diseases of the Liver and Biliary System"" which she first published in 1955, was the first standard textbook on clinical liver disease. In 1959 she became the first woman to become a professor of medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London, where she set up and directed a world famous clinical, research and training center on liver disease."
Hepatoma,"Hepatoma: Cancer originating in the liver, in liver cells. More often called hepatocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. From hepat-, the liver + -oma, tumor = a liver tumor."
Hepatomegaly,"Hepatomegaly: An abnormally enlarged liver. Hepatomegaly can be caused by heart failure, blockage of blood vessels from the liver, or be a sign of chronic liver disease."
Hepatosplenomegaly,Hepatosplenomegaly: Abnormal enlargement of the liver and spleen. Hepatosplenomegaly is typically associated with chronic liver diseases.
HER2,"HER2: Abbreviation for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. HER2 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is expressed by, and involved in the growth of, some cancer cells. For example, HER2 is overexpressed in 18% to 20% of invasive breast cancers and affects treatment as well as prognosis of breast cancers. Also called c-erbB-2 or neu; also written HER-2."
Hereditary angioedema,"Hereditary angioedema: A genetic form of angioedema. (Angioedema is also referred to as Quinke's disease.) Persons with it are born lacking an inhibitor protein (called C1 esterase inhibitor) that normally prevents activation of a cascade of proteins leading to the swelling of angioedema. Patients can develop recurrent attacks of swollen tissues, pain in the abdomen, and swelling of the voice box (larynx) which can compromise breathing. The diagnosis is suspected with a history of recurrent angioedema. It is confirmed by finding abnormally low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor in the blood. Treatment options include antihistamines and male steroids (androgens) that can also prevent the recurrent attacks. Also called hereditary angioneurotic edema."
Hereditary spherocytosis,"Hereditary spherocytosis: A genetic disorder of the red blood cell membrane clinically characterized by anemia, jaundice (yellowing) and splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen). In HS the red cells are smaller, rounder, and more fragile than normal. The red cells have a spherical rather than the biconcave-disk shape of the normal red cell. These rotund red cells (spherocytes) are osmotically fragile and less flexible than normal red cells and tend to get trapped in narrow blood passages, particularly in the spleen, and there they break up (hemolyze) leading to hemolytic anemia. The clogging of the spleen with red cells almost invariably causes splenomegaly. The breakup of the red cells releases hemoglobin and the heme part gives rise to bilirubin, the pigment of jaundice. The excess bilirubin leads to the formation of gallstones, even in childhood, There is also often iron overload due to the excess destruction of iron-rich red cells. Hereditary spherocytosis is most common in people of northern European ancestry. It often shows up in infancy or early childhood, causing anemia and jaundice. The bone marrow has to work extra hard to make more red cells. So, if in the course of an ordinary viral illness, the bone marrow stops making red cells, the anemia can quickly become profound. This is termed an aplastic crisis. Laboratory studies show evidence not only of many spherocytes but also increased numbers of reticulocytes (young red blood cells), hyperbilirubinemia (increased blood levels of the jaundice pigment bilirubin due to the breakup of the red cells) and increased osmotic fragility of the red cells. HS is due to a deficiency of a protein called ankyrin. Ankyrins are cell membrane proteins (thought to interconnect integral proteins with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton.) The ankyrin of red blood cells (erythrocytic ankyrin) is called ankyrin-R or ankyrin-1. It is represented by the symbol ANK1. The HS gene, that for ANK1, has been mapped to chromosome 8 and, specifically, to chromosome band 8p11.2. HS is inherited as a dominant trait so, if a person with HS reproduces, their child (irrespective of whether it is a boy or girl) has a 50:50 chance to have HS. The treatment of hereditary spherocytosis is to remove the spleen (splenectomy). Although the red cell defect persists, the breakup of the red cells (hemolysis) ceases. Splenectomy, however, is a hazard in young children. Young children without a spleen are at increased risk for overwhelming sepsis (bloodstream infection), particularly with the pneumococcus bacteria. Splenectomy is therefore usually postponed if possible until the age of 3 years. Before having a splenectomy, anyone with HS should have the pneumococcal vaccine. Persons with HS (or another cause of brisk ongoing hemolysis) should take supplemental folic acid. The prognosis (outlook) after splenectomy is for a normal life and a normal life expectancy. HS is also known as congenital hemolytic jaundice, severe atypical spherocytosis, spherocytosis type II, ankyrin deficiency, erythrocyte ankyrin deficiency, ankyrin-R deficiency, and ankyrin1 deficiency."
Herniation,Herniation: Abnormal protrusion of tissue through an opening.
Herniorrhaphy,"Herniorrhaphy: The surgical repair of a hernia. Herniorrhaphy may be done under local or general anesthesia using a conventional incision or a laparoscope. The term ""herniorrhaphy"" comes from hernio-, referring to a hernia + the Greek rhaphe, a seam = putting a seam (or suture) in a hernia."
Heroin,"Heroin: Semisynthetic drug derived from morphine. Discovered in 1874, it was introduced commercially in 1898 by the Bayer company in Germany. The name heroin was coined from the German heroisch meaning heroic, strong. Heroin is stronger (more potent) than morphine."
Herpes,"Herpes: A family of viruses. Herpes also refers to infection with one of the human herpesviruses, especially herpes simplex types 1 and 2. Herpes simplex type 1, also known as human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), causes cold sores and fever blisters in the mouth and around it. Herpes simplex type 2, also known as human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), causes genital herpes, a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Genital herpes is characterized by sores in the genital area. Both herpes simplex types 1 and 2 are capable of causing systemic disease including encephalitis (infection of the brain) in someone who is immunodeficient. The treatment of most infections with herpes simplex infections is by topical or oral anti-viral medication, although intravenous therapy is required to treat infections of the brain (encephalitis)."
Herpes Simplex Type 1 (HSV-1),"Herpes simplex type 1 is a herpes virus that causes cold sores and fever blisters in and around the mouth. In rare cases, when someone's immune system is severely compromised, this virus can cause infection of the brain (encephalitis), requiring intravenous therapy. Herpes simplex type 1 is also known as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1)."
Herpes zoster,"Herpes zoster: Also called shingles, zona, and zoster. The culprit is the varicella-zoster virus. Primary infection with this virus causes chickenpox (varicella). At this time the virus infects nerves (namely, the dorsal root ganglia) where it remains latent (lies low) for years. It can then be reactivated to cause shingles with blisters over the distribution of the affected nerve accompanied by often intense pain and itching. Herpes zoster is more frequent with increasing age. Vaccination against Herpes zoster is recommended for all adults age 60 and older to prevent or decrease the severity of future episodes of this painful condition."
Hetero-,"Hetero-: Prefix meaning different, as in heteromorphism (something that is different in form) and heterozygous (possessing two different forms of a particular gene). The opposite of hetero- is homo-."
Heterotopic,"Heterotopic: In the wrong place, in an abnormal place, misplaced. From the Greek roots ""hetero-"" meaning ""other"" + ""topos"" meaning ""place"" = other place. For example, heterotopic bone formation is the formation of bone where it is not normally found, as in muscle."
Hexadactyly,"Hexadactyly: The presence of an extra digit, a sixth finger or toe, which is a very common congenital malformation (birth defect). This condition is called hexadactyly. The word hexadactyly literally means six digits. In medical usage, hexadactyly does not specify whether the six digits are fingers or toes (although in Greek ""dactylos"" is without equivocation a finger). The 6th digit can be located in three different locations: on either side of the extremity or somewhere in between. With the hand for example, the extra finger can be out beyond the little finger (which is called ulnar hexadactyly) or out beyond the thumb (radial hexadacyly) or, finally, between two of the normally expected fingers (intercalary hexadactyly). Far and away the most frequent form of hexadactyly is ulnar (postaxial) hexadactyly. Next comes radial (preaxial) hexadactyly. And far and away the rarest form of hexadactyly is intercalary hexadactyly. Hexadactyly in itself can be innocuous, absolutely harmless and very easily remedied, when the hexadactyly is an isolated finding and the baby is otherwise entirely normal. Ulnar hexadactyly with just a rudimentary tag of a sixth digit, for instance, can be very simply treated by tying it off with one suture. However, hexadactyly can also be one of a number of congenital malformations affecting the baby. In this case, treatment may not be so simple and the prognostic outlook may not be as good. Hexadactyly can be seen on some prenatal ultrasound scans. To present a real case, an ultrasound scan showed ""a rudimentary 6th digit on both hands."" A more detailed ultrasound confirmed ""a 6th digit on ulnar side of each hand"" and showed that 6th digit ""is small and just a floppy skin tag."" No other morphological (physical) abnormalities of the fetus were visible. Another ultrasound with even greater resolution revealed ""a rudimentary digit/skin tag on the palmar surface of the hand lying between the 4th and 5th digits."" Again, no abnormality was seen elsewhere on the baby. The differential diagnostic list of disorders causing hexadactyly is pretty long. But many were excluded by the absence of other malformations. It also seemed a particular type of hexadactyly. If it were an intercalated extra digit (with the extra finger situated between the other fingers), the list would be much smaller and only a very few entities such as the Pallister-Hall syndrome and Greig syndrome (but there would usually be other things to see in either of these 2 syndromes). The final diagnosis in this case has not yet been made. We have present the case to convey the quandary that can occur when hexadactyly is discovered antenatally (before birth) today. Hexadactyly is the most frequent form of polydactyly, a diagnosis that encompasses all cases of extra digits, irrespective of the number of extra digits in a particular case."
Hg,"Hg: Symbol for the metallic element mercury. The abbreviation ""mm Hg"" means millimeters of mercury, the height of a column of mercury, as in a blood pressure reading. Mercury is poisonous to people. See Mercury poisoning."
HGD,"HGD: The gene encoding an enzyme called homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (also known as homogentisate oxidase). HGD is located on chromosome 3 in region 3q21-q23. Homogentisate oxidase is active chiefly in the liver and kidneys. It is needed to break down the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Previous steps convert these two amino acids into a molecule called homogentisic acid. Homogentisate oxidase adds two oxygen atoms to homogentisic acid, converting it to another molecule called maleylacetoacetate. Other enzymes break down maleylacetoacetate into smaller molecules that are later used for energy or to make other products that can be used by the body. More than 40 mutations in the HGD gene have been identified in people with alkaptonuria. Many of these mutations change single amino acids in the homogentisate oxidase protein. For example, a substitution of the amino acid valine for methionine at position 368 (also written as Met368Val) is the most common HGD mutation in European populations. Mutations in the HGD gene probably inactivate the enzyme by changing its structure. Without active homogentisate oxidase, homogentisic acid builds up in the body. It is deposited in connective tissues such as cartilage and skin, causing them to darken and leading to arthritis. Homogentisic acid is also present in urine, causing the urine to turn black when exposed to air."
Hiatal,"Hiatal: Pertaining to an hiatus, an opening. An hiatal hernia occurs when a part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm at the opening where the esophagus normally passes through the diaphragm. ""Hiatus"" in Latin means an opening."
Hiatus,"Hiatus: An opening, as in the diaphragm. When there is an unusually wide opening in the diaphragm, there can be a hiatus (or hiatal) hernia. In Latin an hiatus is ""an opening, gaping mouth, or chasm."" It is derived from the verb ""hiare"" meaning ""to gape or yawn."" Therefore, a ""hiatus"" is a gaping opening in anything, such as the opening in a cliff leading into a cave or a break in the conversation in which nothing happens or is said."
Hiccough,"Hiccough: Hiccups happen when the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, suddenly contracts. When that happens, air is taken in, and then the voice box closes shut, which is what causes the ""hic"" sound. There are different types of hiccups, named after how long they last: A ""regular"" bout of hiccups can last up to 48 hours ""Persistent hiccups"" last longer than 48 hours and up to a month ""Intractable hiccups"" last longer than a month In most cases, hiccups go away on their own with no lasting effects. But in some people, they can last a long time and lead to problems such as poor nutrition, tiredness, and reduced appetite. Alternative terms for ""hiccough"" and ""hiccups"" include: ""hickup"" and ""singultus""."
Hiccups,"Hiccups: A hiccup is an extraordinary type of respiratory movement involving a sudden inspiration (intake of air) due to an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm accompanied by closure of the glottis (the vocal apparatus of the larynx). The abrupt inspiration is the result of a sudden contraction of the diaphragm. Closure of the glottis then halts the incoming air. The column of air strikes the closed glottis to produce the characteristic sound: a hiccup. Hiccups are often rhythmic. They are usually just a minor nuisance, but prolonged hiccups can become a major medical problem. The word ""hiccup"" was in use by 1530. It is an instance of onomatopoeia, the imitation of natural sounds by words. Alternative forms of ""hiccups"" include ""hiccough"" and ""hickup."""
High altitude,"High altitude: Altitude sickness occurs at high altitude. So what is high altitude? Altitude is defined on the following scale: Most people can go up to 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) with minimal effects. If you have been at that altitude before and had no problems, you can probably return to that altitude without problems if (and only if) you are properly acclimatized. If you have not been to high altitude before, caution is strongly recommended. No specific factors such as age, sex, or physical condition are known to correlate with the susceptibility to altitude sickness although there is a decreased incidence among those 50 to 60 years or older and women may be at a slightly higher risk than men. Some people are simply more susceptible than others. There is no telling, so caution is the better part of wisdom."
High blood pressure,"High blood pressure: A repeatedly elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90 mmHg. Chronic high blood pressure can stealthily cause blood vessel changes in the back of the eye (retina), abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, kidney failure, and brain damage. No specific cause for high blood pressure is found in 95 percent of patients. Treatment for high blood pressure involves dietary changes, regular aerobic exercise, and medication. There are many types of medications used to treat high blood pressure including diuretics, beta-blockers, blood vessel dilators, and others. Also known as hypertension."
High blood sugar,"High blood sugar: An elevated level of the sugar glucose in the blood. Also called hyperglycemia. High blood sugar is a finding in a number of conditions, most notably diabetes mellitus. Elevated blood glucose leads to spillage of glucose into the urine (glucosuria) so that the urine is sugary. (The term diabetes mellitus means ""sweet urine."") Aside from diabetes, the many other causes of high blood sugar include just eating more sugar (or food) than usual, the presence of an infection or another illness, an injury and the stress of surgery. High blood sugar may produce few or no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they may be dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, urination during the night, blurry vision, fatigue or drowsiness, weight loss, or increased appetite. An elevated level of blood sugar may be a useful independent indicator of heart disease risk. The risk of dying from heart disease has been found to rise as the level of blood glucose increases (regardless of age, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking status)."
High protein diet,"High protein diet: A high protein diet is a type of weight loss plan that emphasizes consumption of high-protein-containing foods. There are many different kinds of high protein diets. Many high protein diets may be risky for overall health because they stress the consumption of meats and high protein foods containing saturated fat and a high percentage of overall fat. According to the American Heart Association guidelines, adults who are trying to lose weight and keep it off should eat no more than 30 percent of total daily calories from fat and less than 7 percent from saturated fat, which is difficult or impossible with many high protein diets. High protein diets may also restrict intake of important carbohydrates and low-fat dairy products."
Hip pain,"Hip pain: Hip pain is the sensation of discomfort in or around the hip joint, where the upper end (head) of the thigh bone (femur) fits into the socket of the hip bone. Hip pain has a number of causes, most of which are related to degeneration, injury, or inflammation of the muscles, bones, joints, and tendons located in the hip area. Common causes of hip pain include arthritis, bursitis, bone fracture, muscle spasms, and strains. Hip pain can also result from disorders causing pain radiating from the spine and back, such as sciatica and herniated discs. A theory of hip pain that turns into arthritis of the hip is femoral acetabular impingement disorder. The condition is theorized to cause hip pain in early stages of arthritis."
HIPAA,"HIPAA: Acronym that stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a US law designed to provide privacy standards to protect patients' medical records and other health information provided to health plans, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, these new standards provide patients with access to their medical records and more control over how their personal health information is used and disclosed. They represent a uniform, federal floor of privacy protections for consumers across the country. State laws providing additional protections to consumers are not affected by this new rule. HIPAA took effect on April 14, 2003."
Hippocrates,"Hippocrates: (c.460-377BC) Great Greek physician on the Mediterranean island of Cos, who founded a medical school there, and is regarded as the ""Father of Medicine."" That is the standard view of Hippocrates. But, in truth, virtually nothing is known of the first physician named Hippocrates. There are considered to have been several by that name, all of them teachers at the famous medical school on the island of Cos. It was in the 5th century BCE, however, that Hippocrates' name and image began to emerge as a leader in medical research and thought. Hippocrates is generally credited with turning away from divine notions of medicine and using observation of the body as a basis for medical knowledge. Prayers and sacrifices to the gods did not hold a central place in his theories, but changes in diet, beneficial drugs, and keeping the body ""in balance"" were the key. Central to his physiology and ideas on illness was the humoral theory of health, whereby the four bodily fluids, or humors, of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile needed to be kept in balance. Illness was caused when these fluids became out of balance, sometimes requiring the reduction in the body of a humor through bloodletting or purging. The Hippocratic Corpus, or the collected writings attributed to Hippocrates, contains about sixty works on a variety of medical topics, including diagnosis, epidemics, obstetrics, pediatrics, nutrition, and surgery. There are assumed to be several authors, however, probably scattered over several centuries, and different treatises often give contradictory advice. Hippocrates' followers wrote over 60 medical books on a broad range of medical topics (including diseases, gynecology, and head wounds). As to the Hippocratic Oath, little is known about who wrote it or first used it, but it appears to be more strongly influenced by followers of Pythagoras than Hippocrates and is often estimated to have been written in the 4th century BCE. Over the centuries, it has been rewritten often in order to suit the values of different cultures influenced by Greek medicine. See Hippocratic Oath."
Hippocratic Oath,"Hippocratic Oath: One of the oldest binding documents in history, the Oath written by Hippocrates is still held sacred by physicians: to treat the ill to the best of one's ability, to preserve a patient's privacy, to teach the secrets of medicine to the next generation, and so on. There are many versions of the Hippocratic Oath. We here present two versions. First, the ""classic"" version (or more precisely, one translation of the original oath). And then, following it, is presented one of the fine ""modern"" versions of the Hippocratic Oath. Classic Version of the Hippocratic Oath I swear by Apollo Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfil according to my ability and judgment this oath and this covenant: To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art - if they desire to learn it - without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law, but no one else. I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work. Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves. What I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself, holding such things shameful to be spoken about. If I fulfil this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honored with fame among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot. A Modern Version of the Hippocratic Oath I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. I will not be ashamed to say ""I know not,"" nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help. The classical version of the Hippocratic Oath is from the translation from the Greek by Ludwig Edelstein. From The Hippocratic Oath: Text, Translation, and Interpretation, by Ludwig Edelstein. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1943. The modern version of the Hippocratic Oath was written in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University."
Hippophobia,"Hippophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of horses. Sufferers of this fear experience undue anxiety even when a horse is known to be gentle and well trained. They usually avoid horses entirely rather than risk being kicked, bitten or thrown. They may also fear other hoofed animals such as ponies, donkeys and mules. This type of phobia may be triggered by a fall from a horse (which is probably why it is said that, after a fall from a horse, one should get right back on). ""Hippophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""hippos"" (horse) and ""phobos"" fear. ""Hippos"" has given us the English word ""hippodrome,"" the oval-shaped racecourses in ancient Greece and Rome where horse and chariot races took place. ""Hippodrome"" can also refer to any building or arena of the present or past designed for circuses, games and other entertainments. An alternate name for fear of horses is ""equinophobia,"" a hybrid word (one that is composed of roots from different languages). It is derived from the Latin ""equus"" (horse) and Greek ""phobos"" (fear). ""Equus"" also gives us the English words ""equoid"" and ""equine"" (resembling a horse). Talipes equinovarus is the common form of clubfoot in which the heel is elevated (like a horse's) and turned inward."
Hirsutism,Hirsutism: Having excessive facial and bodily hair. Hirsutism can be a side effect of certain medications (such as prednisone) or reflect an underlying hormonal imbalance.
His,His: Histidine. See also: Amino acid symbols.
His disease,"His disease: This is a parasite (louse-borne) disease that was first recognized in the trenches of World War I and so was called trench fever. It is estimated to have affected more than a million people in Russia and on the war fronts in Europe. Trench fever was again a major problem in the military in World War II and is seen endemically in Mexico, Africa, E. Europe, and elsewhere. Urban trench fever occurs among the homeless people and people with alcoholism today. Outbreaks have been documented, for example, in Seattle, Baltimore (among injection-drug users), Marseilles (France) and Burundi. The cause of trench fever is Bartonella quintana (also called Rochalimaea quintana), an unusual rickettsial organism that multiplies in the gut of the body louse. Transmission of the rickettsia to people can occur by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded (scuffed) skin or into the conjunctivae (whites of the eyes). The disease is classically a 5-day fever. The onset of symptoms is sudden with high fever, severe headache, back pain and leg pain and a fleeting rash. Recovery takes a month or more. Relapses are common. It is now clear, that at least in its urban form among the homeless, trench fever can be associated with nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms (New England Journal of Medicine 340: 184-189, 1999). The organism (B. quintana) that causes trench fever also has been found responsible for a disease called bacillary angiomatosis in people infected with HIV and for infection of the heart and great vessels (endocarditis) with bloodstream infection. Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever, shin bone fever, quintan fever, five-day fever, Meuse fever, His disease, Werner-His disease. His disease is named for the Swiss physician Wilhelm His, Jr. (who also described the bundle of His in the heart) and the German physician Heinrich Werner (who was not the Werner who described Werner's syndrome)."
Histamine,"Histamine: A substance that plays a major role in many allergic reactions, dilating blood vessels and making the vessel walls abnormally permeable. Histamine is part of the body's natural allergic response to substances such as pollens. Antihistamines work by preventing the release of histamine from certain cells (mast cells) thereby blocking the allergic reaction."
Histiocyte,"Histiocyte: A type of white blood cell, also called a macrophage, that is created by the bone marrow. They usually stay in place, but when histiocytes are stimulated by infection or inflammation they become active, attacking bacteria and other foreign matter in the body. See also histiocytosis."
Histo-,"Histo-: Tissue. As in histocompatible (tissue compatible) and histology (the study of tissues, especially under the microscope)."
Histology,"Histology: The study of the form of structures seen under the microscope (light, electron, infrared ). Also called microscopic anatomy, as opposed to gross anatomy which involves structures that can be observed with the naked eye. The word ""anatomy"" comes from the Greek ana- meaning up or through + tome meaning a cutting. Anatomy was once a ""cutting up"" because the structure of the body was originally learned through dissecting it. The word ""histology"" came from the Greek ""histo-"" meaning tissue + ""logos"", treatise."
"History, developmental","History, developmental: An account of how and when a person met developmental milestones, such as walking and talking. For adults, information on social-emotional development may be included. Used primarily in the diagnosis of developmental disorders."
"History, social","History, social: An account of a patient that puts his or her illness or behavior in context. A social history may include aspects of the patient's developmental, family, and medical history, as well as relevant information about life events, social class, race, religion, and occupation."
HIV,"HIV: Acronym for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the cause of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV has also been called the human lymphotropic virus type III, the lymphadenopathy-associated virus and the lymphadenopathy virus. No matter what name is applied, it is a retrovirus. (A retrovirus has an RNA genome and a reverse transcriptase enzyme. Using the reverse transcriptase, the virus uses its RNA as a template for making complementary DNA which can integrate into the DNA of the host organism). Although the American research Robert Gallo at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) believed he was the first to find HIV, it is now generally accepted that the French physician Luc Montagnier (1932-) and his team at the Pasteur Institute discovered HIV in 1983-84."
Hives,"Hives: A raised, itchy area of skin that may be a sign of an allergic reaction. It can be rounded or flat-topped but is always elevated above the surrounding skin. It reflects circumscribed dermal edema (local swelling of the skin). The hives are usually well circumscribed but may be coalescent and will blanch with pressure. A single spot is almost always gone by 24 hours but the process may stay for weeks to months. Approximately 20% of the population has experienced a bout of hives. The hives are also called urticaria."
HNP,HNP: Human neutrophil peptide.
Hoarseness,"Hoarseness: Hoarseness is a term referring to abnormal voice changes. Hoarseness may be manifested as a voice that sounds breathy, strained, rough, raspy, or a voice that has higher or lower pitch. There are many causes of hoarseness, including viral laryngitis, vocal cord nodules, laryngeal papillomas, gastroesophageal reflux-related laryngitis, and environmental irritants (such as tobacco smoking). An accumulation of fluid in the vocal cords associated with hoarseness has been termed Reinke's edema. Reinke's edema may occur as a result of cigarette smoking or voice abuse (prolonged or extended talking or shouting). Rarely, hoarseness results from serious conditions such as cancers of the head and neck region."
Holoprosencephaly,"Holoprosencephaly: This relatively common birth defect of the brain, often also affects facial features, causing closely spaced eyes, small head size, and sometimes clefts of the lip and roof of the mouth. Not all individuals with holoprosencephaly (HPE) are affected to the same degree, even in families where more than one individual has this predisposition. The risk of reoccurrence is small in most families. The best diagnostic procedure is a brain scan (CT or MRI). There are a number of causes of HPE, including genetic alterations and environmental effects. HPE's cause in any individual family may be unknown. Holoprosencephaly is characterized by the failure of the prosencephalon (the forebrain of the embryo) to develop. During normal development, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of pregnancy. Holoprosencephaly is caused by a failure of the embryo's forebrain to divide to form bilateral cerebral hemispheres (the left and right halves of the brain), causing developmental defects of the face and in brain structure. Holoprosencephaly has three classifications. Alobar holoprosencephaly is the most serious form because the brain fails to separate and is usually associated with severe facial anomalies. Semilobar holoprosencephaly shows the brain's hemispheres have a slight tendency to separate and is a more intermediate form. Lobar holoprosencephaly, in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain hemispheres, is the least severe form. In some cases of lobar holoprosencephaly, the patient's brain may be nearly normal. Holoprosencephaly, once called arhinencephaly, consists of a spectrum of defects or malformations of the brain and face. At the most severe end of this spectrum are cases involving serious brain malformations, some so severe that they are incompatible with life and often cause spontaneous intrauterine death. At the other end of the spectrum are individuals with facial defects - which may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip - and normal or near-normal brain development. Seizures and mental retardation may occur. The most severe of the facial defects (or anomalies) is cyclopia, an abnormality characterized by the development of a single eye, located in the area normally occupied by the root of the nose, and a missing nose or a nose in the form of a proboscis (a tubular appendage) located above the eye. Ethmocephaly is the least common facial anomaly. It consists of a proboscis separating narrow-set eyes with an absent nose and microphthalmia (abnormal smallness of one or both eyes). Cebocephaly, another facial anomaly, is characterized by a small, flattened nose with a single nostril situated below incomplete or underdeveloped closely set eyes. The least severe in the spectrum of facial anomalies is the median cleft lip, also called premaxillary agenesis. Approximately one-half of all cases of holoprosencephaly have a chromosomal cause. Trisomy 13 (Patau) syndrome and trisomy 18 (Edwards) syndrome are associated with holoprosencephaly. There is an increased risk for holoprosencephaly in infants born to diabetic mothers. There is no treatment for holoprosencephaly and the prognosis for individuals with the disorder is poor. Most of those who survive show no significant developmental gains. For children who survive, treatment is symptomatic."
Homeostasis,"Homeostasis: A property of cells, tissues, and organisms that allows the maintenance and regulation of the stability and constancy needed to function properly. Homeostasis is a healthy state that is maintained by the constant adjustment of biochemical and physiological pathways. An example of homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant blood pressure in the human body through a series of fine adjustments in the normal range of function of the hormonal, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular systems. These adjustments allow the maintenance of blood pressure needed for body function despite environmental changes and changes in a person's activity level and position. Other homeostatic mechanisms, for example, permit the maintenance of body temperature within a narrow range."
Homeotherm,"Homeotherm: A homeotherm is a warm-blooded animal (such as homo sapiens). Another term for us warm-blooded creatures is endotherm. Those of us who are homeotherms or endotherms are as opposed to a poikilotherm (an organism such as a frog that is cold-blooded) and a stenotherm (a creature that can only survive only within a very narrow temperature range). Homeotherm is all Greek. The ""homeo-"" comes from the Greek ""homo"" meaning ""the same"" + ""-therm"" comes from the Greek ""therme"" meaning ""heat"" = the same heat."
Homo sapiens,Homo sapiens: The primate species of mammal to which modern humans belong. Homo sapiens is Latin for knowing man or wise man.
Homo-,"Homo-: Prefix meaning same, as in homology (similarity in DNA or protein sequences between individuals or between species) and homosexual (a person who is sexually attracted to persons of the same sex). The opposite of homo- is hetero-."
Homocysteine,"Homocysteine: An amino acid that is produced by the human body, usually as a byproduct of consuming meat. Homocysteine is normally converted into other amino acids. An abnormal accumulation of homocysteine, which can be measured in the blood, can be a marker for the development of heart disease. Elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood appear to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and venous thrombo'embolism (blood clots in the veins). Homocysteine is believed to damage blood vessels in several ways. It injures the cells that line arteries and stimulates the growth of smooth muscle cells. Homocysteine can also disrupt normal blood clotting mechanisms. Elevated levels of homocysteine also appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The ways to lower homocysteine are to eat less meat and take supplements of the B vitamins folic acid (folate), B6, and B12 that are needed by the enzymes that process homocysteine."
Homosexual,"Homosexual: A person sexually attracted to persons of the same sex. Homosexuals include males (gays) and females (lesbians). The term ""homosexual"" can also be an adjective."
Hookworm,"Hookworm: An intestinal parasite that usually causes diarrhea or cramps. Heavy infestation with hookworm can be serious for newborns, children, pregnant women, and persons who are malnourished. Hookworm infections occur mainly in tropical and subtropical climates and affect about 1 billion people -- about one-fifth of the world's population. One of the most common species of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, is found in southern Europe, northern Africa, northern Asia, and parts of South America. A second species, Necator americanus, was once widespread in the southeastern US early in the 20th century. Hookworms have a complex life cycle that begins and ends in the small intestine. Hookworm eggs require warm, moist, shaded soil to hatch into larvae. These barely visible larvae penetrate the skin (often through bare feet), are carried to the lungs, go through the respiratory tract to the mouth, are swallowed, and eventually reach the small intestine. This journey takes about a week. In the small intestine, the larvae develop into half-inch-long worms, attach themselves to the intestinal wall, and suck blood. The adult worms produce thousands of eggs. These eggs are passed in the feces (stool). If the eggs contaminate soil and conditions are right, they will hatch, molt, and develop into infective larvae again after 5 to 10 days. Hookworm infection is contracted from contact with soil contaminated by hookworm, by walking barefoot or accidentally swallowing contaminated soil. Children -- because they play in dirt and often go barefoot -- are at high risk. Since transmission of hookworm infection requires development of the larvae in soil, hookworm cannot be spread person to person. Chronic heavy hookworm infection can damage the growth and development of children. The loss of iron and protein retards growth and mental development, sometimes irreversibly. The first signs of hookworm infection are itching and a rash at the site where the larvae penetrate the skin. These signs may be followed by abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite and weight loss, and anemia. Hookworm can also cause difficulty breathing, enlargement of the heart, and irregular heartbeat. Hookworm infection have been known to be fatal, particularly in infants. The diagnosis is by identifying hookworm eggs in a stool sample. In countries where hookworm is common and reinfection is likely, light infections are often not treated. In the US, hookworm infections are generally treated for 1-3 days. The drugs are effective and appear to have few side effects. Another stool exam should be repeated 1 to 2 weeks after therapy. If the infection is still present, treatment is repeated. Iron supplements are in order with anemia. People infected with hookworm are half as likely to have asthma as those without it, in keeping with the hygiene hypothesis of asthma -- the theory that because of better hygiene, people today tend to get fewer infections so they are at greater risk of allergic conditions such as asthma. To prevent hookworm, do not walk barefoot or contact the soil with bare hands in areas where hookworm is common or there are likely to be feces in the soil or sand."
Hormone,"Hormone: A chemical substance produced in the body that controls and regulates the activity of certain cells or organs. Many hormones are secreted by special glands, such as thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Hormones are essential for every activity of life, including the processes of digestion, metabolism, growth, reproduction, and mood control. Many hormones, such as neurotransmitters, are active in more than one physical process."
Horripilation,"Horripilation: Also known as Cutis anserina, a temporary local change in the?skin when it becomes rougher due to erection of little muscles, as from?cold, fear, or excitement. The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as cold or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of little muscles called the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps."
Horror autotoxicus,"Horror autotoxicus: Literally, the horror of self-toxicity. A term coined by the great German bacteriologist and immunologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) to describe the body's innate aversion to immunological self-destruction. However, as we now know, the immune system can upon occasion attack itself and does so in the autoimmune disorders."
Hospice care,"Hospice care: Care designed to give supportive care to people in the final phase of a terminal illness and focus on comfort and quality of life, rather than cure. The goal is to enable patients to be comfortable and free of pain, so that they live each day as fully as possible. Aggressive methods of pain control may be used. Hospice programs generally are home-based, but they sometimes provide services away from home -- in freestanding facilities, in nursing homes, or within hospitals. The philosophy of hospice is to provide support for the patient's emotional, social, and spiritual needs as well as medical symptoms as part of treating the whole person. Hospice programs generally use a multidisciplinary team approach, including the services of a nurse, doctor, social worker and clergy in providing care. Additional services provided include drugs to control pain and manage other symptoms; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; medical supplies and equipment; medical social services; dietary and other counseling; continuous home care at times of crisis; and bereavement services. Although hospice care does not aim for cure of the terminal illness, it may treat potentially curable conditions such as pneumonia and bladder infections, with brief hospital stays if necessary. Hospice programs also offer respite care workers, people who are usually trained volunteers, who take over the patient's care so that the family or other primary caregivers can leave the house for a few hours. Volunteer care is part of hospice philosophy. The word ""hospice"" comes from the Latin ""hospitium"" meaning guesthouse. It was originally described a place of shelter for weary and sick travelers returning from religious pilgrimages. During the 1960's, Dr. Cicely Saunders began the modern hospice movement by establishing St. Christopher's Hospice near London. St. Christopher's organized a team approach to professional caregiving, and was the first program to use modern pain management techniques to compassionately care for the dying. The first hospice in the United States was established in New Haven, Connecticut in 1974."
Host,"Host: 1. The organism from which a parasite obtains its nutrition and/or shelter.
2. An organism or cell culture in which a virus can replicate itself.
3. The transplant recipient of a tissue or organ graft."
Hot flashes,"Hot flashes: A sudden wave of mild or intense body heat caused by rushes of hormonal changes resulting from decreased levels of estrogen. Hot flashes can occur at any time and may last from a few seconds to a half-hour. They are due to blood vessel opening and constricting and a symptom of menopause. Hot flashes are episodes that are experienced by many, but not all, women undergoing menopause. A hot flash is a feeling of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing that spreads over the body and sometimes followed by perspiration. Menstruating women in their 40's may have hot flashes, and hot flashes may last for a decade or more in some women. There is no way to predict when they will cease in a given woman. They decrease in frequency over time. The cause of hot flashes is not completely understood. Hot flashes may have more to do with fluctuation of hormone levels as opposed to low hormone levels per se. Hot flashes can be treated with either oral (by mouth) or transdermal (patch) forms of estrogen. Both oral and transdermal estrogen therapies are available either as estrogen alone, or as estrogen combined with progesterone. All available prescription estrogen replacement therapies, whether oral or transdermal, are effective in reducing hot flash frequency and severity. Generally, available treatments decrease hot flash frequency by about 80-90%."
ficer,"House officer: A resident physician and surgeon of a hospital (the ""house"") who is receiving further training, usually in a medical or surgical specialty, while caring for patients under the direction of an attending physician."
House staff,House staff: The resident physicians of a hospital who care for patients under the direction of the attending staff. House in this context refers to the hospital.
House surgeon,"House surgeon: Literally, a surgeon in the house, the house being the hospital. The meaning of the term house surgeon varies significantly from country to country. For example,"
HPS,"HPS: 1. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
2. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome."
HRT (hormone replacement therapy),"HRT (hormone replacement therapy): The combination therapy of estrogen plus a progestogen. Formerly, known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and now known as hormone therapy (HT).?Estrogen therapy (ET) is used to treat the symptoms of??menopause. It reduces or stops the short-term changes of menopause such as?hot flashes, disturbed??sleep, and?vaginal dryness. Estrogen therapy can prevent?osteoporosis, a consequence of lowered estrogen levels. Vaginal estrogen therapy products help with vaginal dryness, more severe vaginal changes, and bladder effects but, since very little vaginal estrogen enters the circulation, it may not help with hot flashes or prevent osteoporosis.? The use of unopposed estrogen therapy (ET alone) is associated with an increase in the risk of endometrial?cancer?(cancer of the lining of the uterus). However, by taking the hormone progestogen along with estrogen, the risk of endometrial cancer is reduced substantially. Progestogen protects the uterus by keeping the lining of the wall of the uterus (endometrium) from thickening (an effect caused by estrogen). Hormone therapy may be associated with certain health risks. Specifically, postmenopausal women taking combination estrogen-progestin have a small but definite increased risk for developing?heart disease,?breast cancer,?stroke, and?blood clots?when compared with women not taking hormone therapy. The risks for women taking estrogen therapy alone without progesterone include an increased risk for stroke and blood clots. While long-term hormone therapy is no longer recommended, hormone therapy may still play a role in the treatment of severe menopausal symptoms, particularly in younger women. The healthcare provider can help to weigh the risks and benefits of estrogen therapy or hormone therapy on a case-by-case basis."
HS,"HS: Hereditary spherocytosis. HS also stands for half-strength, hamstrings, heart sounds, heparan sulfate, hernia sac, and house surgeon."
HSA,"HSA: 1. In the US, Health Saving Account.
2. Human serum albumin."
Ht,HT: Hormone therapy.
Human chorionic gonadotropin,"Human chorionic gonadotropin: (hCG) A human hormone made by chorionic cells in the fetal part of the placenta. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is directed at the gonads and stimulates them. Hence, the name ""gonadotropin."" The presence of hCG is detectable by immunologic means within days of fertilization and forms the foundation of the common pregnancy tests. The level of hCG tends to be higher with a female fetus soon after conception. The level of hCG in maternal serum also enters as one component in the ""double"" and the ""triple"" screening tests used during pregnancy to assign risks of Down syndrome and other fetal disorders."
Human chromosome count,"Human chromosome count: The usual number of chromosomes in humans, 46 chromosomes. Also called the human chromosome complement. History: For half a century, the human chromosome count was widely believed to be 48. That changed on Dec. 22, 1955. On that day at the Institute of Genetics of the University of Lund in Sweden, a visiting scientist named Joe Hin Tjio (pronounced CHEE-oh) used what was then a new technique to study the chromosomes of cells on a glass microscope slide. The technique employed the drug colchicine and a dilute salt solution. Colchicine froze the cells at a point during division when the chromosomes had separated into clearly visible bodies. The dilute salt solution (hypotonic saline) spread the chromosomes so they could be seen separately from one another. Tjio succeeded in obtaining a clear picture of the human chromosome complement on a photomicrograph (a photograph taken through a microscope) of a human embryonic lung cell. Much to his amazement, Tjio discovered that the cell had 46 chromosomes. ""The number was just an incidental finding, like serendipity,"" he recounted. ""I was just surprised that it was not 48, as they had thought for so many years."" Tjio published his discovery together with Dr. Albert Levan a month later in the Scandinavian genetics journal Hereditas. Levan, who was the director of the Institute of Genetics, traditionally listed himself as the first author on any publication based on work done in his laboratory. But Levan had been on vacation when Tjio made his discovery. Tjio said ""I told him, 'No.' I wouldn't allow him to be first author. I said, 'If you want to be the author, you do the work.'"" Levan acquiesced. The now-classic citation is: Tjio TH, Levan A. The chromosome number of man. Hereditas 1956;42:1. Joe Hin Tjio (1919-2001) was born to Chinese parents in Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies, in 1919. After World War II, Tjio did cytogenetic research in the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. He came to the United States in 1958 and in 1959 joined the staff of the NIH where he spent the balance of his long career. Based on obituaries of Dr. Tjio by Bart Barnes in The Washington Post (Dec. 4, 2001) and by Wolfgang Saxon in The New York Times (Dec. 7, 2001) and on personal recollections."
Humidifier,"Humidifier: A machine that puts moisture into the air. Humidified air makes it easier to breathe for persons with certain conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, Sjogren's syndrome, and others."
Humidifier fever,"Humidifier fever: A form of sick building syndrome that usually develops on Monday or the first workday of the week. The hallmark of the disease is the sudden onset of fever. Other features may include muscle aches and pains and mild shortness of breath. Humidifier fever can be caused by a number of different agents including amebas, bacteria, and fungi that may live in the moist environment of a humidifier. Humidifier fever typically resolves once the patient is no longer exposed to the causative agent coming from the humidifier."
Humor,"Humor: In medicine, a fluid or semifluid substance. For example, the aqueous humor is the fluid normally present in the anterior chamber of the eye, between the cornea and the iris."
Humoralism,"Humoralism: An ancient theory holding that health came from balance between the bodily liquids termed humors. Disease was thought to arise when imbalance occurred between the humors. The humors were phlegm (water), blood, gall (black bile, thought to be secreted by the kidneys and spleen), and choler (yellow bile secreted by the liver). The humoral theory was devised well before Hippocrates, and it was not definitively demolished until 1858. The word humor lives on as a medical term for liquid or semiliquid substances in the body and as a euphemism for mood (such as being 'in good humor'). Also known as humorism."
Humorism,"Humorism: In medicine, humor refers to a fluid (or semifluid) substance. Thus, the aqueous humor is the fluid normally present in the front and rear chambers of the eye. The humors were part of an ancient theory that held that health came from balance between the bodily liquids. These liquids were termed humors. Disease arose when imbalance occurred between the humors. The humors were: The humoral theory (also called humoralism was devised well before Hippocrates (c.460-c.375 BC). It was not definitively demolished until Rudolf Virchow published his formative book, Cellularpathologie, in 1858 that laid out the cellular basis of pathology. Pathology now rests on a cellular and molecular foundation. The humors have been dispelled, except for the aqueous humor (and its ilk)."
Huntington disease,"Huntington disease: An hereditary disorder with mental and physical deterioration leading to death. Although characterized as an ""adult-onset"" disease, it can affect children as well. Huntington disease describes an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with high penetrance (a high proportion of persons with the gene develop the disease). The characteristic findings of Huntington disease are caused by loss of neurons (nerve cells) in the brain. The disease is due a gene in chromosome band 4p16.3. The gene, called HD, contains an unstable repeating sequence of 3 nucleotide bases (CAG) in the DNA. Normal people have an average of 19 CAG repeats and at most 34 such repeats while virtually all patients with Huntington disease have more than 40. The Huntington disease gene codes for a protein that has been named (confusingly) huntingtin whose function is unknown. The elevated numbers of CAG repeats in the Huntington disease gene lead to the production of an elongated huntingtin protein which appears to correlate with the loss of neurons in the disease. Mood disturbance is usually the first symptom seen, with bipolar disorder-like mood swings that may include mania, depression, extreme irritability or angry outbursts, and psychosis. Other symptoms include chorea (restless, wiggling, turning movements), muscle stiffness and slowness of movement, and difficulties with memory and other cognitive processes. The HD gene is located on chromosome 4, and is an autosomal dominant gene. Only one copy need be inherited to cause the illness. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, and family members of people with Huntington's disease may also want to know if they carry the HD gene. At this time, there is no cure for HD, although medication may be used to control symptoms of the illness, such as mood swings and chorea."
Hyaline membrane disease,"Hyaline membrane disease: A respiratory disease of the newborn, especially the premature infant, in which a membrane composed of proteins and dead cells lines the alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lung), making gas exchange difficult or impossible. The word ""hyaline"" comes from the Greek word ""hyalos"" meaning ""glass or transparent stone such as crystal."" The membrane in hyaline membrane disease looks glassy. Hyaline membrane disease is now commonly called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It is caused by a deficiency of a molecule called surfactant. RDS almost always occurs in newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation. The more premature the baby is, the greater is the chance of developing RDS. RDS is more likely to occur in newborns of diabetic mothers. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, is secreted by lung cells. The air-fluid interface of the film of water lining the alveoli of the lung (where the exchange of oxygen and CO2 occurs) exerts large forces that cause the alveoli to close if surfactant is deficient. Lung compliance is decreased, and the work of inflating the stiff lungs is increased. The preterm newborn is further handicapped because his or her ribs are more easily deformed (compliant). Breathing efforts therefore result in deep sternal (breastbone) retractions but poor air entry if the ribs are compliant compared with the lungs. This results in diffuse atelectasis (collapse of the lungs). Rapid, labored, grunting respirations usually develop immediately or within a few hours after delivery, with retractions above and below the breastbone and flaring of the nostrils. The extent of atelectasis (lung collapse) and the severity of respiratory failure progressively worsen. Not all infants with RDS have signs of respiratory distress; extremely low birth weight newborns (i.e., < 1000 g) may be unable to initiate respirations at birth because their lungs are so stiff; they may fail to initiate breathing in the delivery room. The incidence of RDS can be reduced by assessment of fetal lung maturity to determine the optimal time for delivery. When a fetus must be delivered prematurely, giving betamethasone systemically to the mother for at least 24 hours before delivery induces fetal surfactant production and usually reduces the risk of RDS or decreases its severity. If untreated, severe RDS can result in multiple organ failure and death. However, if the newborn's ventilation is adequately supported, surfactant production will begin and RDS will resolve by 4 or 5 days. Recovery is hastened by treatment with pulmonary surfactant."
Hydatidiform mole,"Hydatidiform mole: A tumor that forms in the uterus as a mass of cysts resembling a bunch of grapes. Hydatidiform moles occur during the childbearing years, and they do not spread outside the uterus. However, a malignancy called choriocarcinoma may start from a hydatidiform mole. In its early stages, a hydatidiform mole may look like a normal pregnancy. Diagnosis is based on a history of lack of fetal movement, a pelvic examination, an ultrasound, and a blood test to look for high
levels of the hormone beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG in the blood of a woman who is not pregnant can be a sign of a hydatidiform mole. Treatment includes removal of the mole by dilation and curettage (D & C) and suction evacuation and surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy). Also known as a molar pregnancy."
Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo,"Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo: What is termed ""hydrocephalus ex-vacuo"" occurs when there is damage to the brain caused by stroke or injury, and there may be an actual shrinkage of brain substance. Although there is more CSF than usual, the CSF pressure itself is normal in hydrocephalus ex-vacuo. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. The fluid is most often under increased pressure and that pressure can compress and damage the brain. Hydrocephalus can arise before birth or any time afterward. It may be due to many causes including a birth defect, hemorrhage into the brain, infection, meningitis, tumor, or head injury. Most forms of hydrocephalus are the result of obstructed CSF flow in the ventricular system. With birth defects, physical obstruction of CSF flow in the ventricular system is usually the cause of the hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common companion of spina bifida (meningomyelocele). Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can occur due to a gradual blockage of the CSF drainage pathways in the brain. Although the ventricles enlarge, the pressure of the CSF remains within normal range. NPH is characterized by memory loss (dementia), balance disorder (ataxia), urinary incontinence and a general slowing of activity. In old age or persons with Alzheimer's disease, the entire brain may shrink and the CSF fills up the space created by the shrinkage. This is not due to hydrocephalus. The diagnostic signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus depend upon the age of the person: Treatment of hydrocephalus involves the insertion of a shunt to let the excess fluid exit and relieve the pressure on the brain. The shunt is a flexible, plastic tube with a one-way valve. The shunt is inserted into the ventricular system of the brain to divert the flow of CSF into another area of the body, where the CSF can drain and be absorbed into the bloodstream. The prognosis (outlook) with hydrocephalus depends the cause and the timing of the diagnosis and treatment. Many children treated for hydrocephalus are able to lead normal lives with few, if any, limitations. In some cases, cognitive impairments in language and non-language functions may occur. Problems with shunts such as infection or malfunction require revision of the shunt. The word ""hydrocephalus"" in Greek means ""watery head."""

Hydrophobia,"Hydrophobia: 1. Literally, an irrational fear of water, to drink or to swim in. Someone who is scared of the water is hydrophobic. 2. A term once commonly used for rabies because in the later stages of that disease, the animal (or person) has difficulty swallowing and so fears a drink of water. From hydro-, water + -phobia, fear."
Hydroxyapatite,"Hydroxyapatite: A major component and an essential ingredient of normal bone and teeth. Hydroxyapatite makes up bone mineral and the matrix of teeth. It is hydroxyapatite that gives bones and teeth their rigidity. Hydroxyapatite molecules can group together (crystalize) to form microscopic clumps. If these tiny crystals of hydroxyapatite are deposited by mistake in or around joints, they may cause inflammation of the joints and nearby tissues, such as tendons and ligaments, particularly causing rotator cuff problems in the shoulder. The inflammation caused by hydroxyapatite crystals has been referred to as hydroxyapatite crystal disease."
Hydroxyurea,"Hydroxyurea: A drug that inhibits the synthesis of DNA and so is classified as an antimetabolite. Hydroxyurea is used to treat a number of diseases, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, carcinoma of the head and neck, ovary, and cervix, melanoma, and sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea is taken orally."
Hygiene,Hygiene: The science of preventive medicine and the preservation of health. Also commonly used as a euphemism for cleanliness and proper sanitation.
Hymen,Hymen: A thin membrane that may completely or partially cover the vaginal opening before first sexual intercourse but that usually disappears before puberty.
Hyper-,"Hyper-: Prefix meaning high, beyond, excessive, or above normal, as in hyperglycemia (high sugar in the blood) and hypercalcemia (high calcium in the blood). The opposite of hyper- is hypo-."
Hyperactivity,"Hyperactivity: A higher than normal level of activity. An organ can be described as hyperactive if it is more active than usual. Behavior can also be hyperactive. People who are hyperactive always seem to be in motion. They can't sit still; they may dash around or talk incessantly. Sitting still through a lesson can be an impossible task. They may roam around the room, squirm in their seats, wiggle their feet, touch everything, or noisily tap a pencil. They may also feel intensely restless."
Hyperadrenocorticism,"Hyperadrenocorticism: Excess hormone called ""cortisol"". Often called Cushing's syndrome, it is an extremely complex condition that involves many areas of the body. It results from an excess of cortisol and its effects on the human body. Common symptoms are thinning of the skin, weakness, weight gain, bruising, hypertension, diabetes, weak bones (osteoporosis), facial puffiness, and in women cessation of periods. One of the commonest causes of Cushing's syndrome is the administration of ""cortisol-like medications"" for the treatment of diverse diseases. All other cases of Cushing's syndrome are due to excess production of cortisol by the adrenal gland including 1) an abnormal growth of the pituitary gland, which stimulates the adrenal gland, 2) a benign or malignant growth within the adrenal gland itself, which produces cortisol and 3) production within another part of the body (ectopic production) of a hormone that directly or indirectly stimulates the adrenal gland to make cortisol. Harvey Cushing (1869-1939), a neurosurgeon, described hyperadrenocorticism due specifically to an ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary adenoma, a benign pituitary tumor that puts out ACTH (AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone) that, in turn, drives (or overdrives) the adrenal gland."
Hyperaldosteronism,"Hyperaldosteronism: Overproduction of the hormone aldosterone from the outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal gland or a tumor containing that type of tissue. Excess aldosterone (pronounced al-do-ster-one) results in low potassium levels (hypokalemia), underacidity of the body (alkalosis), muscle weakness, excess thirst (polydipsia), excess urination (polyuria), and high blood pressure (hypertension). Also called aldosteronism and Conn's syndrome."
Hyperbaric,"Hyperbaric: Pertaining to gas pressures greater than 1 atmosphere* of pressure. Also pertaining to solutions that are more dense than the medium to which they are added. The term ""hyperbaric"" is derived from Greek roots: ""hyper-"" meaning high, beyond, excessive, above normal + ""baros"" meaning weight. Hyperbaric oxygenation is an increased amount of oxygen in organs and tissues resulting from the administration of oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than 1 atmosphere* of pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen is used to treat gas gangrene, some soft tissue infections, and other conditions in which high concentrations of oxygen are beneficial. Hyperbaric solutions in spinal anesthesia are solutions that have a density greater than that of spinal fluid. *An atmosphere is a unit of pressure taken to be the standard pressure of the earth's atmosphere at sea level. An atmosphere is equal to the pressure of a column of mercury 760 mm high and expressed as 101.325 kilopascals (1.01325 ? 105 newtons per square meter), or about 14.7 pounds per square inch."
Hyperbaric chamber,"Hyperbaric chamber: a pressurized chamber used to deliver high-pressure oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing pure oxygen in a closed environment in which the air pressure is 1.5 to 3 times greater than normal air pressure. The entire body is placed inside a hyperbaric chamber for HBOT. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the accepted treatment for decompression sickness that can occur following scuba diving. Other conditions that are treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy include certain infections, poorly healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, and air emboli (bubbles of air) in the blood vessels. A hyperbaric chamber is a medical device that has been cleared by the US FDA."
Hyperbilirubinemia,"Hyperbilirubinemia: An elevated level of the pigment bilirubin in the blood. A sufficient elevation of bilirubin produces jaundice. Some degree of hyperbilirubinemia is very common right after birth, especially in premature babies. Treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn involves exposure of the skin to special lights and removal of serum from the blood and replacing with solutions free of bilirubin (exchange transfusion)."
Hypercalcemia,"Hypercalcemia: A higher-than-normal level of calcium in the blood. Hypercalcemia can be a result of malignancy, elevated parathyroid gland activity (hyperparathyroidism), or other conditions. It can cause a number of nonspecific symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, thirst, fatigue, muscle weakness, restlessness, and confusion. An elevated level of calcium may cause muscle weakness and constipation, affect the conduction of electrical impulses in the heart (heart block), lead to calcium stones (nephrocalcinosis) in the urinary tract, impair kidney function, and interfere with the absorption of iron, predisposing the person to iron deficiency."
Hypercholesterolemia,"Hypercholesterolemia: High blood cholesterol. This can be sporadic (occurring with no family history) or familial. Hypercholesterolemia is one form of hyperlipidemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia is the most common inherited type of hyperlipidemia (high fat or lipid levels in blood). It predisposes to premature arteriosclerosis including coronary artery disease with heart attacks at an unusually young age. About half of men and a third of women suffer a heart attack by age 60. Persons with familial hypercholesterolemia can reduce their risk by adhering to a very low cholesterol diet under a doctor's supervision, and may also need to take medications that reduce their cholesterol level. Familial hypercholesterolemia is recognizable in childhood. Children and other relatives at risk for familial hypercholesterolemia can be screened (checked) for the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia is due to a genetic defect in the receptor (the dock on the surface of cells) for LDL (low density lipoprotein). See also hyperlipidemia."
Hypercoagulable state,"Hypercoagulable state: A hypercoagulable state is the medical term for a condition in which there is an abnormally increased tendency toward blood clotting (coagulation). There are numerous hypercoagulable states. Each has different causes and each increases a person's chances of developing blood clots such as those associated with thrombophlebitis (clot in the veins). Causes of hypercoagulable states include medications (female hormones, estrogens and birth control pills), after surgery (post- operative period, especially hip, knee, and urinary system procedures), pregnancy, phospholipid antibodies in blood (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant), cancer (though most patients with a hypercoagulable state do not have cancer), elevated blood homocysteine levels, and inherited protein deficiencies (antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, protein S, protein C, and others)."
Hyperemesis gravidarum,"Hyperemesis gravidarum: Extreme, excessive, and persistent vomiting in early pregnancy that may lead to dehydration and malnutrition. It is usually associated with weight loss of more than 5%of the woman's prepregnancy weight. Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 1 in every 300 pregnant women and is most common in young women, in first pregnancies, and in women carrying multiple fetuses. Hyperemesis gravidarum usually stops on its own by the 20th week of pregnancy. Treatment of mild hyperemesis gravidarum usually involves dietary measures, rest, and use of antacids. Very severe hyperemesis gravidarum may call for the use of intravenous fluids and nutrition."
Hyperglycemia,"Hyperglycemia: A high blood sugar. An elevated level specifically of the sugar glucose in the blood. Hyperglycemia is often found in diabetes mellitus. It occurs when the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it has to turn glucose into energy. Hyperglycemia may also occur in Cushing's syndrome and other conditions. The signs of hyperglycemia are polydipsia (a great thirst), polyuria (a need to urinate often), and a dry mouth. The term ""hyperglycemia"" comes from the Greek ""hyper-"" = high, over, beyond, above + ""glykys"" = sweet + ""haima"" = blood. High sweetness (sugar) in the blood."
Hypergraphia,"Hypergraphia: The driving compulsion to write; the overwhelming urge to write. Hypergraphia may compel someone to keep a voluminous journal, to jot off frequent letters to the editor, to write on toilet paper if nothing else is available, and perhaps even to compile a dictionary. Hypergraphia is the opposite of writer's block. Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with hypergraphia. This association has been known at least as early as 1974 (Waxman SG, Geschwind N. Hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy. Neurology. 1974;24:629-36). A number of prolific writer may have had temporal lobe epilepsy, including Byron, Dante, Dostoevsky, Moliere, Petrarch, Poe, and Tennyson. Hypergraphia has also been called the midnight disease."
Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis: A condition characterized by extreme and excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis affects the hands, feet, and armpits and often has no identifiable cause. If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. In secondary hyperhidrosis, the sweating may be all over the body or may be localized to one area. A number of medical conditions can cause secondary hyperhidrosis."
Hyperkalemia,"Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium in the blood. Hyperkalemia can be caused by taking excessive amounts of potassium, by medications, tissue trauma, and by diseases such as kidney failure. Hyperkalemia may not produce any symptoms, but severe hyperkalemia can lead to potentially fatal arrythmias of the heart."
Hyperlipidemia,Hyperlipidemia: Elevated lipid (fat) levels in the blood. Hyperlipidemia can be inherited and increases the risk of disease of the blood vessels leading to stroke and heart disease.
Hypermagnesemia,"Hypermagnesemia: Excess magnesium in the blood. Kidney disease is one of the main causes of hypermagnesemia. Persons with impaired kidney function should be especially careful about their magnesium intake because they can accumulate magnesium, which is dangerous and sometimes fatal."
Hyperosmolar,"Hyperosmolar: In biochemistry, pertaining to an osmolar concentration of the body fluids that is abnormally increased. As, for examples, in hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and hyperosmolar coma."
Hyperparathyroidism,"Hyperparathyroidism: Too much parathyroid hormone resulting in abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). This can cause bone resorption and osteoporosis, calcium deposits in the kidneys, muscular weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, and drowsiness. Hyperparathyroidism can be primary or secondary. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands in which one or more of the parathyroid glands are enlarged (hyperplastic), overactive, and secrete too much parathyroid hormone. In secondary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands themselves are normal but a problem such as kidney failure makes the body resistant to the action of parathyroid hormone. "
Hyperphosphatemia,"Hyperphosphatemia: An elevated level of phosphate in the blood. Higher-than-normal levels can be caused by ingestion of phosphate-rich foods, such as dairy products, or by kidney failure."
Hyperplasia,Hyperplasia: An increase in the number of normal cells in a tissue or an organ. Hyperplasia can represent a precancerous condition.
Hypertension,"Hypertension: Also known as high blood pressure is, by definition, a repeatedly elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90 mmHg -- a systolic pressure above 140 or a diastolic pressure above 90. Chronic hypertension is a ""silent"" condition that does not have symptoms. It can cause blood vessel changes in the back of the eye (retina), abnormal thickening of the heart muscle,?kidney failure, and brain damage."
Hypertensive,Hypertensive: Having abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension). See also: Hypotensive; Normotensive.
Hyperthermia,"Hyperthermia: Overheating of the body, possibly due to extreme weather conditions. Unrelieved hyperthermia can lead to collapse and death, particularly in the elderly. Hyperthermia can be prevented in many cases through use of air conditioning and ventilation, as well as by ensuring that vulnerable persons drink extra water. In emergency cases of hyperthermia, injections of saline solution and rapid cooling of the body may be necessary. Also known as heatstroke and heat prostration."
Hypertonia,Hypertonia: Increased tightness of muscle tone and reduced capacity of the muscle to stretch caused by damage to the motor nerve pathways in the central nervous system. Untreated hypertonia can lead to loss of function and deformity. Treatment can include physical and/or occupational therapy or medications. Injections of botulism toxin (botox) are sometimes used in the treatment for chronic hypertonia in cerebral palsy and other disorders. Also known as spasticity.
Hypertonic solution,"Hypertonic solution: A solution that contains more dissolved particles (such as salt and other electrolytes) than is found in normal cells and blood. For example, hypertonic solutions are used for soaking wounds."
Hypertrophic,"Hypertrophic: Exhibiting hypertrophy (enlargement or overgrowth of an organ or part of the body due to increased size of the constituent cells), as in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A heart defect characterized by increased thickness (hypertrophy) of the wall of the left ventricle, the largest of the four chambers of the heart."
Hypertrophy,Hypertrophy: Enlargement or overgrowth of an organ or part of the body due to the increased size of the constituent cells.
Hyperuricemia,"Hyperuricemia: Abnormally elevated blood level of uric acid. Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines that are part of many foods we eat. While hyperuricemia may indicate an increased risk of gout , the relationship between hyperuricemia and gout is unclear. Many patients with hyperuricemia do not develop gout, while some patients with repeated gout attacks have normal or low blood uric acid levels. Among the male population in the United States, approximately ten percent have hyperuricemia. However, only a small portion of those with hyperuricemia will actually develop gout."
Hypervolemia,"Hypervolemia: An abnormal increase in blood volume or, strictly speaking, an abnormal increase in the volume of blood plasma. From hyper- + volume + emia (blood)."
Hypo-,"Hypo-: Prefix meaning low, under, beneath, down, or below normal, as in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyposensitivity (undersensitivity). The opposite of hypo- is hyper-."
Hypoalbuminemia,"Hypoalbuminemia: An abnormally low blood level of albumin. Normally, albumin is the most plentiful protein in human blood and the key to the regulation of its osmotic pressure."
Hypocalcemia,"Hypocalcemia: Lower-than-normal level of calcium in the blood, which makes the nervous system highly irritable, as evidenced by tetany (spasms of the hands and feet, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and overly active reflexes). Chronic hypocalcemia contributes to poor mineralization of bones, soft bones (osteomalacia), and osteoporosis. In children, hypocalcemia leads to rickets and impaired growth. Treatment involves increased dietary intake of calcium or calcium supplementation."
Hypocapnia,"Hypocapnia: Less than the normal level of carbon dioxide in the blood. Hypoapnia is the opposite of hypercapnia. The origin of the suffix ""-capnia"" is curious. It comes from the Greek ""kapnos"" referring to carbon dioxide which is a principal part of smoke."
Hypochondriac,"Hypochondriac: A person who has hypochondriasis, a disorder characterized by a preoccupation with body functions and the interpretation of normal body sensations (such as sweating) or minor abnormalities (such as minor aches and pains) as portending problems of major medical moment. Reassurance by physicians and others only serves to increase the hypochondriac's persistent anxiety about their health. The hypochondrium is the anatomic area of the upper abdomen just below (Greek ""hypo"" meaning ""below"") the cartilage (Greek ""chondros"" meaning ""cartilage"") of the ribs. Hypochondriasis was thought by the ancients to be due to disturbed function of the spleen and other organs in the upper abdomen."
Hypocitraturia,"Hypocitraturia: a low level of citrate in the urine. A level of urine citrate of less than 320 mg/day is typically classified as low, but in severe cases, excretion of citrate can be less than 100 mg/day. Low urine citrate levels are a risk factor for kidney stone formation because citrate inhibits the process of calcium stone formation. There are a number of causes of low urine citrate and calcium kidney stone formation, including gout, urinary tract infection, certain medications, high animal protein consumption, and distal renal tubular acidosis, among others. Hypocitraturia is estimated to be involved in about 1/3 of those who have calcium kidney stones. Treatment with potassium citrate is successful at resolving the hypocitraturia in most patients."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar (glucose). Hypoglycemia may be associated with symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, tremor, palpitations, nausea, and pallor. Hypoglycemia also starves the brain of glucose energy, which is essential for proper brain function. Lack of glucose energy to the brain can cause symptoms ranging from headache, mild confusion, abnormal behavior, loss of consciousness, seizure, and coma. Severe hypoglycemia can cause death. The causes of hypoglycemia include use of drugs (such as insulin), liver disease, surgical absence of the stomach, tumors that release excess amounts of insulin, and pre-diabetes. In some patients, symptoms of hypoglycemia occur during fasting (fasting hypoglycemia). In others, symptoms of hypoglycemia occur after meals (reactive hypoglycemia). Immediate treatment of severe hypoglycemia consists of administering large amounts of glucose and repeating this treatment at intervals if the symptoms persist. Treatment must also be directed at the underlying cause. Treatment of reactive hypoglycemia involves changing the diet, including eating fewer concentrated sweets and ingesting multiple small meals throughout the day."
Hypoglycemic,"Hypoglycemic: Relating to hypoglycemia, an abnormally low level of the sugar glucose in the blood, usually a complication of diabetes, in which the body does not produce enough insulin to fully metabolize glucose. Hypoglycemic symptoms include tiredness, dizziness, confusion, increased heart rate, and a cold, clammy feeling. The treatment of hypoglycemia is careful diet, including eating small meals or snacks throughout the day; or by changing the dose or timing of insulin or other drugs that affect blood sugar levels. Severe hypoglycemia must be treated immediately with sugar or a high carbohydrate snack."
Hypogonadism,"Hypogonadism: A condition in which decreased production of gonadal hormones leads to below-normal function of the gonads and to retardation of sexual growth and development in children. (The gonads are the ovaries and testes and the hormones they normally produce include estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.)"
Hypokalemia,"Hypokalemia: Low blood potassium. Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. An abnormal decrease (or increase) of potassium can profoundly affect the nervous system and heart, and when extreme, can be fatal. The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L). See also: Potassium balance."
Hypomagnesemia,"Hypomagnesemia: Low magnesium in the blood, which can occur due to inadequate intake or impaired intestinal absorption of magnesium. Hypomagnesemia is often associated with low
calcium (hypocalcemia) and low potassium (hypokalemia). It causes increased irritability of the nervous system with tetany (spasms of the hands and feet, muscular twitching and cramps, spasm of the larynx, and overly active reflexes)."
Hypomania,"Hypomania: A condition similar to mania but less severe. The symptoms are similar with elevated mood, increased activity, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, racing thoughts, and the like. However, hypomanic episodes differ in that they do not cause significant distress or impair one's work, family, or social life in an obvious way while manic episodes do. Hypomanic people tend to be unusually cheerful, have more than ample energy, and need little sleep. Hypomania is a pleasurable state. It may confer a heightened sense of creativity and power. However, hypomania can subtly impair a person's judgment. Too much confidence can conceal the consequences of decisions. Hypomania can be difficult to diagnose because it may masquerade as mere happiness. It is important to diagnose hypomania because, as an expression of bipolar disorder, it can cycle into depression and carry an increased risk of suicide."
Hypomnesia,"Hypomnesia: Abnormally poor memory of the past. As compared to hypermnesia and amnesia. From hypo- + the Greek mneme, memory."
Hyponatremia,Hyponatremia: Low sodium in the blood. Hyponatremia can be caused by many conditions and when severe can lead to confusion and seizures.
Hypoparathyroidism,"Hypoparathyroidism: Underfunction of the parathyroid glands with deficient production of the hormone parathormone which leads to low blood calcium (hypocalcemia). The parathyroid glands are located adjacent to the thyroid gland. They may be missing due to a birth defect, impaired by autoimmune disease, or surgically removed during thyroid surgery. Treatment is with oral calcium supplements and oral vitamin D. Oral vitamin D increases the gut absorption of calcium in the diet and helps to maintain normal blood calcium levels."
Hypophosphatemia,Hypophosphatemia: A lower-than-normal level of phosphate in the blood. Hypophosphatemia can be associated with a number of conditions including bone diseases and hormone conditions. Symptoms occur only when hypophosphatemia is very severe and include muscle weakness that may progress to coma and death.
Hypoplasia,"Hypoplasia: Underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue or an organ. For example, hypoplasia of the enamel of the teeth indicates that the enamel coating is thinner than normal or missing in some but not all areas. Hypoplasia is less drastic than aplasia, where there is no development of a tissue or an organ at all."
Hypopnea,"Hypopnea: Literally, underbreathing. Breathing that is shallower or slower than normal. Hypopnea is distinct from apnea in which there is no breathing. Hypopnea comes from the Greek roots hypo- (meaning low, under, beneath, down, below normal) and pnoe (meaning breathing)."
Hypotension,"Hypotension: Any blood pressure that is below the normal expected for an individual in a given environment. Hypotension is the opposite of hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure). Hypotension is a relative term because the blood pressure normally varies greatly with activity, age, medications, and underlying medical conditions. Low blood pressure can result from conditions of the nervous system, conditions that do not begin in the nervous system, and drugs. Neurologic conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include changing position from lying to more vertical (postural hypotension), stroke, shock, lightheadedness after urinating or defecating, Parkinson's disease, neuropathy and simply fright. Nonneurologic conditions that can cause low blood pressure include bleeding, infections, dehydration, heart disease, adrenal insufficiency, pregnancy, prolonged bed rest, poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and blood transfusion reactions. Hypotensive drugs include blood pressure drugs, diuretics (water pills), heart medications (especially calcium antagonists- nifedipine / Procardia, beta blockers-propranolol / Inderal and others), depression medications (such as amitriptyline / Elavil), and alcohol. The word hypotension is a hybrid of the Greek ""hypo"" meaning ""under"" and the Latin ""tensio"" meaning ""to stretch."" In French, ""la tension"" is ""the blood pressure."""
Hypotensive,Hypotensive: Having abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension). See also: Hypertensive; Normotensive.
Hypothalamus,"Hypothalamus: The area of the brain that secretes substances that influence pituitary and other gland function and is involved in the control of body temperature, hunger, thirst, and other processes that regulate body equilibrium."
Hypothermia,"Hypothermia: Abnormally low body temperature. Someone who falls asleep in a cold temperature may become hypothermic, and the condition can be fatal. Hypothermia is intentionally produced to slow the metabolism during some types of surgery. Severe hypothermia can be fatal. Those with mild or moderate hypothermia (are alert and conscious, and have not lost the shivering reflex) will usually simply require removing them from the cold environment and providing them with additional insulation. Treatment of severe hypothermia involves slow heating of the body using blankets or other ways of increasing body warmth. Body temperature should increase by no more than a couple of degrees per hour."
Hypothyroidism,Hypothyroid: Deficiency of thyroid hormone which is normally made by the thyroid gland which is located in the front of the neck:
Hypotonic solution,Hypotonic solution: A solution that contains fewer dissolved particles (such as salt and other electrolytes) than is found in normal cells and blood. Hypotonic solutions are commonly used to give fluids intravenously to hospitalized patients in order to treat or avoid dehydration.
Hypoventilation,"Hypoventilation: The state in which a reduced amount of air enters the alveoli in the lungs, resulting in decreased levels of oxygen and increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. Hypoventilation can be due to breathing that is too shallow (hypopnea) or too slow (bradypnea), or to diminished lung function. The opposite of hypoventilation is hyperventilation (overbreathing)."
Hypovolemia,Hypovolemia: Abnormal decrease in the volume of blood plasma. Hypovolemia occurs with dehydration or bleeding.
Hypoxemia,"Hypoxemia: abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood. Hypoxemia may be mild to severe and leads to shortness of breath. Low blood oxygen can result from a variety of conditions that affect either the ability of the heart to pump blood to the lungs to receive oxygen or the function of the lungs themselves. Breathing at high altitudes can also cause hypoxemia. The level of oxygen in the blood can be measured by a test performed on a sample of arterial blood (referred to as an arterial blood gas measurement) or by an instrument known as a pulse oximeter , which is clipped onto the finger."
Hypoxia,"Hypoxia: A lower-than-normal concentration of oxygen in arterial blood, as opposed to anoxia, a complete lack of blood oxygen. Hypoxia will occur with any interruption of normal respiration."
Iatrogenic,"Iatrogenic: Due to the activity of a physician or therapy. For example, an iatrogenic illness is an illness that is caused by a medication or physician."
iatry,"iatry: Suffix meaning medical treatment. From the Greek ""iatreia"" meaning healing, which came from ""iatros"" meaning treatment (or physician). See ""iatrics"""
en,"Ibuprofen: A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to treat pain, swelling, and fever. Common brand names of ibuprofen include Advil, Motrin, and Nuprin."
ICD,"ICD: Implantable cardiac defibrillator, a device that is put within the body and is designed to recognize certain types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and correct them. Defibrillators continuously monitor the heart rhythm in order to detect overly rapid arrhythmias such as These ventricular arrhythmias impair the pumping efficiency of the heart and greatly raise the risks of fainting (syncope) and sudden cardiac arrest. They tend to develop in people with coronary artery disease or heart muscle diseases (cardiomyopathies). They are life- threatening. A defibrillator can be implanted within the body by far less invasive techniques than in the past because the devices, aside from being more technologically advanced, are smaller. (An implantable defibrillator is about the size of a pager). The defibrillator corrects the heart rhythm by delivering precisely calibrated and timed electrical shocks, when needed, to restore a normal heartbeat."
Ichthyosis,"Ichthyosis: Dry, rectangular scales on the skin. Like fish scales. From the Greek ""ichthys"" meaning fish. Ichthyosis is not one but rather a group of skin disorders characterized by scaling of the skin. Many different metaphors have been used to describe the appearance and texture of the skin in the various types and stages of ichthyosis, for example alligator skin, crocodile skin, collodion skin, porcupine skin and, of course, fish skin. Most ichthyoses are genetic (inherited). Some ichthyoses develop in association with various systemic diseases or be a prominent feature in certain genetic syndromes. The term ""ichthyosis"" is commonly used alone to refer to ichthyosis vulgaris. Ichthyosis vulgaris, also known as ichthyosis simplex, is inherited as an autosomal (nonsex-linked) trait and is characterized by scaly (fishlike) areas of skin. The first scaly skin problems usually appear after 3 months of age. The palms and soles are often affected. Areas that tend to be spared include the axillae (the armpits), the antecubital fossa (the inside area at the bend of the elbow) and the popliteal fossa (behind the knee). The gene responsible for ichthyosis vulgaris has been mapped to chromosome band 1q21. The product of this gene is thought to be a substance called filaggrin (abbreviated FLG) which may act as the ""keratin matrix protein"" in cells of the stratum corneum, one of the layers of the skin."
Icterus,"Icterus: Jaundice. At least one medical dictionary defines icterus as the presence of jaundice seen in the sclera of the eye. This is incorrect. Icterus is synonymous with jaundice. They are one and the same thing. Curiously, both icterus and jaundice come from the Greek. Icterus is a Latinized (-us) form of the Greek word ""ikteros"" and to the ancient Greeks signified both ""jaundice"" and ""a yellow bird."" It was thought that jaundice could be cured if the patient gazed at the bird. The disease would transmigrate from the jaundiced patient to the hapless bird (JAMA 184: 615, 1963). For related information, see Jaundice."
ICU,ICU: Intensive care unit. The intensive care unit is a designated area of a hospital facility that is dedicated to the care of patients who are seriously ill.
ICU psychosis,"ICU psychosis: A disorder in which patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a similar hospital setting may experience anxiety, become paranoid, hear voices, see things that are not there, become severely disoriented in time and place, become very agitated, even violent, etc. The condition has been formally defined as ""acute brain syndrome involving impaired intellectual functioning which occurs in patients who are being treated within a critical care unit."" ICU psychosis is a form of delirium, or acute brain failure. Organic factors including dehydration, hypoxia (low blood oxygen), heart failure (inadequate cardiac output), infection and drugs can cause or contribute to delirium. The treatment of ICU psychosis depends on the cause(s). Family members, familiar objects and calm words may help. Dehydration should call for fluids. Heart failure needs treatment with digitalis. Infections must be diagnosed and treated. Sedation with anti- psychotics agents may help. To prevent ICU psychosis, many critical care units now have instituted visiting hours, they try to minimize shift changes in the nursing staff caring for a patient, the lighting is coordinated with the normal day-night cycle, etc. ICU psychosis usually goes away when the patient leaves the ICU. One patient in every 3 who spends more than 5 days in an ICU experiences some form of psychotic reaction, according to current estimates. As the number of intensive care units and the number of people in them grow, ICU psychosis is perforce increasing as a problem. What causes ICU psychosis is not fully known. Something about the ICU causes some people, who are already experiencing great debility, stress and pain, to ""lose their minds."" Among the factors which are believed to play into ICU psychosis are: ICU psychosis often goes away with the coming of morning or sleep. Although it may linger through the day, severe agitation usually occurs only at night. (This phenomenon, called sundowning, is common in nursing homes)."
ID,ID: Intradermal.
"Idiocy, amaurotic familial","Idiocy, amaurotic familial: An outdated term for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) which is concisely defined by OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) as ""an autosomal recessive, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which in the classic infantile form, is usually fatal by age 2 or 3 years, results from deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. "" ""Autosomal"" points to the gene for TSD residing on a nonsex (autosomal) chromosome (namely, chromosome15q23-q24). ""Recessive"" indicates a person with 2 copies of the gene has TSD whereas someone with 1 copy is a carrier in normal health. TSD worsens, with time, as the central nervous system progressively deteriorates. The ""classic"" (""textbook"") type of TSD has its insidious onset in infancy. The child with TSD usually develops normally for the first few months of life. An exaggerated startle reaction may first be noted. Head control is lost by 6-8 months of age. The infant cannot roll over or sit up. Spasticity and rigidity develop. Excessive drooling and convulsions become evident. Blindness and head enlargement set in by the second year. ""Fatal by age 2 or 3 years"" today would be modified to ""fatal by age 5."" After age 2, total constant nursing care is needed. Death is due usually to cachexia (wasting away) or aspiration pneumonia initiated by food going down ""the wrong way"" into the lungs. TSD is due to deficiency of an enzyme (a protein needed to catalyze a specific chemical reaction within the body). Lack of the enzyme which results in failure to process a lipid (a fat) which accumulates and is deposited in the brain and other tissues, to their detriment. The enzyme is called hexosaminidase-A (hex-A) and the lipid that is deposited is called GM2-ganglioside. TSD is a model of a fatal metabolic disease that occurs primarily within a well- defined subpopulation. It is one of several genetic diseases found more often in persons of Jewish origin. (Other Jewish genetic diseases include Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Bloom syndrome, and factor XI deficiency). The frequency of TSD is much higher in Ashkenazi Jews (of European origin) than in other groups of Jews. (In the U.S., 95% of Jews are Ashkenazi and are at risk for TSD). TSD occurs more rarely in non-Jews. Knowledge of the biochemical basis of TSD has permitted screening programs for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of TSD. There are forms of TSD with somewhat more hex-A and hence later onset, termed juvenile TSD and adult TSH. Alternative names for TSD itself are type 1 GM2-gangliosidosis, B variant GM2-gangliosidosis, hexosaminidase A deficiency, hex-A deficiency. TSD is named for the English physician Waren Tay (1843-1927) and the New York neurologist Bernard (Barney) Sachs (1858-1944). Tay in 1881 studied an infant with progressive neurological impairment and described ""symmetrical changes in the yellow spot in each eye"", the ""cherry-red spots"" characteristic of TSD. Sachs saw a child in 1887 and the child's sister in 1898 with the cherry-red spots and ""arrested cerebral development"" and in 1910 he demonstrated the presence of accumulated lipid in the brain and retina."
Idiopathic,"Idiopathic: Of unknown cause. Any disease that is of uncertain or unknown origin may be termed idiopathic. For example, acute idiopathic polyneuritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic scoliosis, etc. From the New Latin idiopathia (primary disease), from the Greek idiopatheia, from idio-, from idios (one's own, personal) + -patheia, -pathic (feeling, suffering)."
IFA,IFA: Indirect immunofluorescence assay.
Ig,"Ig: Abbreviation for immunoglobulin, a protein produced by plasma cells and lymphocytes. Immunoglobulins are an essential part of the body's immune system which attach to foreign substances, such as bacteria, and assist in destroying them. The classes of immunoglobulins are immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin E (IgE)."
IHS,"IHS: The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The provision of health services to members of federally-recognized tribes grew out of the special government-to-government relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes. This relationship, established in 1787, is based on Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and has been given form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people, and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level.

"Ileitis, Crohn","Ileitis, Crohn: Inflammation of the ileum (the farthest segment of the small intestine) due to Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily involving the small and large intestine, but which can affect other parts of the digestive system as well. It is named for the doctor who first described the disease in 1932. The disease is usually diagnosed in persons in their teens or twenties, but can occur at any point in life. Crohn's disease can be a chronic, recurrent condition or can cause minimal symptoms with or even without medical treatment. In mild forms, Crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. In more serious cases, deeper and larger ulcers can develop, causing scarring and stiffness and possibly narrowing of the bowel, sometimes leading to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs. Crohn's disease has many forms: Involvement of the large intestine (colon) only is called Crohn's colitis or granulomatous colitis, while involvement of the small intestine alone is called Crohn's enteritis. The most common part of the small intestine to be affected by Crohn's disease is the last portion, called the ileum. Active disease in this area is termed Crohn's ileitis. When both the small intestine and the large intestine are involved, the condition is called Crohn's enterocolitis (or ileocolitis). Other descriptive terms may be used as well. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss can be symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Diagnosis is commonly made by CT enterography or colonoscopy. Treatment includes medications that are anti-inflammatories, steroids, immune modulators, antibiotics or surgery. Surgery can be necessary in severe cases. Crohn's disease is an area of active research around the world and new treatment approaches are being investigated which have promise to improve the lives of affected patients."
"Ileocolitis, Crohn","Ileocolitis, Crohn: Crohn disease involving both the ileum (the furthest part of the small intestine just before the colon) and the large intestine (the colon). Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily involving the small and large intestine, but which can affect other parts of the digestive system as well. It is named for the doctor who first described the disease in 1932. The disease is usually diagnosed in persons in their teens or twenties, but can occur at any point in life.

Crohn disease is an area of active research around the world and new treatment approaches are being investigated which have promise to improve the lives of affected patients."
Ileum,Ileum: Part of the small intestine beyond the jejunum and before the large intestine (colon).
Ileus,"Ileus: Obstruction of the intestine due to its being paralyzed. The paralysis does not need to be complete to cause ileus, but the intestine must be so inactive that food cannot pass through it, which leads to blockage of the intestine. Ileus commonly follows some types of surgery. It can also result from certain drugs, injuries, and illnesses. Regardless of the cause, ileus causes constipation and bloating. When one listens to the abdomen with a stethoscope, no bowel sounds are heard because the bowel is inactive. Also known as paralytic ileus."
Iliac,Iliac: Pertaining to the ilium.
Ilium,"Ilium: The upper part of the pelvic bone, which forms the receptacle of the hip."
Illusion,"Illusion: A perception that occurs when a sensory stimulus is present but is incorrectly perceived and misinterpreted, such as hearing the wind as someone crying. Everyone may occasionally experience an illusion. However, illusions are extraordinarily common in people suffering from schizophrenia."
IM (intramuscular),"IM (intramuscular): An IM medication is given by needle into the muscle. This is as opposed to a medication that is given by a needle into the skin (intradermal) , just below the skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous)."
Imitrex,"Imitrex: Brand name for sumatriptan, a triptan drug for the treatment of migraine."
Immune,"Immune: Protected against infection, usually by the presence of antibodies."
Immune response,"Immune response: Any reaction by the immune system. For example, poison ivy can cause an immune response in the skin characterized by inflammation with tiny blisters, and itching. Also, a flu shot is designed to produce an immune response by stimulating the production of antibodies against the flu virus."
Immune system,Immune system: A complex system that is responsible for distinguishing a person from everything foreign to him or her and for protecting his or her body against infections and foreign substances.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura: A blood disorder characterized by the destruction of blood platelets due to the presence of antiplatelet autoantibodies. (Autoantibodies are antibodies directed against the patient's own cells, in this disorder, the patient's own platelets.) Thrombocytopenia refers to a decrease in platelets (also known as thrombocytes). Purpura pertains to the visible hallmarks: purplish areas in the skin and mucous membranes (such as the mouth lining) where bleeding has occurred as a result of decreased platelets. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) can be triggered by drugs, or associated with infection, pregnancy, or immune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. About half of all cases are classified as ""idiopathic,"" meaning the cause is unknown. The abbreviation ""ITP"" is much used. It stands for both immune thrombocytopenic purpura and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura."
Immunization,"Immunization: Vaccination. Immunizations work by stimulating the immune system, the natural disease-fighting system of the body. The healthy immune system is able to recognize invading bacteria and viruses and produce substances (antibodies) to destroy or disable them. Immunizations prepare the immune system to ward off a disease. To immunize against viral diseases, the virus used in the vaccine has been weakened or killed. To immunize against bacterial diseases, it is generally possible to use only a small portion of the dead bacteria to stimulate the formation of antibodies against the whole bacteria. In addition to the initial immunization process, it has been found that the effectiveness of immunizations can be improved by periodic repeat injections or ""boosters."" Also see Immunizations (in the plural) and Immunization of a specific type (such Immunization, Polio)."
Immunocompetent,"Immunocompetent: Able to develop an immune response. An immunocompetent body is able to
recognize antigens and act against them. Immuno-
competent is the opposite of immunodeficient."
Immunocompromised,Immunocompromised: Having an immune system that has been impaired by disease or medical treatment.
Immunoglobulin,"Immunoglobulin: A protein produced by plasma cells and lymphocytes and characteristic of these types of cells. Immunoglobulins play an essential role in the body's immune system. They attach to foreign substances, such as bacteria, and assist in destroying them. Immunoglobulin is abbreviated Ig. The classes of immunoglobulins are termed immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin E (IgE)."
Immunoglobulin A,"Immunoglobulin A: A major class of immunoglobulins (antibodies) found in serum and external body secretions such as saliva, tears, and sweat, as well as in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts. Abbreviated IgA. About 10 percent to 15 percent of the antibodies present in the body are IgA antibodies."
Immunoglobulin G,Immunoglobulin G: A class of immunoglobulins found in all body fluids. They are the smallest but most common antibodies (75 percent to 80 percent) in the body. Abbreviated IgG. IgG antibodies are very important in fighting bacterial and viral infections. IgG antibodies are the only type of antibody that can cross the placenta in a pregnant woman to help the fetus.
Immunology,"Immunology: The study of all aspects of the immune system, including its structure and function, disorders of the immune system, blood banking, immunization, and organ transplantation."
Immunosuppressant,"Immunosuppressant: An agent that can suppress or prevent the immune response. Immunosuppressants are used to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ and to treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Some treatments for cancer act as immunosuppressants."
Immunosuppression,"Immunosuppression: Suppression of the immune system and its ability to fight infection. Immunosuppression may result from certain diseases, such as AIDS or lymphoma, or from certain drugs, such as some of those used to treat cancer. Immunosuppression may also be deliberately induced with drugs, as in preparation for bone marrow or other organ transplantation, to prevent the rejection of a transplant. Also known as immunodepression."
Immunosuppressive,"Immunosuppressive: 1. Pertaining to immunosuppression, the suppression of the immune system.
2. An agent capable of suppressing the immune response."
Immunotherapy,"Immunotherapy: Treatment to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune (defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is thus any form of treatment that uses the body's natural abilities that constitute the immune system to fight infection and disease or to protect the body from some of the side effects of treatment. Immunotherapy (also called biological therapy or biotherapy) often employs substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces low levels of BRMs in response to infection and disease. Large amounts of BRMs can be made in the laboratory to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. Forms of biological therapy include monoclonal antibodies, interferon, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM-CSF, G-CSF). Interleukin-2 and interferon are BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma. Interferon is a BRM now in use to treat hepatitis C. Biologic therapy to block the action of instruments of inflammation called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is being explored to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Etanercept (ENBREL) is a commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatment for patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Often, these treatments cause flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, muscle aches, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some patients develop a rash, and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling. Depending on how severe these problems are, patients may need to stay in the hospital during treatment. These side effects are usually short-term and they gradually go away after treatment stops."
Impact,"Impact: To lodge firmly or wedge in. For example, a molar tooth that is growing up and against an adjacent tooth is impacting the tooth next to it."
Impaired glucose tolerance,"Impaired glucose tolerance: A transition phase between normal glucose tolerance and diabetes, also referred to as prediabetes. In impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), the levels of blood glucose are between normal and diabetic. People with IGT do not have diabetes. Each year, only 1-5% of people whose test results show IGT actually develop diabetes. And with retesting, as many as half of the people with IGT have normal oral glucose tolerance test results. Weight loss and exercise may help people with IGT return their glucose levels to normal. With diet and exercise as many as 60% will not developed diabetes or it will be considerably slowed in its development. See also: Oral glucose tolerance test"
Impetigo,"Impetigo: A skin infection caused by the staphylococcus or, less often, by the streptococcus bacterium. The first sign of impetigo is a patch of red, itchy skin. Pustules develop on this area, soon forming crusty, yellow-brown sores that can spread to cover entire areas of the face, arms, and other body parts. Most patients are children. Because impetigo is caused by a bacterium that is transmitted onto the skin, it is contagious and easily contracted by persons who might touch the affected person. Treatment involves the use of antibiotics."
Implantation,"Implantation: The act of setting in firmly. In embryology, implantation refers specifically to the attachment of the fertilized egg to the uterine lining, which occurs approximately 6 or 7 days after conception (fertilization). Many medical devices or materials may be implanted (embedded). There are breast implants, cochlear implants, defibrillator implants, pacemaker implants, etc."
Impotence,"Impotence: A common problem among men characterized by the consistent inability to sustain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse or the inability to achieve ejaculation, or both. Impotence can vary. It can involve a total inability to achieve an erection or ejaculation, an inconsistent ability to do so, or a tendency to sustain only very brief erections. The risk of impotence increases with age. It is four-fold higher in men in their 60s compared with those in their 40s according to a study published in the Journal of Urology (2000;163:460-463). Men with less education are also more likely to experience impotence, perhaps because they tend to have less healthy lifestyles, eat a less healthy diet, drink more and exercise less. Physical exercise tends to lessen the risk of impotence. Impotence can have emotional causes but most often it is due to a physical problem. The physical causes of impotence include diseases (such as diabetes and hypertension), injuries (such as from prostate surgery), side-effects of drugs (such as the protease inhibitors used in HIV therapy), and disorders (such as atherosclerosis) that impair blood flow in the penis. Impotence is treatable in all age groups. Treatments include psychotherapy, vacuum devices, surgery and, most often today, drug therapy. Advertising for drugs for the treatment of impotence has greatly popularized the problem better known in the ads by its other name, erectile dysfunction."
Impulsivity,"Impulsivity: Inclined to act on impulse rather than thought. People who are overly impulsive, seem unable to curb their immediate reactions or think before they act. As a result, they may blurt out answers to questions or inappropriate comments, or run into the street without looking. Their impulsivity may make it hard for a child to wait for things they want or to take their turn in games. They may grab a toy from another child or hit when they are upset. Impulsivity is a characteristic feature of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)."
in,in: Abbreviation for inch.
In situ,"In situ: In the normal location. An in situ tumor is one that is confined to its site of origin and has not invaded neighboring tissue or gone elsewhere in the body. For example, squamous cell carcinoma in situ is an early stage of skin cancer."
In vitro fertilization,In vitro fertilization: A laboratory procedure in which sperm are put in a special dish with unfertilized eggs to achieve fertilization. The embryos that result can be transferred into the uterus or frozen (cryopreserved) for future use. Abbreviated IVF.
,"Inbreeding, coefficient of: A measure of how close two people are genetically to each another. The coefficient of inbreeding, symbolized by the letter F, is the probability that a person with two identical genes received both genes from one ancestor. Take a first-cousin mating. First cousins share a set of grandparents. For any particular gene in the male, the chance that his female first cousin inherited the same gene from the same source is 1/8. Further, for any gene the man passes to his child, the chance is 1/8 that the woman has the same gene and ? that she transmits that gene to the child so 1/8 X ? = 1/16. Thus, a first-cousin marriage has a coefficient of inbreeding F =1/16. The added risks for the offspring of first cousins depend not only upon the coefficient of inbreeding but also upon the genetic family history and test results. For example, first cousins of Italian descent are at increased risk of carrying a gene for beta thalassemia and genetic laboratory tests may confirm that they are both beta-thalassemia gene carriers. There are always added risks in the mating of closely related persons and those risks are not entirely negligible."
Incision,Incision: A cut through skin or other tissue performed by a health care professional.
Incontinence,"Incontinence: The inability to control excretions, to hold urine in the bladder, or to keep feces in the rectum."
Incubation period,"Incubation period: In medicine, the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear. For example, the incubation period of chickenpox is 14-16 days. In biology, the incubation period is the time needed for any particular process of development to take place. For example, the length of time for turtle eggs to hatch is the incubation period."
Incubator,"Incubator: In biotechnology. an apparatus in which environmental conditions can be set and controlled. Incubators are used in microbiology for culturing (growing) bacteria and other microorganisms. Incubators in tissue culture rooms are used for culturing stem cells, lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts and other types of cells. And in the hospital nursery and newborn intensive care unit (NICU), incubators serve to house and maintain premature and ill infants. Incubators were developed for infants in France as early as 1857. The first one in the US was built by Dr. William Champion Deming at the State Emigrant Hospital, Ward's Island, New York. The ""hatching cradle"" was first occupied on September 7, 1888 by Edith Eleanor McLean, birth weight 2 pounds, 7 ounces."
Indicate,"Indicate: In medicine, to make a treatment or procedure advisable because of a particular condition or circumstance. For example, certain medications are indicated for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy while others are contraindicated."
Indication,"Indication: 1. In medicine, a condition which makes a particular treatment or procedure advisable. CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) is an indication for the use of Gleevec (imatinib mesylate). 2. A sign or a circumstance which points to or shows the cause, pathology, treatment, or outcome of an attack of disease. The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in peripheral blood cells is an indication of a relapse in CML."
Induced abortion,Induced abortion: An abortion that is brought about intentionally. Also called an artificial or therapeutic abortion. As opposed to a spontaneous abortion (a miscarriage).
Induction therapy,"Induction therapy: The first in a series of therapeutic measures taken to treat a disease, typically a cancer. The induction therapy, for example, in acute leukemia is the initial chemotherapy designed to bring about a remission."
Induration,"Induration: Localized hardening of soft tissue of the body. The area becomes firm, but not as hard as bone."
Industrial health,Industrial health: A branch of public health concerned with the health and well-being of workers. Its aims are to eliminate hazards and reduce industrial fatigue in the workplace.
Infant,"Infant: A young baby, from birth to 12 months of age."
"Infant, post-term","Infant, post-term: An overly mature baby that has not been born until well after the usual term pregnancy. A post-term baby is specifically one born 2 weeks (14 days) or more after the usual 9 months (280 days) of gestation. The gestation (length of the pregnancy) is calculated from the date of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is a very important calculation since, if delivery is delayed 3 weeks beyond term, the infant mortality rate skyrockets to 3 times normal. The definition of a post-term infant has evolved. A few sources still consider a baby post-term if it is born a week after the usual 9 months' gestation but the current trend is to consider a baby post-term only if it is born 2 weeks (14 days) or more after the usual full-term 9 months of gestation. The terms ""post-term infant"" and ""postmature infant"" are interchangeable."
Infantile paralysis (polio),"Infantile paralysis (polio): Infantile paralysis is an old synonym for poliomyelitis, an acute and sometimes devastating viral disease. Man is the only natural host for poliovirus. The virus enters the mouth and multiplies in lymphoid tissues in the pharynx and intestine. Small numbers of virus enter the blood and go to other sites where the virus multiplies more extensively. Another round of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) leads to invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), the spinal cord and brain, the only sites seriously struck by the virus. In polio, there is inflammation of the central nervous system, especially the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and the brainstem (the portion of the brain between the cerebral hemispheres and spinal cord). Polio can be a minor illness, as it is in 80-90% of clinical infections, chiefly in young children, and not involve the CNS. Symptoms are slight fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, and vomiting 3-5 days after exposure. Recovery occurs in 24-72 hours. This is termed the abortive type of polio. Polio as a major illness may or may not be paralytic. Symptoms usually appear without prior illness, particularly in older children and adults, 7-14 days after exposure. Symptoms are fever, severe headache, stiff neck and back, deep muscle pain, and sometimes areas of hyperesthesia (increased sensation) and paresthesia (altered sensation). There may be no further progression from this picture of viral meningitis or there be loss of tendon reflexes and weakness or paralysis of muscle groups. Recovery is complete in the abortive and nonparalytic forms of polio. In paralytic polio, about 50% of patients recover with no residual paralysis, about 25% are left with mild disabilities, and the remaining patients have severe permanent disability. The greatest return of muscle function occurs in the first 6 months, but improvement may continue for up to 2 years. Physical therapy is the most important part of treatment of paralytic polio during convalescence. The ideal strategy with polio is clearly to prevent it by immunization against poliovirus. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) had polio and worked with the National Foundation/March of Dimes to raise money to combat this once-fearsome scourge."
Infarction,"Infarction: The formation of an infarct, an area of tissue death, due to a local lack of oxygen."
Infection,"Infection: The invasion and multiplication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are not normally present within the body. An infection may cause no symptoms and be subclinical, or it may cause symptoms and be clinically apparent. An infection may remain localized, or it may spread through the blood or lymphatic vessels to become systemic (bodywide). Microorganisms that live naturally in the body are not considered infections. For example, bacteria that normally live within the mouth and intestine are not infections."
"Infection, hospital-acquired","Infection, hospital-acquired: An infection caught while hospitalized. The medical term for a hospital-acquired infection is nosocomial. Most nosocomial infections are due to bacteria. Since antibiotics are frequently used within hospitals, the types of bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics is different than bacteria outside of the hospital. Nosocomial infections can be serious and difficult to treat. A nosocomial infection is strictly and specifically an infection ""not present or incubating prior to admittance to the hospital, but generally occurring 48 hours after admittance."" The word ""nosocomial"" is made up of two Greek words. The prefix ""noso-"" comes from ""nosus"" meaning disease and ""-comial"" comes from ""komeion"" meaning to take care of. Nosocomial could therefore refer to any affliction acquired by a patient while under medical supervision, but it doesn't. It now refers more narrowly to a hospital-acquired infection."
"Infection, urinary tract (UTI)","Infection, urinary tract (UTI): An infection in the urinary system that begins when microorganisms cling to the opening of the urethra (the canal from the bladder) and begin to multiply. Most UTIs are due to one type of bacteria, E. (Escherichia) coli, a normal denizen of the colon. An infection in the urethra leads to inflammation called urethritis. From there bacteria may move up, causing a bladder infection (cystitis) and if the infection is not treated promptly, bacteria may go up the ureters to infect the kidneys (pyelonephritis). Factors leading to UTI include any abnormality of the urinary tract (such as a urinary tract malformation or a kidney stone) that obstructs the flow of urine, an enlarged prostate gland that slows the flow of urine, catheters (tubes) in the bladder, diabetes (due to changes of the immune system), and any disorder that suppresses the immune system. Women have more UTI than men, probably because a woman's urethra is shorter (allowing bacteria quick access to the bladder) and nearer sources of bacteria from the anus and vagina. For many women, sexual intercourse seems to trigger an infection, as may the use of a diaphragm. Not everyone with a UTI has symptoms but symptoms commonly include a frequent urge to urinate and a painful, burning when urinating (dysuria). The urine may look milky or cloudy, even reddish if blood is present. Kidney infection can cause pain in the back or side below the ribs. In children, symptoms may be easily missed or misunderstood. A child with a UTI may be irritable, not eat normally, have an unexplained fever, have incontinence or loose bowels, or just not thrive."
Inferior,"Inferior: In anatomy, below or toward the feet. As opposed to superior. The liver is inferior to the lungs. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Inferior vena cava,"Inferior vena cava: A large vein that receives blood from the lower extremities, pelvis and abdomen and delivers it to the right atrium of the heart."
Inferolateral,"Inferolateral: Below and to one side. Both inferior and lateral. In anatomy, there are many such compound terms. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Infiltrate,"Infiltrate: To penetrate. For example, a cancer may grow into, or infiltrate, surrounding tissues."
Inflammation,"Inflammation: A localized reaction that produces redness, warmth, swelling, and pain as a result of infection, irritation, or injury. Inflammation can be external or internal."
Inflammatory response,"Inflammatory response: A fundamental type of response by the body to disease and injury, a response characterized by the classical signs of ""dolor, calor, rubor, and tumor"" -- pain, heat (localized warmth), redness, and swelling. Innumerable insults (a mosquito bite, a splinter, a virus infection, a bruise, a broken bone) can trigger an inflammatory response and dispatch cells and chemicals to the site to repair the damage. Inflammation is a key part of the body's defense system, an indispensable protective response by the body's system of self-defense. Acute inflammation is short-lived, lasting only a few days. If it lasts longer, it is referred to as chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation may last weeks, months, or beyond. Paradoxically, the inflammatory process itself may cause tissue damage while it is engaged in healing and repair. Thus, inflammation may play a role in such diverse disorders as Alzheimer disease, meningitis, atherosclerosis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, cirrhosis of the liver, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes, osteoporosis, and psoriasis. For more information, see: Inflammation."
Influenza,"Influenza: Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza A or B viruses Most people who get the influenza recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual influenza vaccination."
Informed consent,"Informed consent: The process by which a patient learns about and understands the purpose, benefits, and potential risks of a medical or surgical intervention, including clinical trials, and then agrees to receive the treatment or participate in the trial. Informed consent generally requires the patient or responsible party to sign a statement confirming that they understand the risks and benefits of the procedure or treatment."
Infuse,"Infuse: In medicine, to introduce a solution into the body through a vein. An infusion is the therapeutic introduction of a fluid other than blood into a vein. The infused fluid might, for example, be a saline (salt) solution."
Inguinal,Inguinal: Having to do with the groin.
Injury,"Injury: Harm or hurt. To harm, hurt, or wound. The word injure may be in physical or emotional sense. From the Latin injuria meaning injury."
Innervation,"Innervation: The nerve supply, usually to a specific part of the body. The innervation of the cornea is dense."
Inotropic,Inotropic: Affecting the force of muscle contraction. An inotropic heart drug is one that affects the force with which the heart muscle contracts. Ionotropic can be negative or positive.
Inpatient,Inpatient: A patient whose care requires a stay in a hospital. As opposed to an outpatient. The term inpatient dates back to at least 1760. The case of an inpatient was referred to an incase.
INR,INR: International normalized ratio.
Insinuate,"Insinuate: In the biomedical sciences, to introduce slowly, through a winding or narrow passage, or by a persistent movement. The term ""insinuate"" in this sense carries the connotation of introducing artfully and gently, as a cardiologist would do in insinuating a catheter (a tube) into the arteries of ones heart. The origin of ""insinuate"" is from the Latin in-, in + sinus, the bosom, meaning ""in the bosom."""
Insomnia,"Insomnia is the perception or complaint of inadequate or poor-quality sleep due to a number of factors, such as difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night with difficulty returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, or unrefreshing sleep. Insomnia is not defined by the number of hours of sleep a person gets or how long it takes to fall asleep; it is a measure of satisfaction with sleep. Individuals vary normally in their need for and their satisfaction with sleep. Insomnia may cause problems during the day, such as tiredness, a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability."
Medicine,Institute of Medicine: A nonprofit organization established in 1970 as a component of the US National Academy of Sciences that works outside the framework of government to provide evidence-based research and recommendations for public health and science policy. Abbreviated IOM. The IOM is also an honorific membership organization.
Insulin,Insulin: A natural hormone made by the pancreas that controls the level of the sugar?glucosein the blood. Insulin permits cells to use glucose for energy. Cells cannot utilize glucose without insulin.
Integron,"Integron: A mobile DNA element that can capture and carry genes, particularly those responsible for antibiotic resistance. Integrons do this by site-specific recombination. There are at least three classes of integrons based upon which integrase gene they contain. The antibiotic resistance genes that integrons capture are located on gene cassettes. These cassettes can exist as free circular DNA. A recombination event occurs, integrating the cassette into the integron. Additional gene cassettes can integrate, resulting in the integration of several genes. Although gene cassettes are a mechanism for the development of multiple antibiotic resistance, bacteria predating the use of antibiotics have also been found to contain cassettes."
Intercurrent disease,Intercurrent disease: A disease that intervenes during the course of another disease. A patient with AIDS may develop an intercurrent bout of pneumonia.
Intermittent claudication,"Intermittent claudication: An aching, crampy, tired, and sometimes burning pain in the legs that comes and goes -- it typically occurs with walking and goes away with rest -- due to poor circulation of blood in the arteries of the legs. In very severe claudication the pain is also felt ar rest. Intermittent claudication may occur in one or both legs and often continues to worsen over time. However, some people complain only of weakness in the legs when walking or a feeling of ""tiredness"" in the buttocks. Impotence is an occasional complaint in men. The usually intermittent nature of the pain is due to narrowing of the arteries that supply the leg with blood, limiting the supply of oxygen to the leg muscles, a limitation that is felt especially when the oxygen requirement of these muscles rises with exercise. Intermittent claudication can be due to temporary artery narrowing due to vasospasm (spasm of the artery), permanent artery narrowing due to atherosclerosis, or complete occlusion (closure) of an artery to the leg. The condition is quite common, more so in men than women. It affects 1-2% of the population under 60 years of age, 3-4% of persons age 60 to 70 and over 5% of people over 70. The pulses in the legs and feet are evaluated on the clinical exam. Diagnostic tests include blood pressure measurements to compare the arms and legs, Doppler ultrasonography on the legs, duplex Doppler/ultrasound exam of the extremities to visualize arterial blood flow, an ECG, and arteriography (injecting dye that can be visualized in the arteries). The prognosis with intermittent claudication is generally favorable because the condition often stabilizes or improves in time. Conservative therapy is advisable. Walking often helps increase the distance that the patient can walk without symptoms. A program of daily walking for short periods, and stopping for pain or cramping, often helps improve function by encouraging the development of collateral circulation, that is, the growth of new small blood vessels that bypass the area of obstruction in the artery. It is essential to stop smoking. Avoid applications of heat or cold on legs. Avoid tight shoes. Two drugs are available for the management of intermittent claudication: pentoxifylline (brand name: Trental) and cilostazol (brand name: Pletal). These drugs act differently. Trental decreases the ""stickiness"" (viscosity) of blood and thereby improves its flow to the legs. Pletal acts to dilate (widen) the arteries by decreasing the action of an enzyme, phosphodiesterase III. It also reduces the ability of blood to clot. If conservative therapy is inadequate, correction of the narrowing in the affected artery may be suggested. This option depends on the location and severity of the narrowing in the artery and the underlying medical condition of the patient. Procedures that are used to correct the narrowing of arteries include surgery (such as bypass grafting) and interventional radiology (such as balloon angioplasty). When claudication is severe and persistent, these procedures may be required to ultimately relieve the condition and the pain. The word ""claudication"" comes from the Latin ""claudicare"" meaning to limp. There is also venous claudication, resulting from inadequate venous drainage."
Intern,"Intern: In medicine, a doctor who has completed medical school and is engaged in a year of additional training at a hospital before residency. An intern may, for example, be in pediatrics or internal medicine. The internship year is often quite rigorous."
Internal bleeding,"Internal bleeding: Bleeding inside the body that is not seen from the outside. Internal bleeding occurs when damage to an artery or vein allows blood to escape the circulatory system and collect inside the body. The internal bleeding may occur within tissues, organs, or in cavities of the body including the head, chest, and abdomen. Examples of other potential sites of bleeding include the eye, lining tissues of the heart, muscles, and joints. Internal bleeding may not be evident for many hours after it begins, and symptoms occur when there is significant blood loss or if a blood clot is large enough to compress an organ and prevent it from functioning properly."
Internal fixation,"Internal fixation: A surgical procedure that stabilizes and joins the ends of fractured (broken) bones by mechanical devices such as metal plates, pins, rods, wires or screws. Internal fixation is as opposed to external fixation of a fracture by a splint or cast."
Internal medicine,"Internal medicine: The medical specialty dedicated to the diagnosis and medical treatment of adults. A physician who specializes in internal medicine is referred to as an internist. Subspecialties of internal medicine include allergy and immunology, cardiology (heart diseases), endocrinology (hormone disorders), hematology (blood disorders), infectious diseases, gastroenterology (diseases of the gut), nephrology (kidney diseases), oncology (cancer), pulmonology (lung disorders), and rheumat-ology (arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders)."
International normalized ratio,"International normalized ratio: A system established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee on Thrombosis and Hemostasis for reporting the results of blood coagulation (clotting) tests. Abbreviated INR. Under the INR system, all results are standardized. For example, a person taking the anticoagulant warfarin (brand name: Coumadin) would regularly have blood tested to measure the INR. The INR permits patients on anticoagulants to travel and obtain comparable test results wherever they are."
International unit (IU),"International unit (IU): An international unit (IU) is an internationally accepted amount of a substance. This type of measure is used for the fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D and E) and certain hormones, enzymes, and biologicals (such as vaccines). All international units are officially defined by the International Conference for Unification of Formulae."
Interstitial,"Interstitial: Pertaining to being between things, especially between things that are normally closely spaced. The word interstitial is much used in medicine and has specific meaning, depending on the context. For instance, interstitial cystitis is a specific type of inflammation of the bladder wall. Interstitial radiation involves placing radioactive material directly into a tumor. Interstitial pneumonia is inflammation of the lung that involves the mesh of lung tissue (alveolar septa) rather than the air spaces (alveoli)."
Interstitial cystitis (IC),"Interstitial cystitis (IC): Disease that involves inflammation or irritation of the bladder wall. This inflammation can lead to scarring and stiffening of the bladder, and even ulcerations and bleeding. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, findings on cystoscopy and biopsy, and eliminating other treatable causes such as infection. Because doctors do not know what causes interstitial cystitis, treatments are aimed at relieving symptoms. Most people are helped for variable periods of time by one or a combination of treatments."
Intervening sequence,"Intervening sequence: Part of a gene that is initially transcribed from the DNA into the primary RNA transcript but then is excised (removed) from it when the so-called exons sequences on either side of it are spliced together. Intervening sequences, which are also called introns, are genetic sequences that intervene between the exons. The DNA of a gene is thereby made up of an alternation of introns and exons."
Intervention,"Intervention: The act of intervening, interfering or interceding with the intent of modifying the outcome. In medicine, an intervention is usually undertaken to help treat or cure a condition. For example, early intervention may help children with autism to speak. ""Acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention is widely practiced in the United States,"" according to the National Institutes of Health. From the Latin intervenire, to come between."
Interventional,"Interventional: Pertaining to the act of intervening, interfering or interceding with the intent of modifying the outcome."
Interventional radiology (IR),"Interventional radiology (IR): Interventional radiologists employ image guidance methods to gain access to the deep interstices of most organs and organ systems. Through a galaxy of techniques, they can treat certain conditions percutaneously (through the skin) that might otherwise require surgery. (The technology includes the use of balloons, catheters, microcatheters, stents, therapeutic embolization (deliberately clogging up a blood vessel), etc.) The specialty of interventional radiology is growing and becoming increasingly diverse. It overlaps with other surgical arenas including interventional cardiology, vascular surgery, endoscopy, laparoscopy and other minimally invasive techniques, such as biopsies. Specialists performing interventional radiology procedures today include not only radiologists but also other types of doctors including general surgeons, vascular surgeons, cardiologists (heart doctors), gastroenterologists (GI specialists), gynecologists, and urologists (urinary specialists)."
Intestinal obstruction,"Intestinal obstruction: Blockage of the intestine by infolding (intussusception), malformation, tumor, digestive problems, a foreign body, or inflammation. Symptoms can include crampy abdominal pain, lack of ability to eliminate normal feces, and eventually shock. On examining the abdomen, the doctor may feel a mass. Abdominal X-rays may suggest intestinal obstruction, but a barium enema may be needed to show the actual cause. Treatment depends on the cause of the obstruction. See also: Intussusception."
Intestinal parasite,"Intestinal parasite: A parasite (an organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism) in the intestinal tract. Intestinal parasites include both helminths and protozoa. Helminths are worms such as tapeworms, pinworms, and roundworms. All of these worms can live, but typically not reproduce, inside the human intestine. In contrast to worms, which are composed of many cells, protozoa are single-celled organisms that can multiply inside the body. Examples of protozoa that can live in the intestinal tract are Giardia and Cryptosporidium."
Intestine,"Intestine: The long, tubelike organ in the abdomen that completes the process of digestion. It consists of the small and large intestines."
Intracellular,"Intracellular: Within a cell. In contrast to extracellular, meaning outside a cell."
Intracranial,"Intracranial: Within the cranium, the bony dome that houses and protects the brain. An intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding within the cranium due, for example, to a stroke or leakage of blood from an aneurysm in the brain. The intracranial pressure is the pressure on brain and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cranium. Julius Caesar and his fellow Romans called the skull the ""cranium"" Today as a rule the ""cranium"" is taken to be the skull minus the mandible (the jaw bone)."
Intractable,"Intractable: Unstoppable. For example, intractable diarrhea is diarrhea that can't be stopped, even with medication, and intractable pain is pain that can't be stopped, even with medication."
Intradermal,"Intradermal: In the skin. For example, an intradermal injection is given into the skin. Abbreviated ID."
Intraepithelial,"Intraepithelial: Within the layer of cells that forms the surface or lining of an organ. For example, a blister forms fluid in the intraepithelial layer of the skin."
Intrahepatic,"Intrahepatic: Within the liver. For example, a liver tumor is an intrahepatic growth."
Intramuscular (IM),"Intramuscular (IM): An intramuscular (IM) medication is given by needle into the muscle. This is as opposed to a medication that is given by a needle, for example, into the skin (intradermal) or just below the skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein"
Intraocular,"Intraocular: In the eye. For example, intraocular pressure is the pressure within the eye."
Intraocular lens,"Intraocular lens: An artificial lens made of plastic, silicone, acrylic or other material that is implanted in the eye during cataract surgery. Abbreviated IOL."
Intraocular pressure,"Intraocular pressure: The pressure created by the continual renewal of fluids within the eye. The intraocular pressure is increased in glaucoma. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, the intraocular pressure rises because the canal into which the fluid in the front part of the eye normally drains is suddenly blocked. In chronic glaucoma, there is a gradual imbalance between the production and removal (resorption) of the fluid in the back part of the eye (with supply exceeding demand)."
Intraoperative,Intraoperative: During surgery.
Intraoral,Intraoral: Within the mouth.
Intrauterine,Intrauterine: In the uterus.
Intravenous (IV),"Intravenous (IV): 1) Into a vein. Intravenous (IV) medications are a solutions administered directly into the venous circulation via a syringe or intravenous catheter (tube). 2) The actual solution that is administered intravenously. 3) The device used to administer an intravenous solution, such as the familiar IV drip."
Intrinsic,"Intrinsic: 1. An essential or inherent part of a something such as a structure.
2. Coming from within, from the inside. Proteins have intrinsic signals that govern their transport and localization in the cell.
From the Latin intrinsecus meaning situated on the inside. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic."
Intubate,"Intubate: To put a tube in, commonly used to refer to the insertion of a breathing tube into the trachea for mechanical ventilation. For example, as a life-saving measure, an emergency room physician might intubate a patient who is not breathing adequately so that the lungs can be ventilated."
Invasive candidiasis,"Invasive candidiasis: A fungal infection that occurs when Candida (a yeast-like fungus) enters the bloodstream and then spreads through the body. Candida is the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infection among hospitalized patients in the US. A survey found that candidemia (bloodstream infection with Candida) occurs in 8 of every 100,000 persons per year. Persons at high risk for candidemia include low-birth-weight babies, surgical patients, and those whose immune systems are deficient. The symptoms of invasive candidiasis are not specific. Fever and chills that do not improve after antibiotic therapy are the most common symptoms. If the infection spreads to deep organs such as kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes, additional specific symptoms may develop, which vary depending on the site of infection. If the infection does not respond to treatment, the patient's organs may fail and cause death. Invasive candidiasis may result when a person's own Candida organisms, normally found in the digestive tract, enter the bloodstream. On rare occasions, it can also occur when medical equipment or devices become contaminated with Candida. In either case, the infection may spread throughout the body. Invasive candidiasis is usually diagnosed by either culture of blood or tissue or by examining samples of infected tissue under the microscope. Invasive candidiasis is usually treated with an antifungal agent called amphotericin B that is given intravenously(IV) (in the vein) or it may be treated with the azole drugs taken by mouth or IV."
Invert,"Invert: 1) To turn inward. To invert the foot is to move its forepart toward the midline of the body. 2) To turn upside down or inside out. Inversion of the nipple can be normal or be a sign of an underlying tumor. 3) To reverse in position or order. A DNA sequence may be inverted. From the Latin invertere, from in- + vertere to turn."
Involuntary,"Involuntary: Done other than in accordance with the conscious will of the individual. The opposite of voluntary. The terms ""voluntary"" and ""involuntary"" apply to the human nervous system and its control over muscles. The nervous system is divided into two parts -- somatic and autonomic. The somatic nervous system operates muscles that are under voluntary control. The autonomic (automatic or visceral) nervous system regulates individual organ function and is involuntary. Opening the mouth is voluntary while blushing is involuntary."
Involute,"Involute: 1. Literally, to turn inward or roll inward. 2. To decrease in size after an enlargement. The uterus involutes after pregnancy. The thymus involutes after adolescence. 3. To undergo a retrograde change. After treatment, a tumor may involute. 4. To shrink physically and emotionally with advancing age. From the Latin involutio, from in- meaning into + volvere meaning to roll."
Involution,"Involution: A retrograde change. After treatment, a tumor may involute; with advancing age, there may be physical and emotional involution."
Iodine,"Iodine: An element in the diet that is essential for the manufacture of hormones by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroxine (T4), which has four iodine molecules attached to its structure, and triiodothyronine (T3), which has three iodine molecules attached. Iodine is found in seafood, bread, iodized salt, and seaweed."
IOP (intraocular pressure),"IOP (intraocular pressure): The pressure created by the continual renewal of fluids within the eye. The normal IOP varies among individuals. The intraocular pressure is increased in glaucoma. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, the intraocular pressure rises rapidly because the iris blocks the angle in the front of the eye where the anterior chamber fluid normally drains out. In chronic glaucoma, there is a gradual imbalance between the production and removal (resorption) of the fluid in the back part of the eye (with supply exceeding demand)."
Ipecac,"Ipecac: A naturally occurring substance with multiple properties including the ability to cause vomiting (emesis). Ipecac is derived from dried roots of a bush called Uragoga ipecacuanha that is native to Brazil. In the past, a sizable proportion of poison exposures in the U.S. were treated with ipecac. This practice has dropped off and some experts recommend that it should be abandoned, except in rare instances."
Ipsilateral,"Ipsilateral: On the same side, as opposed to contralateral. For example, a tumor involving the right side of the brain may affect vision ipsilaterally'that is, in the right eye."
IPT,IPT: Interpersonal therapy.
IPV,"IPV: Inactivated polio vaccine. The polio virus in IPV has been inactivated (killed). The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is also called the Salk vaccine after the late American physician-virologist Jonas Salk. The vaccines available for vaccination against polio are the IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) and the OPV (oral polio vaccine). IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) is given as a shot in the arm or leg. OPV (oral polio vaccine) is the preferred vaccine for most children. As its name suggests, it is given by mouth. Infants and children should be given four doses of OPV. The doses are given at 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months and 4-6 years of age. Persons allergic to eggs or the drugs neomycin or streptomycin should receive OPV, not the injectable IPV. Conversely, IPV should be given if the vaccine recipient is on long-term steroid (cortisone) therapy, has cancer, or is on chemotherapy or if a household member has AIDS or there is an unimmunized adult in the house."
IQ,"IQ: Abbreviation for intelligence quotient, an attempt to measure the intelligence of someone. The IQ score is usually based upon the results of a written test. To calculate the IQ, the person's mental age (as determined by a test) is divided by their chronologic age and the result is multiplied by 100."
Iron,"Iron: An essential mineral. Iron is necessary for the transport of oxygen (via hemoglobin in red blood cells) and for oxidation by cells (via cytochrome). Deficiency of iron is a common cause of anemia. Food sources of iron include meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables and cereals (especially those fortified with iron). According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowances of iron for women ages 19 to 50 is 18 milligrams per day and for men ages 19+, 8 milligrams per day. Iron overload can damage the heart, liver, gonads and other organs. Iron overload is a particular risk in people who may have certain genetic conditions (hemochromatosis) sometimes without knowing it and also in people receiving recurrent blood transfusions. Iron supplements meant for adults (such as pregnant women) are a major cause of poisoning in children."
Iron deficiency anemia,"Iron deficiency anemia: A common form of nutritional disorder, iron deficiency results in anemia as iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, key molecule in red blood cells responsible for the transport of oxygen. In iron deficiency anemia, the red cells appear abnormal and are unusually small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). The pallor of the red cells reflects their low hemoglobin content. The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia spans all ages and races. In children, iron deficiency causes developmental delays, behavioral disturbances, failure to thrive (grow) and increased infections. Iron deficiency is a major problem in developed countries such as the US, Canada, the UK and across Europe. In developing countries, iron deficiency anemia is frequently exacerbated by malaria and worm infections. The treatment of iron deficiency anemia , whether it be in children or adults, is with iron and iron-containing foods. Food sources of iron include meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables and cereals (especially those fortified with iron). According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowances of iron are 15 milligrams per day for women and 10 milligrams per day for men. Do not give iron supplements to children unless the doctor recommends it. A cause of iron deficiency anemia is the ulcer bacteria. The successful treatment of infection with Helicobacter pylori (the bacteria associated with irritation of the stomach lining and stomach ulcers) may also resolve iron deficiency anemia."
Iron overload,"Iron overload: Iron overload can damage the heart, liver, gonads and other organs. Iron overload is a particular risk for: According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowances of iron are 15 milligrams per day for women and 10 milligrams per day for men."
Irradiation,"Irradiation: The use of high-energy radiation from x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external-beam radiation therapy) or from materials called radioisotopes. Radioisotopes produce radiation and can be placed in or near the tumor or in the area near cancer cells. This type of radiation treatment is called internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, interstitial radiation, or brachytherapy. Systemic radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance, such as a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, that circulates throughout the body. Irradiation is also called radiation therapy, radiotherapy, and x-ray therapy."
Irrigate,"Irrigate: To wash out. For example, one can irrigate a wound to clean it."
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): A common gastrointestinal disorder involving an abnormal condition of gut contractions (motility) and increased gut sensations (visceral hypersensitivity) characterized by abdominal pain / discomfort , gas, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel habits with constipation or diarrhea or alternating diarrhea and constipation. Symptoms tend to be chronic ,intermittent and to wax and wane over the years. Although IBS can cause chronic recurrent abdominal discomfort, it does not lead to any serious abdominal organ problems. Making the diagnosis usually done by suspecting the condition and confirming irritable bowel by excluding other causes of abdominal illnesses. Treatment is directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating a moderate high fiber and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners), exercise, relaxation techniques, and medications. Also called spastic colitis, mucus colitis, nervous colon syndrome."
Ischemia,Ischemia: Inadequate blood supply to a local area due to blockage of blood vessels leading to that area. Treatment is directed toward increasing the circulation to the affected body area.
Iso-,"Iso-: Equal, like, or similar. Iso- is much used in medicine and science as, for example, in isotonic solution (a solution that has the same salt concentration as cells and blood), isotope (a form of a chemical element with the same atomic number as another element but having a different atomic mass), isocellular (composed of cells of the same size and type), and isochromosome (a chromosome with two identical equal arms). The opposite of iso- is aniso-. Iso- is derived from the Greek ""isos"" meaning ""equal or like."""
Isolate,Isolate: To separate from others as during an infectious disease.
Isometropia,"Isometropia: The condition in which both eyes have equal refractive power. If, for example, one eye is myopic (nearsighted), so is the other. Or if one eye is hyperopic (farsighted), so is the other, or neither eye may have a significant refractive error. The term ""isometropia"" is made up of three parts from the Greek: iso- (equal) + -metr- (measure) + -opia (vision). Literally, the measure of vision is equal. The opposite of isometropia is anisometropia in which the two eyes have unequal refractive powers. Anisometropia is a serious concern in newborns and young children because it can lead to amblyopia (impaired vision in one eye). With a major degree of anisometropia, the brain cannot reconcile the difference in images coming from the two eyes. It develops a preference for the image coming from one eye and suppresses the image from the other eye and, in time, the brain loses the ability to ""see"" the image from the suppressed eye."
Isotonic exercise,"Isotonic exercise: Exercise when a contracting muscle shortens against a constant load, as when lifting a weight. Isotonic exercise is one method of muscular exercise. In contrast, isometric exercise is when muscular contractions occur without movement of the involved parts of the body. Isotonic comes from the Greek ""iso-"", equal + ""tonos"", tone = maintaining equal (muscle) tone. The muscle maintains equal tone while shortening in isotonic exercise."
Isotonic solution,Isotonic solution: A solution that has the same salt concentration as cells and blood. Isotonic solutions are commonly used as intravenously infused fluids in hospitalized patients.
ITC,"ITC: In-the-canal (that is, the ear canal). See In-the-canal hearing aid."
Itching,Itching: An uncomfortable sensation in the skin that feels as if something is crawling on the skin and makes the person want to scratch the affected area. Itching is medically known as pruritis; something that is itchy is pruritic.
Itchy ear,"Itchy ear: Itching of the ears. Can be the first sign of an ear infection, but if the problem is chronic, it is more likely caused by a chronic dermatitis of the ear canal. Seborrheic dermatitis and eczema can both affect the ear canal. There is really no cure for this problem, but it can be made tolerable with the use of steroid drops and creams. People with these problems are more prone to acute infectious exacerbations. Use of ear plugs, alcohol drops, and non-instrumentation of the ear is the best prevention for infection. Other allergy type treatments may also help itchy ears."
itis,"itis: Suffix meaning inflammation. For example, colitis is literally colon inflammation or figuratively inflammation of the colon. The ending -itis is one of the building blocks derived from Greek (in this case) or Latin used to construct medical terms."
ITN,"ITN: Insecticide-treated bednet. ""Provision of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) is universally accepted as an efficacious and essential public health service in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa endemic for malaria."" (H Guyatt and S Ochola, Lancet 2003;362:1549) See: Bednet."
IU (international unit),"International unit (IU): An international unit (IU) is an internationally accepted amount of a substance. This type of measure is used for the fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D and E) and certain hormones, enzymes, and biologicals (such as vaccines). All international units are officially defined by the International Conference for Unification of Formulae."
IUD (intrauterine contraceptive device),"IUD (intrauterine contraceptive device): A device inserted into the uterus (womb) to prevent conception (pregnancy). The IUD can be a coil, loop, triangle, or T in shape made of plastic or metal. An IUD is inserted into the uterus by a health-care professional. How IUDs prevent pregnancy is not entirely clear. They seem to prevent sperm and eggs from meeting by either immobilizing the sperm on their way to the fallopian tubes or by changing the uterine lining so the fertilized egg cannot implant in it. IUDs have one of the lowest failure rates of any contraceptive method. "" In the population for which the IUD is appropriate -- for those in a mutually monogamous, stable relationship who are not at a high risk of infection -- the IUD is considered a safe and effective contraception method. However, the IUD's image suffered when the Dalkon Shield IUD, which was associated with a high incidence of pelvic infections, infertility and some deaths, was taken in 1975 off the market. Today, serious complication from IUDs are rare, although IUD users may be at increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease. Other side effects can include perforation of the uterus, abnormal bleeding, and cramps. Complications occur most often during and immediately after insertion. This is in part based on information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA)."
IV (intravenous),"IV (intravenous): Within a vein. IV is the abbreviation for ""intravenous."" The word ""intravenous"" is quite properly an adjective. In this guise, it entered the English language around 1849. It means, according to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, ""situated, performed, or occurring within or entering by way of a vein."" Some examples of the use of ""intravenous"" as an adjective: The accompanying adverb is ""intravenously"", as in: ""The glucose was given intravenously."" The word ""intravenous"" as a noun refers to an intravenous fluid drip, a solution (usually a balanced electrolyte solution) administered directly into the venous circulation. Also called a drip."
IVC,"IVC: 1. Intravenous cholangiogram, an X-ray study of the gallbladder. 2. Inferior vena cava, the largest vein coming up below the heart to it. As an IVC filter."
Jammed finger,"Jammed finger: Lay terminology that refers to an injury of the finger joints. The most common joint affected is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP), the joint formed by the first and second finger bones. A jammed finger occurs because of an on-end injury to the tip of a finger. The injury most commonly occurs during athletic activity, particularly with ball-handling sports. The term is not medically precise, and a variety of injuries to the finger may actually occur when the finger is ""jammed,"" including tendon or ligament damage, as well as fracture or dislocation of the bones. This type of injury may be very painful. Treatment and outcome depend upon the severity and type of injury."
Jaundice,"Jaundice: Yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile pigment bilirubin. The yellowing extends to other tissues and body fluids. Jaundice was once called the ""morbus regius"" (the regal disease) in the belief that only the touch of a king could cure it. When red blood cells are removed from the bloodstream, hemoglobin, the molecule in red cells that carries oxygen, is broken down into bilirubin. The bilirubin is carried to the liver and excreted into the intestine as a component of bile. Jaundice can indicate liver or gallbladder disease. When the excretion of bilirubin is hindered, excess bilirubin passes into the blood, resulting in jaundice. Inflammation or other abnormalities of liver cells hinder the excretion of bilirubin into bile. Or the bile ducts outside the liver may be blocked by a gallstone or a tumor. Jaundice can also result from the excessive breakdown of red blood cells (a process called hemolysis) and too much bilirubin is released into the bloodstream. This occurs typically in the hemolytic anemias (as opposed to the aplastic anemias in which not enough red cells are produced). Jaundice is common in newborns because there is some hemolysis during labor and delivery and the newborn's liver is immature and may not be fully up to the task of handling the bilirubin for a few days. In Gilbert syndrome, the blood bilirubin levels are slightly increased, enough to cause mild jaundice. This genetic condition is usually discovered serendipitously during routine screening tests of liver function. It causes no symptoms and no problems. The figurative use of ""jaundice"" in ""to view things with a jaundiced eye"" refers to an attitude of distaste. This may reflect the distaste with which a jaundiced person views food, since severe jaundice typically brings loss of appetite and feelings nausea. ""Jaundice"" is often said to have come from the French ""jaune"" for yellow. This is incorrect. The word ""jaundice"" stemmed from the Latin ""galbinus"" which described a light greenish-yellow color. In Old French this became ""jaunisse"" and, in crossing the English Channel, it became ""jaundice."" In French ""jaundice"" is still ""jaunisse."" The term icterus is synonymous with jaundice. A person who is icteric is jaundiced. Abnormally high blood bilirubin is termed hyperbilirubinemia."
Jejunostomy,Jejunostomy: A surgical operation to create an opening of the jejunum (a part of the small intestine).This can be done thru an abdominal incision or endoscopically. Usually refers to a procedure to establish enteral feeding but commonly done by a surgeon for one of many other reasons during a surgical procedure.
Jejunum,"Jejunum: Part of the small intestine. It is half-way down the small intestine between its duodenum and ileum sections. The term ""jejunum"" derives from the Latin ""jejunus,"" which means ""empty of food,"" ""meager,"" or ""hungry."" The ancient Greeks noticed at death that this part of the intestine was always empty of food. Hence, the name the jejunum. The Latin ""jejunus"" also gave rise to ""jejune"" means lacking in nutritive value and devoid of substance, significance or interest, that is dull. A jejune argument is one that is empty (like the jejunum) and totally devoid of interest."
JIP,JIP: Juvenile intestinal polyposis. See: Juvenile polyposis.
Jock itch,"Jock itch: A common fungal infection sometimes referred to as ringworm, involving the skin of the inner thighs, buttocks, and genitals. Also known as tinea cruris. It occurs most frequently in people who are overweight and/or who sweat profusely, such as athletes. Symptoms include an itchy, red, sometimes ring-shaped rash. Treatment involves topical or oral antifungal medications."
Johnny,"Johnny: A hospital gown. A johnny is a short collarless gown that ties in the back, worn by patients being examined or treated in a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. Johnnies are generally disliked by patients as skimpy, ugly, ill-fitting garments often leaves one's backside ignominiously exposed. In British slang, a johnny is also a condom."
Joint,"Joint: The area where two bones are attached for the purpose of permitting body parts to move. A joint is usually formed of fibrous connective tissue and cartilage. Joints are grouped according to their type of motion: ball-and-socket joint; hinge joint; condyloid joint, which permits all forms of angular movement except axial rotation; pivot joint; gliding joint; or saddle joint. Joints can move in only four ways: gliding, in which one bony surface glides on another, without angular or rotatory movement; angular, a movement that occurs only between long bones, increasing or decreasing the angle between the bones; circumduction, which occurs in joints composed of the head of a bone and an articular cavity, with the long bone describing a series of circles and the whole forming a cone; and rotation, in which a bone moves about a central axis without moving from this axis. Also known as articulation and arthrosis."
Jugular vein,"Jugular vein: The jugular veins are in the neck and drain blood from the head, brain, face and neck and convey it toward the heart. The external jugular vein collects most of the blood from the outside of the skull and the deep parts of the face. It lies outside the sternocleidomastoid muscle, passes down the neck and joins the subclavian vein. The internal jugular vein collects blood from the brain, the outside of the face and the neck. It runs down the inside of the neck outside the internal and common carotid arteries and unites with the subclavian vein to form the innominate vein. The jugular veins are particularly prominent during congestive heart failure. When the patient is sitting or in a semirecumbent position, the height of the jugular veins and their pulsations provides an estimate of the central venous pressure and gives important information about whether the heart is keeping up with the demands on it or is failing. The word ""jugular"" refers to the throat or neck. It derives from the Latin ""jugulum"" meaning throat or collarbone and the Latin ""jugum"" meaning yoke. To go for the jugular is to attack a vital part that is particularly vulnerable."
Juxta-,"Juxta-: Prefix meaning near, nearby, or close, as in juxtaspinal (near the spinal column) and juxta-vesicular (near the bladder)."
Juxtaarticular,"Juxtaarticular: Near a joint. For example, a juxta-articular fracture is a break near a joint."
Kala-azar,"Kala-azar: A chronic and potentially fatal parasitic disease of the viscera (the internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes) due to infection by the parasite called Leishmania donovani. Leishmania donovani, the agent of kala-azar, is transmitted by sandfly bites in parts of Asia (primarily India), Africa (primarily Sudan) and South America (primarily Brazil) where all together there are an estimated half million cases per year. There are also several hundred cases yearly in Europe (primarily in the Mediterranean region) and a few in North America. Kala-azar can cause no or few symptoms but typically it is associated with fever, loss of appetite (anorexia), fatigue, enlargement of the liver, spleen and nodes and suppression of the bone marrow. Kala-azar also increases the risk of other secondary infections. The first oral drug found to be effective for treating kala-azar is miltefosine. The term ""kala-azar"" comes from India where it is the Hindi for black fever. The disease is also known as Indian leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leishmania infection, dumdum fever, black sickness, and black fever. The name ""Leischmania donovani"" honors two men: the British pathologist William Boog Leishman who in 1903 wrote about the protozoa that causes kala-azar and the researcher C. Donovan, who made the same discovery independently the same year."
Kalemia,"Kalemia: The presence of potassium in the blood. The word ""kalemia"" is seldom used today although it is the basis for the terms for abnormally high blood potassium (hyperkalemia) and low blood potassium (hypokalemia). See also: Potassium balance."
Karyocyte,"Karyocyte: Any cell that possesses a nucleus. A neuron (nerve cell) is a karyocyte; it has a nucleus. A mature erythrocyte (red blood cell) is not a karyocyte; it lacks a nucleus. The term ""karyocyte"" is made up of ""kary-"" from the Greek ""karyon"" meaning ""nut or kernel"" + ""-cyte"" from the Greek ""kytos"" meaning a ""hollow vessel"" = a hollow vessel (a cell) containing a nut or kernel (a nucleus)."
Karyokinesis,"Karyokinesis: During cell division, the process of partition of a cell's nucleus into the daughter cells. See also: Cytokinesis; Mitosis."
Kashin-Beck disease,"Kashin-Beck disease: A disorder of the bones and joints of the hands and fingers, elbows, knees, and ankles of children and adolescents who slowly develop stiff deformed joints, shortened limb length and short stature due to necrosis (death) of the growth plates of bones and of joint cartilage. The disorder is endemic in some areas of eastern Siberia, Korea, China and Tibet and is probably of environmental origin, as evidenced by the fact that it occurs in children who move into the endemic areas and children with it who move away get better. Selenium supplementation has no effect on established Kashin-Beck disease. Iodine deficiency should be corrected. It is clearly a factor in the disease. Also called Kashin-Bek disease. The people in the areas subject to the disorder called it big bone disease."
KB,KB: 1. The skin disease Keratodermia blennorrhagicum. 2. Kilobase of DNA. The preferred abbreviation for kilobase is kb in lower case letters.
Keratin,"Keratin: A protein found in the upper layer of the skin, hair, and nails, and in animal horns."
Keratitis,"Keratitis: Inflammation of the cornea. Keratitis can occur due to abrasion trauma, infection, or underlying diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome and lupus. Keratitis can lead to blindness."
Kerato-,"Kerato: Prefix that can refer either to the cornea (as in keratitis and keratocornea) or to ""horny"" tissue (as in keratin and keratosis)."
Keratodermia blennorrhagicum,"Keratodermia blennorrhagicum: A skin disease that occurs in patients with reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter's syndrome). Abbreviated KB. Classically, the areas of the skin that are involved are the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, although other body surfaces may also be affected. The inflammation of the skin can come and go. When the inflammation is present, it appears as patches of reddish, raised pustules that can be painful and tender. These patchy areas may group together and peel periodically. KB can be treated with topical medications, including skin softeners (emollients) and medications that clear off the peeling, dry skin (keratolytic medications). Sometimes these treatments are used along with vitamin D creams, such as calcipotriene. Emotional stress and certain medications may aggravate the condition."
Keratoma,"Keratoma: An area of hardened skin, usually called a callus which is usually a response to frictional trauma to the skin."
Keratosis,"Keratosis: A localized horny overgrowth of the skin, such as a wart or callus. Among the common types of keratosis are actinic keratosis and seborrheic keratosis."
Ketoacidosis,"Ketoacidosis: A feature of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus characterized by a combination of ketosis and acidosis. Ketosis is the accumulation of substances called keytones and ketone bodies in the blood. Acidosis is increased acidity of the blood. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include slow, deep breathing with a fruity odor to the breath; confusion; frequent urination (polyuria); poor appetite; and eventually loss of consciousness. The treatment of ketoacidosis is a matter of urgency and is usually done in a hospital. It may require the administration of intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, and the institution of changes in the person's diet. See also diabetes mellitus and ketone bodies."
Ketone bodies,"Ketone bodies: Chemicals that the body makes when there is not enough insulin in the blood and it must break down fat instead of the sugar glucose for energy. The ketone bodies -- acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate -- are toxic acidic chemicals. They build up in the blood and then spill over into the urine. The body can also rid itself of acetone through the lungs. This gives the breath a fruity odor. The presence of ketone bodies in the blood is termed ketosis and the presence of ketone bodies in the urine is called ketonuria."
Ketonuria,"Ketonuria: A condition in which abnormally high amounts of ketones and keytone bodies (a byproduct of the breakdown of cells) are present in the urine. Ketonuria is a sign seen in diabetes mellitus that is out of control. Diabetics prone to ketonuria need to monitor their urine for signs of ketone buildup that could lead to life-threatening symptoms unless promptly treated. Ketonuria can also develop as a result of fasting, dieting, starvation and eating disorders. Alternate names for ketonuria include ketoaciduria and acetonuria. Digestion and the Role of Insulin When food is digested, the body turns fats, proteins and carbohydrates into components that sustain and nurture the body. Fats are converted into fatty acids, proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose (a sugar) that enters the bloodstream. The body needs glucose as fuel to perform activities. However, glucose has to be delivered. It does not automatically route itself to body sites requiring fuel. Insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas, carries out this task, delivering glucose to cells throughout the body. Muscles and tissues then have the energy to do their jobs. Ketones and Ketone Bodies: What They Are, How They Accumulate In some people with diabetes mellitus, the pancreas releases insufficient amounts of insulin or no insulin at all. Consequently, glucose goes largely undelivered. In a desperate attempt to provide fuel, the body begins feeding on itself -- that is, it breaks down muscle and fat to burn as fuel. Ketone bodies are a byproduct of this process. Ketone bodies consist chemically of three substances (beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone). When ketone bodies are released, they enter the bloodstream, acidify the blood, and are eventually excreted mostly in urine. (One type of ketone body exits via the lungs.) Without treatment, glucose and ketone bodies may build to dangerous levels in the blood. Stress and illness can increase the risk of glucose and ketone buildup. When glucose and ketone bodies build to very high levels, the following conditions then exist: 1. Hyperglycemia: too much sugar in the blood. 2. Ketoacidosis: too many ketone bodies in the blood. 3. Ketonuria: accumulation of ketone bodies in the urine. When ketone is excreted, sodium is excreted along with it. Symptoms and Treatment Symptoms of glucose and ketone-body overload include thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, heavy breathing, dilation of the pupils and confusion resulting from the toxic effects of ketone bodies and acid accumulation on the brain. In addition, the symptoms may also include a breath odor resembling the smell of fruit. (One type of ketone, acetone, is excreted through the lungs, causing the fruity smell.) This symptom-complex can progress to coma and death. Treatment with insulin and intravenous fluids can restore normal levels of blood sugar and end ketoacidosis and ketonuria. Prevention Prevention of emergencies in diabetics prone to ketonuria requires close monitoring of the levels of glucose in the blood and ketone bodies in the urine. Although ketone-body overload in the blood occurs primarily in type 1 diabetics, it can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is commonly recommended that all diabetics should closely monitor not only their glucose levels but also their ketone levels. Home tests kits are available to check both glucose and ketone levels. Ketogenic Diet Ironically, ketonuria is a desired effect of a special ""ketogenic diet"" used to prevent or reduce the number of seizures in people with epilepsy (seizure disorders). Some physicians use this diet when conventional medications fail to control seizures or when the side effects of medications become intolerable. The ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in protein and carbohydrates, mimics starvation and raises the level of ketone bodies in the blood. The ketone bodies can prevent or decrease the incidence of many types of seizures, including myoclonic (spastic) and atonic (drop) seizures. They may also limit other types of seizures, including so-called staring spells. Why ketone bodies may inhibit such seizures is not known. The ketogenic diet is very strict and must be closely managed under a physician's supervision. Only a limited number of medical centers are equipped and trained to prescribe it."
Kidney,"Kidney: One of a pair of organs located in the right and left side of the abdomen. The kidneys remove waste products from the blood and produce urine. As blood flows through the kidneys, the kidneys filter waste products, chemicals, and unneeded water from the blood. Urine collects in the middle of each kidney, in an area called the renal pelvis. It then drains from the kidney through a long tube, the ureter, to the bladder, where it is stored until elimination. The kidneys also make substances that help control blood pressure and regulate the formation of red blood cells."
Kidney stone,"Kidney stone: A stone in the kidney or a stone that originates in the kidney but has passed lower down in the urinary tract. Kidney stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. The development of kidney stones is related to decreased urine volume or to increased excretion of stone-forming components, such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine-collecting area (pelvis) of the kidney and may range in size from tiny to 'staghorn' stones the size of the renal pelvis itself. Factors that predispose people to kidney stones include reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause high uric acid (hyperuricemia), and a history of gout. Pain from kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and intermittent, and not improved by changes in position, and it radiates from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones do not. Several factors influence the ability to pass a stone, including the size of the person, prior stone passage, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, and the size of the stone. If a stone does not pass, the help of a urology specialist may be needed. Routine treatment includes relief of pain, hydration, and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, administration of antibiotics. Also known as nephrolithiasis."
Kilocalorie,"Kilocalorie: The term used to represent the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a liter of water one degree centigrade at sea level. In nutrition terms, the word calorie is commonly used to refer to a unit of food energy. (The word calorie is used instead of the more precise scientific term kilocalorie.) Technically, however, this common usage of the word calorie of food energy is understood to refer to a kilocalorie (and actually represents, therefore, 1000 true calories of energy)."
Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome,"Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome: Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease). Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome is a kidney condition associated with long-standing diabetes. It affects the network of tiny blood vessels (the microvasculature) in the glomerulus, a key structure in the kidney that is composed of capillary blood vessels and which is critically necessary for the filtration of the blood. Features of Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome include the nephrotic syndrome with excessive filtration of protein into the urine (proteinuria), high blood pressure (hypertension), and progressively impaired kidney function. When severe, Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome leads to kidney failure, end-stage renal disease, and the need for chronic kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant. The disorder is named for Paul Kimmelstein (1900-70), a German-born pathologist in the U.S., and Clifford Wilson (1906-), an English physician. It is also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease or intercapillary glomerulonephritis."
Kinetics,"Kinetics: Kinetics (with an ""s"" at the end) refers to the rate of change in a biochemical (or other) reaction, the study of reaction rates. Kinetics is a noun. It is distinct from ""kinetic"" (an adjective) meaning with movement. The opposite of kinetic is akinetic meaning without movement. In neurology, kinetic and akinetic serve to denote the presence or absence of movement. Kinetic comes from the Greek word ""kinesis"" for motion. The term ""akinetic"" is put together from the prefix ""a-"" meaning ""without"" + ""kinesis"" = without motion. Kinesis is verbatim from the Greek ""kinesis."""
Kiss,"Kiss: A touch or caress with the lips. ""The anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction."" -- Henry Gibbons, Sr., MD (1808-1884) (This definition does not apply universally as a kiss can also refer to the single application of one's lips against anything else.)"
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome,"Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome: A congenital malformation syndrome characterized by the triad of asymmetric limb hypertrophy, hemangiomata, and nevi. ""Asymmetric limb hypertrophy"" is enlargement of one limb and not the corresponding limb on the other side, the enlarged limb being 3 times more likely to be a leg than an arm in KTW; and the limb enlargement is of bone as well as soft tissue. The hemangiomas, abnormal nests of blood vessels that proliferate inappropriately and excessively, cover a remarkable range from small innocuous capillary hemangiomas (""strawberry marks"") to huge cavernous hemangiomas. The nevi are pigmented moles on the skin; in KTW there are often also dark linear streaks on the skin, streaks due to too much pigment. There can be other abnormalities but the triad is the consistent clinical centerpiece of the disease. Most persons with KTW have an enlarged leg and do relatively well without treatment or, for example, with only compression from an elastic stocking. Skin ulcers and other skin problems can occur over the swollen leg. Usually, the treatment is conservative. Surgery is almost never needed. The only possible exceptions are the very rare situations in which the leg reaches gigantic proportions or secondary clotting difficulties arise (due to trapping and destruction of blood platelets in a huge hemangioma). Then, amputation may become necessary. The cause of KTW syndrome is unknown."
Knee,"Knee: The knee is a joint which has three parts. The thigh bone (the femur) meets the large shin bone (the tibia) to form the main knee joint. This joint has an inner (medial) and an outer (lateral) compartment. The kneecap (the patella) joins the femur to form a third joint, called the patellofemoral joint. The patella protects the front of the knee joint. The knee joint is surrounded by a joint capsule with ligaments strapping the inside and outside of the joint (collateral ligaments) as well as crossing within the joint (cruciate ligaments). The collateral ligaments run along the sides of the knee and limit the sideways motion of the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects the tibia to the femur at the center of the knee and functions to limit rotation and forward motion of the tibia. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) located just behind the ACL limits the backward motion of the tibia. All of these ligaments provide stability and strength to the knee joint. The meniscus is a thickened cartilage pad between the two joints formed by the femur and tibia. The meniscus acts as a smooth surface for the joint to move on. The knee joint is surrounded by fluid- filled sacs called bursae, which serve as gliding surfaces that reduce friction of the tendons. Below the kneecap, there is a large tendon (patellar tendon) which attaches to the front of the tibia bone. There are large blood vessels passing through the area behind the knee (referred to as the popliteal space). The large muscles of the thigh move the knee. In the front of the thigh the quadriceps muscles extend the knee joint. In the back of the thigh, the hamstring muscles flex the knee. The knee also rotates slightly under guidance of specific muscles of the thigh. The knee functions to allow movement of the leg and is critical to normal walking. The knee flexes normally to a maximum of 135 degrees and extends to 0 degrees. The bursae, or fluid-filled sacs, serve as gliding surfaces for the tendons to reduce the force of friction as these tendons move. The knee is a weight-bearing joint. Each meniscus serves to evenly load the surface during weight- bearing and also adds in disbursing joint fluid for joint lubrication."
Kneecap,"Kneecap: The patella, the small bone in the front of the knee. The patella is a little (sesamoid) bone, embedded in the tendon of insertion of the quadriceps muscle. If the patella is shattered beyond repair, it can be removed in an operation called a patellectomy and sometimes replaced with prosthetic material."
Koch's postulates,"Koch's postulates: In 1890 the German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch set out his celebrated criteria for judging whether a given bacteria is the cause of a given disease. Koch's criteria brought some much-needed scientific clarity to what was then a very confused field. Koch's postulates are as follows: However, Koch's postulates have their limitations and so may not always be the last word. They may not hold if: A harmless bacteria may cause disease if: Despite such limitations, Koch's postulates are still a useful benchmark in judging whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a bacteria (or any other type of microorganism) and a clinical disease."
Koplik's spots,"Koplik's spots: Little spots inside the mouth that are highly characteristic of the early phase of measles (rubeola). The spots look like a tiny grains of white sand, each surrounded by a red ring. They are found especially on the inside of the cheek (the buccal mucosa) opposite the 1st and 2nd upper molars. Named for the New York pediatrician Henry Koplik (1858-1927) who described them."
KUB,"KUB: Abbreviation for kidney, ureter, and bladder."
Labia,"Labia: Lips, the fleshy folds that surround the opening of the mouth (oral labia) or the vagina (the labia majora and labia minora)."
Labia majora,Labia majora: The larger (major) outside pair of labia (lips) of the vulva (the female external genitalia).
Labia minora,Labia minora: The smaller (minor) inside pair of labia (lips) of the vulva (the female external genitalia).
Labial sounds,"Labial sounds: The lips are not only anatomic features of note, they are organs of speech essential to certain articulations. A sound requiring the participation of one or both lips is a labial (labium in Latin means lip) sound or, simply, a labial. All labials are consonants. There are bilabial sounds such as ""p"" which involve both lips and labiodental sounds such as ""v"" which involve the upper teeth and lower lip."
Labile,"Labile: Unstable. For example, labile blood pressure is blood pressure that abnormally increases and decreases frequently."
Lability,"Lability: The state or quality of being labile: susceptible to change, error or instability. From the Latin labilis meaning prone to slip, from labi meaning to slip. See also: Labile."
Labor,"Labor: Childbirth, the process of delivering a baby and the placenta, membranes, and umbilical cord from the uterus to the vagina to the outside world. During the first stage of labor (which is called dilation), the cervix dilates fully to a diameter of about 10 cm (2 inches). The first stage of labor is divided into two phases: the latent phase and the active phase. In the latent phase, contractions become progressively more coordinated and the cervix dilates to 4 cm (approximately 1.5 inches). The latent phase averages about 8 hours for a nullipara (a woman having her first baby) and 5 hours for a multipara (a woman having a subsequent baby). In the active phase, the cervix becomes fully dilated and the presenting part of the baby descends into the midpelvis. The active phase averages about 5 hours for a nullipara and 2 hours for a multipara. In the second stage (which is called expulsion), the baby moves out through the cervix and vagina to be born. Expulsion generally lasts 2 hours for a nullipara and l hour for a multipara. The third stage of labor begins with the delivery of the baby and ends when the placenta and membranes are expelled. Also known as parturition and childbirth."
Laboratory,"Laboratory: A place for doing tests and research procedures, and for preparing chemicals and some medications. Also known as lab."
Labra,"Labra: The plural of labrum, a ring of fibrocartilage (fibrous cartilage) around the edge of the articular (joint) surface of a bone. In Latin, ""labrum"" means ""lip."" The term is generally used to designate a lip, edge, or brim."
Labrum,"Labrum: In medicine, a ring of fibrocartilage (fibrous cartilage) around the edge of the articular (joint) surface of a bone. The term labrum is used in anatomy to designate a lip, edge, or brim. Plural: labra. The glenoid labrum is a ring of fibrocartilage that runs around the cavity of the scapula (wingbone) in which the head of the humerus (the bone in the upper arm) fits. The labrum deepens this cavity (the glenoid cavity) and effectively increases the surface of the shoulder joint. Injuries to the glenoid labrum can occur from chronic trauma due to repetitive shoulder motion or from acute trauma. For example, from a fall on an outstretched arm, a direct blow to the shoulder, a sudden pull from trying to lift a heavy object, or a violent motion like pitching a baseball. Signs and symptoms of a glenoid labrum injury include pain accompanying overhead arm motion, occasional pain in the shoulder at night or during daily activities, decreased range of motion and loss of strength in the shoulder. Treatment may include anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles may then be recommended. If these measures are not effective, arthroscopic surgery may be done. The acetabular labrum is a ring of fibrocartilage that runs around the acetabulum (cup) of the hip joint and increases its depth. The causes of injury to the acetabular labrum, the signs and symptoms, and treatment are like those for a glenoid labrum injury. Labrum was borrowed from the Latin for lip. Labrum also gave rise to a number of other words including labia, labial; labrose, and, circuitously, lip."
Labyrinthitis,"Labyrinthitis: Inflammation of the labyrinth of the ear, which can be accompanied by vertigo. Labyrinthitis has many potential causes including virus infection, M'ni're's disease, and autoimmune disease."
Lacrimation,"Lacrimation: Shedding tears, or shedding more tears than is normal (for example, as a result of eye injury or irritation)."
Lactic acidosis,"Lactic acidosis: Acidosis (too much acid in the body) due to the buildup of lactic acid in the body. Lactic acidosis occurs when cells make lactic acid (from glucose) faster than it can be metabolized. The key signs of lactic acidosis include unusually deep and rapid breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Lactic acidosis is a feature of different disorders, usually indicating a metabolic derangement in the acid-base system of the body. Sometimes associated with severe infection, and can be a rare side effect of some medications such as metformin (Glucophage)."
Lactobacillus,"Lactobacillus: A bacterium normally found in the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina. Lactobacillus can also live in fermenting products, such as yogurt. Humans appear to have a symbiotic relationship with this bacteria: some types have become an important part of food digestion, although Lactobacillus can also contribute to cavities in the teeth if allowed to remain too long within the mouth."
Lactobacillus acidophilus,"Lactobacillus acidophilus: This bacteria is part of the normal flora of the human and animal mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina. As normal flora, it helps to prevent overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria by maintaining an acidic environment. Acidophilus and some related bacteria are considered to be ""probiotic"" because they may help the body maintain or restore its normal balance of helpful bacteria. The use of antibiotics can decimate the normal flora in the body. Some healthcare professionals recommend probiotics to counter the side effect of antibiotic use. L. acidophilus is found in milk and fermented products like yogurt with ""active cultures"" and in the form of supplements. See also probiotics."
Lactose,"Lactose: The sugar found in milk. Lactose is a large sugar molecule that is made up of two smaller sugar molecules, glucose and galactose. In order for lactose to be absorbed from the intestine and into the body, it must first be split into glucose and galactose. The glucose and galactose are then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine. The enzyme that splits lactose into glucose and galactose is called lactase, and it is located on the surface of the cells lining the small intestine. Lactose intolerance is a common medical condition that results in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gas (flatulence) and is caused by reduced or absent activity of enzyme lactase. When there is a deficiency of lactase, the lactose in the intestine cannot be split for digestion."
LAMB syndrome,"LAMB syndrome: Acronym for Lentigines, Atrial myxomas, Mucocutaneous myxomas, and Blue nevi. Now included in the Carney complex. See: Carney complex."
Lancet,"Lancet: A small, pointed knife that is used to prick a finger for a blood test."
Landry ascending paralysis,"Landry ascending paralysis: A particularly virulent form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The disorder often begins with a flu-like illness that brings on general physical weakness, but is then characterized by rapidly progressing paralysis that starts in the legs and arms, and may move on (ascend) to affect the breathing muscles and face. As with less severe forms of Guillain-Barre, the exact cause is not yet known but presumed to be viral and/or autoimmune. Hospitalization is usually required, and treatment is by plasmapheresis or intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG). See also Demyelination; Guillain-Barre syndrome."
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) by laparoscopy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed through several small incisions. The laparoscope, a small thin tube, is put into the abdomen through a tiny cut made just below the navel. The surgeon can then see the gallbladder on a TV monitor and do the surgery with tools inserted in three other small cuts made in the right upper part of the abdomen. The gallbladder is then taken out through one of the incisions. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy permits a shorter hospital stay and shorter recovery time with less pain. Possible complications may include bleeding, infection and injury to the bile duct, intestines or major blood vessels. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides a safe and effective treatment for most patients with symptomatic gallstones and has become the treatment of choice for many patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases pain and disability without increasing mortality or overall morbidity. Although the rate of common bile duct injury appears increased, this rate is still sufficiently small to justify the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. The cost of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is equal to or slightly less than that of open cholecystectomy. The outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is influenced greatly by the training, experience, skill, and judgment of the surgeon. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, when the anatomy is obscured, excessive bleeding occurs, or other problems arise, the operation should be converted promptly to open cholecystectomy. See also: Open cholecystectomy."
Laparoscopy,"Laparoscopy: A type of surgery in which small incisions are made in the abdominal wall through which a laparoscope and other instruments can be placed to permit structures within the abdomen and pelvis to be seen. A variety of probes or other instruments can also be pushed through these small incisions in the skin. In this way, a number of surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision."
Laryngeal,Laryngeal: Having to do with the larynx (voice box).
Laryngectomee,"Laryngectomee: A person who has had his or her larynx (voice box) removed. A partial laryngectomy preserves the voice. The surgeon removes only part of the voice box, just one vocal cord, part of a cord, or just the epiglottis, and the stoma is temporary. After a brief recovery period, the trache tube is removed, and the stoma closes up. The patient can then breathe and talk in the usual way. In some cases, however, the voice may be hoarse or weak. In a total laryngectomy, the whole voice box is removed, and the stoma is permanent. The patient, called a laryngectomee, breathes through the stoma. A laryngectomee must learn to speak with air coming from the esophagus, an external device, or implanted prosthesis."
Laryngitis,"Laryngitis: An inflammation of the larynx. Inflammation of the larynx is most often caused by viral infections. In these cases, other symptoms, such as sore throat, cough, difficulty swallowing, and fever, generally occur. The voice changes may persist after the fever and other symptoms of acute infection have resolved. Laryngitis can also occur as a result of irritation to the vocal cords. People such as singers, cheerleaders, or even small children after bouts of screaming may find that they become hoarse or speak with a 'gravelly' voice after prolonged overuse. Environmental causes of irritation of the airway that can result in inflammation of the larynx include exposure to tobacco smoke or other chemicals."
Larynx,"Larynx: A tube-shaped organ in the neck that contains the vocal cords. The larynx is about 5 cm (2 in.) long. It is part of the respiratory system and is located between the pharynx and the trachea. Humans use the larynx to breathe, talk, and swallow. Its outer wall of cartilage forms the area of the front of the neck referred to as the Adam's apple. The vocal cords, two bands of muscle, form a V inside the larynx. Each time a person inhales, air goes into the nose or mouth, then through the larynx, down the trachea, and into the lungs. When a person exhales, the air goes the other way. The vocal cords are relaxed during breathing, and air moves through the space between them without making any sound. The vocal cords tighten up and move closer together for speech. Air from the lungs is forced between them and makes them vibrate, producing the sound of a voice. The openings of the esophagus and the larynx are very close together in the throat. When a person swallows, a flap called the epiglottis moves down over the larynx to keep food out of the windpipe. Also known as voice box."
Lassitude,"Lassitude: Weakness, weariness, listlessness, exhaustion, lethargy. For example, the patient complained of lassitude. From Latin lassitudo, from lassus meaning weary."
Last menstrual period,"Last menstrual period: By convention, pregnancies are dated in weeks starting from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). If her menstrual periods are regular and ovulation occurs on day 14 of her cycle, conception takes place about 2 weeks after her LMP. A woman is therefore considered to be 6 weeks pregnant 2 weeks after her first missed period. A woman's obstetric date is different from the embryologic date (the age of the embryo). The obstetric date is about 2 weeks longer than the embryologic date."
Latent,"Latent: Hidden, dormant, inactive. The virus that causes chickenpox remains latent after the initial attack of chickenpox is over. When it becomes reactivated, usually many years later, the virus causes shingles. HIV may remain in a small long-lived population of infected T cells. These cells provide a source for renewed replication of the virus following the cessation of therapy."
Lateral,"Lateral: 1. In anatomy, the side of the body or a body part that is farther from the middle or center of the body. Typically, lateral refers to the outer side of the body part, but it is also used to refer to the side of a body part. For example, when referring to the knee, lateral refers to the side of the knee farthest from the opposite knee. The opposite of lateral is medial.
2. In radiology, slang for a lateral X-ray. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Lateral Canthotomy and Cantholysis,"Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis is a surgical procedure most commonly used for the emergency treatment of orbital compartment syndrome, which is an emergency condition characterized by increased pressure within the orbit of the eye due to any cause. Immediate treatment is required to preserve vision. With lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, the lateral canthal tendons that attach the eyelids to the orbital rim are cut so that the pressure within the orbit can be released. This procedure is also performed on the medial canthal tendons (medial canthotomy and cantholysis)."
Lateral X-ray,Lateral X-ray: An X-ray taken from the side of the patient.
Lavage,"Lavage: Washing out. Gastric lavage, for example, is the washing out of the stomach to remove drugs or poisons."
LAVH,"LAVH: Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy, a procedure using laparoscopic techniques to remove the uterus (womb) and/or tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). In LAVH, several small incisions (cuts) are made in the abdominal wall through which slender metal tubes known as ""trocars"" are inserted to provide passage for a laparoscope and other microsurgical tools. The laparoscope is essentially a tiny telescope. A camera attached to it provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen which the surgeon during the operation. In the course of LAVH, the uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other pelvic structures using the laparoscopic tools. If the tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are also detached from their ligaments and blood supply. Then whatever is to removed is taken out through an incision made in the vagina. Since the incisions are small, the scarring, pain and recovery time from LAVH are usually less than with an abdominal hysterectomy which requires both a vaginal incision and a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) long incision in the abdomen. Not all hysterectomies can be done by LAVH. There are certain conditions that necessitate abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy."
Laxative,"Laxative: Something that promotes emptying of the bowels. Laxatives are used to combat constipation. They are sometimes overused, producing diarrhea. Laxatives include milk of magnesia and many others."
hands,"Laying on of hands: In alternative medicine, an ancient method of healing by touching a person with the hands or palms, usually on the head, shoulders, or waist. Also called contact healing. See also: Therapeutic touch."
Lazy eye,"Lazy eye: An eye that diverges in gaze. A lazy eye is formally called strabismus. A lazy eye (strabismus) can be due to esotropia (cross-eyed) or to exotropia (wall-eyed). The danger of the condition is that the brain comes in time to rely more on one eye than the other and that part of the brain circuitry connected to the less-favored eye fails to develop properly, leading to amblyopia (blindness) in that eye. The classic treatment for a moderately lazy eye has long been an eyepatch, covering the stronger eye with a patch, forcing the weaker eye to do enough work to catch up. However, eyedrops can work as well as an eyepatch in correcting moderate lazy eye and preventing the development of amblyopia. Atropine eyedrops are instilled daily in the stronger (dominant) eye. The atropine works by blurring rather than blocking vision in the stronger eye. Severe strabismus may require surgery. The surgery is designed to increase or decrease the tension of the small muscles outside the eye. (These muscles are called the extraocular eye muscles. The six extraocular eye muscles move the eye in all directions.) When strabismus surgery is needed, the sooner it is done, the better the chance of the child achieving normal binocular vision. Adults sometimes also need strabismus surgery. This can be done in a standard manner, as in children. Or adjustable suture surgery may be done because scarring from old eye surgery, inflammation from eye muscle disease, or neurological eye weakness makes it difficult to gauge how much tension to take up or let out to straighten the eyes. With adjustable suture surgery, it is possible to adjust the tension of the muscles after the surgery."
lb.,"Lb.: Abbreviation for pound (for the Latin libra), a measure of weight."
LDL (low-density lipoprotein),"LDL (low-density lipoprotein): A molecule that is a combination of lipid (fat) and protein. Lipoproteins are the form in which lipids are transported in the blood. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) transports cholesterol from the liver to the tissues of the body. LDL cholesterol is therefore considered the ""bad"" cholesterol."
Left atrium,Left atrium: The upper right chamber of the heart. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it down into the left ventricle which delivers it to the body.
Left-handed,"Left-handed: The preferential use of the left hand for most fine manual tasks. Approximately 10% of the population is left-handed. In French, the word for left is gauche meaning clumsy or awkward and the word for right is droit. In Latin the word for left is sinister and that for right is dexter (as in dexterity), as left-handed person were historically been seen as abnormal."
Leg,"Leg: In popular usage, the part of the body from the top of the thigh down to the foot, and in medical terminology, the portion of the lower extremity that runs from the knee to the ankle. The leg (in the medical sense) has two bones'the tibia (shinbone) and the fibula'both of which are known as long bones. The larger of the two is the tibia. The fibula runs alongside the tibia."
Leg pain with cramping,"Leg pain with cramping: An aching, crampy, tired, and sometimes burning pain in the legs that comes and goes -- it typically occurs with walking and goes away with rest -- due to poor circulation of blood in the arteries of the legs. Known medically as intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication may occur in one or both legs and may worsen over time. However, some people complain only of weakness in the legs when walking or a feeling of ""tiredness"" in the buttocks. In very severe claudication the pain may be felt ar rest. Impotence is an occasional complaint in men. The usually intermittent nature of the pain is due to narrowing of the arteries that supply the leg with blood, limiting the supply of oxygen to the leg muscles, a limitation that is felt especially when the oxygen requirement of these muscles rises with exercise. Intermittent claudication can be due to temporary artery narrowing due to vasospasm (spasm of the artery), permanent artery narrowing due to atherosclerosis, or complete occlusion (closure) of an artery to the leg. The condition is quite common, more so in men than women. It affects 1-2% of the population under 60 years of age, 3-4% of persons age 60 to 70 and over 5% of people over 70. The pulses in the legs and feet are evaluated on the clinical exam. Diagnostic tests include blood pressure measurements to compare the arms and legs, Doppler ultrasonography on the legs, duplex Doppler/ultrasound exam of the extremities to visualize arterial blood flow, an ECG, and arteriography (injecting dye that can be visualized in the arteries). The prognosis with intermittent claudication is generally favorable because the condition often stabilizes or improves in time. Conservative therapy is advisable. Walking often helps increase the distance that the patient can walk without symptoms. A program of daily walking for short periods, and stopping for pain or cramping, often helps improve function by encouraging the development of collateral circulation, that is, the growth of new small blood vessels that bypass the area of obstruction in the artery. It is essential to stop smoking. Avoid applications of heat or cold on legs. Avoid tight shoes. Two drugs are available for the management of intermittent claudication: pentoxifylline (brand name: Trental) and cilostazol (brand name: Pletal). These drugs act differently. Trental decreases the ""stickiness"" (viscosity) of blood and thereby improves its flow to the legs. Pletal acts to dilate (widen) the arteries by decreasing the action of an enzyme, phosphodiesterase III. It also reduces the ability of blood to clot. If conservative therapy is inadequate, correction of the narrowing in the affected artery may be suggested. This option depends on the location and severity of the narrowing in the artery and the underlying medical condition of the patient. Procedures that are used to correct the narrowing of arteries include surgery (such as bypass grafting) and interventional radiology (such as balloon angioplasty). When claudication is severe and persistent, these procedures may be required to ultimately relieve the condition and the pain. The word ""claudication"" comes from the Latin ""claudicare"" meaning to limp. (The Roman emperor Claudius, who ruled from A.D. 41-54, was so named because he limped, probably because of a birth defect.) There is also venous claudication, resulting from inadequate venous drainage."
Legal medicine,Legal medicine: The branch of medicine that deals with the application of medical knowledge to legal problems and legal proceedings. Legal medicine is also called forensic medicine. A physician may be engaged in legal (or forensic) medicine while a lawyer with identical interests is said to be in medical jurisprudence. It just depends upon the direction you are coming from.
Leiomyoma,"Leiomyoma: A benign tumor of smooth muscle, the type of muscle that is found in the heart and uterus. A leiomyoma of the uterus is commonly called a fibroid. Uterine fibroids are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. Fibroids can be present and be inapparent. However, they are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and may cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Both the economic cost and the effect of fibroids on quality of life are substantial. Fibroids are not cancerous. Drugs that manipulate the levels of steroid hormones are effective in treating fibroids but side-effects limit their long-term use. Fibroids may be removed if they cause discomfort or if they are associated with uterine bleeding. Surgery is the mainstay of fibroid treatment. In addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy, various minimally invasive procedures have been developed to remove fibroids."
Leishmania infection,"Leishmania infection: A parasitic disease, also called leishmaniasis, spread by the bite of sand flies infected with a protozoa (Leishmania). There are several forms of leishmaniasis, the most common being cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form of the disease causes skin sores while the visceral form strikes internal organs of the body such as the spleen, liver and bone marrow and can be fatal. Cutaneous leishmaniasis involves one or more sores on their skin. The sores can change in size and appearance over time. They often end up looking like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater. Some sores are covered by a scab. The sores can be painless or painful. Some people have swollen glands near the sores (for example, under the arm if the sores are on the arm or hand). Visceral leishmaniasis usually causes fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver (usually the spleen is bigger than the liver). Some patients have swollen glands. Certain blood tests are abnormal. For example, patients usually have low blood counts, including a low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count, and low platelet count. There are about two million new cases of leishmaniasis each year -- 1.5 cutaneous and 0.5 million visceral. The disease is found in the following areas: Leishmaniasis is NOT found in Australia or Oceania (that is, islands in the Pacific, including Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia). It is possible but very unlikely to get leishmaniasis in the USA. Very rarely, people living in rural southern Texas have developed skin sores from cutaneous leishmaniasis. No cases of visceral leishmaniasis are known to have been acquired in the USA. Leishmaniasis is spread by the bite of some types of phlebotomine sand flies. Sand flies become infected by biting an infected animal (for example, a rodent or dog) or person. Since sand flies do not make noise when they fly, people may not realize they are present. Sand flies are very small and may be hard to see; they are only about one-third the size of typical mosquitos. Sand flies usually are most active in twilight, evening, and night-time hours (from dusk to dawn). Sand flies are less active during the hottest time of the day. However, they will bite if they are disturbed, such as when a person brushes up against the trunk of a tree where sand flies are resting. Rarely, leishmaniasis is spread from a pregnant woman to her baby. Leishmaniasis also can be spread by blood transfusions or contaminated needles. People of all ages are at risk for leishmaniasis if they live or travel where leishmaniasis is found. Leishmaniasis usually is more common in rural than urban areas; but it is found in the outskirts of some cities. The risk for leishmaniasis is highest from dusk to dawn because this is when sand flies are the most active. All it takes to get infected is to be bitten by one infected sand fly. This is more likely to happen the more people are bitten, that is, the more time they spend outside in rural areas from dusk to dawn. Adventure travelers, Peace Corps volunteers, missionaries, ornithologists (people who study birds), other people who do research outdoors at night, and soldiers are examples of people who may have an increased risk for leishmaniasis (especially cutaneous leishmaniasis). People with cutaneous leishmaniasis usually develop skin sores within a few weeks (sometimes as long as months) of when they were bitten. People with visceral leishmaniasis usually become sick within several months (rarely as long as years) of when they were bitten. Leishmaniasis can be a serious disease if not treated. The skin sores of cutaneous leishmaniasis will heal on their own, but this can take months or even years. The sores can leave ugly scars. If not treated, infection that started in the skin rarely spreads to the nose or mouth and causes sores there (mucosal leishmaniasis). This can happen with some of the types of the parasite found in Central and South America. Mucosal leishmaniasis might not be noticed until years after the original skin sores healed. The best way to prevent mucosal leishmaniasis is to treat the cutaneous infection before it spreads. If not treated, visceral leishmaniasis can cause death. It is very rare for travelers to get visceral leishmaniasis. The best way for travelers to prevent getting leishmaniasis is by protecting themselves from sand fly bites. Vaccines and drugs for preventing infection are not yet available. To decrease their risk of being bitten, travelers should: NOTE: Bed nets, repellents containing DEET, and permethrin should be purchased before traveling and can be found in hardware, camping, and military surplus stores. NOTE ALSO: Some people have had cutaneous leishmaniasis more than once. Therefore, you should follow the preventive measures listed above whenever you are in an area where leishmaniasis is found."
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A severe form of epilepsy that usually begins in early childhood. It is characterized by frequent seizures of multiple types, mental impairment, and a slow spike-and-wave pattern seen on an EEG. The seizures are notoriously hard to treat and may lead to falls and injuries. Treatment involves anti-epileptic medications."
Lens,Lens: The transparent structure inside the eye that focuses light rays onto the retina.
Leprosy,"Leprosy: An infectious disease of the skin, nervous system, and mucous membranes that is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy is transmitted via person-to-person contact. For thousands of years leprosy was one of the world's most feared communicable diseases because the nerve and skin damage often led to terrible disfigurement and disability. Today leprosy can be cured, particularly if treatment is begun early. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Surgery can be performed to reconstruct damaged faces and limbs. Also known as Hansen's disease."
Leptomeningeal,"Leptomeningeal: Having to do with the leptomeninges, the two innermost layers of tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord. Leptomeningeal metastasis refers to cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to the leptomeninges."

Leuk-,"Leuk-: Prefix meaning white, as in leukemia. Leuk-and leuko-, the form used before a consonant, come from the Greek ""leukos"" meaning white."
Leukemia,"Leukemia: Cancer of the blood cells. Strictly speaking, leukemia should refer only to cancer of the white blood cells (leukocytes), but in practice it can apply to malignancy of any cellular element in the blood or bone marrow, as in red cell leukemia (erythroleukemia). Treatment may involve chemo'therapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Also spelled leucemia. See also accelerated phase of leukemia; leukemia, blastic phase of; leukemia, chronic phase of; leukemia, hairy cell; leukemia, lymphocytic; leukemia, myeloid; leukemia, refractory; myelodysplastic syndrome."

Leukocytosis,Leukocytosis: A condition in which the number of white blood cells is higher than normal.
Leukopenia,Leukopenia: A shortage of white blood cells.
Leukotriene,Leukotriene: One of a group of chemicals produced by the body that accompanies inflammation. Leukotrienes are believed to play a major role in causing the symptoms of hay fever and asthma.
Levo-,"Levo-: Prefix meaning on the left side, as in levorotation (turning or twisting to the left). The opposition of levo- is dextro-."
Levocardia,"Levocardia: The location of the heart is in the left chest, in its normal condition. This term has sometimes been used to refer to a normal position of the heart when associated with situs inversus (reversal of sidedness of abdominal and thoracic organs) or other heart diseases."
Levonorgestrel,Levonorgestrel: A progestin. Named levonorgestrel because it is the levorotatory form of norgestrel. Used in combination with an estrogen as an oral contraceptive. Used alone for emergency contraceptive (in Plan B) and the treatment of menstrual disorders or endometriosis.
Levothyroxine,"Levothyroxine: A synthetic thyroid hormone used as a thyroid hormone replacement drug (brand names include Levothroid, Levoxine, Levoxyl, Synthroid) used to treat an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)."
Libido,"Libido: 1. Sexual drive. 2. In psychoanalysis, the psychic energy from all instinctive biological drives. Libido in Latin means ""desire, longing, fancy, lust, or rut."" Although the adjective libidinous, meaning lustful, has been used in English for 500 or so years, libido only entered the language in 1913, thanks to Sigmund Freud and other psychoanalysts who applied the term to psychic energy or drive, and especially to the sexual instinct."
Licensed clinical social worker,"Licensed clinical social worker: A social worker trained in psychotherapy who helps individuals deal with a variety of mental health and daily living problems to improve overall functioning. A social worker usually has a master's degree in social work and has studied sociology, growth and development, mental health theory and practice, human behavior/social environment, psychology, research methods. Abbreviated L.C.S.W."
Lifestyle disease,"Lifestyle disease: A disease associated with the way a person or group of people lives. Lifestyle diseases include atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke; obesity and type 2 diabetes; and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol and drug abuse. Regular physical activity helps prevent obesity, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, colon cancer, and premature mortality."
Lifetime risk,"Lifetime risk: The risk of developing a disease during ones lifetime or dying of the disease. The estimated lifetime risk of developing diabetes for individuals born in 2000 in the US is 32.8% for males and 38.5% for females. Women who inherit mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at an 82% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is 3.4% for American men. However, the lifetime risk of death for the entire population is 100%."
Ligature,"Ligature: Material used to tie something in surgery. Ligatures are used to tie off blood vessels, and they may be made of silk, gut, wire, or other materials."
Lightening,"Lightening: Not to be confused with a discharge of atmospheric electricity, lightening refers to the sensation that a pregnant woman feels when the baby drops. This is the time when the presenting (lowermost) part of the fetus descends into the maternal pelvis. Lightening classically occurs 2 to 3 weeks before labor begins. However, it may not occur in women who have had two or more prior viable pregnancies (and so are multiparas) until labor actually begins. Lightening is also called ""engagement"" because the presenting part of the fetus is then engaged in the mother's pelvis."
Lightheadedness,"Lightheadedness: A feeling you are ""going to faint."" Lightheadedness is medically distinct from dizziness, unsteadiness, and vertigo."
Lilliputian hallucination,"Lilliputian hallucination: An hallucination in which things, people, or animals seem smaller than they would be in real life. Lilliputian refers to the ""little people"" who lived (fictionally) on the island of Lilliput in Jonathan Swift's 1726 masterpiece Gulliver's Travels. The term ""Lilliputian hallucination"" was coined by John Todd, an English psychiatrist (1914-1987) who also called it the Alice in Wonderland syndrome."
Limb,Limb: An arm or a leg.
"Line, central","Line, central: A catheter (tube) that is passed through a vein to end up in the thoracic (chest) portion of the vena cava (the large vein returning blood to the heart) or in the right atrium of the heart. Central lines have a number of different uses. A central line allows concentrated solutions to be infused with less risk of complications. It permits monitoring of special blood pressures including the central venous pressure, the pulmonary artery pressure, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. The central line can be used for the estimation of cardiac output and vascular resistance. The near end of the catheter may also be connected to a chamber for injections given over periods of months. A central line saves having to have frequent small injections or ""drips"" placed in the arms. A central line may also allow a patient to have medicine or fluids at home instead of in the hospital. The central line may be inserted for the short term or long term. There are two types of long term central lines: the cuffed or tunnelled line and the reservoir long line that ends in a rubber bulb or reservoir. The possible complications of a central line include air in the chest (pneumothorax) due to a punctured lung, bleeding in the chest (hemothorax), fluid in the chest (hydrothorax), ble4eding into or under the skin (hematoma) and infection. If the line becomes disconnected, air may enter the blood and cause problems with breathing or a stroke. A central line is also called a central venous line or a central venous catheter (CVC)."

Lingual,Lingual: Having to do with the tongue.
Linkage analysis,"Linkage analysis: Study aimed at establishing linkage between genes. Today linkage analysis serves as a way of gene-hunting and genetic testing. Linkage is the tendency for genes and other genetic markers to be inherited together because of their location near one another on the same chromosome. A gene is a functional physical unit of heredity that can be passed from parent to child. All genes in humans are pieces of DNA. Most genes contain information for making a specific protein. The term ""genetic marker"" is broader than a gene. A genetic marker is simply a segment of DNA with an identifiable physical location on a chromosome whose inheritance can be followed. A genetic marker can have a function and thus be a gene. Or a marker can be a section of DNA with no known function. Because DNA segments that lie near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together, markers are often used as tools for tracking the inheritance pattern of a gene that has not yet been identified but whose approximate location is known. The statistical estimate of whether two loci are likely to lie near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited together is called a LOD score. A LOD score of 3 or more is generally taken to indicate that the two loci are linked and are close to one another."
Linkage map,"Linkage map: A map of the genes on a chromosome based on linkage analysis. A linkage map does not show the physical distances between genes but rather their relative positions, as determined by how often two gene loci are inherited together. The closer two genes are (the more tightly they are linked), the more often they will be inherited together. Linkage distance is measured in centimorgans (cM)."
Lip,"Lip: One of the two fleshy folds that surround the opening of the mouth. The upper lip is separated from the nose by the philtrum, the area that lies between the base of the nose and the pigmented edge (called the vermillion border or the carmine margin) of the upper lip. The upper and lower lips meet at the corners (angles) of the mouth, which are called the oral commissures. Small blind pits are sometimes seen at the corners of the mouth; they are known as angular lip pits, and are considered normal minor variants. The lips may be abnormally thin or thick. For example, children with fetal alcohol syndrome typically have a thin upper lip and flat philtrum."
Lipid,"Lipid: Another word for ""fat."" (Please see the various meanings of fat.) A lipid is chemically defined as a substance that is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. Lipids are an important component of living cells. Together with carbohydrates and proteins, lipids are the main constituents of plant and animal cells. Cholesterol and triglycerides are lipids. Lipids are easily stored in the body. They serve as a source of fuel and are an important constituent of the structure of cells. Lipids include fatty acids, neutral fats, waxes and steroids (like cortisone). Compound lipids (lipids complexed with another type of chemical compound) comprise the lipoproteins, glycolipids and phospholipids."
ile,"Lipid profile: A pattern of lipids in the blood. A lipid profile usually includes the levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and the calculated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 'cholesterol."
Lipids,"Lipids: Another word for ""fats."" (Please see the various meanings of Fat.) Lipids can be more formally defined as substances such as a fat, oil or wax that dissolves in alcohol but not in water. Lipids contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen but have far less oxygen proportionally than carbohydrates. Lipids are an important part of living cells. Together with carbohydrates and proteins, lipids are the main constituents of plant and animal cells. Cholesterol and triglycerides are lipids. Lipids are easily stored in the body. They serve as a source of fuel and are an important constituent of the structure of cells. Lipids include fatty acids, neutral fats, waxes and steroids (like cortisone). Compound lipids (lipids complexed with another type of chemical compound) comprise the lipoproteins, glycolipids and phospholipids. Etymology: Whereas the everyday term ""fat"" comes from the Old English (from ""faett"" meaning crammed or adorned), the more scientific term ""lipid"" comes from the Greek ""lipos"" which referred to animal fat or vegetable oil."
Lipitor,Lipitor: A type of statin that lowers the level of cholesterol in the blood. See: Atorvastatin.
Lipodystrophy,"Lipodystrophy: A disorder of adipose (fatty) tissue characterized by a selective loss of body fat. Patients with lipodystrophy have a tendency to develop insulin resistance, diabetes, a high triglyceride level (hypertriglyceridemia), and fatty liver. There are numerous forms of lipodystrophy that are genetic (inherited) or acquired (not inherited). The genetic forms of lipodystrophy include congenital generalized lipodystrophy (the Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) and several types of familial partial lipodystrophy (the Dunnigan type, the Kobberling type, the mandibuloacral dysplasia type). The acquired forms of lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (the Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (the Barraquer-Simons syndrome), and lipodystrophy induced by protease inhibitors used to treat HIV."
Lipoma,Lipoma: A benign tumor of adipocytes (fat cells). Lipomas are common in the skin and are found anywhere on the body. They may be surgically removed for cosmetic reasons.
Lipoprotein,"Lipoprotein: A molecule that is a combination of lipid and protein. Lipids do not travel in the blood by themselves, but they are carried through the bloodstream as lipoproteins."
Lips,"Lips: Aside from the lips of the mouth, there are two pairs of lips at the entrance to the vagina. They are the labia majora (the larger outside pair) and the labia minora (the smaller inside pair). Together they form part of the vulva (the female external genitalia)."
Liquid diet,"Liquid diet: The Liquid diet is the restriction of solid food intake, and replacement of solid food with liquids. In hospitals, liquid diets are prescribed by doctors for a number of reasons for patients who are unable to consume solid foods. Liquid diets may be prescribed following surgery or as a preparation for certain medical procedures. Additionally, some people have injuries or medical conditions that limit their ability to eat solid foods. Most prescribed liquid diets allow sports drinks, broth, tea, and coffee. Strained juices may also be permitted. In terms of weight loss, various diet plans have been developed that may be termed ""liquid diets,"" since these involve replacing all or part of one's food consumption with liquids. These diets may include specifically formulated diet drinks or may be based upon consumption of teas and juices. Many liquid diets may not be nutritionally sound and safe for long-term weight loss."
Listeria,"Listeria: A group of bacteria capable of causing illness including potentially fatal infections in the elderly, newborns, pregnant women, and persons with a weakened immune system. Listeria monocytogenes is the form of Listeria most commonly responsible for infections. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. If infection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Infection during pregnancy may appear mild but can lead to stillbirth, premature delivery and infection of the newborn. Listeria contamination has been responsible for numerous recalls of food. Listeria infection may be spread through different methods including direct contact with infected lesions, food-borne transmission, and passage from mother to fetus in pregnancy or to the infant during birth. Persons at risk can prevent the infection by avoiding certain high-risk foods and by handling food properly. You should thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources (such as beef, pork, or poultry), keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables, cooked foods and ready-to-eat foods, wash raw vegetables thoroughly before eating them, and avoid raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods made from raw milk. Listeria are named after the English surgeon and apostle of antisepsis, Joseph Lister (1827-1912). Disease caused by Listeria bacteria is called listeriosis."
Liter,"Liter: A metric measure of capacity that is equal to the volume of 1 kilogram of water at 4' Celsius and at standard atmospheric pressure of 760 millimeters of mercury. There are 1,000 cubic centimeters, or 1 cubic decimeter, in 1 liter. A liter is a little more than 1 quart (1.057 US liquid quarts). Abbreviated L or l."
Lithium,"Lithium: A naturally occurring salt that, in purified form, is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders, especially bipolar disease The therapeutic level of lithium'the amount needed to treat bipolar disorders'is perilously close to the level that can cause toxicity, so monitoring of blood levels is required. Symptoms of lithium toxicity include diarrhea, vomiting, blurred vision, loss of coordination, and loss of motor control. Treatment of lithium toxicity involves immediately reducing or discontinuing lithium use under medical supervision."
Litho-,"Litho-: Prefix meaning stone, as in lithotomy (an operation to remove a stone), or lithotripsy (a procedure to crush a stone)."
Lithotomy position,Lithotomy position: Position in which the patient is on their back with the hips and knees flexed and the thighs apart. The position is often used for vaginal examinations and childbirth.
Liver,"Liver: The largest solid organ in the body, situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side. The liver has a multitude of important and complex functions, including to manufacture proteins, including albumin (to help maintain the volume of blood) and blood clotting factors; to synthesize, store, and process fats, including fatty acids (used for energy) and cholesterol; to metabolize and store carbohydrates (used as the source for the sugar in blood); to form and secrete bile that contains bile acids to aid in the intestinal absorption of fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K; to eliminate, by metabolizing or secreting, the potentially harmful biochemical products produced by the body, such as bilirubin, from the breakdown of old red blood cells and ammonia from the breakdown of proteins; and to detoxify, by metabolizing and/or secreting, drugs, alcohol, and environmental toxins."
Liver disease,"Liver disease: Liver disease refers to any disorder of the liver. The liver is a large organ in the upper right abdomen that aids in digestion and removes waste products from the blood. Liver disease includes the following conditions: Alcohol abuse is one leading cause of liver disease. Infections, poisons, and inherited (genetic) conditions can also cause diseases of the liver. In most patients with liver disease, multiple different functions of the liver are impaired."
Liver Failure,"Liver failure: a condition that occurs when the liver is damaged and no longer able to function. Liver failure may be come on suddenly (acute) or develop slowly over time (chronic), depending upon the cause. There are a number of diseases and conditions that can result in liver failure. Examples include hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (iron overload), alcohol abuse, medications (for example, acetaminophen poisoning [Tylenol and others], malnutrition, toxins, and any condition that causes scarring (cirrhosis) of the liver. Symptoms of liver failure include Liver failure may be fatal if not corrected. In some cases, a liver transplant may be required."
Liver pain,"Liver pain: Pain coming from the liver. The liver does not contain nerve fibers that sense pain. Therefore, liver tissue can be cut, burned, or compressed without causing pain. There are pain fibers, however, in the liver's capsule, a thin layer of tissue that surrounds the liver tissue itself. The pain fibers of the capsule are stimulated when the capsule is stretched. Thus anything that stretches the capsule can cause liver pain. The common liver diseases that stretch the capsule are tumors that grow within the liver and inflammation of the liver that occurs, for example, with hepatitis of any cause. In the latter case, an accumulation of inflammatory cells and fluid within the liver is what stretches the capsule. The bile ducts that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and intestine as well as the gallbladder, also are surrounded by a thin layer of tissue that senses pain when it is stretched. Thus, stretching of the ducts due to problems within the ducts can lead to pain that may be difficult to distinguish from stretching of the capsule of the liver."
Liver shunt,"Liver shunt: Transjugular, intrahepatic, portosystemic shunt (TIPS), is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from the intestines to the liver and the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the heart. It is used primarily (but not exclusively) in patients with cirrhosis in which the scar tissue within the liver has blocked the flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein leading to an increase in pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). As a result of the increase in pressure, blood flows around the liver via small, unimportant veins that connect the portal vein with other veins within the abdomen. These veins enlarge and are referred to as varices. Unfortunately, one of the places varices form is in the stomach and lower esophagus, and these varices have a tendency to bleed massively, frequently causing death from exsanguination. By providing an artificial path for blood traveling from the intestines, through the liver, and back to the heart, TIPS reduces the pressure in the varices and prevents them from rupturing and bleeding. There are several types of shunts that are placed surgically. TIPS is a non-surgical way of placing a portosystemic shunt. The shunt is passed down the jugular vein in the neck by a radiologist using x-ray guidance. The shunt then is inserted between the portal and hepatic veins within the liver."
Lizard bite,"Lizard bite: Only two types of lizards are poisonous: the Gila monster that lives in Arizona and Mexico and the beaded lizard of Mexico. Symptoms from their bites of these include pain, swelling, and discoloration in the area around the bite and swollen lymph nodes. Weakness, sweating, thirst, headache, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus) may also develop. In severe cases, blood pressure may fall. Keep the victim calm, still, and warm, and take them immediately to the nearest hospital. The bitten limb should be loosely immobilized and kept positioned below heart level. Rings, watches, and tight clothing should be removed, and no stimulants should be given. A Sawyer's extractor (a device that suctions venom from the site of the bite, designed for first aid) should be applied over the bite within 5 minutes and kept in place for 30 to 40 minutes during transportation to the hospital. A specific antivenom is not available."
LL,LL: 1. Lower lid (of the eye). 2. Lower limit. The recommended LL for potassium intake is 4.7 grams per day for adults.
LLL,LLL: Acronym for the left lower lobe (of the lung). The left lung is divided into the left upper and left lower lobe.
LLQ,"LLQ: Left lower quadrant (quarter). For example, the LLQ of the abdomen contains the descending portion of the colon."
LMP,"LMP: Abbreviation for ""last menstrual period."" By convention, pregnancies are dated in weeks starting from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). If her menstrual periods are regular and ovulation occurs on day 14 of her cycle, conception takes place about 2 weeks after her LMP. A woman is therefore considered to be 6 weeks pregnant 2 weeks after her first missed period. A woman's obstetric date is different from the embryologic date (the age of the embryo). The obstetric date is about 2 weeks longer than the embryologic date."
Lobe,"Lobe: Part of an organ that appears to be separate in some way from the rest. A lobe may be demarcated from the rest of the organ by a fissure (crack), sulcus (groove), connective tissue or simply by its shape. For example, there are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes of the brain. The word ""lobe"" from the Greek lobos meaning ""a small rounded projection"" long applied only to the familiar round projection at the base of the ear -- the earlobe. The lobes of the brain, thyroid, lungs, and liver were hardly mentioned in English until the 16th century."
Local treatment,Local treatment: Treatment that affects the tumor and the area close to it.
Lochia,"Lochia: The fluid that is discharged from the vagina for a week or so after childbirth. At first the lochia is primarily blood, followed by a more mucousy fluid that contains dried blood, and finally a clear-to-yellow discharge."
Locomotion,"Locomotion: Movement from one place to another. And the ability to locomote, to get from one place to the next. The locomotive system permits locomotion and consists of bones that are the framework of the skeleton, joints that hold the bones together and make movement possible, and muscles that contract and relax and make for movement. Locomotion is derived from the Latin ""locus"", place + ""movere"", move = move place."
Locomotive system,"Locomotive system: The bones, the joints, and the muscles that contract and relax to move the joints and bones."
Locoregional,Locoregional: Limited to a local region. See also: Locoregional anesthesia; Locoregional metastasis.
Locus minoris resistentiae,"Locus minoris resistentiae: Latin meaning a place of less resistance. A locus minoris resistentiae offers little resistance to microorganisms. For example, a damaged heart valve acts as a locus minoris resistentiae, a place where any bacteria in the bloodstream tend to settle. The concept of a locus minoris resistentiae is an old one but still a valid, useful way of thinking."
LOD score,"LOD score: In genetics, a statistical estimate of whether two loci (the sites of genes) are likely to lie near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited together as a package. LOD stands for logarithm of the odds (to the base 10). A LOD score of three or more is generally taken to indicate that two gene loci are close to each other on the chromosome. (A LOD score of three means the odds are a thousand to one in favor of genetic linkage)."
a chromosome,"Long arm of a chromosome: The long arm of a chromosome is termed the q arm. All human chromosomes have 2 arms, the p (short) arm and the q (long) arm. They are separated from each other only by a primary constriction, the centromere, the point at which the chromosome is attached to the spindle during cell division. The symbol ""p"" stands for ""petit"", small in French, while ""q"" was chosen merely because it was the next letter in the alphabet."
Long QT syndrome,"Long QT syndrome: A disorder of the heart's electrical system that predisposes individuals to irregular heartbeats, fainting spells, and sudden death. The irregular heartbeats are typically brought on by stress or vigorous activity. Abbreviated LQTS. LQTS is often symptomless and undiagnosed, but it is well known as a cause of sudden cardiac death in young, apparently healthy people, most notably competitive athletes. QT refers to an interval seen in an electrocardiogram (EKG) test of heart function. There are multiple genetic forms of LQTS. Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of LQTS. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of LQTS and is characterized by congenital profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and long QT interval."
Long-term care facility,"Long-term care facility: A facility that provides rehabilitative, restorative, and/or ongoing skilled nursing care to patients or residents in need of assistance with activities of daily living. Long-term care facilities include nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, inpatient behavioral health facilities, and long-term chronic care hospitals."
Longevity,Longevity: Lifespan. Increased longevity means a longer life.
Longitudinal section,Longitudinal section: A section that is cut along the long axis of a structure. Longitudinal section is the opposite of cross-section.
#NAME?,"Loss-of-function mutation: A mutation that results in reduced or abolished protein function. Gain-of-function mutations,which are much less common, confer an abnormal activity on a protein."
Lou Gehrig disease,"Lou Gehrig disease: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a classic motor neuron disease. Motor neuron diseases are progressive chronic diseases of the nerves that come from the spinal cord responsible for supplying electrical stimulation to the muscles. This stimulation is necessary for the movement of body parts. LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is quite a mouthful. The disease is therefore usually referred to simply as ALS. In North America ALS is often called ""Lou Gehrig's disease"" after the stalwart baseball player who died from it. In 14 seasons playing for the New York Yankees, Gehrig did not miss a single game for a total of 2,130 straight games. He became known as the ""iron man."" Born in 1903, he died in 1941 at the age of 38. The movie, ""Pride of the Yankees"", tells Gehrig's tragic and triumphant life story. EPIDEMIOLOGY: ALS strikes in mid-life, most often in the fifth through seventh decades of life. Men are about one-and-a-half times more likely to have the disease as women. It affects about 20,000 Americans with 5,000 new cases occurring in the United States each year. THE DISEASE PROCESS: ALS occurs when specific nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary movement gradually degenerate. The loss of these motor neurons causes the muscles under their control to weaken and waste away, leading to paralysis. The cause of this disease process is still unknown. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: ALS manifests itself in different ways, depending on which muscles weaken first. Symptoms may include tripping and falling, loss of motor control in hands and arms, difficulty speaking, swallowing and/or breathing, persistent fatigue, and twitching and cramping, sometimes quite severely. TREATMENT: There is no cure for ALS; nor is there a proven therapy that will prevent or reverse the course of the disorder. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved riluzole, the first drug that has been shown to prolong the survival of ALS patients. Patients may also receive supportive treatments that address some of their symptoms. PROGNOSIS (OUTLOOK): ALS is progressive and fatal. The usual causes of death of patients with motor neuron diseases are not directly related to the disease, but result from simultaneous additional illnesses which ultimately occur because of weakness of the body. These illnesses are often infections. DURATION OF DISEASE: ALS usually leads to death within 5 years of the time the diagnosis of ALS is made; the range is from 2 to 7 years."
Low Back Pain,"Low back pain: Pain in the lower back area can relate to problems with the lumbar spine, the discs between the vertebrae, the ligaments around the spine and discs, the spinal cord and nerves, muscles of the low back, internal organs of the pelvis and abdomen, or the skin covering the lumbar area. Lumbago is another name for low back pain."
Low blood pressure,"Low blood pressure: Any blood pressure that is below the normal expected for an individual in a given environment. Low blood pressure is also referred to as hypotension. Low blood pressure is a relative term because the blood pressure normally varies greatly with activity, age, medications, and underlying medical conditions. Low blood pressure can result from conditions of the nervous system, conditions that do not begin in the nervous system, and drugs. Neurologic conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include changing position from lying to more vertical (postural hypotension), stroke, shock, lightheadedness after urinating or defecating, Parkinson's disease, neuropathy and simply fright. Nonneurologic conditions that can cause low blood pressure include bleeding, infections, dehydration, heart disease, adrenal insufficiency, pregnancy, prolonged bed rest, poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and blood transfusion reactions. Hypotensive drugs include blood pressure drugs, diuretics (water pills), heart medications (especially calcium antagonists-nifedipine/PROCARDIA, beta blockers-propranolol/INDERAL and others), depression medications (such as amitriptyline/ELAVIL), and alcohol."
Low-set ear,"Low-set ear: A minor anomaly in which the ear is situated below the normal location. Technically, the ear is low-set when the helix of the ear meets the cranium at a level below that of a horizontal plane through both inner canthi (the inside corners of the eyes). The presence of two or more minor anomalies such as this one in a child increases the probability that the child has a major malformation."
Lower leg,"Lower leg: The lower leg is the bottom segment of the leg: the part below the knee. The lower leg contains two long bones. The larger of these two bones is the tibia, the smaller one the fibula. The tibia is familiarly known as the shinbone. ""Tibia"" is a Latin word meaning both shinbone and flute. It is thought that ""tibia"" refers to both the bone and the musical instrument because flutes were once fashioned from the tibia (of animals). The fibula runs alongside the tibia. The word ""fibula"" is a Latin word that designates a clasp or brooch. The fibula was likened by the ancients to a clasp attaching it to the tibia to form a brooch."
Lower segment Cesarian section (LSCS),Lower segment Cesarian section (LSCS): A Cesarian section in which the surgical incision (cut) is made in the lower segment of the uterus.
LP (lumbar puncture),"LP (lumbar puncture): Also known as a spinal tap, an LP is a procedure whereby spinal fluid is removed from the spinal canal for the purpose of diagnostic testing. It is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, especially infections, such as meningitis. It can also provide clues to the diagnosis of stroke, spinal cord tumor and cancer in the central nervous system. A lumbar puncture is so-called because the needle goes into the lumbar portion (the ""small"") of the back. Other names for an LP include spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis. An LP is most commonly done for diagnostic purposes, namely to obtain a sample of the fluid in the spinal canal (the cerebrospinal fluid) for examination. An LP can also be done for therapeutic purposes, namely as a way of administering antibiotics, cancer drugs, or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, for examples, normal-pressure hydrocephalus and benign intracranial hypertension). The patient is typically lying down sideways for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up. LPs in infants are often done upright. After local anesthesia is injected into the small of the back (the lumbar area), a needle is inserted in between the nearby bony building blocks (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is usually placed between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae). Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing. The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury. The normal CSF contains various chemicals such as protein and sugar (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed. A Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows: These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory. Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from hydrocephalus; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (encephalitis, meningitis); tumors of brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as multiple sclerosis. When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include headache, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of headache, which can appear from hours to up to a day after LP. Headaches occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat 1-3 hours after the procedure. The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation but an LP can provide lifesaving information."
LPA,LPA: Little People of America. The abbreviation also for the left pulmonary artery.
LSD,"LSD: Lysergic acid diethylamide is an hallucinogen. LSD is an abbreviation of the German term Lysergsaure-Diathylamid for lysergic acid diethylamide. LSD is considered the typical hallucinogen and the characteristics of its action and effects apply to the other hallucinogens, including mescaline, psilocybin, and ibogaine. LSD was discovered in 1938. It is manufactured from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. LSD is sold on the street as ""acid"" in tablets, capsules, and, occasionally, liquid form. It is odorless, colorless, and has a slightly bitter taste. It is usually taken by mouth. LSD is often added to absorbent paper, such as blotter paper, and divided into small decorated squares, with each square representing one dose. The effects of LSD are unpredictable. The user usually feels the first effects of the drug 30 to 90 minutes after taking it. The physical effects include dilated pupils, higher body temperature, increased heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors. The user may feel several different emotions at once or swing rapidly from one emotion to another. If taken in a large enough dose, the drug produces delusions and visual hallucinations."
Lubricant,Lubricant: An oily or slippery substance. A vaginal lubricant may be helpful for women who feel pain during intercourse because of vaginal dryness.
Lues,"Lues: Pronounced lou-ease. An old name for syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that has been around for centuries and is caused by Treponema pallidum, a microscopic organism called a spirochete, a worm-like spiral-shaped organism that infects by burrowing into the moist mucous membranes of the mouth or genitals. The spirochete then produces the classic non-painful ulcer known as a chancre. There are three stages of syphilis: Diagnosis is by blood test, either the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. Treatment is with antibiotics. The name ""syphilis"" was coined by Hieronymus Fracastorius (Girolamo Fracastoro). Fracastorius was a true Renaissance man; he wrote on the temperature of wines, the rise of the Nile, poetry, the mind, and the soul; he was an astronomer, geographer, botanist, mathematician, philosopher and, last but not least in the present context, a physician. In 1530 he published the poem ""Syphilis sive morbus gallicus"" (Syphilis or the French Disease) in which the name of the disease first appeared. Perhaps more importantly, Fracastorius went on in 1546 to write ""On Contagion"" (""De contagione et contagiosis morbis et curatione""), the first known discussion of the phenomenon of contagious infection: a landmark in the history of infectious disease."
Luetic,"Luetic: 1. Relating to syphilis, caused by it, or suffering from it.
2. A person with syphilis. From lues, an old name for syphilis."
LUL,"LUL: Left upper lobe, the top-left lobe of the lung."
Lumbar,"Lumbar: Referring to the five lumbar vertebrae, the disks below them, and the corresponding area of the lower back. The lumbar vertebrae and their disks are situated below the thoracic vertebrae and above the sacral vertebrae in the spinal column and are surrounded by soft tissues, including ligaments and large muscles."
Lumen,"Lumen: A luminous term referring to the channel within a tube such as a blood vessel or to the cavity within a hollow organ such as the intestine. Lumen is a luminous term because it is Latin for light, including the light that comes through a window. When a hollow organ is cut across, you can see light through the space that has been opened. So the word ""lumen"" came to mean this space. For example, in arteriosclerosis, fat deposits narrow the lumen of the artery. For another example, cells called enetrocytes within the intestinal wall help transport water from the lumen of the intestine into the bloodstream."
Lungs,Lungs: The lungs are a pair of breathing organs located with the chest which remove carbon dioxide from and bring oxygen to the blood. There is a right and left lung.
Lupus,"Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that is caused by autoimmunity. Patients with lupus have in their blood unusual antibodies that are targeted against their own body tissues. Lupus can cause disease of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system. The first symptom is a red (or dark), scaly rash on the nose and cheeks, often called a butterfly rash because of its distinctive shape. As inflammation continues, scar tissue may form, including keloid scarring in patients prone to keloid formation. The cause of lupus is unknown, although heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs may all play a role. Lupus is more common in women than in men, and although it occurs in all ethnic groups, it is most common in people of African descent. Diagnosis is made through observation of symptoms and thorough testing of the blood for signs of autoimmune activity. Early treatment is essential to prevent the progression of the disease. A rheumatologist can provide treatment for lupus, and this treatment has two objectives: treating the difficult symptoms of the disease and treating the underlying autoimmune activity. It may include the use of steroids and other anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, intravenous immunoglobulin, and, in cases in which lupus involves the internal organs, chemotherapy. See also lupus, discoid; lupus erythematosus, systemic."
LUQ,"LUQ: Left upper quadrant (quarter). For example, the LUQ of the abdomen contains the spleen."
Luteinizing hormone,"Luteinizing hormone: A gonadotropin (a hormone that affects the function of the sex organs) that is released by the pituitary gland in response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. Abbrevi'ated LH. In females, LH controls the length and sequence of the female menstrual cycle, including ovulation, preparation of the uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg, and ovarian production of both estrogen and progesterone. In males, LH stimulates the testes to produce androgen. Also known as interstitial-cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH). See also gonadotropin."
Luxation,Luxation: Complete dislocation of a joint. A partial dislocation is a subluxation.
LVF,"LVF: 1. Left ventricular failure, failure of the left side of the heart.
2. Left ventricular function, the function of the left ventricle.

In both of these senses, LVF is in contrast to RVF (right ventricular failure or function)."
Lymph,"Lymph: The almost colorless fluid that travels through the lymphatic system, carrying cells that help fight infection and disease."
Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy: Abnormally enlarged lymph nodes. Commonly called swollen glands.
Lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis: A parasitic disease caused by the African eye worm, a microscopic thread-like worm. The adult worms can only live in the human lymph system. Lymphatic filariasis affects over 120 million people in the tropics and sub-tropics of Asia, Africa, Western Pacific, and parts of Central and South America. The disease spreads from person to person by mosquito bites. When a mosquito bites a person who has lymphatic filariasis, microscopic worms circulating in the person's blood enter and infect the mosquito. If the infected mosquito bites another person, they can then get lymphatic filariasis. The microscopic worms pass from the mosquito through the skin, and travel to the lymph vessels. In the lymph vessels they grow into adults. An adult worm lives for about 7 years. The adult worms mate and release millions of microscopic worms into the blood. Once a person has the worms in their blood, when a mosquito bites, the mosquito can transmit the disease to yet another person. A person needs many mosquito bites over several months to years to get lymphatic filariasis. People living or staying for a long time in tropical or sub-tropical areas where the disease is common are at the greatest risk for infection. Short-term tourists have a very low risk. An infection will show up on a blood test. At first, most people don't know they have lymphatic filariasis. They usually don't feel any symptoms until after the adult worms die. The disease usually is not life threatening, but it can permanently damage the lymph system and kidneys. Because the lymph system does not work right, fluid collects and causes swelling in the arms, breasts legs, and, for men, the genital area. The name for this swelling is lymphedema. The entire leg, arm, or genital area may swell to several times its normal size. Also, the swelling and the decreased function of the lymph system make it difficult for the body to fight germs and infections. A person with the disease tends to have more bacterial infections in the skin and lymph system. This causes hardening and thickening of the skin, which is called elephantiasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. People with the disease can suffer pain, disfigurement, and sexual disability. Communities frequently shun women and men disfigured by the disease. Many women with visible signs of the disease will never marry, or their spouses and families will reject them. Affected people frequently are unable to work because of their disability. This hurts their families and their communities. Poor sanitation and rapid growth in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where the disease is common, has created more places for mosquitoes to breed and has led to more people becoming infected. Prevention includes giving entire communities medicine that kills the microscopic worms and controlling mosquitoes. Avoiding mosquito bites is another form of prevention. The mosquitoes that carry the microscopic worms usually bite between the hours of dusk and dawn. If you live in an area with lymphatic filariasis: To treat lymphatic filariasis a person with adult worms should take a yearly dose of medicine that kills the microscopic worms circulating in your blood. While this does not kill the adult worms, it does prevent the person from giving the disease to someone else. Even after the adult worms die, a person can have swelling of the arms, legs, breasts, or genitals. To keep the swelling from getting worse:"
Lymphatic tissue,"Lymphatic tissue: A part of the body's immune system that helps protect it from bacteria and other foreign entities. Lymphatic tissue is rich in lymphocytes (and accessory cells such as macrophages and reticular cells). The lymphatic tissue includes the lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, adenoids and the thymus (an organ in the chest that is particularly large during infancy). In medicine, a tissue is a broad term that is applied to any group of cells that perform specific functions. A tissue in medicine need not form a layer. Thus, the bone marrow is also a tissue."
Lymphocyte,Lymphocytes: A small white blood cell (leukocyte) that plays a large role in defending the body against disease. Lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. The B cells make antibodies that attack bacteria and toxins while the T cells attack body cells themselves when they have been taken over by viruses or have become cancerous. Lymphocytes secrete products (lymphokines) that modulate the functional activities of many other types of cells and are often present at sites of chronic inflammation.
Lymphocytic,"Lymphocytic: Referring to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. For example, lymphocytic inflammation in the skin is skin that is infiltrated with 'lymphocytes."
Lymphoid,"Lymphoid: Referring to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, or to tissue in which lymphocytes develop. Lymphoid tissue is full of lymphocytes, such as a lymph node."
Lymphoma,"Lymphoma: A tumor of the lymphoid tissue. The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL can in turn be divided into low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade, and miscellaneous lymphomas. The course of NHL varies greatly, from indolent to rapidly fatal. Treatment options include chemo and radiation therapy."
Lysis,"Lysis: Destruction. Hemolysis is the destruction of red blood cells with the release of hemoglobin; bacteriolysis is the destruction of bacteria; etc. Lysis can also refer to the subsidence of one or more symptoms of an acute disease as, for example, the lysis of fever in pneumonia."
MAB,"MAB: Or mab. Abbreviation for monoclonal antibody. At the end of a generic drug name, -mab indicates that the drug is a monoclonal antibody. As in adalimumab, bevacizumab, infliximab, rituximab, and trastuzumab."
Macerate,"Macerate: To soften tissues after death by soaking and by enzymatic digestion, as occurs with a stillborn. The word ""macerate"" comes from the Latin ""macero"" meaning to soften by soaking (in a liquid)."
Macewen sign,"Macewen sign: A sign to detect hydrocephalus and brain abscess. Percussion (tapping) on the skull at a particular spot (near the junction of the frontal, temporal and parietal bones) yields an unusually resonant sound in the presence of hydrocephalus or a brain abscess. Named for Sir William Macewen (1848-1924), a surgeon in Glascow, Scotland who also described Macewen's operation for inguinal hernia."
"Machine, CPM","Machine, CPM: A machine used to help rehabilitate a limb (an arm or leg). The continuous passive motion (CPM) machine is attached to, for example, a knee that has had surgery. The CPM machine then constantly moves the knee through a range of motion for a period of time while the patient relaxes."
Machupo virus,"Machupo virus: a virus of the Arenaviridae family of viruses that was discovered in 1963 as the cause of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia. Symptoms of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever include pain, high fever, and bleeding from multiple body sites. The illness can be rapidly fatal. Since discovery of the Machupo virus in the 1960s there have been isolated outbreaks of the illness in Bolivia, where the virus is endemic."
Macro- (prefix),"Macro- (prefix): Prefix from the Greek ""makros"" meaning large or long. Examples of terms involving macro- include macrobiotic, macrocephaly, macrocytic, macroglossia, macrophage, macroscopic, and macrosomia. The opposite of macro- is micro-."
Macroangiopathy,"Macroangiopathy: A disease of the large blood vessels in which fat and blood clots build up and stick to the vessel walls, blocking the flow of blood. Types of macroangiopathy include coronary artery disease (macroangiopathy in the heart), cerebrovascular disease (macroangiopathy in the brain), and peripheral vascular disease (macroangiopathy that affects, for example, vessels in the legs)."
Macrobiotic,"Macrobiotic: Referring to the macrobiota, a region's living organisms that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye."
Macrocephaly,"Macrocephaly: An abnormally large head. The opposite of macrocephaly is microcephaly. Macrocephaly can be a normal variant or be a sign of pressure within the growing head during childhood, such as from hydrocephalus."
Macrocytic,"Macrocytic: Literally, referring to any abnormally large cell; in practice, referring to an abnormally large red blood cell. For example, macrocytic anemia is characterized by abnormally large red blood cells. The opposite of macrocytic is microcytic."
Macrogenitosomia,Macrogenitosomia: A condition in which the external sex organs are prematurely or abnormally enlarged. Macrogenitosomia is associated with hormonal disorders that may also create changes in the internal sex organs.
Macrognathia,"Macrognathia: An abnormally large jaw. Macrognathia can be associated with pituitary gigantism, tumors, and other disorders. Macrognathia can often be corrected with surgery. Also known as prognathic mandible."
Macrolide,"Macrolide: One in a class of antibiotics that includes Biaxin (Clarithromycin), Zithromax (Azithromycin), Dificid (Fidoximycin), and Erythromycin. The macrolides inhibit the growth of bacteria and are often prescribed to treat rather common bacterial infections. In more technical terms, the macrolides are a group of antibiotics produced by various strains of Streptomyces (spore forming bacteria that grow slowly in soil or water as a branching filamentous mycelium similar to that of fungi) and have a complex chemical (macrocyclic) structure. They act by inhibiting protein synthesis, specifically by blocking the 50S ribosomal subunit. They are broad spectrum antibiotics."
Macroscopic,"Macroscopic: Large enough to be seen with the naked eye, as opposed to microscopic. For example, a macroscopic tumor is big enough to be seen without the aid of a microscope. From the Greek macro- (large, long) + -scopic, from skopos (aim, mark)."
Macrosomia,"Macrosomia: An overly large body. A child with macrosomia has significant overgrowth, which can represent a hormone imbalance."
Macula,"Macula: A macula is a small spot. A macula on the skin is a small flat spot while the macula in the eye is a small spot where vision is keenest in the retina. The macula of the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue lining the interior of the back of the eye, is also known as the macula. It is in the center of the retina. As we read, light is focused onto our macula where millions of cells change the light into nerve signals that tell the brain what we are seeing. This is called central vision thanks to which we are able to read, drive, and perform other activities that require fine, sharp, straight-ahead vision. If the macula begins to degenerate, central visions begins to go."
Macular,"Macular: Pertaining to the macula. A macula is a small spot. A macula on the skin is a small flat spot while the macula in the eye is a small spot where vision is keenest in the retina. The macula of the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue lining the interior of he back of the eye, is also known as the macula. It is in the center of the retina. As we read, light is focused onto our macula where millions of cells change the light into nerve signals that tell the brain what we are seeing. This is called central vision thanks to which we are able to read, drive, and perform other activities that require fine, sharp, straight-ahead vision. If the macula begins to degenerate, central visions begins to go."
Macular (skin),"Macular (skin): Adjective referring to macules which are circumscribed changes in the color of skin that are neither raised (elevated) nor depressed. Macules are never large. They are little spots or blemishes in the skin. They are entirely flat and can only be appreciated by visual inspection; they cannot be seen from the side. Dermatologists call small flat skin spots on the skin macules, as opposed to papules which are small solid bumps that rise up above the surrounding skin and vesicles which are small blisters that contain fluid (before they burst). The word macular comes from the Latin macula meaning a small spot or blemish. Note -- Macular vision refers to the macula lutea (yellow spot), or simply as the macula, a spot in the retina where vision is keenest. Macular degeneration pertains to the macula and involves partial or total loss of macular vision."
Macular cyst,"Macular cyst: A cyst caused by vitreous traction in the macula, the tiny oval area made up of millions of nerve cells located at the center of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. The eye contains a jelly-like substance called the vitreous. Shrinking of the vitreous usually causes the cyst. As a person ages, the vitreous becomes thicker and stringier and begins to pull away from the retina. If the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina when it pulls away, a hole can result. The size of the hole and its location on the retina determine how much it affects vision. Generally, people notice a slight distortion or reduction in their eyesight. However, if the hole goes all the way through the macula, you can lose a lot of your central vision and therefore your detailed fine vision. A surgical procedure called vitrectomy is often used to treat holes that go all the way through the macula. The vitreous is removed to prevent it from pulling on the retina. It is replaced with a gas bubble that eventually fills with natural fluids. Following surgery, patients must usually keep their faces down for two or three weeks. This position allows the bubble to press against the macula and seal the hole. Vitrectomy can lead to complications, most commonly an increase in how fast cataracts develop. Other less common complications include infection and retinal detachment during surgery or afterwards. Vitrectomy is about 90% effective in closing the hole. However, improvement in people's vision is more variable. More than half of those who have the surgery can expect an improvement of two lines or more on the vision chart. Very few people get a macular cyst in the second eye. A macular cyst may also be called a macular hole, retinal hole, retinal tear, or retinal perforation."
Macules,"Macules: Small circumscribed changes in the color of skin that are neither raised (elevated) nor depressed. Macules are never large. They are basically little spots or blemishes in the skin. They are entirely flat and can only be appreciated by visual inspection; they cannot be seen from the side. Dermatologists call small flat skin spots on the skin macules, as opposed to papules which are small solid bumps that rise up above the surrounding skin and vesicles which are small blisters that contain fluid (before they burst). The word macule comes from the Latin macula meaning a small spot or blemish. Note -- The macula lutea (yellow spot), or simply as the macula, is a spot in the retina (where vision is keenest)."
Magic bullet,"Magic bullet: Or, sometimes, silver bullet. 1. The perfect drug to cure a disease with no danger of side effects. The term magic bullet was first used in this sense by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich to describe antibody and, later, the drug salvarsan that he created to treat syphilis. 2. In general, a magical solution to any vexing problem."
Magnesium,"Magnesium: A mineral involved in many processes in the body including nerve signaling, the building of healthy bones, and normal muscle contraction. About 350 enzymes are known to depend on magnesium. Magnesium is contained in all unprocessed foods. High concentrations of magnesium are contained in nuts, unmilled grains, dark-green leafy vegetables, legumes such as peas and beans, and fruit. Magnesium is thus readily available in foods that form the basis of a healthful diet. Magnesium deficiency can occur due to inadequate intake of magnesium, impaired intestinal absorption of the mineral, or excessive loss of it. Large amounts of magnesium can be lost by prolonged exercise, lactation, excessive sweating, and chronic diarrhea; the use of drugs such as diuretics, digitalis, cisplatin, and cyclosporine; and kidney disease, an overactive thyroid or parathyroid, low blood levels of potassium (hypokalemia) and high urine levels of calcium (hypercalcemia). According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of magnesium is 420 milligrams per day for men and 320 milligrams per day for women. The upper limit of magnesium as supplements is 350 milligrams daily, in addition to the magnesium from food and water. Persons with impaired kidney function should be especially careful about their magnesium intake because they can accumulate magnesium, a dangerous situation. Drinking water is a significant source of magnesium if the water supply is hard -- rich in minerals. (Water supplies in much of the US are hard but in the Southeast they are soft.) Soft water is deficient in minerals, including magnesium. Water for drinking should therefore not be softened."
Magnesium sulfate,"Magnesium sulfate: A remarkably versatile compound administered intramuscularly and intravenously as an anticonvulsant and as a tocolytic agent (to halt premature labor), taken by mouth as a fast-acting laxative, and applied locally as an anti-inflammatory. Informally called mag sulfate. Also known as Epsom salt."
Magnet therapy,"Magnet therapy: Magnetic therapy, also called magnetic field therapy and bioenergy therapy, is an alternative therapy that uses magnets of varying sizes and strengths that are placed on the body to relieve pain and treat disease. Thin metal magnets are attached to the body alone or in groups. They can be worn as bracelets or necklaces, attached to adhesive patches to hold in place, placed in bands or belts to be wrapped around the wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, foot, waist, or lower back. Also available are magnetic insoles, blankets, and slumber pads. These magnets may be worn for just a few minutes or for weeks, depending on the condition being treated and the practitioner. Proponents state the magnetic fields produced from the negative pole of the magnet have healing powers. Negative magnetic fields are thought to stimulate metabolism, increase the amount of oxygen available to cells, and create a less acidic environment within the body. Conditions diagnosed or treated include arthritis, cancer, circulatory disorders, diabetic neuropathy (nerve disease), fibromyalgia, HIV/AIDS, immune dysfunction, infection, inflammation, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, muscle pain, neuropathy, pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, stress and to increase energy and prolong life. Although there are anecdotal reports of healing with magnetic therapy, available scientific evidence does not support these claims. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers magnets harmless and of no use for medical purposes."
Magnetic resonance imaging,"Magnetic resonance imaging: A procedure that uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to create pictures of areas inside the body. Abbreviated MRI. An MRI is painless and has the advantage of avoiding x-ray radiation exposure. There are no known risks of an MRI. The benefits of an MRI relate to its precise accuracy in detecting structural abnormalities of the body. Patients with heart pacemakers, metal implants, or metal chips or clips in or around the eyes cannot be scanned with MRI because of the effect of the magnet."
Maintenance therapy,Maintenance therapy: Treatment designed to help the original primary treatment to succeed. Maintenance therapy may be given to patients who have cancer that is in remission to prevent a relapse.
Major,"Major: In general, something that is more than something else. For example, the teres major muscle is larger than the teres minor muscle."
Major depression,"Major depression: A disease with certain characteristic signs and symptoms that interferes with the ability to work, sleep, eat, and enjoy once pleasurable activities. The characteristic signs and symptoms of major depression include loss of interest in activities that were once interesting or enjoyable, including sex; loss of appetite (anorexia) with weight loss or overeating with weight gain; loss of emotional expression (flat affect); a persistently sad, anxious or empty mood; feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness; social withdrawal; unusual fatigue, low energy level, a feeling of being slowed down; sleep disturbance with insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping; trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; unusual restlessness or irritability; persistent physical problems such as headaches, digestive disorders, or chronic pain that do not respond to treatment; thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts. Alcohol or drug abuse may be signs of depression. Disabling episodes of major depression can occur once or a number of times in a lifetime. For more information, see Depression."
Malabsorption,"Malabsorption: Poor intestinal absorption of nutrients. Malabsorption can occur from diseases that injure the bowels, such as Crohn's disease, Whipple's disease, celiac disease, and many others."
Malacia,"Malacia: Softening. For example, osteomalacia is softening of bone, usually due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D."
Malaise,"Malaise: A vague feeling of discomfort, one that cannot be pinned down but is often sensed as 'just not right.'"
Malaria,"Malaria: An infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites from the Plasmodium family that can be transmitted by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito or by a contaminated needle or transfusion. Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type. The symptoms of malaria include cycles of chills, fever, sweats, muscle aches and headache that recur every few days. There can also be vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, and yellowing (jaundice) of the skin and eyes. Persons with severe falciparum malaria can develop bleeding problems, shock, kidney and liver failure, central nervous system problems, coma, and die. Travelers to areas with malaria are advised to take medications to prevent infection if exposed. The treatment of malaria is with oral or intravenous medications, including chloroquine, mefloquine (Larium), or atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone). Malaria transmission occurs primarily between dusk and dawn because of the nocturnal feeding habits of Anopheles mosquitoes. One should therefore take protective measures to reduce contact with mosquitoes, especially during these hours. These measures include remaining in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, and wearing clothes that cover most of the body. Additionally, one should have insect repellent for use on exposed skin. The most effective repellent against a wide range of vectors is DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide), an ingredient in many commercially available insect repellents. The actual concentration of DEET varies widely among repellents. DEET formulations as high as 50% are recommended for both adults and children > 2 months of age. Travelers not staying in well-screened or air-conditioned rooms are advised to use a pyrethroid-containing flying-insect spray in living and sleeping areas during the evening and nighttime hours. They should sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets. Bed nets are more effective if they are treated with permethrin or deltamethrin insecticide; bed nets may be purchased that have already been treated with insecticide. Among the many names for malaria are ague, jungle fever, marsh or swamp fever, and paludism."
Male,Male: The sex that produces spermatozoa.
Male condom,"Male condom: The male condom is a sheath placed over the erect penis before penetration, preventing pregnancy by blocking the passage of sperm. It is a barrier method of contraception. A condom can be used only once. Although some condoms have spermicide added (the spermicide is usually nonoxynol-9 in the United States) to kill sperm, spermicide has not been scientifically shown to provide additional contraceptive protection over a condom alone. Because they act as a mechanical barrier, condoms prevent direct vaginal contact with semen, infectious genital secretions, and genital sores and discharges. Most condoms are made from latex rubber, while a small percentage are made from lamb intestines (sometimes called ""lambskin"" condoms). Condoms made from polyurethane have been marketed in the United States since 1994. Except for abstinence, latex condoms are the most effective method for reducing the risk of infection from the viruses that cause AIDS, other HIV-related illnesses, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Some condoms are prelubricated. These lubricants do not provide more birth control or STD protection. Non-oil-based lubricants, such as water or K-Y jelly, can be used with latex or lambskin condoms, but oil-based lubricants, such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline), lotions, or massage or baby oil, should not be used because they can weaken the material."
Male genitalia,"Male genitalia: The genital organs of the male. These are usually separated by convention into the external and internal genitalia. The male external genitalia comprise the penis, the male urethra, and the scrotum. The male internal genitalia comprise the testis, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, bulbourethral gland, and the prostate. See also: Male external genitalia; and Male internal genitalia."
Male pelvis,"Male pelvis: The lower part of the abdomen that is located between the hip bones in a male. The male pelvis is more robust, narrower, and taller than the female pelvis. The angle of the male pubic arch and the sacrum are narrower as well."
Malformation,"Malformation: A structural defect in the body due to abnormal embryonic or fetal development. There are many types of malformations. For example, cleft lip and cleft palate. See also Congenital malformation."
Malignancy,"Malignancy: A tumor that is malignant (cancerous), that can invade and destroy nearby tissue, and that may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body."
Malignant,"Malignant: 1. Tending to be severe and become progressively worse, as in malignant hypertension. 2. In regard to a tumor, having the properties of a malignancy that can invade and destroy nearby tissue and that may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The word malignant comes the Latin combination of ""mal"" meaning ""bad"" and ""nascor"" meaning ""to be born""; malignant literally means ""born to be bad."""
Malnutrition,"Malnutrition: A term used to refer to any condition in which the body does not receive enough nutrients for proper function. Malnutrition may range from mild to severe and life-threatening. It can be a result of starvation, in which a person has an inadequate intake of calories, or it may be related to a deficiency of one particular nutrient (for example, vitamin C deficiency). Malnutrition can also occur because a person can not properly digest or absorb nutrients from the food they consume, as may occur with certain medical conditions. Malnutrition remains a significant global problem, especially in developing countries."
Mammary gland,"Mammary gland: One of the two half-moon-shaped glands on either side of the adult female chest, which with fatty tissue and the nipple make up the breast. Within each mammary gland is a network of sacs that produce milk during lactation and send it to the nipple via a system of ducts. Undeveloped mammary glands are present in female children and in males. See also Breast, Lactation."
Mammogram,"Mammogram: An X-ray of the?breast?that is taken with a device that compresses and flattens the breast. A?mammogram?can help a health professional decide whether a lump in the breast is a gland, a harmless cyst, or a?tumor. A mammogram can cause pressure, discomfort, and some soreness that lasts for a little while after the procedure. If the mammogram result raises suspicions about?cancer, a biopsy is usually the next step."
Mania,"Mania: An abnormally elevated mood state characterized by such symptoms as inappropriate elation, increased irritability, severe insomnia, grandiose notions, increased speed and/or volume of speech, disconnected and racing thoughts, increased sexual desire, markedly increased energy and activity level, poor judgment, and inappropriate social behavior. A mild form in mania that does not require hospitalization is termed hypomania. Mania that also features symptoms of depression (""agitated depression"") is called mixed mania. Mania is the Greek word for madness. It is derived from mainmai, to rave in anger. The Maniai in Greek mythology were the Furies who pursued those who had done unavenged crimes and drove them to madness. See also: Bipolar disorder, Hypomania, Mixed mania."
Manic,Manic: In a state of mania.
Manic-depression,"Manic-depression: Alternating moods of abnormal highs (mania) and lows (depression). Called bipolar disorder because of the swings between these opposing poles in mood. A type of depressive disease. Not nearly as prevalent as other forms of depressive disorders. Sometimes the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. Bipolar disorder is often a chronic recurring condition. A mild to moderate level of mania is called hypomania. Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it and may even be associated with good functioning and enhanced productivity. Thus even when family and friends learn to recognize the mood swings as possible bipolar disorder, the person may deny that anything is wrong. Without proper treatment, however, hypomania can become severe mania in some people or can switch into depression Sometimes, severe episodes of mania or depression include symptoms of psychosis (or psychotic symptoms). Common psychotic symptoms are hallucinations (hearing, seeing, or otherwise sensing the presence of things not actually there) and delusions (false, strongly held beliefs not influenced by logical reasoning or explained by a person's usual cultural concepts). Psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder tend to reflect the extreme mood state at the time. For example, delusions of grandiosity, such as believing one is the President or has special powers or wealth, may occur during mania; delusions of guilt or worthlessness, such as believing that one is ruined and penniless or has committed some terrible crime, may appear during depression. People with bipolar disorder who have these symptoms are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed as having schizophrenia, another severe mental illness. Some people with bipolar disorder become suicidal. Most people with bipolar disorder -- even those with the most severe forms -- can achieve substantial stabilization of their mood swings and related symptoms with proper treatment. Because bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness, long-term preventive treatment is strongly recommended and almost always indicated. A strategy that combines medication and psychosocial treatment is optimal for managing the disorder over time. Medications known as ""mood stabilizers"" usually are prescribed to help control bipolar disorder. Several different types of mood stabilizers are available:"
Manometry,"Manometry: The measurement of pressure using a device called a manometer. Esophageal manometry is done to measure muscle pressure and movements in the esophagus in the evaluation of achalasia. Anal manometry, the measurement of the pressure generated by the anal sphincter, is used to evaluate anal incompetence and fecal incontinence. A blood pressure cuff is a familiar form of sphygmomanometer."
Manorexia,Manorexia: A term that has been used to refer to anorexia nervosa in males. This is not an officially recognized medical term but has been frequently used in media reports. See also anorexia nervosa.
MAO inhibitor,"MAO inhibitor: One of a family of medications (brand names: Aurorex, Nardil, Parnate) that act to limit the activity of monoamine oxydase (MAO) in the nervous system. MAOIs are prescribed to treat depression, anxiety, migraine, and selected other conditions in patients who are not responsive to other medications. They interact with many over-the-counter medications and some foods, so patients taking MAOIs must be educated about what to avoid and must follow a restricted diet."
MAOI,MAOI: Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.
MAP,"MAP: The commonly used term for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. MAP is an acronym derived from the first, second, and fourth words in Mycobacterium Avium subspecies Paratuberculosis."
Map-dot-fingerprint type corneal dystrophy,"Map-dot-fingerprint type corneal dystrophy: A disorder in which the cornea (the normally clear front window of the eye) shows geographic map-like lines, dots (or microcysts), and grayish fingerprint lines on examination with a slit-lamp, a device that focuses a high intensity light beam as a slit while the examiner looks at the front of the eye through a magnifying scope. The disorder is usually silent and without symptoms. However, about one patient in ten has recurrent erosion of the cornea that usually begins after the age 30. Conversely, half of patients with recurrent corneal erosions of idiopathic (unknown) origin have this disorder. Under the microscope, a structure called the epithelial basement membrane is abnormal. The disorder is therefore sometimes called epithelial basement corneal dystrophy. The disorder was first described by Cogan and colleagues in 1964. Hence, the name: Cogan corneal dystrophy. It is also known (to add to the confusion) as microcystic corneal dystrophy."
Mapping,Mapping: Charting the location of genes on chromosomes.
Marie-Strumpell disease,Marie-Strümpell disease: A synonym for ankylosing spondylitis. Named for the French neurologist Pierre Marie (1853-1940) and the German neurologist whose full name was Ernst Adolf Gustav Gottfried von Str¨mpell (1853-1925). See: Ankylosing Spondylitis.
Marker,"Marker: A piece of DNA that lies on a chromosome so close to a gene that the marker and the gene are inherited together. A marker is thus an identifiable heritable spot on a chromosome. A marker can be an expressed region of DNA (a gene) or a segment of DNA with no known coding function. All that matters is that the marker can be detected and trailed. The term ""marker"" may be used in other contexts such with a blood marker or a tumor marker."
"Marker, blood","Marker, blood: A sign of a disease or condition that can be isolated from a blood sample. For example, the monoclonal antibody D8/17 is a diagnostic sign of pediatric autoimmune disorders associated with streptococcus."
MASA syndrome,"MASA syndrome: MASA stands for mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs. Features of the syndrome include: MASA is inherited as an X-linked trait and so affects mainly boys. Alternative names for MASA include clasped thumb and mental retardation, congenital clasped thumb with mental retardation, adducted thumb with mental retardation, and the Gareis- Mason syndrome."
Masklike face,"Masklike face: An expressionless face with little or no sense of animation; a face that is more like a mask than a normal face. Masklike face is seen in a number of disorders, including Parkinson's disease and myotonic dystrophy. Also known as masklike facies."
Massage,"Massage: The therapeutic practice of manipulating the muscles and limbs to ease tension and reduce pain. Massage can be a part of physical therapy or practiced on its own. It can be effective for reducing the symptoms of disorders of or pain in the muscles and nervous system, and it is often used to reduce stress."
Materia medica,"Materia medica: 1. The branch of medical science concerned with the study of drugs used in the treatment of disease: includes pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and the history and physical and chemical properties of drugs. 2. The drugs used in the treatment of disease. A synonym for pharmacology. From the Medieval Latin meaning medical material."
Maternal age,Maternal age: The age of the mother at the time of delivery. Advanced maternal age is usually defined as age 35 or more at delivery. Advanced maternal age predisposes to Down syndrome (trisomy 21). The risk of having a Down syndrome baby rises with maternal age. It essentially doubles from 1 in 725 at maternal age 32 to 1 in 365 at maternal age 35. And the risk continues to climb with the years and is 1 in 32 at maternal age 45.
Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP),"Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP): The presence of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) , a plasma protein normally produced by the fetus, in the mother's blood. MSAFP serves as the basis for some valuable tests. Alpha-fetoprotein is manufactured principally in the fetus's liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract besides the yolk sac, a structure temporarily present during embryonic development. The alpha-fetoprotein level is typically high in the fetus's blood. It decreases in the baby's blood after birth. And by one year of age, it is virtually undetectable. During pregnancy, alpha-fetoprotein crosses the placenta from the fetal circulation and appears in the mother's blood. The alpha-fetoprotein level in the mother's blood (the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) provides a screening test for several disorders including: The maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) tends to be: Alpha-fetoprotein production is essentially zero after a year of age. However, it increases again under the stimulus of some liver diseases. It may, for example, be produced by viral hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Alpha-fetoprotein is also made by primary liver tumors (hepatomas) and by germ cell tumors (teratocarcinoma and embryonal cell carcinomas). A person's serum alpha-fetoprotein level can therefore be used to help detect these conditions and monitor their cirrhosis of the liver. Alpha-fetoprotein is also made by primary liver tumors (hepatomas) and by germ cell tumors (teratocarcinoma and embryonal cell carcinomas). A person's serum alpha-fetoprotein level can therefore be used to help detect these conditions and monitor their treatment."
Materteral,"Materteral: 1. Literally, relating to a maternal aunt.
2. Figuratively, suggestive of an aunt on either side of the family. 3 In medical genetics, pertaining to an aunt. An materteral relationship is the genetic relationship between aunts and their nieces and nephews. Materteral is synonymous with materterine. From the Latin matertera meaning maternal aunt, from mater meaning mother. The feminine counterpart of avuncular (like an uncle)."
MB ChB,MB ChB: Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. See: MBChB.
MBChB,"MBChB: Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees, which are awarded in the U.K. and other countries (such as New Zealand and South Africa) after 5 years of what is analogous to a combined undergraduate-graduate course of study. As a rule, the first two years of the program leading to the MBChB are designed to provide students with the foundation knowledge and skills that are required prior to their hospital experience which occupy years 3 to 5."
McBurney's point,"McBurney's point: McBurney's point is the most tender area of the abdomen of patients in the case of appendicitis. McBurney's point is named after the 19th-century New York surgeon Charles McBurney (1845-1913) who was the leading authority in his day on the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis. Dr. McBurney in 1889 showed that incipient appendicitis could be detected by applying pressure to a particular point in the right lower abdomen, an area he called the ""seat of greatest pain."" Five years later, Dr. McBurney described the surgical incision he made in the right lower part of the abdomen to remove the inflamed appendix. This is now referred to as ""McBurney's incision."""
MCD,"MCD: Abbreviation for a number of entities in medicine including minimal change disease, mean corpuscular diameter, and medullary cystic disease."
MCH,"MCH: Abbreviation for mean cell hemoglobin, which is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. The MCH is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. (The hemoglobin value is the amount of hemoglobin in a volume of blood while the red cell count is the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood.) It is a standard part of the complete blood count."
MCHC,"MCHC: Abbreviation for mean cell hemoglobin concentration, which is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of blood. The MCHC is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the hematocrit. (The hemoglobin value is the amount of hemoglobin in a volume of blood while the hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood.) The MCHC is a standard part of the complete blood count."
MCP,MCP: Membrane cofactor protein. A ubiquitous protein on the surface of cells that regulates complement and is involved in the attachment and ingestion of foreign particles by neutrophils and macrophages. The gene for MCP is on chromosome 1q32.
MCV,"MCV: Abbreviation for mean cell volume, the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and the red cell count (The hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood while the red cell count is the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood). The MCV is a standard part of the complete blood count (CBC)."
MDI,"MDI: 1. Metered-dose inhaler; 2. Multiple daily injections; 3. Mental developmental index, as in ""the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI), which measures language, memory, and problem-solving abilities."""
MDMA,MDMA: Abbreviation for 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine. See: Ecstasy.
Me-too drug,"Me-too drug: A drug that is structurally very similar to already known drugs, with only minor differences. The term ""me-too"" carries a negative connotation. However, me-too products may create competition and drive prices down."
Mean cell volume,"Mean cell volume: A standard part of the complete blood count, the mean cell volume (MCV) is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and the red cell count (The hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood while the red cell count is the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood). The normal range for the mean cell volume is 86 - 98 femtoliters."
Measles,"Measles: An acute and highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and a spreading skin rash. Measles, also known as rubeola, is a potentially disastrous disease. It can be complicated by ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (which can cause convulsions, mental retardation, and even death), the sudden onset of low blood platelet levels with severe bleeding (acute thrombocytopenic purpura), or a chronic brain disease that occurs months to years after an attack of measles (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). During pregnancy, exposure to the measles virus may trigger miscarriage or premature delivery. Treatment includes rest, calamine lotion or other anti- itching preparations to soothe the skin, non-aspirin pain relievers for fever, and in some cases antibiotics. Measles can often be prevented through vaccination. Also known as hard measles, seven-day measles, eight-day measles, nine-day measles, ten-day measles, morbilli. See also measles encephalitis; measles immunization; measles syndrome, atypical; MMR."
Meatus,"Meatus: An opening or a passageway. For example, the meatus of the ear is the opening to the ear canal."
"Meatus, female urethral","Meatus, female urethral: The meatus (opening) of the female urethra, the transport tube that leads from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body. The female urethral meatus is above the vaginal opening."
Medial,"Medial: 1. Pertaining to the middle; in or toward the middle; nearer the middle of the body. Medial is as opposed to lateral. For example, the medial side of the knee is the side closest to the other knee whereas the lateral side of the knee is the outside of the knee.
2. Within a multilayered structure, the center layer. The medial layer of the aorta is the middle layer. For example, necrosis of the medial layer of the aorta may lead to aortic rupture. The word medial comes from the Latin medialis, from medius, meaning the middle. Medial is the adjective corresponding to the noun median, as in the median in a highway. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Medical entomology,"Medical entomology: The branch of science that deals with insects that cause disease or that serve as vectors of organisms that cause disease in humans. In medical entomology, for example, research may pertain to the interactions of the arboviruses and their hosts and involve physiology, genetics, biology, and ecology."
Medical etymology,"Medical etymology: The origin of medical words and terms. Etymology is an account of the origins and the developments in the meaning of a word or term. Medical etymology brings us into contact with the ""history of medicine, of human ideas, and of the human struggle to understand the forces of nature that determine human destiny and mortality,"" as Dr. John Dirckx has put it. For an example of a medical etymology, the word ""diabetes"" is borrowed from the Greek word meaning ""a siphon."" The 2nd-century A.D. Greek physician, Aretus the Cappadocian, named the condition ""diabetes."" He explained that patients with it had polyuria and ""passed water like a siphon."" Many medical words, like diabetes, come from the Greek or Latin, along with most of the prefixes and suffixes that form the beginning or end of many polysyllabic medical terms. Numerous other languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, Gaelic, German, Hindu, Italian, Japanese, Persian, Portuguese and Spanish, have also contributed to the great treasury of medical terms ."
Medical geography,"Medical geography: An important ""new"" area of health research that is a hybrid between geography and medicine dealing with the geographic aspects of health and healthcare. Medical geography studies the effects of locale and climate upon health. It aims to improve the understanding of the various factors which affect the health of populations and hence individuals. It is also called health geographics. The idea that place and location may influence health is not exactly new. It is an old idea and a fertile one. Since Hippocrates (circa 3rd century BC), it has been known that certain diseases such as malaria occur in some places and not others (and for good reason). Malaria is not a disease of mountain tops. It lurks in lowlands where mosquitos breed and sting, to convey the parasitic agent of the disease -- plasmodium. A classic piece of research in medical geography was in done in 1854 as cholera gripped London. Death tolls rang around the clock from church towers. People feared they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. A physician by the name of John Snow thought that, if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps showing the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He figured that infected water from the pump was the culprit. He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. The number of new cholera cases plummeted. The Broad Street pump was the source of cholera. In the early 20th century a couple of dentists in Colorado noticed that children living in areas with high levels of naturally-occurring fluoride in groundwater had fewer dental caries. Their discovery of the value of fluoride came from the application of medical geography (which, since this is dental geography, might be better called health geography)."
Medical history,"Medical history: 1. In clinical medicine, the patient's past and present which may contain relevant information bearing on their health past, present, and future. The medical history, being an account of all medical events and problems a person has experienced is an important tool in the management of the patient.
2. The history of medicine."
Medical jurisprudence,"Medical jurisprudence: The branch of the law that deals with the application of law to medicine or, conversely, the application of medical science to legal problems. Medical jurisprudence may be involved in cases concerning genetic relationships (eg, paternity testing) or injury or death resulting from violence. An autopsy may be done to help determine the agent of death (eg, a gun shot, poison) and how long the person has been dead.. Forensic medicine is also important in cases involving rape. Modern techniques use such specimens as semen, blood, and hair to identify the body of a victim and to compare the DNA of the criminal to that of the defendant through DNA fingerprinting."
Medical prefix,"Medical prefix: A prefix employed in medical terminology. Medical words are often put together, cobbled from two or more building blocks. Among these building blocks are the prefixes. Examples of prefixes used in medicine include:"
ession,"Medical profession: A vocation characterized by a specialized body of knowledge of medicine that its members must teach and expand, by a code of ethics and a duty of service that put patient care above self-interest, and by the privilege of self-regulation granted by society."
Medical Repository,"Medical Repository: The first medical magazine and the first scientific journal published in the United States. The Medical Repository was founded in 1797 in New York and was published quarterly until 1824. T & J Swords in New York City printed it for the Faculty of Physicians at Columbia College (now Columbia University). The Medical Repository aimed to serve as a ""depository of facts and reasonings relative to Natural History, Agriculture and Medicine."" According to Kahn and Kahn, the Medical Repository was ""the first serious attempt in this country to present the relation between science and practice in a serial format that allowed response and communication."" The journal ""introduced new theory, such as the chemistry of Lavoisier (in France) and Priestly (in England) as it related to medicine...."" It was ""a publication in which physicians and others could find the latest thoughts on subjects as diverse as manure, meteorology, and medical practice...."" Source: Kahn RJ, Kahn, PG: New Engl J Med 1997; 337: 1926- 1930."
Medical school,"Medical school: A school with a curriculum leading to a medical degree. The mission of every medical school includes medical teaching, research, and patient care. All medical schools share the goal of preparing students in the art and science of medicine, and providing them with the background necessary to enter the period of graduate medical education. The years of medical school preceding graduate medical education are typically divided into a preclinical phase and a clinical phase. Although medical students have clinical experiences throughout medical school, the first two years are often called the ""preclinical"" phase. The preclinical phase typically occupies the first two years after matriculation. The normal structure and function of human systems are taught through gross and microscopic anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, behavioral science, and neuroscience. The educational focus then shifts to abnormalities of the body's structure and function, disease, and general therapeutic principles through courses in microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, and pathology. Throughout the first two years, the clinical significance of basic science material is stressed. The preclinical phase always includes a course introducing students to the concepts of physical examination and interviewing. Students often interview ""standardized patients"" (people with actual physical findings or people trained to simulate particular cases or findings) in their introduction to clinical medicine courses. Lectures now account for less than half of the scheduled contact time at the majority of medical schools. Small-group discussion, self-instruction, laboratories, case studies and other educational experiences make up the remainder of the scheduled time. The use of computer technology and computer-assisted instruction in the preclinical phase of medical student education have also introduced new approaches to the delivery and acquisition of the sciences basic to medicine. Most schools include small-group tutorial/discussion sessions organized around patient cases that emphasize problem solving. This approach requires students to take responsibility for obtaining information themselves and encourages students to become active learners. It also prepares them for continuous learning throughout their professional lives. The clinical phase of the curriculum usually occurs during the last two years of medical school and is devoted to education in the clinical setting. The periods of instruction are called clerkships, and may range in length from approximately 4 to 12 weeks. During clerkships, students work with patients and their families in inpatient and outpatient settings. Required ""core"" clerkships in all schools include internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and family medicine. Depending on the school, required clerkships can also include family medicine, primary care, neurology, and community or rural medicine. While in a hospital setting or a hospital clinic, students work under the supervision of physician faculty members (known as ""attending physicians"") and residents, and work with other members of the health care team. Students frequently do ""preceptorships"" --that is, they are assigned to community physicians' offices to gain first hand knowledge about how a practice of medicine functions. Whether in a hospital or community setting, students are responsible for ""working-up"" a number of patient cases during the clerkship, by collecting relevant data and information from patients, and presenting the data to fellow students, attending physicians, faculty members and residents. Students are assigned to a medical team, and participate in the ongoing clinical care of patients, and they gain skills in clinical decision-making and patient management. Ideally, students follow their patients over time, either during hospitalizations, in their preceptorships, or through the course of outpatient treatment. Standardized patients (SPs) are used during the clinical years to supplement the kinds of diseases and conditions the students observe. SPs are also used for assessment of student knowledge, attitudes and skills. Other teaching methods in the clinical phase include ""rounds"" (discussion of inpatient cases), bedside teaching, case-based lectures and small group discussions. All accredited medical schools in the US and Canada are represented by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Further information about medical school in the US and Canada may be obtained from the AAMC."
Medical symbol,"Medical symbol: A staff or rod with a snake curled? around it.?This is the Rod?of Aesculapius (also called Asklepios), the ancient?mythical god of medicine. ?Asklepios may have been a real person who was?renowned for his gentle remedies and humane treatment of the?mentally ill.?Today, the staff of Aesculapius is a commonly used symbol of medicine.?It is the symbol of the American Medical Association (AMA) and many other? medical societies. A similar symbol, the caduceus, was the staff of the Greek god Hermes.?The caduceus is usually depicted with two snakes and a pair of wings and is often used mistakenly as a symbol of medicine."
Medication,Medication:1. A drug or medicine. 2. The administration of a drug or medicine.
Medifast diet,"Medifast diet: The Medifast diet is a low-fat, low-calorie weight loss plan based upon the consumption of specific foods and beverages developed and sold by the Medifast company. The diet plan includes shakes, bars, puddings, soups, oatmeal, hot cocoa, and cappucino. Medifast products contain an appetite suppressor (""Super Citrimax"") that is derived from the southeast Asian plant known as Garcinia Cambogia. The diet consists of eating the formulated foods plus one ""lean and green"" (low-fat meats plus vegetables) meal per day. The Medifast diet claims that adherence to the diet can result in weight loss of 2-5 pounds per week. Medifast recommends consultation with a physician before beginning the program. Like all low-calorie diets, the plan is safest when followed under the supervision of a physician."
Mediterranean anemia,"Mediterranean anemia: Better known today as thalassemia (or as beta thalassemia or thalassemia major). The clinical picture of this important type of anemia was first described in 1925 by the pediatrician Thomas Benton Cooley. The name thalassemia was coined by the Nobel Prize winning pathologist George Whipple and the professor of pediatrics Wm Bradford at U. of Rochester because thalassa in Greek means the sea (like the Mediterranean Sea) + -emia means in the blood so thalassemia means sea in the blood. Thalassemia is not just one disease. It is a complex contingent of genetic (inherited) disorders all of which involve underproduction of hemoglobin, the indispensable molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The globin part of normal adult hemoglobin is made up of 2 alpha and 2 beta polypeptide chains. In beta thalassemia, there is a mutation (change) in both beta globin chains leading to underproduction (or absence) of beta chains, underproduction of hemoglobin, and profound anemia. The gene for beta thalassemia is relatively frequent in people of Mediterranean origin (for example, from Italy and Greece). Children with this disease inherit one gene for it from each parent. The parents are carriers (heterozygotes) with just one thalassemia gene, are said to have thalassemia minor, and are essentially normal. Their children affected with beta thalassemia seem entirely normal at birth because at birth we still have predominantly fetal hemoglobin which does not contain beta chains. The anemia surfaces in the first few months after birth and becomes progressively more severe leading to pallor and easy fatiguability, failure to thrive (grow), bouts of fever (due to infections) and diarrhea. Treatment based on blood transfusions is helpful but not curative. Gene therapy will, it is hoped, be applicable to this disease."
MEDLARS,"MEDLARS: MEDLARS® is an acronym that stands for Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System. It is a computer-based system of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) that allows rapid access to NLM's store of biomedical information. MEDLARS is used for preparing publications like Index Medicus®--the monthly subject/author guide to articles in 3,000 journals. Today, through the Internet and World Wide Web, MEDLARS search services are available around the world without charge. MEDLINE® is the best known of NLM's databases. Essentially Index Medicus online, MEDLINE enables anyone to query the NLM computer's store of journal article references on specific topics. It currently contains 9 million references going back to the mid-1960s. Other databases provide information on cataloging and serials, toxicological and environmental health data, AIDS, and other specialized areas. Through the World Wide Web, some 350,000 MEDLINE searches a day are done by health professionals, scientists, librarians, and the public. A new Web service, called MEDLINEplus, links users to many sources of consumer health information. The NLM is the largest medical library in the world. It is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. It collects materials in all areas of biomedicine and health care, as well as works on biomedical aspects of technology, the humanities, and the physical, life, and social sciences. NLM is a key resource for health science libraries and for all of medicine. It is to this extraordinary resource that MEDLARS gives access."
MEDVAC,MEDVAC: Acronym for medical evacuation. MEDVAC typically refers to a team that has the skills necessary for proper medical evacuation in emergency situations. Also known as MEDEVAC.
Mega- (prefix),"Mega- (prefix): The combining form ""mega-"" comes from the Greek ""megas"", great or big and means abnormally large. Examples include: Megalocephaly is too large a head. Megacardia is too large a heart. Megacolon is too large a colon."
Megrim,"Megrim: Migraine. Usually periodic attacks of headaches on one or both sides of the head. Megrim (migraine) may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Some megrims (migraines) do not include headache. They may or may not be preceded by an aura. ""Megrim"" and ""migraine"" share a meaning and an etymological origin. Latin and Greek speakers called their pain, if it was just on one side of the head, ""hemicrania"" or ""hemikrania,"" from the Greek terms ""hemi-"" meaning ""half"" plus ""kranion"" meaning ""cranium"" = half-skull. The French used ""migraine,"" a modification of ""hemicrania,"" for the same condition. English twice borrowed ""migraine"" from the French. In the 14th century, the French term was modified to form ""migreime,"" which gave rise to ""megrim."" Later, in the 15th century, the French ""migraine"" was borrowed again and its spelling stayed intact. ""Megrim"" and ""migraine"" now can be used interchangeably. The term ""megrim"" also refers to vertigo or dizziness and, in the non-medical arena, to a fancy or whim or to low spirits."
Melan- (prefix),"Melan- (prefix): Prefix meaning dark or black. It comes from the Greek ""melas"", black. Examples of terms containing melan- include melancholia, melanin, melanocytes, melanoma and melena."
Melanin,"Melanin: The pigment that gives human skin, hair, and eyes their color. Dark-skinned people have more melanin in their skin than light-skinned people have. Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes. It provides some protection again skin damage from the sun, and the melanocytes increase their production of melanin in response to sun exposure. Freckles, which occur in people of all races, are small, concentrated areas of increased melanin production."
Melanoderma,"Melanoderma: Increased skin pigmentation, darkening of the skin. This is directly due to an increased amount of melanin pigment in the skin when there is increased production of melanin by the melanocytes (the cells that make melanin) or if there is a rise in the number of melanocytes. Melanoderma comes from the Greek ""melas"", black + ""derma"", skin = black skin."
Melanoma,"Melanoma: a cancer of the melanocyte, the cell that produces pigment in the skin. Melanoma is considered the most dangerous form of skin cancer, Melanoma is most common in people with fair skin, but can occur in people with all skin colors. Most melanomas present as a dark, mole-like spot that spreads and, unlike a mole, has an irregular border. The tendency toward melanoma may be inherited and the risk increases with overexposure to the sun and sunburn. Melanoma is classified into four clinical types called: Fair-skinned people and people with a family history of melanoma should always use a high-SPF sunscreen when outdoors. Everyone who has concern about an unusual mole-like spot should see their doctor. Detected early, melanoma is almost always treatable. Undetected, melanoma can spread rapidly and be fatal. Metastatic melanoma refers to melanoma that has spread beyond the skin to distant organs. Metastatic melanoma typically carries a worse prognosis that localized melanoma."
"Melanoma, benign","Melanoma, benign: A benign growth of the melanocytes that is not cancerous. A mole may be a melanocytic nevus."
Melanosis coli,"Melanosis coli: A benign, reversible condition usually, but not always, associated with long-term use of anthranoid laxatives in which pigment deposition in the lamina propria of the large intestine results in a brown to black discoloration of the mucosa (lining) of the large intestine. Melanosis coli is sometimes called pseudomelanosis coli since the pigment deposited is lipofuscin and not melanin as the name implies. Melanosis coli produces no symptoms and is indicative of chronic anthranoid (senna) laxative use."
Melasma,Melasma: Pigmentation of the cheeks of the face (malar area). When it occurs during pregnancy it is referred to as chloasma or the mask of pregnancy. Melasma darkens with sun exposure.
Melatonin,"Melatonin: A hormone that is produced by the pineal gland and is intimately involved in regulating the sleeping and waking cycles, among other processes. Some people who have chronic insomnia use melatonin supplements. However, melatonin is not recommended for all patients with sleep problems, so one should consult a physician before taking it."
MELD,"MELD: Acronym for Model End Stage Liver Disease. A disease severity scoring system for adults with liver disease, designed to improve the organ allocation in transplantation based on the severity of liver disease rather than the length of time on the waiting list. The MELD score is based only on laboratory data in order to be as objective as possible. The laboratory values used are a patient's creatinine, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio, or INR (a measure of blood-clotting time). The pediatric version of MELD is called PELD."
Melena,Melena: Stool or vomit that is stained black by blood pigment or dark blood products.
Melissophobia,"Melissophobia: Fear of bees. A phobia is an unreasonable sort of fear that can cause avoidance and panic. Phobias are a relatively common type of anxiety disorder. Phobias can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure and fear reduction techniques. In many cases, anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication proves helpful, especially during the early stages of therapy. The word ""melissophobia"" comes from the Greek ""melissa"" meaning bee + phobia from the Greek ""phobos"" meaning fear = literally, fear of bee(s). Melissophobia is also known as apiphobia."
Memory,"Memory: 1. The ability to recover information about past events or knowledge. 2. The process of recovering information about past events or knowledge. 3. Cognitive reconstruction. The brain engages in a remarkable reshuffling process in an attempt to extract what is general and what is particular about each passing moment. Memory may be divided into short-term (also known as working or recent memory) and long-term memory. Short-term memory recovers memories of recent events, while long-term memory is concerned with recalling the more distant past. Some disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, damage the cognitive systems that control memory. Usually long-term memory is retained while short-term memory is lost; conversely, memories may become jumbled, leading to mistakes in recognizing people or places that should be familiar. See also: Explicit memory; Implicit memory."
Memory span,"Memory span: The number of items, usually words or numbers, that a person can retain and recall. Memory span is a test of working memory (short-term memory). In a typical test of memory span, an examiner reads a list of random numbers aloud at about the rate of one number per second. At the end of a sequence, the person being tested is asked to recall the items, in order. The average memory span for normal adults is seven."
Menarche,"Menarche: The time in a girl's life when menstruation first begins. During the menarche period, menstruation may be irregular and unpredictable. Also known as female puberty."
Mendelism,"Mendelism: The principles of genetics, specifically of single-gene traits, based on the work of Gregor Mendel (1822-84), a Moravian monk and biologist who established the laws that are the foundation of classical genetics. Mendel lived in an Augustinian monastery where teaching and research were emphasized and where he was given the freedom to pursue scientific studies in the diverse fields that interested him: mathematics, botany, physics, and meteorology. His meticulous controlled experiments with breeding peas in the monastery garden led him to conclude that the heritable units (now called genes) were not blends of parental traits but rather were separate physical entities passed individually from one generation to the next. The report in 1865 of Mendel's discoveries went unnoticed for some years. Charles Darwin never read the copy of Mendel's paper he received The only scientist who did acknowledge it (a German botanist named Nageli) managed to misinterpret it. Finally in 1900 (16 years after his death), Mendel's paper was rediscovered independently by three different scientists. With the rediscovery of Mendel's work, he came to be recognized as the father of the new science of genetics. Mendelian inheritance is the manner in which genes and traits are passed from parents to their children. The modes of Mendelian inheritance are autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive."
Meninges,"Meninges: The three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord (singular: meninx). The outside meninx is called the dura mater, and is the most resilient of the three. The center layer is the arachnoid membrane and the thin innermost layer is the pia mater. Inflammation of the meninges (meningitis) can occur due to bacterial infection. See also meningitis article."
Meningioma,"Meningioma: A common type of slow-growing, usually benign brain tumor that arises from the dura, one of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. A meningioma may occur wherever there is dura (the outermost of the three meninges), but the most common sites are over the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Meningiomas are the only brain tumors that are more common in women than in men. They tend to occur in people between ages 40 and 60 but can occur at any age. A person may have several meningiomas. Very rarely do meningiomas become malignant. The symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. Treatment ranges from observation to neurosurgical resection."
Meningitis,"Meningitis: Inflammation of the meninges, the three membranes that envelop the brain and the spinal cord. Meningitis can be caused by infection by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Other causes include cancer (metastasis to the meninges), inflammatory diseases, and drugs. In some cases the cause of meningitis cannot be determined. The treatment depends on the cause of the meningitis."
Menometrorrhagia,"Menometrorrhagia: Excessive uterine bleeding, both at the usual time of menstrual periods and at other irregular intervals. Menometrorrhagia can be a sign of a number of different disorders including hormone imbalance, endometriosis, benign fibroid tumors in the uterus, and, less commonly, cancer. Women who have abnormal menstrual bleeding should always consult their physician to rule out these conditions. Anemia may result from the excessive uterine bleeding. Treatment depends on the cause. If there does not appear to be a dangerous cause, such as cancer, hormone supplementation, the therapeutic use of birth control pills to better control the menstrual cycle, or fibroid removal (myomectomy) may be recommended. Hysterectomy may sometimes be required. See also: Menorrhagia; Metrorrhagia."
Menopause,"Menopause is the time in a woman's life when menstrual periods permanently stop; it is also called the ""change of life."" Menopause is defined as the time when there have been no menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months and no other biological or physiological cause can be identified. It is the end of fertility, the end of the childbearing years. (A woman may still, however, be able to become pregnant unless 12 consecutive months have passed without a period.) A woman can usually tell if she is approaching menopause because her menstrual periods start changing. The medical terms used to describe this time are ""perimenopause"" and the ""menopause transition."" Natural menopause occurs when the ovaries naturally begin decreasing their production of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. Induced menopause occurs if the ovaries are surgically removed (by bilateral oophorectomy) or damaged by radiation or drugs. Due to the abrupt cutoff of ovarian hormones, induced menopause causes the sudden onset of hot flashes and other menopause-related symptoms such as a dry vagina and a decline in sex drive. Early menopause (before age 40), whether natural or induced, carries a greater risk for heart disease and osteoporosis since there are more years spent beyond the protective cover of estrogen. A ""simple"" hysterectomy (when the uterus but not the ovaries are removed) before natural menopause should not affect the production of sex hormones and so not cause menopause (unless the nerves or blood supply to the ovaries is damaged during the hysterectomy). The timing of natural menopause is variable. In the western world, the average age at which menopause starts is now 51. Natural menopause can, however, be in a woman's 30s or 60s. Factors influencing the time of menopause include heredity (genetics) and cigarette smoking. Smokers (and former smokers) reach menopause an average of 2 years before women who have never smoked. There is no relation between the time of a woman's first period and her age at menopause. The age at menopause is not influenced by a woman's race, height, number of children, or use of oral contraceptives. The changes in the menopause transition (perimenopause) begin about 6 years before the natural menopause. This is a time when the levels of hormones produced by the aging ovaries fluctuate, leading to irregular menstrual patterns (irregularity in the length of the period, the time between periods, and the level of flow) and hot flashes (a sudden warm feeling with blushing). Other changes associated with perimenopause and menopause include night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness, fluctuations in sexual desire (libido), forgetfulness, trouble sleeping, and fatigue (probably from the loss of sleep)."
Menorrhagia,"Menorrhagia: Excessive uterine bleeding occurring at the expected intervals of the menstrual periods. The bleeding from the uterus starts on schedule but is heavier than usual and may last longer than usual. Menorrhagia may be a sign of an underlying disorder, such as hormone imbalance, endometriosis, uterine fibroids or, rarely, cancer of the uterus. Menorrhagia may cause significant anemia. See also: Menometrorrhagia; Metrorrhagia."
Menstrual cramps,"Menstrual cramps: Cramping in the lower abdomen, usually in the first or second day of the menstrual cycle, that is caused by contractions of the uterus as it expels its unneeded contents and by the passage of clotted blood through the cervix. Ibuprofen or other pain relievers can reduce the severity of menstrual cramps, and some women report that exercise is also helpful. Severe menstrual cramps, particularly if paired with excessive bleeding or passage of large blood clots, can occasionally be a sign of endometriosis or other disorders of the female reproductive tract. Also known as dysmenorrhea."
Menstrual cycle,"Menstrual cycle: The monthly cycle of changes in the ovaries and the lining of the uterus (endometrium), starting with the preparation of an egg for fertilization. When the follicle of the prepared egg in the ovary breaks, it is released for fertilization and ovulation occurs. Unless pregnancy occurs, the cycle ends with the shedding of part of the endometrium, which is menstruation. Although it is actually the end of the physical cycle, the first day of menstrual bleeding is designated as ""day 1"" of the menstrual cycle in medical parlance."
Menstruation,"Menstruation: The periodic blood that flows as a discharge from the uterus. Also called menorrhea, the time during which menstruation occurs is referred to as menses. The menses occurs at approximately 4 week intervals to compose the menstrual cycle."
,"Menstruation, cessation of: The ending of a woman's menstrual cycles. Menstruation ends naturally in middle age with the onset of menopause. It can also end suddenly as a result of induced menopause. Cessation of menstruation in nonmenopausal women may be due to pregnancy, illness, disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, medication, stress, overexercise, or malnutrition, among other causes. In particular, it can be a symptom of anorexia, signaling potentially dangerous changes in the body's hormonal system. Cessation of menstruation in women who have established a regular menstrual cycle, or in girls or teens who show other signs of anorexia, is a cause for medical concern. Also known as amenhorrhea."
Mental retardation,"Mental retardation: The condition of having an IQ measured as below 70 to 75 and significant delays or lacks in at least two areas of adaptive skills. Mental retardation is present from childhood. Between 2 and 3 percent of the general population meet the criteria for mental retardation. Causes of mental retardation include fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect; brain damage caused by the use of prescription or illegal drugs during pregnancy; brain injury and disease; and genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Treatment of mental retardation depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, such as phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism, special diets or medical treatments can help. In all cases, special education starting as early in infancy as possible can help people with mental retardation maximize their abilities."
Mercaptopurine,"Mercaptopurine: A drug that acts as an antimetabolite, interfering with the metabolism of purine bases and inhibiting the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Mercaptopurine is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and polycythemia vera. It is also used in the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Also known as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP, or MP."
Met,Met: Methionine. See also: Amino acid symbols.
Metabolic,"Metabolic: Relating to metabolism, the whole range of biochemical processes that occur within us (or any living organism). Metabolism consists of anabolism (the buildup of substances) and catabolism (the breakdown of substances). The term ""metabolic"" is often used to refer specifically to the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy."
Metabolic syndrome,"Metabolic syndrome: A constellation of conditions that place people at high risk for coronary artery disease. These conditions include type 2 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and a poor lipid profile with elevated LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, low HDL (""good"") cholesterol, elevated triglycerides. All of these conditions are associated with high blood insulin levels. The fundamental defect in the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance in both adipose tissue and muscle. Drugs that decrease insulin resistance also usually lower blood pressure and improve the lipid profile. Also called the insulin resistance syndrome, syndrome X, dysmetabolic syndrome X, and Reaven syndrome. The term Reaven syndrome refers to the Stanford University physician Gerald Reaven who first described the syndrome at the 1988 Banting Lecture of the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association."
Metabolism,Metabolism: The whole range of biochemical processes that occur within a living organism. Metabolism consists of anabolism (the buildup of substances) and catabolism (the breakdown of substances). The term metabolism is commonly used to refer specifically to the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy.
Metastasis,"Metastasis: 1. The process by which cancer spreads from the place at which it first arose as a primary tumor to distant locations in the body.
2. The cancer resulting from the spread of the primary tumor. For example, someone with melanoma may have a metastasis in their brain, while a person with colon cancer might, fortunately, have no metastases. Metastasis depends on the cancer cells acquiring two separate abilities -- increased motility and invasiveness. Cells that metastasize are basically of the same kind as those in the original tumor. If a cancer arises in the lung and metastasizes to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are lung cancer cells. However, the cells have acquired increased motility and the ability to invade another organ. The ancient Greeks used the word metastasis to mean ""removal from one place to another."" The plural of ""metastasis"" is ""metastases."" The term ""metastatic"" may be used along with the names of specific cancers to refer to the fact that the cancer has spread beyond its site of origin and has, therefore, become a metastatic cancer. For example, ""metastatic melanoma"" refers to melanoma that has spread beyond the skin to distant organs."
Metered-dose inhaler,"Metered-dose inhaler: Abbreviated MDI. A device that delivers a measured amount of medication as a mist the patient can inhale. A MDI consists of a pressurized canister of medication in a case with a mouthpiece. MDIs are portable, efficient and convenient. People with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema."
Methadone,Methadone: A synthetic opiate. The most common medical use for methadone is as a legal substitute for heroin in treatment programs for drug addiction.
Methemoglobinemia,"Methemoglobinemia: The presence in the blood of methemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin that is useless for carrying oxygen and delivering it to tissues throughout the human body. A small amount of methemoglobin is normally present in blood but the conversion of a larger fraction of hemoglobin into methemoglobin, which does not function well as an oxygen carrier, results in clinical symptoms. Since hemoglobin is the key carrier of oxygen in the blood, its replacement by methemoglobin can cause a slate gray-blueness of the skin (cyanosis), and potentially cause more serious symptoms due to insufficient oxygen. In more technical terms, methemoglobin is a transformation product of normal oxyhemoglobin. It is created by the oxidation of the ferrous iron present in the heme part of hemoglobin to ferric iron. Methemoglobinemia may be acquired anytime in life by exposure to a number of different chemical agents such as nitrites or certain medications (acquired methemoglobulinemia) or it may be present at birth (congenital) due a genetic condition."
Methicillin,"Methicillin: A semisynthetic penicillin-related antibiotic, also known as Staphcillin, that once was effective against staphylococci (staph) resistant to penicillin because they produce the enzyme penicillinase. Rarely used now, methicillin has been largely superceded by Vancomycin. Over the past 50 years, staph bacteria have become resistant to various antibiotics, including the commonly used penicillin-related antibiotics, including methicillin. These resistant bacteria are called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA."
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Staphylococcus aureus (a type of staph bacteria) resistant to the antibiotic methicillin. Abbreviated MRSA. MRSA first appeared among people in hospitals and other health facilities, especially among the elderly, the very sick, and those with an open wound, an IV catheter, or a urinary catheter. MRSA has since been found to cause illness in the community outside of hospitals and other health facilities. Community-associated MRSA infections typically cause skin lesions (such as boils), but can also cause severe illness. The transmission of MRSA is largely from people with active MRSA skin infections. MRSA is almost always spread by direct physical contact, and not through the air. Just as S. aureus can be carried on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease, MRSA can be carried in this way as well, a process known as colonization. MRSA infections are usually mild superficial infections of the skin that can be treated successfully with proper skin care and antibiotics. However, MRSA can be difficult to treat and can progress to life-threatening blood or bone infections because there are fewer effective antibiotics available for treatment."
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,"Methylenedioxymethamphetamine: 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), best known on the street as ""Ecstasy."" An illicit drug, considered a recreational or party drug. It acts as both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. Ecstasy achieves its high by preventing the brain from reabsorbing the chemical serotonin, thereby prolonging its effects in the body."
Metrorrhagia,"Metrorrhagia: Uterine bleeding at irregular intervals, particularly between the expected menstrual periods. Metrorrhagia may be a sign of an underlying disorder, such as hormone imbalance, endometriosis, uterine fibroids or, less commonly, cancer of the uterus. Metrorrhagia may cause significant anemia. See also: Menometrorrhagia; Menorrhagia."
mg,"mg: Abbreviation for milligram, a unit of measurement of mass in the metric system equal to a thousandth of a gram. A gram is equal to the mass of one milliliter, one thousandth of a liter, of water at 4 degrees C. MG (in capital letters) is the abbreviation for the disease myasthenia gravis."
MG (myasthenia gravis),"MG (myasthenia gravis): An autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fatigue and exhaustion of muscles. It is caused by a mistaken immune response to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR), which are found in junctions between muscles and the nervous system. The body produces antibodies that attack these AChR receptors, preventing signals from reaching the muscles. Proof that the anti-AChR antibodies are responsible for myasthenia comes from the effect these antibodies can have on the unborn and the newborn. Pregnancy: During pregnancy in a woman with myasthenia, the anti-AChR antibodies can cross the placenta and block the function of the fetal form of AChR leading to fetal paralysis. Fetal and neonatal death is a common consequence. Babies who survive often have arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (nonprogressive congenital contractures) due to lack of fetal muscle movement before birth. Transient signs of MG are seen in 10-15% of babies born to MG mothers. These problems are potentially preventable if the mother is effectively treated during pregnancy. Treatment: There is currently no cure for myasthenia gravis, but today at least 90 percent of patients with MG survive. A number of treatments are available that help, including steroids and other immunosuppressive medications and cholinergic medications."
MI,"MI: Commonly used abbreviation for myocardial infarction, otherwise known as a heart attack. The term ""myocardial infarction"" focuses on the heart muscle, which is called the myocardium,and the changes that occur in it due to the sudden deprivation of circulating blood. This is usually caused by arteriosclerosis with narrowing of the coronary arteries, the culminating event being a thrombosis (clot). The main change is death (necrosis) of myocardial tissue. The word ""infarction"" comes from the Latin ""infarcire"" meaning ""to plug up or cram."" It refers to the clogging of the artery."
Miasma,"Miasma: A poisonous vapor or mist believed to be made up of particles from decomposing material that could cause disease and could be identified by its foul smell. The miasma theory of disease originated in the Middle Ages and persisted for centuries. During the Great Plague of 1665, doctors wore masks filled with sweet-smelling flowers to keep out the poisonous miasmas. Because of the miasmas, they sanitized some buildings, required that night soil be removed from public proximity and had swamps drained to get rid of the bad smells. However, the miasmic approach only worked if something smelled bad. In the winter, sanitation was forgotten. The theory of miasmas was still popular in the 1800s and led to the ""Bad Air theory"" which lasted until the 1860s and 1870s. Miasmic reasoning prevented many doctors from adopting new practices like washing their hands between patients. Lethal agents traveled by air, they thought, not lodged beneath a doctor's fingernail. Although the miasma theory proved incorrect, it represented some recognition of the relation between dirtiness and disease. It encouraged cleanliness and paved the way for public health reform. The pioneer nurse Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) firmly believed in miasmas and became celebrated for her work in making hospitals clean, fresh and airy. The miasma theory also helped interest scientists in decaying matter and led eventually to the identification of microbes as agents of infectious disease."
Micro-,"Micro-: Prefix meaning small, as in microcephaly (small head) and microsomia (small body). The opposite of micro- is macro-."
Microangiopathy,"Microangiopathy: A disease of the capillaries (very small blood vessels), in which the capillary walls become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood. For example, diabetes predisposes to the development of microangiopathy in many areas, including the eye."
Microorchidism,"Microorchidism: Abnormally small testes. To determine if the testes are too small, a device called an orchidometer is used that permits the testes to be compared to a series of plastic ovals (like miniature American footballs) of differing sizes. Microorchidism is a diagnostic feature, for example, of the Prader-Willi syndrome and certain other multiple malformation syndromes. Microorchidism may also result from shrinkage (atrophy) of the testis due to damage, as from mumps. The opposite of macroorchidism is microorchidism (abnormally small testes)."
Micropenis,"Micropenis: An abnormally small penis. In medical practice, the dimension of the penis that is measured is the length. This measurement is taken along the upper surface of the shaft of the penis to the tip, using a measuring tape or, preferably, a ruler. The ruler is pressed firmly into the soft tissue over the pubic bone (the symphysis pubis) since, in obese boys and men, a seemingly small penis may be partly engulfed by the fat pad at its base and actually be quite normal in length. Normal standards are available for penile length. True micropenis is a penis that measures significantly less than normal. This may reflects failure of normal hormonal stimulation or a failure of normal development during the formation of the embryo (a birth defect). The prefix ""micro-"" is derived from the Greek ""mikros"" meaning small. It diminishes whatever it precedes."
Microphallus,"Microphallus: An abnormally small penis. Also called micropenis. In medical practice, the dimension of the penis that is measured is the length. The measurement is taken along the upper surface of the shaft of the penis to the tip, using a measuring tape or preferably a ruler. The ruler is pressed firmly into the soft tissue over the pubic bone (the symphysis pubis) since, in obese boys and men, a seemingly small penis may be partly engulfed by the fat pad at its base and actually be quite normal in length. Normal standards are available for penile length. True micropenis may reflect failure of normal hormonal stimulation or a failure of normal development during the formation of the embryo (a birth defect). The prefix ""micro-"" is derived from the Greek ""mikros"" meaning small. It diminishes whatever it precedes."
Microscope,"Microscope: An optical instrument that augments the power of the eye to see small objects. The name microscope was coined by Johannes Faber (1574-1629) who in 1628 borrowed from the Greek to combined micro-, small with skopein, to view. Although the first microscopes were simple microscopes, most (if not all) optical microscopes today are compound microscopes."
Microscopic anatomy,Microscopic anatomy: The study of normal structure of an organism under the microscope. Known among medical students simply as 'micro.' Also known as histology.
Microscopy,"Microscopy: The examination of minute objects by means of a microscope, an instrument which provides an enlarged image of an object not visible with the naked eye. Aside from the usual microscopy, there are various special types of microscopy including, for example: The word ""microscopy"" comes from Greek roots: mikros, small + skopeo, to view = to view small (objects)."
Microvascular,"Microvascular: Pertaining to the microvasculature, the portion of the vasculature of the body consisting of the smaller vessels, those with an internal diameter of at most 100 microns. In contrast to macrovascular."
Micturition,Micturition: Urination; the act of urinating.
Midget,"Midget: A very small person (or thing). Midget is a picturesque but somewhat disparaging term. It is the diminutive of midge (the insect), and who wants to be a mini-midge? A more correct term today for a very small person is dwarf or little person. The notion that a midget is (as some dictionaries state) a ""normal dwarf, a person who is unusually short...but is not deformed"" is incorrect."
Midnight disease,Midnight disease: See: Hypergraphia.
Midwife,"Midwife: A trained person who assists women during childbirth. Many midwives also provide prenatal care for pregnant women, birth education for women and their partners, and care for mothers and newborn babies after the birth. Depending on local law, midwives may deliver babies in the mother's home, in a birthing center or clinic, or in a hospital. Most midwives specialize in normal, uncomplicated deliveries, referring women with health problems that could require hospitalization during birth to a hospital-based obstetrician. Others work with physicians as part of a team. Legal qualifications required to practice midwifery differ among the US states and various countries."
Mifepristone,"Mifepristone: The French abortion pill, also known as RU-486. RU-486 has been used in combination with another drug called misoprostol, to terminate pregnancy at an early stage. It is used with women who are no more than 7 weeks pregnant. The drug has 95% effectiveness. About 5% of women using RU-486 in early pregnancies need additional medical intervention because of incomplete abortions. (doctors often intervene at higher rates in cases of natural miscarriages). The side effects with RU-486 are similar to those of a natural miscarriage."
Migraine,"Migraine: Usually, periodic attacks of headaches on one or both sides of the head. These may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Some migraines do not include headache, and migraines may or may not be preceded by an aura."
Migraine headache,"Migraine headache: The most common type of vascular headache involving abnormal sensitivity of arteries in the brain to various triggers resulting in rapid changes in the artery size due to spasm (constriction). Other arteries in the brain and scalp then open (dilate), and throbbing pain is perceived in the head. The tendency to migraine is inherited and appears to involve serotonin, a chemical in the brain involved in the transmission of nerve impulses that trigger the release of substances in the blood vessels that in turn cause the pain of the migraine. These nerve impulses cause the flashing lights and other sensory phenomena known as an aura that may accompany a migraine. Not all severe headaches are migraines and not all migraines are severe. Factors known to make migraines worse in some patients include stress, food sensitivities, menstruation, and the onset of menopause. Most patients will feel better if they lie down and avoid bright lights. Prevention measures can include taking preventative medication (usually an antispasmodic) and avoiding any known migraine triggers. Medication is also available that can ease the pain of a current migraine."
Migrainous neuralgia,"Migrainous neuralgia: A distinctive syndrome of headaches, today better known as cluster headache. There are two main clinical patterns of cluster headache -- the episodic and the chronic: The episodic and acute forms of cluster headache may transform into one another, so it seems most likely that they are merely different-appearing clinical patterns of one and the same disease. Although the mechanisms underlying cluster headache and migraine may have a degree of commonality, cluster headache looks to be different and distinct as a disease from migraine. For example, propranolol is effective for migraine but not cluster headache while lithium benefits cluster headache syndrome but not migraine. Cluster headache has also gone by a bevy of other confusing names including ciliary neuralgia, erythroprosopalgia, histamine cephalalgia, Raeder's syndrome, sphenopalatine neuralgia, and vidian neuralgia."
Magnesia,Milk of magnesia is a medication available as an over-the-counter product that is used as a laxative in addition to treating conditions related to stomach acid such as heartburn or indigestion. The active ingredient in milk of magnesia is magnesium hydroxide. It is believed to work as a laxative by drawing water into the intestinal tract. Milk of magnesia is available in liquid and chewable forms. Extended use or overuse of this medication for constipation may result in dependence on laxatives or chronic constipation.
Miller's lung,"Miller's lung: a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in people who are hypersensitive to the granary weevil (the wheat weevil or Sitophilus granarius). Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a type of inflammation of the lung that develops from breathing in a foreign substance. People who work with grains or flours contaminated with this weevil are at especially high risk for this disease. Hence, the name miller's lung. Symptoms typically have an acute onset and include fever, cough, chills, and shortness of breath within hours of re-exposure to the weevil. Given no further contact with the weevil, the person's symptoms typically improve over a day or two, but weeks may be need for full recovery. In the subacute form of miller's lung, a cough and shortness of breath develop over days or weeks and may be so severe as to require hospitalization. With chronic miller's lung from contact with the weevil over months to years, there may be scarring (fibrosis) of the lung with increasing shortness of breath and a cough productive of sputum, progressing over months or years to respiratory failure."
Milligram,"Milligram: A unit of measurement of mass in the metric system equal to a thousandth of a gram. A gram is equal to the mass of one milliliter, one thousandth of a liter, of water at 4 degrees C. The abbreviation for milligram is mg."
Milligray,"Milligray: A unit of absorbed radiation equal to 0.001 gray. (A gray is the dose of one joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter, or 100 rad.) Because the gray is such a large unit, many radiation measurements are made in milligrays. In particular, exposures from by X-ray equipment are typically expressed in the milligray range. The abbreviation for milligray is mGy."
Mimesis,"Mimesis: Imitation or mimicry. Mimesis in medicine refers to the hysterical simulation of organic disease and to the imitation of one organic disease by another. Mimesis in aesthetic or artistic theory refers to the attempt to imitate or reproduce reality. The word ""mimesis"" comes from the Greek verb ""mimeisthai"" meaning ""to imitate"" and from ""mimos"" meaning ""mime."" The English word ""mime"" also comes from ""mimos"" as do ""mimic"" and ""mimicry."""
Mind,"Mind: That which thinks, reasons, perceives, wills, and feels. The mind now appears in no way separate from the brain. In neuroscience, there is no duality between the mind and body. They are one."
Minor,"Minor: In general, something that is less than something else. For example, the teres minor muscle is smaller than the teres major muscle."
Miosis,Miosis: Contraction of the pupil. The opposite of miosis is mydriasis.
Misophonia,"Misophonia: a rare disorder in which certain sounds provoke extreme reactions of dislike or hatred in the affected individual. An example of mild misophonia is an aversion to the sound of fingernails scraping a blackboard. When the condition is more severe, the offending sound can produce rage, disgust, panic, hatred, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to flee. It is more common in females than in males and usually begins around ages 9-13. The exact cause is not understood. Treatments can include psychotherapy, certain antidepressant medications, and hearing aid-like devices that create distracting sounds."
"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS, MDDS)","Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS or MDDS): one of a number of diseases characterized by a decrease in the amount of mitochondrial DNA in affected body tissues. Mitochondria are structures within cells that are important for converting food into an energy form that cells can use, and they contain a small amount of DNA, although most of a cell's DNA resides within its nucleus. MDDS condition are genetic (inherited) and are passed to offspring in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition is usually fatal in infancy. Different forms of the condition affect the muscles (myopathic form), the liver (hepatopathic), or the or both the muscles and brain (encephalomyopathic). The condition gained much public attention in 2017 due to media reports of a boy named Charlie Gard born with the condition in the UK."
Mixed-lineage leukemia,"Mixed-lineage leukemia: A type of childhood leukemia in which a piece of chromosome 11 has been translocated (broken off and attached itself to another chromosome). Children with this type of leukemia have a particularly poor prognosis (outlook). The name comes from the fact that that the gene expression profiles in this disease differ from those seen in ALL and AML. They usually have very high white blood counts and a high frequency of central nervous system involvement. They do not respond at all well to the standard therapies for ALL (acute lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemia) and often suffer from early relapse after chemotherapy. The mixed lineage leukemia gene is located at 11q23. Translocations affecting this region may be seen in as many as 80% of infants presenting with acute leukemia in the first 6 months of life. The frequency diminishes between 6 months and 1 year of age, but is still significant. The frequency declines in children and then adults with increasing age but may still be found in 3% to 4% of adults with AML and ALL. The translocation may be difficult to detect with conventional chromosome analysis and more sophisticated analytic techniques may be needed to detect it. Mixed lineage leukemia is a distinct entity, not a subtype of ALL, and may require different therapeutic efforts be made."
MM,"MM: In medicine, the abbreviation for meningomyelocele (spina bifida), malignant melanoma, and multiple myeloma. (In lower case letters, mm stands for millimeter.)"
MME,"MME: Metallomembrane endopeptidase, also known as membrane metalloendopeptidase. MME is also called CALLA (Common Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia antigen) a cell surface marker for the most common form of acute lymphocytic leukemia. There is however some confusion regarding the specificity of this marker. MME is identical to neutral endopeptidase and is the target of antibodies directed against podocytes- cells which line the glomerulus or primary filtration site in the kidney. Mutations in the gene for MME that shorten it can cause a kidney disease called membranous nephropathy. The gene for MME is on chromosome 3 in the region 3q21-q27. MME is also synonymous with CD10, membrane metalloendopeptidase, enkephalinase, and neprilysin."
Modafinil,"Modafinil: An oral drug first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of narcolepsy, a condition in which there is an uncontrollable desire to sleep. Modafinil promotes wakefulness. In 2004 the FDA also approved modafinil for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and sleeping problems caused by shift work. Modafinil is said to be in common ""off-label"" use by college students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake when normally they should be sleeping. The drug is reportedly also being prescribed for numerous other problems including fatigue, depression, multiple sclerosis, and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Some of these ""off-label"" uses may prove legitimate while others may be abuses of the drug. Modafil stimulates the brain without producing the jitteriness of caffeine or the addiction and euphoria of amphetamines. Modafinil is believed to act by affecting dopamine and other neurotransmitters including histamine and norepinephrine. It is sold under the brand name Provigil."
Mole,"Mole: 1. In dermatology a mole is a pigmented spot on the skin. The medical term for mole is melanocytic nevus (a nevus composed of melanocytes). 2. In gynecology, a mass within the uterus formed of partly developed products of conception.
3. In biochemistry, the molecular weight of a substance. In more technical terms, a mole is the number of atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. Mole in this sense is short for molecular weight."
Molecular biology,"Molecular biology: The study of biology on a molecular level including the structure, function, and makeup of biologically important molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. The field of molecular biology involves many other areas of biology such as biochemistry and genetics."
Mongolism,"Mongolism: Obsolete name for Down syndrome. Down syndrome refers to the 19th century English physician J. Langdon Down who described the condition in 1866. In great error, Langdon Down attributed the condition to a ""reversion"" to the ""mongoloid race."" He held that evolution had been reversed and there had been a sort of backslide from the superior Caucasian to the inferior Oriental race. The misnomer ""mongolism"" is incorrect and racist and is to be avoided."
Mono,Mono: Popular name for infectious mononucleosis.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor,Monoamine oxidase inhibitor: One of a potent class of medications used to treat depression. Abbreviated MAOI.
Monoclonal,Monoclonal: Derived from a single cell and cells identical to that cell.
Monoclonal antibody,Monoclonal antibody: An antibody produced by a single clone of cells. A monoclonal antibody is therefore a single pure type of antibody. Monoclonal antibodies can be made in large quantities in the laboratory and are a cornerstone of immunology. Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly coming into use as therapeutic agents.
Monocyte,Monocyte: A white blood cell that has a single nucleus and can take in (ingest) foreign material.
Mononucleosis,"Mononucleosis: Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus 4, HHV-4) in which there is an increase of white blood cells that have a single nucleus (monocytes). The infection can be spread by saliva. Its incubation period is four to eight weeks. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands. Mononucleosis can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) and spleen enlargement; vigorous contact sports should be avoided to prevent spleen rupture. It is less severe in young children. Most people exposed to EBV do not develop mononucleosis: most adults carry an antibody against EBV in their blood, meaning they have been infected with EBV at some time. Treatment includes rest, pain medication, and in some cases anti-viral medication. Also known as mono, the kissing disease. See also Epstein-Barr virus."
Monosodium glutamate,"Monosodium glutamate: MSG, a sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid that enhances the flavor of certain foods. Originally isolated from seaweed, MSG is now made by fermenting corn, potatoes and rice. It does not enhance the four basic tastes (bitter, salty, sour, sweet) but it does enhance the complex flavors of meat, poultry, seafood, and vegetables. MSG is an important ingredient in the cuisines of China and Japan and is used commercially worldwide in many types of foods. It is naturally present at high levels in tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. In China, MSG is known as wei jing, which means flavor essence. The Chinese restaurant syndrome was first described in 1968 in people who had eaten Chinese food on which MSG had been lavished. The syndrome only seems to occur in some people. Their symptoms may include headache, throbbing of the head, dizziness, lightheadedness, a feeling of facial pressure, tightness of the jaw, burning or tingling sensations over parts of the body, chest pain, and back pain. Large amounts of MSG may cause arterial dilatation (widening of arteries). Many Chinese do not believe in the existence of the Chinese restaurant syndrome. It may be a hypersensitive (allergic) reaction."
Morpheus,"Morpheus: In Greek and Roman mythology, the son of sleep and the god of dreams who lay on an ebony bed in a dim-lit cave, surrounded by poppies. (Opium is derived from poppies, Genus Papaver somniferum.) Morpheus was the son of Hypnos from whence comes hypnosis. To be in the arms of Morpheus is to be asleep. The drug morphine is named after Morpheus. The Roman poet Ovid (43BC-17AD) coined the name of Morpheus from the Greek morphe, form + the Latin -eus, because Morpheus was responsible for shaping dreams, and giving shape to the beings who inhabit dreams."
Morphine,"Morphine: A powerful narcotic agent that has strong analgesic (pain relief) action and other significant effects on the central nervous system. It is dangerously addicting. Morphine is a naturally occurring member of a large chemical class of compounds called alkaloids. The name, which derives from Morpheus (the mythologic god of dreams) was coined in 1805 by German apothecary Adolf Serturner to designate the main alkaloid in opium. Opium comes from the poppy plant."
Morphology,Morphology: The science of structure and form of organisms without regard to function.
Mosaic,"Mosaic: A person or a tissue that contains two or more types of genetically different cells. All females are mosaics because of X-chromosome inactivation (lyonization). Mosaic patterns can affect the way genetic disorders are expressed. For example, about 5 percent of people with Down syndrome have a mosaic variant in which only some cells have an extra chromosome 21. Compared to others with Down syndrome, these individuals have fewer clinical symptoms, are more likely to have a normal IQ, and are less likely to have heart and other problems that can be associated with Down syndrome."
Mother,"Mother: (1) The female parent. (2) To produce offspring as a female. To attribute the maternity of. (3) A cell or other structure from which similar cells or structures are formed. Accordingly, such a cell might be referred to as the mother cell.(4) To provide maternal protection, guidance, and nurturing to children."
Motion sickness,"Motion sickness: A disorder of the sense of balance and equilibrium and, hence, the sense of spatial orientation that is caused by repeated motion such as from the swell of the sea, the movement of a car, or the motion of a plane in turbulent air. Motion sickness is due to irritation of a portion of the inner ear called the labyrinth. The symptoms of motion sickness include nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. Other common signs of motion sickness are sweating and a general feeling of discomfort and not feeling well (malaise). Symptoms usually stop when the motion that causes it ceases. However, some people suffer symptoms for even a few days after the trip is over."
Motor,"Motor: Something that produces or refers to motion. For example, a motor neuron is a nerve cell that conveys an impulse to a muscle for contraction, which then moves a joint."
Mouth,"Mouth: 1. The upper opening of the digestive tract, beginning with the lips and containing the teeth, gums, and tongue. Foodstuffs are broken down mechanically in the mouth by chewing and saliva is added as a lubricant. Saliva contains amylase, an enzyme that digests starch. 2. Any opening or aperture in the body. The mouth in both senses of the word is also called the os, the Latin word for an opening, or mouth. The o in os is pronounced as in hope. The genitive form of os is oris from which comes the word oral."
MP,MP: Abbreviation for mercaptopurine and molecular pathology.
MPH,"MPH: Master of public health, a degree designating successful training in analyzing past, present, and future public health issues."
MPO,MPO: Myeloperoxidase.
MPS,MPS: Abbreviation for mucopolysaccharidosis.
MRA,"MRA: The magnetic resonance angiogram, or MRA, is a noninvasive test that has demonstrated usefulness in defining the anatomy of blood vessels of certain size in the head and neck. MRA serves as a complement to traditional MRI scanning in evaluation of the brain and neck. Conventional angiograms, whereby contrast material is injected through a catheter into the blood vessels of the body are the gold standard (most accurate) for determining the anatomy of these vessels. The advantages of magnetic resonance angiogram is that it is faster and easier (it does not involve the catheters, contrast material, and risks of angiograms). Another advantage is that magnetic resonance angiogram also gives an image of the tissue of the brain. Magnetic resonance angiogram is a general term that refers to various imaging techniques that are used to visualize the blood vessels by using magnetic resonance (MR) signal changes that are affected by changes in the flow of blood caused by changes in the shape of the blood vessels. Magnetic resonance angiogram can be used to detect small ballooning of the blood vessels (aneurysms) as small as 4 millimeters in diameter. Smaller aneurysms can require an angiogram for detection. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiogram in detecting aneurysms can be affected by bleeding within the brain and the location of the aneurysms within the brain. Magnetic resonance angiogram can also detect abnormal design (malformations), and atherosclerosis of blood vessels within the brain. Atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries of the neck can be visualized with magnetic resonance angiogram. Magnetic resonance angiogram does not have significant application for the detection or definition of cancer of the brain."
MRC,"MRC: 1. In the US, the Medical Reserve Corps. 2. In the UK and some Commonwealth countries, the Medical Research Council."
MRCP,"MRCP: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, an application of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system. An MRCP uses an MRI machine with special software to obtain images comparable to the cholangiogram and pancreatogram obtained by the more invasive approach with ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) without the added risks of sedation, pancreatitis, and perforation. MRCP may be useful, for example, in cases with unexplained abdominal pain in which there is a low or uncertain probability of hepatobiliary pathology such as retained stones in the common bile duct, cancer, biliary dyskinesia, or idiopathic pancreatitis. MRCP in another context can stand for something quite different. MRCP(UK) means Member, Royal College of Physicians (in the UK)."
MRD,"MRD: Minimal residual disease, evidence for the presence of residual malignant cells, even when so few cancer cells are present that they cannot be found by routine means. Tests for minimal residual disease (MRD) can detect some early tumors. In a patient who has been treated, the detection of MRD indicates that treatment is incomplete. MRD can thus distinguish who needs intensive and potentially more toxic therapy from those who do not. The general premise underlying MRD is that knowledge of MRD can effectively guide clinical care and increase cure rates. There are a number of different techniques for detecting MRD. Among those techniques are flow cytometry and PCR (the polymerase chain reaction). These laboratory methods allow for the detection of very few abnormal cells existing among the many normal cells which may greatly outnumber them. Flow cytometry: A flow cytometer, a laser-based instrument, is used in MRD detection to analyze a sample of cells and count any malignant cells present in the sample. The cell sample may be from blood or bone marrow. The cells are stained with a number of different antibodies specific for different antigens known to be expressed by the malignant cells. The antibodies have fluorescent tags on them to permit the flow cytometer to detect them and thereby count the malignant cells. This technology can detect one leukemic cell among 10,000 or more normal cells. PCR: Tests for MRD using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can identify malignant cells based on their characteristic chromosome rearrangements. For example, PCR can detect evidence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which is found in about 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 2%-10% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 20%-50% of adults with ALL. The Ph arises through a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 which creates a chimeric (hybrid) gene called bcr-abl that causes the malignancy. By PCR, the chimeric bcr-abl messenger RNA transcript can be detected. With PCR it is possible to detect one Ph-positive cell within a million normal cells."
MS/MS,MS/MS: Abbreviation for tandem mass spectrometry. See: Tandem mass spectrometry.
MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein),"MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein): The presence of AFP, a plasma protein normally produced by the fetus, in the mother's blood. The MSAFP serves as the basis for some valuable tests. AFP is manufactured principally in the fetus's liver and, also, in the fetal gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the yolk sac, a structure temporarily present during embryonic development. The level of AFP is typically high in the fetus's blood, goes down in the baby's blood after birth, and by a year of age is virtually undetectable. During pregnancy, AFP crosses the placenta from the fetal circulation and appears in the mother's blood. The level of AFP in the mother's blood (the maternal serum AFP) provides a screening test for a number of disorders including: The maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) tends to be:"
MSG,"MSG: Monosodium glutamate, a sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid that enhances the flavor of certain foods.

Large amounts of MSG may cause arterial dilatation (widening of arteries). Many Chinese do not believe in the existence of the Chinese restaurant syndrome. It may be a hypersensitive (allergic) reaction."
MST,"MST: A multiple subpial transection (MST) is a procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact."
MTX,MTX: Abbreviation for methotrexate.
Mucosa,"Mucosa: Having to do with a mucous membrane. For example, the oral mucosa."
Mucous,"Mucous: Pertaining to mucus, a thick fluid produced by the lining of some tissues of the body."
Mucus,Mucus: A thick fluid that is produced by the lining of some organs of the body.
Mucus colitis,"Mucus colitis: A common gastrointestinal disorder involving an abnormal condition of gut contractions (motility) and gut sensation (hypersensitivity) characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel habits with diarrhea or constipation or alternating diarrhea and constipation, symptoms that tend to be chronic and to wax and wane over the years. Although the disorder can cause chronic recurrent discomfort, it does not lead to any serious organ problems. Making the diagnosis usually involves suspecting and making a positive diagnosis and excluding other illnesses. Treatment is directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating high fiber and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners), exercise, relaxation techniques, and medications. Alternative names include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nervous colon syndrome, and spastic colitis."
Multicentric,"Multicentric: Having more than one center. A term often applied to tumors. A minority of Wilms tumors are multicentric and appear to represent separate tumors. A multicentric breast cancer involves two or more distinct primary tumors, usually in different quadrants of the breast. Also called multifocal or polycentric."
Multidetector computed tomography,"Multidetector computed tomography: (MDCT) A form of computed tomography (CT) technology for diagnostic imaging. In MDCT, a two-dimensional array of detector elements replaces the linear array of detector elements used in typical conventional and helical CT scanners. The two-dimensional detector array permits CT scanners to acquire multiple slices or sections simultaneously and greatly increase the speed of CT image acquisition. Image reconstruction in MDCT is more complicated than that in single section CT. Nonetheless, the development of MDCT has resulted in the development of high resolution CT applications such as CT angiography and CT colonoscopy. Multidetector computed tomography is also known by a confusing array of other terms such as multidetector CT, multidetector-row computed tomography, multidetector-row CT, multisection CT, multislice computed tomography, and multislice CT."
Multifactorial,"Multifactorial: In medicine, referring to multiple factors in heredity or disease. For example, traits and conditions that are caused by more than one gene occurring together are multifactorial, and diseases that are caused by more than one factor interacting (for example, heredity and diet in diabetes) are multifactorial."
Multifocal,"Multifocal: Having to do with two or more foci or arising from two or more places. For example, aortic aneurysm disease is often multifocal and needs total aortic screening for diagnosis."
Multipara,Multipara: A woman who has had two or more pregnancies resulting in potentially viable offspring. The term para refers to births. A para III has had three such pregnancies; a para VI or more is also known as a grand 'multipara.
Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma: A bone marrow cancer that involves a type of white blood cell called a plasma (or myeloma) cell. The tumor cells in myeloma can form a single collection (plasmacytoma) or many tumors (multiple myeloma). Plasma cells are normally part of the immune system; they make antibodies. Because myeloma patients have an excess of identical plasma cells, they have too much of one type of antibody. As myeloma cells increase in number, they damage and weaken the bones, causing pain and often fractures. When bones are damaged, too much calcium is released into the blood, leading to loss of appetite, nausea, thirst, fatigue, muscle weakness, restlessness, and confusion. Myeloma cells prevent the bone marrow from forming normal plasma cells and other white blood cells that are important to the immune system, so patients with multiple myeloma may not be able to fight infections. Myeloma cells can also prevent the growth of new red blood cells in the marrow, causing anemia. Excess antibody proteins and calcium may prevent the kidneys from filtering and cleaning the blood properly. Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant are the primary treatments. Also known as plasma cell myeloma and myeloma."
Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis: A disease that is characterized by loss of myelin (demyelinization). Abbreviated MS. Myelin, the coating of nerve fibers, is composed of lipids (fats) and protein. It serves as insulation and permits efficient nerve fiber conduction. In MS, demyelinization usually affects white matter in the brain, but sometimes it extends into the gray matter. When myelin is damaged, nerve fiber conduction is faulty or absent, and nerve cell death may occur. Impaired bodily functions or altered sensations associated with those demyelinated nerve fibers give rise to the symptoms of MS, which range from numbness to paralysis and blindness. People with MS experience attacks of symptoms that may last days, months, or longer. For many patients, the disease is progressive and leads to disablement, although some cases enter long, perhaps even permanent, remission. The cause of MS is unknown, although viral activity is suspected. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40. Rarely, children and teens develop MS (pediatric MS). Until recently, treatment had focused on preventing attacks. Steroids, interferon, and medications to treat specific symptoms (such as fatigue, depression, and vertigo) are standard, along with lifestyle changes to avoid stress and other triggers. New treatment options involve immune system modulation or support."
Multiple system failure,"Multiple system failure: The failure of two or more systems in the body as, for example, the cardiovascular and renal systems. Multiple system failure is also known as multiple organ failure, as when both the heart and kidney give out. Multiple organ or system failure is often given as the cause of death on the death certificate. However, the National Center for Health Statistics recommends that: ""When a number of conditions or multiple organ/system failure resulted in death, the physician, medical examiner, or coroner should choose a single sequence to describe the process leading to death and list the other conditions... """
Munchausen syndrome by proxy,"Munchausen syndrome by proxy: A parenting disorder in which the parent either fabricates an illness or induces an illness in their child. Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) differs from other forms of parenting disorder in that the offending parent is almost always the mother, she usually appears to be a model mother, there is little or no indication of family discord, and the abusive behavior is clearly premeditated, not impulsive, and not in reaction to the child's behavior. Fabricated illness is the more frequent form of MSBP. The parent may claim that their child is ill, when the child is not. For example, a parent might claim their child is having seizures when the child is not. Or a parent may allege that their child is passing blood in its urine and provides urine samples suggesting this is so, whereas the parent has pricked their own finger and dripped blood into the urine sample. Induced illness is the less frequent but more dangerous form of MSBP. This involves the parent inflicting damage on their own child. For instance, the parent may inject air under the child's skin or feed the child too much salt and make them sick. Some of these child victims die at the hands of their parents. Claims have been made that MSBP is more common than is generally thought or that it is rare or even that it does not exist. However, cases of MSBY have been documented beyond a reason doubt and we have ourselves seen several cases. In all likelihood, MSBP is probably uncommon but in truth the frequency of MSBP is uncertain. The psychological basis for MSBP is also uncertain. In some cases, there is a misdirected parental desire for attention. In other cases, the parent may have a history of mental illness. Or the parent may have been abused as a child themselves. We believe that the causes of MSBP may well be heterogeneous and vary from case to case. The term Munchausen syndrome by proxy was coined by the British pediatrician Roy Meadow in a report describing two cases of the condition in 1977. Other names for the condition include fabricated illness by proxy, factitious disorder by proxy. Meadow syndrome, and Polle syndrome (after the fictional Baron Munchausen's only child who died at a year of age)."
Munchhausen syndrome,"Munchhausen syndrome: Recurrent feigning of catastrophic illnesses. Munchhausen syndrome is a psychological disorder that is characterized by the recurrent presentation of the patient for treatment of an acute and often dire illness that is, in reality, not present. The person with Munchhausen syndrome usually gives a plausible and dramatic history. All of it is entirely false. The patient tends to go from hospital to hospital feigning medical or surgical diseases and giving false and fanciful information about their medical and social background. They may even have unnecessary surgery repeatedly, resulting for example in a ""mass of scars"" on the abdomen, what has been called a ""gridiron abdomen."" Some patients with Munchhausen's syndrome cause their own illness, as by secretly ingesting or injecting substances. The syndrome was named by an astute English physician Richard Asher in 1951 after the German cavalry officer Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymous von Munchhausen (1720-97), a teller of tall tales. Although Asher named the syndrome, he did not discover it. In 1893 Henry Miege, a student of the famed French neurologist Jean Charcot, wrote his thesis on patients with the syndrome and Charcot (1825-1893) referred to it in his own writing. Forty years later, the Kansas psychiatrist Karl Menninger (1893-1990) discussed the subject in a paper entitled ""Polysurgery and Polysurgical Addiction."" However, it was Asher's article that crystallized the syndrome and brought it to general medical attention. The first sentence in Asher's article stated, ""Here is described a common syndrome which most doctors have seen, but about which little has been written."" This prompted a flurry of responses in which doctors testified that they, too, had had patients with this mysterious malady. Although the Baron's name was Munchhausen, it is commonly written without the umlaut as ""Munchhausen"" in English."
Murmur,Murmur: A sound due to vibrations from the flow of blood through the heart or great vessels. A murmur may be innocent and be of no significance. Or it may be pathologic and reflect disease. A murmur is usually heard with a stethoscope.
Muscle,"Muscle: Muscle is the tissue of the body which primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscle in the body. Muscle which is responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the body is called ""skeletal muscle."" Heart muscle is called ""cardiac muscle."" Muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel is called ""smooth muscle."""
Muscle relaxant,"Muscle relaxant: Muscle relaxant is a term usually used to refer to skeletal muscle relaxants (drugs), which act on the central nervous system (CNS) to relax muscles. These drugs are often prescribed to reduce pain and soreness associated with sprains, strains, or other types of muscle injury. Some examples of commonly prescribed skeletal muscle relaxant medications include carisoprodol (Soma), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), and metaxalone (Skelaxin), which are taken in tablet form. Muscle relaxant drugs are only available by prescription in the U.S. Other types of muscle relaxant drugs (neuromuscular blocking drugs) are sometimes used during the induction of general anesthesia or during insertion of an endotracheal (ET) tube. These muscle relaxants are given intravenously (through the bloodstream) and act directly on the muscles. Examples of muscle relaxants used during surgical procedures include succinylcholine (Anectine, Sucostrin), atracurium (Tracrium), and pancuronium (Pavulon)."
Muscle Spasm,"Muscle spasm is a common, involuntary tightening or contraction of a muscle or group of muscles. Muscle spasms typically are not predictable and can be quite painful. Thighs, feet, calves, hands, and arms are common locations for muscle spasms. Muscle spasms are also referred to as muscle cramps. Spasms may last for a few seconds or up to several minutes, and they may recur after they have gone away. The pain can range from mild to severe. The affected muscle may feel hardened to the touch or may appear to have a distorted shape. Twitching is another possible associated symptom. Anyone can be affected by muscle spasms."
Muscular,"Muscular: Having to do with the muscles. Also, endowed with above average muscle development. Muscular system refers to all of the muscles of the body collectively."
Mute,"Mute: A mute is a person who does not speak, either from an inability to speak or an unwillingness to speak. The term ""mute"" is specifically applied to a person who, due to profound congenital (or early) deafness, is unable to use articulate language and so is deaf-mute. A mute in speech is a letter that is silent and also an element of speech formed by a position of the mouth which stops the passage of the breath, such as the letters p, b, d, k, and t. The word ""mute"" comes from the Latin ""mutus"" meaning unable to speak."
Mutism,"Mutism: The inability or unwillingness to speak. A person who is mute cannot or does not care to talk. Someone who was mute was said to be dumb, not in the sense of being stupid, but in the sense of being devoid of the power of speech. The term ""mutism"" is specifically applied to people who, due to profound congenital (or early) deafness, are unable to use articulate language and so are affected by deaf-mutism. The word ""mutism' comes from the Latin ""mutus"" meaning unable to speak."
MVP,"MVP: In medicine, not the most valuable player but mitral valve prolapse."
Myalgia,Myalgia: Pain in the muscles or within muscle 'tissue.
Myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis: An autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by fatigue and exhaustion of muscles. Abbreviated MG. MG is caused by a mistaken immune response to the body's own nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are found in junctions between muscles and the nervous system. The body produces antibodies that attack these receptors, preventing signals from reaching the muscles. A number of treatments are available that help, including steroids and other immunosuppressive medications and anticholinergic medications."
Myc-,"Myc-: Prefix that denotes a relationship to fungus. From the Greek mykes, meaning fungus."
Myco-,"Myco-: Prefix that denotes a relationship to fungus. From the Greek mykes, meaning fungus."
Mycobacterium,Mycobacterium: A large family of bacteria that have unusually waxy cell walls that are resistant to digestion. The mycobacteria includes: The mycobacteria are acid-fast rod-shaped bacteria. They are usually slow-growing. Many are intracellular parasites.
Mycobacterium avium,Mycobacterium avium: A slow-growing bacterium found in the soil and in dust particles that causes tuberculosis in birds and swine and is responsible for the mycobacterium avian complex (MAC) in humans. See: Mycobacterium avian complex.
Mycobacterium avium complex,"Mycobacterium avium complex: A serious opportunistic infection that is caused by two similar bacteria, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intercellulare, which are found in the soil and in dust particles. Abbreviated MAC. In persons with suppressed immune systems, such as people with AIDS, MAC can spread through the bloodstream to infect lymph nodes, bone marrow, the liver, the spleen, spinal fluid, the lungs, and the intestinal tract. Typical symptoms of MAC include night sweats, weight loss, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, and enlarged spleen. Antibiotics are commonly used in MAC prevention (for persons with suppressed immune systems) and treatment."
Mycoplasma,"Mycoplasma: A large group of bacteria, with more than 100 types identified. Mycoplasma are very simple one-celled organisms without outer membranes. They penetrate and infect individual cells. Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are examples of mycoplasma bacteria that occur in humans."
Mydriasis,Mydriasis: Dilation of the pupil. The opposite of mydriasis is miosis.
Myeloencephalitis,"Myeloencephalitis:Inflammation of both the spinal cord and the brain. Myeloencephalitis (also called encephalomyelitis) can be caused by a variety of conditions that lead to inflammation of the spinal cord and brain. Among the common causes of myeloencephalitis are viruses which infect the nervous system. One type, acute disseminated myeloencephalitis, occurs most commonly after an acute viral infection such as measles (rubeola) and is due to be an autoimmune attack upon the nervous system. ""Myelo"" refers to the spinal cord; ""encephal-"" comes from the Greek ""enkephalon"", brain; and ""-itis"" means inflammation = spinal cord and brain inflammation."
ibrosis,"Myelofibrosis: Spontaneous scarring (fibrosis) of the bone marrow that disrupts the normal production of blood cells, leading to severe anemia and enlargement of the spleen and liver. Myelofibrosis usually begins slowly and worsens over time. It can be associated with a variety of diseases, primarily myeloproliferative (preleukemic) disorders. Also known as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia."
Myeloperoxidase,Myeloperoxidase: An enzyme in leukocytes (white blood cells) that is linked to inflammation and cardiovascular disease. An elevated blood level of the enzyme predicts the early risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack). Abbreviated MPO.
MYH,"MYH: A base excision repair gene responsible for an hereditary colon cancer syndrome. MYH is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 in region 1p34.3-p32.1. MYH encodes an enzyme that removes the base adenine from mispairs (with 8-oxoguanine) that arise during the replication of oxidized DNA. MYH is also known as MUTYH. A substantial proportion of people with multiple polyps in the colon, perhaps as many as 30% of those who have 15 to 100 polyps, have biallelic MYH mutations. (Both of their MYH genes are mutant.) From another perspective, up to 10% of families thought to have FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis) but who do not have the usual mutation in the APC gene, have biallelic mutations in the MYH gene. The MYH syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most people with the syndrome do not have a multigenerational family history of polyps or cancer of the colon but may have brothers or sisters with it. The MYH syndrome can result in very few or several hundred polyps in the colon. There is no tendency to extracolonic tumors (growths outside the colon and rectum) associated with MYH. In sum, the MYH syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of colorectal adenomatous polyposis (familial adenomatous polyposis or familial polyposis of the colon and rectum)."
Myo- (prefix),"Myo- (prefix): A prefix denoting a relationship to muscle. Myo- enters into many words and terms in medicine including cardiomyopathy, dermatomyositis, electromyography, leiomyoma, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, myocardium, myoclonic, myocyte, myopathy, myoglobin, myometrium, myotonia, myotonic dystrophy, and polymyositis."
Myocardial infarction,"Myocardial infarction: A heart attack. Abbreviated MI. The term ""myocardial infarction"" focuses on the myocardium (the heart muscle) and the changes that occur in it due to the sudden deprivation of circulating blood. The main change is necrosis (death) of myocardial tissue. The word ""infarction"" comes from the Latin ""infarcire"" meaning ""to plug up or cram."" It refers to the clogging of the artery."
Myocarditis,"Myocarditis: Inflammation of the myocardium, the heart muscle. Myocarditis can be caused by a number of different conditions. The most common cause is infection of the heart muscle by a virus. The virus causes the initial heart muscle inflammation. After the initial viral infection subsides, the body's immune system continues to inflict inflammatory damage on the heart muscles, prolonging the myocarditis, a process termed autoimmunity. Other causes of myocarditis include such as a disease called sarcoidosis, various autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus, and certain drugs."
Myoclonus,Myoclonus: A condition of abnormal contraction of muscles or portions of muscles.
Myocyte,"Myocyte: A muscle cell. From myo-, muscle + -cyte, cell = muscle cell. ""Remaining young at heart is a desirable but elusive goal. Unbeknown to us, however, myocyte regeneration may accomplish just that."" (Nature 415, 240, 2003)"
Myoma,"Myoma: A tumor of muscle. Myoma can refer specifically to a benign tumor of uterine muscle, also called a leiomyoma or a fibroid."
Myometrium,Myometrium: The muscular outer layer of the uterus.
Myopathy,Myopathy: Any and all diseases of muscle.
Myopia,"Myopia: Nearsightedness, the ability to see close objects more clearly than distant objects. Myopia can be caused by a longer-than-normal eyeball or by any condition that prevents light rays from focusing on the retina. Most forms of myopia can be managed with corrective lenses. Surgery is available to permanently correct some forms of myopia, although long-term effectiveness and safety has not been fully determined."
Myotonic dystrophy,"Myotonic dystrophy: An inherited disease in which the muscles contract but have decreasing power to relax -- this phenomenon is termed myotonia (irritability and prolonged contraction of muscles). The disease also leads to a mask-like expressionless face, premature balding, cataracts, and heart arrhythmias (abnormalities in heart rhythm). The onset of such problems is usually in young adulthood. However, onset can be at any age and the disease is extremely variable in the degree of severity. Myotonic dystrophy is due to a trinucleotide repeat (a ""stuttering"" sequence of three bases) in the DNA. The myotonic dystrophy gene (called DM1), found on chromosome 19q13.3, codes for a protein kinase (an enzyme) that is found in skeletal muscle. An unusual feature is that the signs and symptoms of the disease usually become more severe with each successive generation. This is because mistakes in the faithful copying of the gene from one generation to the next result in the amplification of a genomic ""AGC/CTG triplet repeat."" Unaffected individuals have between 5 and 27 copies of AGC/CTG, myotonic dystrophy patients who are minimally affected have at least 50 repeats, while more severely affected patients have an expansion of up to several kilobase pairs. Myotonic dystrophy is not genetically homogeneous; it is more than one genetic entity. Some families with myotonic dystrophy have a mutation in a gene on chromosome 3q21 (at the DM2 locus). The DM2 mutation is a huge expansion of a tetranucleotide repeat (CCTG) in a noncoding region of the ZNF9 gene. Both DM1 and DM2 appear to cause disease through the effects of the mutant RNA (that contains abnormal repeating sequences). Myotonic dystrophy is not to be confused with muscular dystrophy. They are distinct and different diseases."
Myotonic dystrophy type 2,"Myotonic dystrophy type 2: An inherited disorder of the muscles and other body systems characterized by progressive muscle weakness, prolonged muscle contractions (myotonia), clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), cardiac abnormalities, balding, and infertility. Type 2 myotonic dystrophy is caused by mutation of a different gene than type 1 myotonic dystrophy and tends to be milder than type 1. Only about 2% of people with myotonic dystrophy reportedly have type 2. The gene for type 2 myotonic dystrophy was only discovered in 2001, which may help explain the low number of diagnoses to date. Type 2 myotonic dystrophy may be as common as type 1 myotonic dystrophy in families with German ancestry. Mutations in the ZNF9 gene cause type 2 myotonic dystrophy. These mutations are abnormally long expansions of a tetranucleotide repeat sequence in the DNA. The disease more severe as the disorder is passed down from one generation to the next. This phenomenon is called anticipation. Myotonic dystrophy, type 2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 is also called dystrophica myotonia 2; DM2; myotonic dystrophy 2; myotonic myopathy, proximal; proximal myotonic myopathy; PROMM; and Ricker syndrome."
Myriad,"Myriad: A great number, a very large number, a huge number of something. There are, for example, myriad ways in which syphilis can present; it is the great imitator. ""Myriad"" is a Greek word for 10,000 (ten thousand)."
Nadir,"Nadir: The lowest point. The nadir may refer, for example, to the lowest blood count after chemotherapy or the lowest concentration of a drug in the body."
Nail care,"Nail care: Care of the fingernails and toenails. Many nail problems are due to poor nail care. Recommendations for maintaining nail health include keeping nails clean and dry to keep bacteria and other infectious organisms from collecting under the nails, cutting nails straight across with only slight rounding at the tip, using a fine-textured file to keep nails shaped and free of snags, and avoiding nail-biting. It is a good idea to soak toenails that are thick and difficult to cut in warm salt water (1 tsp. salt to 1 pint of water) for 5 to 10 minutes, and apply a 10 percent urea cream (available at drugstores, without a prescription) before trimming. One should not 'dig out' ingrown toenails, especially if they are sore; instead, a physician should provide treatment. Nail changes, swelling, and pain can signal serious problems that should be reported to a physician."
Nail furrows,"Nail furrows: Transverse lines or grooves across the fingernails; transverse depressions in the nail plate caused by temporary cessation of cell division in the proximal nail matrix. The condition may be caused by local disease of the nail fold, physical trauma to it, or a systemic insult, such as an illness or a drug as, for example, chemotherapy. Also known as Beau's lines."
Naloxone,"Naloxone: A drug that antagonizes morphine and other opiates. Naloxone is a pure opiate antagonist and prevents or reverses the effects of opioids including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Sold under the brand name of Narcan and in combination with buprenorphine as Suboxone."
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that is marked by the recurrent, sudden, uncontrollable compulsion to sleep. Narcolepsy is often associated with cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone and paralysis of voluntary muscles associated with a strong emotion), sleep paralysis (immobility of the body that occurs in the transition from sleep to wakefulness), hypnagogic hallucinations (pre-sleep dreams), and automatic behaviors (such as doing something 'automatically' and not remembering afterward how one did it). The causes of narcolepsy are unknown. Narcolepsy is not a fatal disorder in itself, but it can lead to fatalities. For example, affected people may fall asleep while driving. Also known as excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnolepsy, sleeping disease, paroxysmal sleep, and Gelineau syndrome."
Narcotic,"Narcotic: 1. A drug that causes insensibility or stupor. A narcotic induces narcosis, from the Greek ""narke"" for ""numbness or torpor.""
2. A drug such as marijuana which is subject to regulatory restrictions comparable to those for addictive narcotics."
Nasal,Nasal: Having to do with the nose.
Nasal passage,"Nasal passage: A channel for airflow through the nose. The walls of the nasal passages are coated with respiratory mucous membranes, which contain innumerable tiny hair-like cells that move waves of mucus toward the throat. Dust, bacteria, and other particles inhaled from the air are trapped by the mucus in the nose, carried back, swallowed, and dropped into the gastric juices so that any potential harm they might do is nullified. The organs of smell are made up of patches of tissue called olfactory membranes. The olfactory membranes are about the size of a postage stamp and are located in a pair of clefts just under the bridge of the nose. Most air breathed in normally flows through the nose, but only a small part reaches the olfactory clefts to get a response to an odor. When a person sniffs to detect a smell, air moves faster through the nose, increasing the flow to the olfactory clefts and carrying more odor to these sensory organs."
Nasal polyps,"Nasal polyps: Benign growths that originate in the mucous membranes lining the nasal passages or paranasal sinuses. Polyps are believed to arise in the nasal mucosa as a result of chronic inflammation. Up to 4% of adults have nasal polyps; they can also occur in children, particularly those with chronic respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Symptoms include postnasal drainage, snoring, headaches, sinusitis, and a reduced sense of smell and taste. Therapy can include oral and topical steroid medications or surgical removal. "
Naso-,"Naso-: Prefix referring to the nose, as in nasogastric tube (a tube that is passed through the nose and to the stomach)."
Nasogastric tube,"Nasogastric tube: A tube that is passed through the nose and down through the nasopharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Abbreviated NG tube. It is a flexible tube made of rubber or plastic, and it has bidirectional potential. It can be used to remove the contents of the stomach, including air, to decompress the stomach, or to remove small solid objects and fluid, such as poison, from the stomach. An NG tube can also be used to put substances into the stomach, and so it may be used to place nutrients directly into the stomach when a patient cannot take food or drink by mouth."
Nasopharynx,"Nasopharynx: The area of the upper throat that lies behind the nose. In contrast to the oropharynx, the area of the throat that lies behind the mouth. The word ""nasopharynx"" is a hybrid -- part Latin, part Greek. ""Naso-"" is a prefix that has to do with the nose. It comes from the Latin ""nasus"" for the nose (or snout). ""Pharynx"" is the Greek word for throat. The Greco-Roman term ""nasopharynx"" was coined in 1877."
National Formulary,"National Formulary: Full name: United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary (USP-NF). An official publication, issued first by the American Pharmaceutical Association and now yearly by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, that gives the composition, description, method of preparation, and dosage for drugs. The book contains two separate official compendia -- the USP and the NF. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP), established in 1820, contains legally recognized standards of identity, strength, quality, purity, packaging, and labeling for drug substances, dosage forms, and other therapeutic products, including nutritionals and dietary supplements. The National Formulary (NF), established in 1888 by the American Pharmaceutical Association, includes standards for excipients, botanicals, and other similar products. USP purchased the NF in 1975, combining the two publications under one cover, creating the USP-NF. USP-NF monographs contain specifications (tests, procedures, and acceptance criteria) that helps ensure the strength, quality, and purity of named items. The USP-NF also contains monographs and general approaches to ensure the quality of compounded preparations. USP-NF monographs, which are recognized worldwide, may be enforceable by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and also by state agencies in the US."
Health (NIH),"National Institutes of Health (NIH): The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is an important U.S. health agency. It is devoted to medical research. Administratively under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the NIH consists of 20-some separate Institutes and Centers. NIH's program activities are represented by these Institutes and Centers. They are, along with a brief overview of their essential missions, as follows: The value of the NIH to medical research not only in the USA but in the world as a whole cannot be overestimated."
Natriuresis,"Natriuresis: The excretion of an excessively large amount of sodium in the urine. Natriuresis is similar to diuresis (the excretion of an unusually large quantity of urine), except that in natriuresis the urine is exceptionally salty. Natriuresis occurs with some diuretics and diseases (as of the adrenal) and can lead to the salt-losing syndrome characterized by dehydration, vomiting, low blood pressure, and the risk of sudden death. Natriuresis is a ancient language hybrid of the Latin natrium = sodium and the Greek ouresis = a making water."
Natriuretic,"Natriuretic: Causing natriuresis, the excretion of an excessively large amount of sodium in the urine. A hybrid of the Latin natrium = sodium and the Greek ouresis = a making water."
Natural immunity,"Natural immunity: Immunity that is naturally existing, Natural immunity does not require prior sensitization to an antigen. See: Innate immunity."
Naturalistic study,"Naturalistic study: A type of study in which the researcher very carefully observes and records some behavior or phenomenon, sometimes over a prolonged period, in its natural setting while interfering as little as possible with the subjects or phenomena. In medical research, a naturalistic study usually involves observing people as they go about their normal activities. The presence of an observer obviously has an effect as one goes about one's daily activities."
Naturopathy,"Naturopathy: A system of therapy that is based on preventive care and on the use of physical forces such as heat, water, light, air, and massage as primary therapies for disease. Some naturopaths use no medications, either pharmaceutical or herbal. Some recommend herbal remedies only. A few who are licensed to prescribe may recommend pharmaceuticals in cases in which they feel their use is 'warranted."
Nausea,"Nausea: Stomach queasiness, the urge to vomit. Nausea can be brought on by many causes, including systemic illnesses (such as influenza), medications, pain, and inner ear disease."
Navel,"Navel: The umbilicus, the former site of attachment of the umbilical cord, usually found in about the middle of the abdominal wall. The appearance of the navel depends on how the cord was cut and also on the condition of the underlying muscle. If the muscles are firm and the cut was close enough to the belly, the navel will go inward. If the muscles are weak and/or the cut was too far from the belly, the navel will protrude outward. The word navel came from the Anglo-Saxon ""nafe"" for the hub of a wheel. Also called the belly button."
NCS,NCS: Nerve conduction study. See: Nerve conduction velocity test.
ND,ND: Abbreviation for Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine; Natural death; Newcastle disease; Normal delivery; Notifiable disease.
Nearsightedness,"Nearsightedness: The ability to see near objects more clearly than distant objects. Also called myopia . Myopia can be caused by a longer-than-normal eyeball or by any condition that prevents light rays from focusing on the retina. Most forms of myopia can be managed with corrective lenses. Surgery is available to permanently correct some forms of myopia, although long-term effectiveness and safety has not been fully determined."
Nebulizer,Nebulizer: A device for administering a medication by spraying a fine mist. Also known as atomizer.
Neck,"Neck: The part of the body joining the head to the shoulders. Also, any narrow or constricted part of a bone or organ that joins its parts as, for example, the neck of the femur bone."
Neck Pain,"Neck pain: Neck pain is the sensation of discomfort in the neck area. Neck pain can result from disorders of any of the structures in the neck, including the cervical vertebrae and intervertebral discs, nerves, muscles, blood vessels, esophagus, larynx, trachea, lymphatic organs, thyroid gland, or parathyroid glands. Neck pain arises from numerous different conditions and is sometimes referred to as cervical pain or cervicalgia."
"Neck, chronic stiff","Neck, chronic stiff: Also called torticollis or spasmodic torticollis, this is the most common of the focal dystonias: a state of abnormal -- either excessive of inadequate -- muscle tone. In this disorder, the muscles in the neck that control the position of the head are affected, causing the head to twist and turn to one side. In addition, the head may be pulled forward or backward. Torticollis can occur at any age, although most individuals first experience symptoms in middle age. It often begins slowly and usually reaches a plateau. About 10 to 20 percent of those with torticollis experience a spontaneous remission, but unfortunately the remission may not be longlasting."
Necropsy,"Necropsy: A postmortem examination or autopsy. Necropsies have been done for more than 2,000 years, but during most of this time they were rarely done, most often for legal purposes. The Roman physician Antistius performed one of the earliest necropsies on record. In 44 B.C., he examined Julius Caesar and documented 23 wounds, including a final fatal stab to the chest. In 1410, the Catholic Church itself ordered an autopsy on Pope Alexander V, to determine whether his successor had poisoned him. No evidence of this was found. By the turn of the 20th century, prominent physicians such as Rudolf Virchow in Berlin, Karl Rokitansky in Vienna, and William Osler in Baltimore won popular support for the practice. They defended it as a tool of discovery, to identify the cause of tuberculosis, reveal how to treat appendicitis, and establish the existence of Alzheimer's disease. They showed that necropsies prevented errors and provided a means to confirm diagnoses. In the early 2oth century, the causes of most deaths were a mystery and that necropsies were a tool to provide families with a comprehensible explanation for a loved one's death. By the end of the Second World War, the necropsy was firmly established as a routine part of death in North America and Europe."
Necrosis,"Necrosis: The death of living cells or tissues. Necrosis can be due, for example, to ischemia (lack of blood flow). From the Greek ""nekros"" (dead body)."
Necrotizing Pneumonia,"Necrotizing pneumonia: This is a rare complication of bacterial pneumonia (lung infection by bacteria) in which tissue death (necrosis) begins to occur in the lung. Necrosis is the word for cellular or tissue death due to lack of oxygen. In necrotizing pneumonia, there is a reduction in the vascular supply to the lungs, leading to areas of cellular death. The lack of blood supply due to damaged blood vessels impairs the delivery of antibiotics to the infection, allowing for further progression of the infection."
Needlestick injury,"Needlestick injury: A penetrating stab wound from a needle (or other sharp object) that may result in exposure to blood or other body fluids. The main concern is exposure to the blood or other body fluids of another person who may be carrying infectious disease. The pathogens of primary concern are the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In case of such a needlestick injury, you should immediately follow these steps: These recommendations are in line with those of the CDC (the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention)."
Negative calorie diet,"Negative calorie diet: The Negative calorie diet is a weight loss concept based upon the premise that consumption of foods with a ""negative caloric effect"" (meaning that the calories burned by chewing, digesting, and eliminating the food are greater than those contained in the food itself) will lead to rapid weight loss of up to two pounds per day. Even if this were true, this rate of weight loss is dangerous and unhealthy. The negative calorie diet has not been recommended by medical professionals as a weight loss plan and is not considered a healthy way to lose weight. Instead, it is considered to be an unhealthy, ""fad"" diet that may contribute to the cycle of weight loss and gain known as ""yo-yo"" dieting."
Negative-strand RNA virus,"Negative-strand RNA virus: Also known as an antisense-strand RNA virus, a virus whose genetic information consists of a single strand of RNA that is the negative or antisense strand which does not encode mRNA (messenger RNA). Examples of negative-strand RNA viruses include influenza virus, measles viruses, and rabies virus. There are two types of RNA viruses. Some are positive in that they have a ""sense"" strand of RNA (coded information about how to build proteins) as their genetic material. And other RNA viruses tare negative in that they have an ""antisense"" strand (the paired opposite of the coded information). Negative-strand or antisense-strand RNA viruses are as opposed to positive-strand or sense-strand RNA viruses. See also: Positive-strand RNA virus."
Neo- (prefix),"Neo- (prefix): Prefix meaning new. From the Greek ""neos"", new, young, fresh, recent. Examples of terms starting with ""neo-"" include neonatal and neonate (the newborn), neoplasia and neoplasm (new growth = tumor), etc. The opposite of neo- is paleo-. Although paleo- does enter occasionally into medical usage, it is far less commonly encountered than neo- in medicine (and on the pharmacy shelves where there is Neomycin but no Paleomycin)."
Neonatal,"Neonatal: Pertaining to the newborn period, specifically the first 4 weeks after birth."
Neonate,"Neonate: A newborn baby, specifically a baby in the first 4 weeks after birth. After a month, a baby is no longer considered a neonate."
Neoplasia,Neoplasia: Abnormal new growth of cells.
Neoplasm,Neoplasm: A tumor.
Neoplastic,Neoplastic: Pertaining to a tumor or the process of tumor formation.
NEP,"NEP: 1. Neutral endopeptidase.
2. Neuroepithelial."
Nephritis,"Nephritis: Inflammation of the kidney, which causes impaired kidney function. Nephritis can be due to a variety of causes, including kidney disease, autoimmune disease, and infection. Treatment depends on the cause."
Nephro-,"Nephro-: Having to do with the kidney, as in nephrology (the art and science of the care of the kidneys) and nephropathy (any kidney disease)."
Nephrocalcinosis,"Nephrocalcinosis: The deposition of calcium (in the form of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate) in the substance of the kidney, a process that can impair the function of the kidney function. The disorder may be symmetric or, in anatomic disorders such as medullary sponge kidney, involve only a single kidney. Nephrocalcinosis is caused by a number of conditions including: the excess excretion of calcium by the kidney, renal tubular acidosis, medullary sponge kidney, hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood), renal cortical necrosis, and tuberculosis. Nephrocalcinosis is relatively common in premature infants, partly from intrinsic kidney calcium losses and partly from enhanced calcium excretion when they are given diuretics. Other causes include hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, oxalosis, papillary necrosis, chronic glomerulonephritis, transplant rejection, and trauma. Medications can cause calcinosis with acetazolamide, amphotericin B, and triamterene commonly implicated. Fragments of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate may break free from the kidney and provide nuclei for the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Nephrocalcinosis may eventually result in acute obstructive uropathy or chronic obstructive uropathy, leading to eventual kidney failure. The disorder is often discovered when symptoms of renal insufficiency/renal failure, obstructive uropathy, or urinary tract stones develop."
Nephrolithiasis,"Nephrolithiasis: The process of forming a kidney stone, a stone in the kidney (or lower down in the urinary tract). Kidney stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones occur in 1 in 10 people at some time in their life. The development of the stones is typically related to increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate or cystine. The pain with kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and colicky (intermittent), not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. If a symptomatic stone does not pass, a procedure by a urologist may be needed. ""Nephrolithiasis"" is derived from the Greek nephros- (kidney) lithos (stone) = kidney stone. The stones themselves are also called renal caluli. The word ""calculus"" (plural: calculi) is the Latin word for pebble."
Nephropathy,Nephropathy: Any kidney disease.
Nephrosis,"Nephrosis: Any degenerative disease of the kidney tubules, the tiny canals that make up much of the substance of the kidney. Nephrosis can be caused by kidney disease, or it may be a complication of another disorder, particularly diabetes. Diagnosis is made via urine testing for the presence of protein, blood testing for lower-than-normal levels of protein, and observation of edema. Treatment usually involves use of cortisone-like drugs. Also known as nephrotic syndrome."
Nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic: Poisonous to the kidney.
Nerve,"Nerve: A bundle of fibers that uses electrical and chemical signals to transmit sensory and motor information from one body part to another. The fibrous portions of a nerve are covered by a sheath called myelin and/or a membrane called neurilemma. (Note that entries for specific nerves can be found under the names of the particular nerves. For example, the optic nerve is not under 'nerve, optic' but rather under 'optic nerve.')"
"Nerve, trigeminal","Nerve, trigeminal: This nerve functions both as the chief nerve of sensation for the face and as the motor nerve controlling the muscles of mastication (chewing). Problems with the sensory part of the trigeminal nerve result in pain or loss of sensation in the face. Problems with the motor root of the trigeminal nerve result in deviation of the jaw toward the affected side and trouble chewing. The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve. The cranial nerves, the trigeminal nerve included, emerge from or enter the skull (the cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves which emerge from the vertebral column. There are twelve cranial nerves. The term ""trigeminal"" comes from the Latin ""trigeminus"" meaning ""threefold,"" referring to the three divisions (ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular) of this nerve."
Nervine,"Nervine: A nerve tonic, a medicine that acts therapeutically upon the nerves, particularly in the sense of a sedative that serves to calm ruffled nerves. The word nervine comes from the Latin nervinus, belonging to a sinew. Nervine travelled across the Channel from France to 17th-century England. There it was first applied to the sinews. That is not illogical because the Latin nervinus derives from nervus meaning ""a sinew, tendon, thong, string (as a bowstring), or wire."" In ancient anatomy the Romans (and Greeks) did not distinguish between and tendons and nerves. The name ""nervus"" referred to any white cordlike structure, whether it be a band of connective tissue or a fiber in the nervous system. (I must admit I did not know the word ""nervine"" myself. I came upon it in a diabolically difficult Saturday New York Times crossword -- they get progressively harder fro Monday to Saturday. The clue was ""Soothing medicine."" There were 7 spaces to be filled. The answer proved to be NERVINE. I found it was not in most standard desktop dictionaries nor in many medical dictionaries. -- Editor)"
Nervous colon syndrome,"Nervous colon syndrome: A common gastrointestinal disorder involving an abnormal condition of gut contractions (motility) characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel habits with alternating diarrhea and constipation, symptoms that tend to be chronic and to wax and wane over the years. Although the disorder can cause chronic recurrent discomfort, it does not lead to any serious organ problems. Making the diagnosis usually involves excluding other illnesses. Treatment is directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating high fiber and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners), exercise, relaxation techniques, and medications. Alternative names include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), spastic colitis, and mucus colitis."
"Nervous system, peripheral (PNS)","Nervous system, peripheral (PNS): That portion of the nervous system that is outside the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two major divisions of the nervous system. The other is the central nervous system (CNS) which is made up of the brain and spinal cord. The nerves in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connect the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear), other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels and glands. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and what are called the autonomic nerves. The autonomic nerves are concerned with automatic functions of the body. Specifically, autonomic nerves are involved with the regulation of the heart muscle, the tiny muscles lining the walls of blood vessels, and glands. ""Peripheral"" in anatomy and medicine (as elsewhere) is the opposite of ""central."" It means situated away from the center. The word ""peripheral"" comes from the Greek ""peripheria"" (""peri-"", around or about + ""pherein"", to bear, carry). An IV (intravenous) catheter is a peripheral line."
Neuralgia,Neuralgia: Pain along the course of a nerve.
Neurobiological disorder,"Neurobiological disorder: An illness of the nervous system caused by genetic, metabolic, or other biological factors. Many illnesses categorized as psychiatric disorders are neurobiological, including autism, bipolar disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome."
Neurogenic,"Neurogenic: Giving rise to or arising from the nerves or the nervous system. For example, neurogenic pain is pain that originates in the nerves, as opposed to muscle pain, bone pain, etc."
Neurogenic shock,"Neurogenic shock: A type of shock (a life-threatening medical condition in which there is insufficient blood flow throughout the body) that is caused by the sudden loss of signals from the sympathetic nervous system that maintain the normal muscle tone in blood vessel walls. The blood vessels relax and become dilated, resulting in pooling of the blood in the venous system and an overall decrease in blood pressure. Neurogenic shock can be a complication of injury to the brain or spinal cord."
Neuroleptic,"Neuroleptic: A term that refers to the effects of antipsychotic drugs on a patient, especially on his or her cognition and behavior. Neuroleptic drugs may produce a state of apathy, lack of initiative and limited range of emotion. In psychotic patients, neuroleptic drugs cause a reduction in confusion and agitation and tend to normalize psychomotor activity. The term comes from the Greek ""lepsis"" meaning a taking hold."
Neurological,"Neurological: Having to do with the nerves or the nervous system as, for example, a neurological exam."
Neurology,"Neurology: The medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves."
Neuromuscular,"Neuromuscular: Pertaining to both nerves and muscles, as in neuromuscular blockade by an anesthetic agent, the neuromuscular junction (the meeting place of a nerve and a muscle fiber), and neuromuscular transmission (the transfer of ""information"" from the nerve to the muscle)."
Neuron-specific enolase (NSE),"Neuron-specific enolase (NSE): Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a substance that has been detected in patients with certain tumors, namely: neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and melanoma. Studies of NSE as a tumor marker have concentrated primarily on patients with neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer. Measurement of NSE levels in patients with these two diseases can provide information about the extent of the disease and the patient's prognosis (outlook), as well as about the patient's response to treatment."
Neuropathic pain,Neuropathic pain: Chronic pain resulting from injury to the nervous system. The injury can be to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or the peripheral nervous system (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). Neuropathic pain can occur after trauma and many diseases such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. It is common and affects more than 2 million people in the US alone. This type of pain is notoriously difficult to treat.
Neuropathy,Neuropathy: Any disease or malfunction of the nerves.
Neuroplasticity,"Neuroplasticity: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment. Brain reorganization takes place by mechanisms such as ""axonal sprouting"" in which undamaged axons grow new nerve endings to reconnect neurons whose links were injured or severed. Undamaged axons can also sprout nerve endings and connect with other undamaged nerve cells, forming new neural pathways to accomplish a needed function. For example, if one hemisphere of the brain is damaged, the intact hemisphere may take over some of its functions. The brain compensates for damage in effect by reorganizing and forming new connections between intact neurons. In order to reconnect, the neurons need to be stimulated through activity. Neuroplasticity sometimes may also contribute to impairment. For example, people who are deaf may suffer from a continual ringing in their ears (tinnitus), the result of the rewiring of brain cells starved for sound. For neurons to form beneficial connections, they must be correctly stimulated. Neuroplasticity is also called brain plasticity or brain malleability."
Neurosis,Neurosis: A chronic disorder featuring irritability of the nervous system (nervousness) and characterized by anxiety and/or extreme behavior dedicated to avoid anxiety situations.
Neurotransmitter,"Neurotransmitter: A chemical that is released from a nerve cell which thereby transmits an impulse from a nerve cell to another nerve, muscle, organ, or other tissue. A neurotransmitter is a messenger of neurologic information from one cell to another."
Neutropenia,"Neutropenia: Not enough neutrophils, neutrophils being a type of white blood cell (specifically a form of granulocyte) filled with neutrally-staining granules, tiny sacs of enzymes that help the cell to kill and digest microorganisms it has engulfed by phagocytosis. The mature neutrophil has a segmented nucleus (it is called a seg or poly) while the immature neutrophil has band-shape nucleus (it is called a band). The neutrophil has a lifespan of about 3 days. Neutropenia may be seen with viral infections and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Neutropenia lowers the immunologic barrier to bacterial and fungal infection. Granulocytopenia or, as it is also called, agranulocytosis results in a syndrome of frequent chronic bacterial infections of the skin, lungs, etc. Although ""agranulocytosis"" literally means no granulocytes, there may, in fact, be some granulocytes but too few of them, i.e. granulocytopenia. Granulocytopenia can be genetic and inherited or it can be acquired as, for example, an aspect of leukemia. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are all types of granulocytes. They are named by the staining features of their granules in the laboratory: This classification dates back to a time when certain structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of these intracellular structures were still not yet fathomed. However, the classification of granulocytes into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils is still widely used (and quite useful). Granulocytopenia can therefore more specifically involve neutropenia (shortage of neutrophils), eosinopenia and/or basopenia. The term ""neutropenia"" is sometimes used interchangeably with granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis."
Neutrophil,"Neutrophil: A type of white blood cell, a granulocyte that is filled with microscopic granules, little sacs containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Also known as polymorphonuclear leukocyte or poly."
Nexus,"Nexus: A connection or link. A causal connection. A connected series. ""Nexus"" comes from the Latin ""nectere"" meaning ""to bind."" The same Latin root gave rise to ""connect"" and ""annex."""
NF,NF: Abbreviation for Neurofibromatosis and for National Formulary.
NG,NG: Nasogastric. Usually a tube to remove stomach content via a tube that is inserted in to the stomach via the nose.
Niacin,"Niacin: Nicotinic acid, one of the B-complex vitamins-B 3. Deficiency of niacin in the diet results in the disease pellagra. See: Pellagra."
Nicotine,"Nicotine: An alkaloid (a nitrogen-containing chemical) made by the tobacco plant or produced synthetically. Nicotine has powerful pharmacologic effects (including increased heart rate, heart stroke volume, and oxygen consumption by the heart muscle), as well as powerful psychodynamic effects (such as euphoria, increased alertness, and a sense of relaxation). Nicotine is also powerfully addictive."
Nidus,"Nidus: In medicine, any structure that resembles a nest in appearance or function. From the Latin for 'nest.' A nidus is a breeding place where bacteria, parasites, and other agents of a disease lodge and develop. For example, a nidus of infection is a focus of infection. A nidus is also the nucleus or origin of a nerve. The nidus avis cerebelli is a deep sulcus (groove) on each side of the inferior vermis (a wormlike structure in the brain), separating it from the adjacent lobes of the cerebral hemispheres."
Night blindness,"Night blindness: Impaired vision in dim light and in the dark, due to impaired function of specific vision cells (namely, the rods) in the retina. The ability of our eyes to quickly view objects as they shift from light to dark areas and the ability to see in dim light or at night is an important part of our visual health. When we are not able to do such, the condition is referred to commonly as night blindness or medically as nyctalopia. It occurs as a result of various diseases that cause degeneration of the rods of the retina (the sensory cells responsible for vision in dim light). The problem can also appear as an inherited deficiency in visual purple, or rhodopsin, which is the pigment of the rods of the retina. The abnormality can also result from vitamin A deficiency. Rhodopsin,? maintains its photosensitivity only in the presence of vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic finding from deficiency of vitamin A. It was described by the English physician William Heberden (1710-1801) who also discovered other medical disorders of importance including angina pectoris (chest pain that is often severe and crushing, due to an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle) and osteoarthritis of the small joints with nodules (Heberden's nodes) in and about the last joint of the finger. Sources of vitamin A include animal livers, milk, and yellow and green leafy vegetables which contain carotenes, chemically related substances that are converted to vitamin A in the body. Night blindness is also called day sight, nocturnal amblyopia, nyctalopia and nyctanopia."
Night sweats,"Night sweats: Severe hot flashes that occur at night and result in a drenching sweat. Night sweats can have many different causes, including medications, infections, and cancers."
Nil disease,Nil disease: A form of kidney disease preferably called minimal change disease. See: Minimal change disease.
Nipple,"Nipple: The pigmented projection on the surface of the chest in the male and the breast in the female. In the mature female, ducts that conduct milk from the mammary glands to the surface of the breast exit through the nipple. The surrounding flat area of pigmentation is the areola."
Nipple discharge,Nipple discharge: See: Breast discharge.
Nit,"Nit: Nits are lice eggs. They are hard to see and are often confused with dandruff or hair spray droplets. Nits are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Nits take about a week to hatch. All nits must be removed to prevent reinfestation with lice. They can be removed with a special comb or with the fingers. Topical preparations are available that loosen the ""glue"" that binds them to the hair, making removal easier."
Nitrogenous base,"Nitrogenous base: A molecule that contains nitrogen and has the chemical properties of a base. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). The nitrogenous bases in RNA are the same, with one exception: adenine (A), guanine (G), uracil (U), and cytosine (C)."
Nitrosoureas,"Nitrosoureas: A group of cancer drugs called alkylating agents because they act by the process of alkylation to inhibit DNA repair. The nitrosoureas can cross the blood-brain barrier and are used to treat brain tumors. The nitrosoureas include carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine."
NMR,"NMR: Nuclear magnetic resonance, an imaging technique that does not use radiation, but instead employs large magnetic forces to produce detailed images of body tissues."
Nocardia infection,"Nocardia infection: Also called nocardiosis, infection with bacteria called Nocardia which tend to strike the lungs, brain and skin, particularly in people with an impaired immune system. The majority (about 80%) of cases of nocardiosis involves lung infection, brain abscess, or disseminated (widespread) disease from Nocardia. The remaining 20% of cases are localized to the skin and cause cellulitis (skin infection). The most common symptoms with the pulmonary form of nocardiosis are fever, cough, and chest pain. With brain nocardiosis, the symptoms are usually headache, lethargy, confusion, seizures, and sudden onset of neurologic problems. Nocardia is ubiquitous in the environment. It is in the soil and in dust particles. The inhalation of Nocardia spores usually initiates pulmonary nocardiosis. The skin form of nocardiosis is contracted through soil contamination of wounds. There is no evidence for person-to-person transmission of Nocardia. Outbreaks of nocardiosis can occur in immunocompromised patients, including persons with malignancy, connective tissue disorders, bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplantation, high-dose corticosteroid use, and HIV/AIDS. The diagnosis of Nocardia may be difficult. Newer molecular diagnostic and subtyping methods can assist in earlier diagnosis. Nocardia asteroides is responsible for at least 50% of invasive Nocardia infections. Other species of Nocardia that may cause disease include N. farcinica, N. nova, N.transvalensis, N. brasiliensis, and N. pseudobrasiliensis. Long-term antibiotic therapy (usually with sulfonamides) may be given for 6 months to a year or longer depending on the individual and site involved. Frequently, chronic suppressive therapy may be needed with prolonged, low-dose antibiotic therapy. In addition, patients with abscesses may need surgery to ensure adequate drainage. The antimicrobial combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the drug of choice for nocardiosis. However, resistance to TMP-SMX is becoming more common. A new combination drug therapy (sulfonamide, ceftriaxone, and amikacin) has shown promise for infections difficult to treat with TMP-SMX. About 10% of cases of uncomplicated Nocardia pneumonia are fatal. The fatality rates increase with overwhelming infection, disseminated disease, and brain abscess."
Nocturia,"Nocturia: Excessive urinating at night. Nocturia can be normal and more common with aging. Nocturia can also be a sign of an underlying condition, such as diabetes or urinary infection."
Node,"Node: Literally a knot, a node is a collection of tissue. For example a lymph node, is a collection of lymphoid tissue. A nodule is a small node, a little collection of tissue."
Nodule,"Nodule: A small collection of tissue that is palpable (can be felt) at any level of the skin (in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutis) or in another tissue of the body. Nodules characteristically range in size from 1 to 2 cm in diameter."
Nomenclature,"Nomenclature: A system of names used in a particular discipline, as in medicine and surgery, anatomy and biochemistry, etc. A standard system of nomenclature presupposes the existence of an organized classification of the entities within that field. From the Latin nomenclatura, a listing of names, from nomen, name, + calo, to proclaim. The USSR and other Communist countries used the term nomenklatura to refer to a system of government patronage."
Non-rapid eye movement sleep,"Non-rapid eye movement sleep: NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep is dreamless sleep. During NREM, the brain waves on the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording are typically slow and of high voltage, the breathing and heart rate are slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth leading to REM sleep. REM sleep is when dreams occur. We have 3 to 5 REM periods per night. They occur at intervals of 1-2 hours apart and are quite variable in length, ranging from 5 minutes to over an hour. REM sleep is characterized by rapid, low-voltage brain waves, irregular breathing and heart rate and involuntary muscle jerks. About 80% of sleep is NREM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, all but maybe an hour and a half is spent in dreamless NREM sleep."
Non-small cell lung cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer: Cancer of the lung which is not of the small cell carcinoma (oat cell carcinoma) type. The term ""non-small cell lung cancer"" applies to the various types of bronchogenic carcinomas (those arising from the lining of the bronchi) which include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. The distinctions between small and non-small cell lung cancer is made by looking at the tumor under the microscope and is important for proper treatment. Surgery is the treatment of choice for the early stage of non-small cell lung cancer."
Nonagenarian,"Nonagenarian: Someone in his or her ninties, that is, between 90 and 99 years of age. See also: Age by decade."
Noncompliance,"Noncompliance: Failure or refusal to comply. In medicine, the term noncompliance is commonly used in regard to a patient who does not take a prescribed medication or follow a prescribed course of treatment. A person who demonstrates noncompliance is said to be noncompliant."
Nonpathogenic,"Nonpathogenic: Incapable of causing disease. For example, nonpathogenic E. coli are E. coli bacteria that do not cause disease, but instead live naturally in the large intestine."
Nonsyndromic,"Nonsyndromic: Not part of a syndrome. Hearing loss, for instance, can be syndromic or nonsyndromic."
Noonan syndrome (NS),"Noonan syndrome (NS): A multifaceted genetic disorder characterized by a series of birth defects (congenital malformations) including dysmorphic (malformed) facial features, short stature after birth (postnatal growth retardation), webbing of the neck (pterygium colli), caved-in chestbone (pectus excavatum), cardiovascular problems (pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), bleeding tendency and, in boys, testes that do not descend normally into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). NS is an autosomal dominant disorder that carries an elevated risk of developmental and language delay, learning disability, hearing loss, and mild mental retardation. The syndrome is relatively common, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000-2,500 live births. A gene for NS has been mapped to chromosome 12q24.1. More than 50% of cases are due to missense mutations in PTPN11, a gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Noonan syndrome may, it is thought, be due to excessive SHP-2 activity."
Norketamine,"Norketamine is the major metabolite (metabolic product) of the drug ketamine. Ketamine is a drug that is used as a treatment for depression or severe mental health conditions, although it is often misused recreationally. Norketamine is formed in the body after ketamine is taken."
Normal range,"Normal range: Characteristic of 95 percent of values from a normal population. The remaining normal results fall outside the normal range, as do any truly abnormal results. The normal range for a particular test result, condition, symptom, or behavior may differ, based on the patient's age, size, sex, ethnicity, or culture."
Normotensive,Normotensive: Having normal blood pressure. See also: Hypertensive; Hypotensive.
Nose,"Nose: The external midline projection from the face. The purpose of the nose is to warm, clean, and humidify the air that a person breathes. In addition, it helps a person to smell and taste. The nose is divided into two passageways by a partition called the septum. Opening to these passageways are the nostrils. Bony projections, called turbinates, protrude into each breathing passage; they help to increase the surface area of the inside of the nose. There are three turbinates on each side of the nose (the inferior, middle, and superior turbinates). The sinuses are four paired air-filled chambers that empty into the nasal cavity."
Nosebleed,"Nosebleed: Bleeding from the blood vessels of the nose. The nose is rich in blood vessels and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a result, any trauma to the face can cause bleeding, which may be profuse. Nosebleeds can also occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in dry climates or during winter months, when the air is dry and warm from household heaters. People have increased susceptibility to nosebleeds if they are taking medications that prevent normal blood clotting, such as warfarin (brand name: Coumadin), aspirin, or any anti-inflammatory medication. Other predisposing factors include infection, trauma, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and inherited bleeding problems. Also known as epistaxis."
Nosocomial,"Nosocomial: Originating or taking place in a hospital, acquired in a hospital, especially in reference to an infection. The term ""nosocomial"" comes from two Greek words: ""nosus"" meaning ""disease"" + ""komeion"" meaning ""to take care of."" Hence, ""nosocomial"" should apply to any disease contracted by a patient while under medical care. However, common usage of the term ""nosocomial"" is now synonymous with hospital-acquired. Nosocomial infections are infections that have been caught in a hospital and are potentially caused by organisms that are resistant to antibiotics. A nosocomial infection is specifically one that was not present or incubating prior to the patient's being admitted to the hospital, but occurring within 72 hours after admittance to the hospital. A bacterium named Clostridium difficile is now recognized as the chief cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the US and Europe. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics and may be acquired during hospitalization."
NREM sleep,"NREM sleep: NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep is dreamless sleep. During NREM, the brain waves on the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording are typically slow and of high voltage, the breathing and heart rate are slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth leading to REM sleep. REM sleep is when dreams occur. We have 3 to 5 REM periods per night. They occur at intervals of 1-2 hours apart and are quite variable in length, ranging from 5 minutes to over an hour. REM sleep is characterized by rapid, low-voltage brain waves, irregular breathing and heart rate and involuntary muscle jerks. About 80% of sleep is NREM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, all but maybe an hour and a half is spent in dreamless NREM sleep."
NS,NS: Noonan syndrome.
NSAID,"NSAID: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a medication that is commonly prescribed or purchased over the counter to treat the inflammation associated with conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis. Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, indomethacin (brand name: Indocin), ibuprofen (brand name: Motrin), naproxen (brand name: Naprosyn), piroxicam (brand name: Feldene), and nabumetone (brand name: Relafen). People who take certain NSAIDs may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Other major side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal problems. Some 10 to 50 percent of patients are unable to tolerate NSAID treatment because of these side effects, which include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, heartburn, and upset stomach."
NTD,NTD: Neural tube defect.
Nuchal,"Nuchal: Referring to the back of the neck (nape). For example, nuchal rigidity is a stiff neck, sometimes a symptom of meningitis."
Nucleic acid hybridization,"Nucleic acid hybridization: A technique in which single-stranded nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) are allowed to interact so that complexes called hybrids are formed by molecules with similar, complementary sequences. Through nucleic acid hybridization, the degree of sequence identity between nucleic acids can be determined and specific sequences detected in them. The hybridization can be carried out in solution or with one component immobilized on a gel or, most commonly, on nitrocellulose paper. Hybrids are detected by various means: visualization in the electron microscope; by radioactively labelling one component and removing non-complexed DNA; or by washing or digestion with an enzyme that attacks single-stranded nucleic acids and finally estimating the radioactivity bound. Hybridizations are done in all combinations: DNA-DNA (DNA can be rendered single-stranded by heat denaturation), DNA-RNA or RNA-RNA. In situ hybridization involves hybridizing a labelled nucleic acid (often labelled with a fluorescent dye) to suitably prepared cells or histological sections. This is used particularly to look for specific transcription or localization of genes to specific chromosomes via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis."
Nucleoside bypass therapy,"Nucleoside bypass therapy: an experimental treatment designed to restore the normal number of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) in the mitochondria of cells in patients with certain forms of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. dNTPs are components of DNA. While most of a cell?s DNA is found within the nucleus, the mitochondria (structures within cells that are important for converting food into an energy form that cells can use) contain a small amount of DNA. In this type of therapy, the DNA components are administered daily in pill form. Also known as deoxypyrimidine monophosphate bypass therapy. See also mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome."
Nucleus,"Nucleus: 1) In cell biology, the structure that houses the chromosomes. 2) In neuroanatomy, a group of nerve cells."
Null mutation,"Null mutation: A mutation (a change) in a gene that leads to its not being transcribed into RNA and/or translated into a functional protein product. For example, a null mutation in a gene that usually encodes a specific enzyme leads to the production of a nonfunctional enzyme or no enzyme at all."
Nullipara,Nullipara: A woman who has not given birth to a viable child.
Numb,"Numb: Numb, or numbness is a loss of the sensation of feeling in an area of the body. Numbness results from damage to, or impaired function of, the nerves that supply the affected area. The function of the nerves may be impaired by numerous causes including some chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, migraine), trauma, toxins, decreased blood supply due to atherosclerosis or other conditions, electrolyte imbalances, and pressure on the spinal nerves from herniated discs or other diseases of the spine."

OB,"OB: Abbreviation for obstetrician or for obstetrics, the art and science of managing pregnancy, labor and the puerperium, the time immediately after delivery."
OB/GYN,"OB/GYN: A commonly used abbreviation. OB is short for obstetrics or for an obstetrician, a physician who delivers babies. GYN is short for gynecology or for a gynecologist, a physician who specializes in treating diseases of the female reproductive organs. The word ""gynecology"" comes from the Greek gyno, gynaikos meaning woman + logia meaning study, so gynecology literally is the study of women. These days gynecology is focused largely on disorders of the female reproductive organs. An obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) is therefore a physician who both delivers babies and treats diseases of the female reproductive organs."
Obese,"Obese: Well above one's normal weight. A person has traditionally been considered to be obese if they are more than 20% over their ideal weight. That ideal weight must take into account the person's height, age, sex, and build. Obesity has been more precisely defined by the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) as a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30 and above. (A BMI of 30 is about 30 pounds overweight.) The BMI, a key index for relating body weight to height, is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared. Since the BMI describes the body weight relative to height, it correlates strongly (in adults) with the total body fat content. Some very muscular people may have a high BMI without undue health risks. Obesity is often multi-factorial, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Accordingly, treatment of obesity usually requires more than just dietary changes. Exercise, counseling and support, and sometimes medication can supplement diet to help patients conquer weight problems. Extreme diets, on the other hand, can actually contribute to increased obesity. Being overweight is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including:"

Intra-observer variation is the amount of variation one observer experiences when observing the same material more than once."
Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder: A psychiatric disorder characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions, such as cleaning, checking, counting, or hoarding. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), one of the anxiety disorders, is a potentially disabling condition that can persist throughout a person's life. The individual who suffers from OCD becomes trapped in a pattern of repetitive thoughts and behaviors that are senseless and distressing but extremely difficult to overcome. OCD occurs in a spectrum from mild to severe, but if severe and left untreated, can destroy a person's capacity to function at work, at school, or even in the home. The obsessions are unwanted ideas or impulses that repeatedly well up in the mind of the person with OCD. Persistent fears that harm may come to self or a loved one, an unreasonable concern with becoming contaminated, or an excessive need to do things correctly or perfectly, are common. Again and again, the individual experiences a disturbing thought, such as, ""My hands may be contaminated--I must wash them""; ""I may have left the gas on""; or ""I am going to injure my child."" These thoughts are intrusive, unpleasant, and produce a high degree of anxiety. Sometimes the obsessions are of a violent or a sexual nature, or concern illness. In response to their obsessions, most people with OCD resort to repetitive behaviors called compulsions. The most common of these are washing and checking. Other compulsive behaviors include counting (often while performing another compulsive action such as hand washing), repeating, hoarding, and endlessly rearranging objects in an effort to keep them in precise alignment with each other. Mental problems, such as mentally repeating phrases, listmaking, or checking are also common. These behaviors generally are intended to ward off harm to the person with OCD or others. Some people with OCD have regimented rituals while others have rituals that are complex and changing. Performing rituals may give the person with OCD some relief from anxiety, but it is only temporary. The old belief that OCD was the result of life experiences has been weakened by the growing evidence that biological factors are a primary contributor to the disorder. The fact that OCD patients respond well to specific medications that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin suggests the disorder has a neurobiological basis. OCD is sometimes accompanied by depression, eating disorders, substance abuse disorder, a personality disorder, attention deficit disorder, or another of the anxiety disorders. Co-existing disorders can make OCD more difficult both to diagnose and to treat. Treatment is by cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication. One patient may benefit significantly from behavior therapy, while another will benefit from pharmacotherapy. Some others may use both medication and behavior therapy. Others may begin with medication to gain control over their symptoms and then continue with behavior therapy. The neurotransmitter serotonin can significantly decrease the symptoms of OCD. The first serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) specifically approved for the use in the treatment of OCD was the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (AnafranilR). It was followed by fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and paroxetine (Paxil). Large studies have shown that more than three-quarters of patients are helped by these medications. And in more than half of patients, medications relieve symptoms of OCD by diminishing the frequency and intensity of the obsessions and compulsions. Improvement usually takes at least three weeks or longer. If a patient does not respond well to one of these medications, or has unacceptable side effects, another SRI may give a better response. Medications are of help in controlling the symptoms of OCD, but often, if the medication is discontinued, relapse will follow. Indeed, even after symptoms have subsided, most people will need to continue with medication indefinitely, perhaps with a lowered dosage. Traditional psychotherapy, aimed at helping the patient develop insight into his or her problem, is generally not helpful for OCD. However, a specific behavior therapy approach called ""exposure and response prevention"" is effective for many people with OCD. In this approach, the patient deliberately and voluntarily confronts the feared object or idea, either directly or by imagination. At the same time the patient is strongly encouraged to refrain from ritualizing, with support and structure provided by the therapist, and possibly by others whom the patient recruits for assistance. For example, a compulsive hand washer may be encouraged to touch an object believed to be contaminated, and then urged to avoid washing for several hours until the anxiety provoked has greatly decreased. Treatment then proceeds on a step-by-step basis, guided by the patient's ability to tolerate the anxiety and control the rituals. As treatment progresses, most patients gradually experience less anxiety from the obsessive thoughts and are able to resist the compulsive urges. Studies of behavior therapy for OCD have found it to be a successful treatment for the majority of patients who complete it. For the treatment to be successful, it is important that the therapist be fully trained to provide this specific form of therapy. It is also helpful for the patient to be highly motivated and have a positive, determined attitude. The positive effects of behavior therapy endure once treatment has ended."

Occam's razor,"Occam's razor: The principle of scientific or, in medicine, diagnostic parsimony or ""unitarianism."" In medicine, a clinician would like to be able to use Occam's razor and come up with a unifying diagnosis that will explain all of the patient's problems. ""Although we generally like to invoke Occam's razor, for some patients we cannot follow the rule of diagnostic parsimony."" (New Engl J Med 350: 600, 2004). William of Occam in the 14th century stated this principle: ""The assumptions introduced to explain a thing must not be multiplied beyond necessity."""

2. Located near the occipital bone as, for example, the occipital lobe of the brain."
Occipital bone,Occipital bone: The bone that forms the rear and rear bottom of the skull.
Occipital hematoma,"Occipital hematoma: A hematoma (collection of blood) in the occipital region (at the back of the head). An occipital hematoma may be either subdural or epidural. In an occipital epidural hematoma, the bleeding occurs between the skull and the dura (the brain cover). The bleeding is from an injury to a vein or a branch of the posterior meningeal artery. Occipital epidural hematoma is often caused by a full-on blow to the head and may be associated with a skull fracture. In an occipital subdural hematoma, the bleeding is into the space between the dura and the brain itself. As the hematoma enlarges, it can put increasing pressure on the brain and cause neurological abnormalities including slurred speech, impaired gait, and dizziness and lead to coma and even death. The diagnosis of an occipital hematoma, whether it be epidural or subdural, may be confirmed by MRI or CAT scan. Treatment may range from watchful waiting in the case of a small epidural bleed to trepanation -- drilling through the skull to drain the excess blood."

The medical suffix -oma came from the Greek suffix -oma which was used in a different way -- to transform a verb into a noun."
Omega-3 fatty acids,"Omega-3 fatty acids: A class of essential fatty acids found in fish oils, especially from salmon and other cold-water fish, that acts to lower the levels of cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoproteins) in the blood. (LDL cholesterol is the ""bad"" cholesterol.) EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are the two principal omega-3 fatty acids. The body has a limited ability to manufacture EPA and DHA by converting the essential fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which is found in flaxseed oil, canola oil or walnuts. Omega-3 fish oil is considered a nutraceutical, a food that provides health benefits. Eating fish has been reported, for example, to protect against late age-related macular degeneration, a common eye disease. The American Heart Association recommends eating fish (particularly fatty fish such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon) at least two times a week. (In technical terms, omega-3 fatty acids have a double bond three carbons from the methyl moiety.)"
Omentum,Omentum: A sheet of fat that is covered by peritoneum. The greater omentum is attached to the bottom edge of the stomach and hangs down in front of the intestines.

Oncology,"Oncology: The field of medicine that is devoted to cancer. Clinical oncology consists of three primary disciplines: medical oncology (the treatment of cancer with medicine, including chemotherapy), surgical oncology (the surgical aspects of cancer including biopsy, staging, and surgical resection of tumors), and radiation oncology (the treatment of cancer with therapeutic radiation)."
Ondine's curse,"Ondine's curse: Failure from birth of central nervous system control over breathing while asleep. There are usually no breathing problems while awake. The involuntary (autonomic) control of respiration is impaired, but the voluntary control of ventilation which operates during waking hours is generally intact. There can, in addition, be problems with the motility of the esophagus and the colon. Reduced esophageal motility causes food to move too slowly down to the stomach. Reduced motility of the colon produces a condition called Hirschsprung disease (megacolon) with severe constipation and even obstruction. The heart rate may be abnormally slow. Some patients have down slanting eyes, a small nose, a triangular-shape mouth, and ears that are low-set and backwards rotated. The names for this disease include congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), CCHS with Hirschsprung disease, congenital failure of autonomic control, idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation, and central sleep apnea with severe hypoventilation. Ondine (Undine) was a female water sprite who loved a knight but was condemned to stay awake in order to breathe."

Onychomycosis,"Onychomycosis: Fungus infection of the nail bed under the fingernails or toenails. Onychomycosis makes the nails look white and opaque, thickened, and brittle. It usually produces no symptoms other than a cosmetic problem. Treatment includes avoiding artificial nails, using safer application techniques and only new artificial nails, and using topical and oral antifungal medications. Also known as nail fungus and tinea unguium."
Oocyte,"Oocyte: A female germ cell in the process of development. The oocyte is produced in the ovary by an ancestral cell called an oogonium and gives rise to the ovum (the egg), which can be fertilized."
Oogenesis,"Oogenesis: The process of egg formation. The second ""o"" in oogenesis is pronounced separately from the first: o?o?gen?e?sis. The word was created from the prefix ""oo-"" (Greek oon, egg) + ""genesis"" (the coming into being of something) = the coming into being of the egg (the ovum). Oogenesis is in contrast to spermatogenesis, the process of sperm formation."
Open-angle glaucoma,"Open-angle glaucoma: Glaucoma is a condition of the eye that leads to progressive atrophy of the optic nerve in the presence of an open angle. It is accompanied by changes in the appearance of the optic disc, loss of peripheral vision and has historically been associated with elevated intra-ocular pressure. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. It is in contrast to angle-closure glaucoma in which the drainage angle between the iris and the cornea becomes closed, blocks fluid from exiting the eye and results in a significant rise in pressure."
Operation,"Operation: In medicine, a surgical procedure. Many operations are named after persons. They range from A to Z, from the Abbe operation (on the lip) to the Ziegler operation (on the eye)."
Ophthalmic,"Ophthalmic: Pertaining to the eye. For example, an ophthalmic ointment is designed for the eye."
Ophthalmitis,Ophthalmitis: Inflammation of the eye. Also known as ophthalmia.
Ophthalmoscope,"Ophthalmoscope: A lighted instrument that is used to examine the inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve."
Ophthalmoscopy,"Ophthalmoscopy: Examination of the interior of the eye, including the lens, retina and optic nerve, by indirect or direct ophthalmoscopy. Indirect ophthalmoscopy employs a head lamp device to shine a very bright light into the eye. This is generally done by an ophthalmologist. Direct ophthalmoscopy is in more common usage. The examiner uses a device the size of a flashlight to examine the eye. The device consists of a concave mirror and a battery-powered light (contained within the handle). The operator looks through a single monocular eyepiece into the patient's eye. The ophthalmoscope is equipped with a rotating disc of lenses to permit the eye be examined at different depths and magnifications. This may be enhanced by drugs that dilate the pupil and enlarge the opening into the structures within the eye. The ophthalmoscope is invaluable in many fields of medicine, including cardiology (cardiovascular disease), hematology, medical genetics, neurology, neurosurgery, rheumatology, family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, and geriatrics. Visualization of the retina is important in conditions such as the effects of glaucoma, diabetes, and hypertension and in conditions such as brain tumors and meningitis/encephalitis which may cause increased intracranial pressure. The invention of the ophthalmoscope is often erroneously credited to the great German physician-scientist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894). Helmholtz demonstrated the principle of the ophthalmoscope in 1850 using a crude device (cardboard, glue, and microscope glass plates). By means of his ophthalmoscope, Helmholtz could place the eye of the observer in the path of the rays of light entering and leaving the patient's eye, allowing the patient's retina to be seen. However, Helmholtz was neither the first person to look into the living retina nor the first to fashion a device for viewing the retina. In 1823 Johannes Purkinje observed the back of the eye and in 1847 Charles Babbage fashioned an ophthalmoscope similar to the one later developed by Helmholtz. The work of Purkinje and Babbage lay largely unknown. Helmholtz rediscovered the ophthalmoscope and immediately realized and communicated its importance."
Opiate,"Opiate: A medication or an illegal drug that is derived from the opium poppy. Opiates are narcotic sedatives that depress activity of the central nervous system, reduce pain, and induce sleep. Codeine, morphine, and heroin are examples of opiates. In contrast, the term opioid is a broader term that originally was used to refer to any substance, natural (such as opiates) or synthetic, that bind to the opioid receptors in the brain and cause sedative and pain relief effects. Some examples of synthetic opioids include the prescription painkillers hydrocodone (Vicodin) and oxycodone (OxyContin), as well as fentanyl and methadone. In recent years, the term opioid has been used more broadly and is often used to refer to the entire class of drugs that consists of both opium derivatives (opiates) and synthetic opioids.  
Side effects of all opioids may include oversedation, nausea, and constipation. Long-term use can produce addiction, and overuse can cause overdose and potentially death. "
Opioid,Opioid: 1. A synthetic narcotic that resembles the naturally occurring opiates. 2. Any substance that binds to or otherwise affects the opiate receptors on the surface of the cell.
Opium,"Opium: An addictive narcotic drug that is derived from the unripe seedpods of the opium poppy. Preparations of opium were called laudanum. Derivatives of opium include paregoric (a drug used to treat diarrhea), morphine, and heroin. For centuries, opium was used as a painkiller in the Middle East and Asia. It gained great popularity in Europe and the European colonies in the 18th century and became a main ingredient in patent medicines that patients could easily obtain without prescriptions. Many people became addicted to opium. Wounded Civil War soldiers who were in pain often received morphine. By 1900, it is estimated that more than 200,000 people in the US were addicted to opium and its derivatives. In 1909, the US Congress passed a law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of opium."
Optometrist,"Optometrist: A practitioner who provides primary eye and vision care, performs eye examinations to detect vision problems, and prescribes corrective lenses to correct those problems. Some optometrists also make and fit eyeglasses, but many leave that job to opticians. An optometrist is a doctor of optometry (OD), not an MD. When an optometrist detects eye disease, the patient may be referred instead to an ophthalmologist, a physician who specializes in evaluating and treating diseases of the eye."
OR (abbreviation),"OR (abbreviation): Stands for ""operating room"". A facility equipped for performing surgery. OR is sometimes written O.R."
Oral,"Oral: Having to do with the mouth. For example, an oral solution is a solution that is given by mouth."
Oral cholecystogram,"Oral cholecystogram: Abbreviated OCG. An x-ray procedure for diagnosing gallstones. The patient takes iodine-containing tablets by mouth for one night or two nights in a row. The iodine is absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream, removed from the blood by the liver, and excreted by the liver into the bile. The iodine, together with the bile, is highly concentrated in the gallbladder. Iodine is used in an OCG because it is dense and radioopaque (stops x-rays). It outlines the gallstones that are radiolucent (x-rays pass through them) and that are usually invisible on x-ray. The failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG is evidence for a diseased gallbladder. The OCG is an excellent procedure for diagnosing gallstones when they are strongly suspected but cannot be seen by ultrasound."
Oral contraceptive,"Oral contraceptive: A birth control pill taken by mouth. Most oral contraceptives include both estrogen and progesterone. When given in certain amounts and at certain times in the menstrual cycle, these hormones prevent the ovary from releasing an egg for fertilization. See also birth control."
Oral glucose tolerance test,"Oral glucose tolerance test: A test to determine the body's ability to handle glucose . In the test, a person fasts overnight (at least 8 but not more than 16 hours). Then first, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives 75 grams of glucose (100 grams for pregnant women). Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken up to four times to measure the blood glucose. For the test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and the person should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. For 3 days before the test, the person should have eaten a diet high in carbohydrates (150-200 grams per day). The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or drink coffee. The oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels 5 times over a period of 3 hours. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast. People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic have what is termed ""impaired glucose tolerance"" (IGT). People with IGT do not have diabetes. Each year, only 1-5% of people whose test results show IGT actually develop diabetes. And with retesting, as many as half of the people with IGT have normal oral glucose tolerance test results. Weight loss and exercise may help people with IGT return their glucose levels to normal. Oral glucose tolerance depends on a number of factors including the ability of the intestine to absorb glucose, the power of the liver to take up and store glucose, the capacity of the pancreas to produce insulin, the amount of ""active"" insulin it produces, and the sensitivity of the cells in the body to the action of insulin. The outcome of the test may show:"
Oral moniliasis,"Oral moniliasis: Yeast infection of the mouth and throat caused by a fungus formerly called Monilia, now known as Candida albicans. This infection is also known as thrush. Yeast organisms are part of the germs normally found in various parts of the body. They ordinarily do not cause any symptoms. Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, can disturb the natural balance of microbes in the mouth and allow an overgrowth of Candida to cause thrush."
Oral rehydration salts,"Oral rehydration salts: ORS. A solution of glucose-based salt solution used in oral rehydration therapy. WHO and UNICEF recommend a single formulation of glucose-based ORS to treat or prevent dehydration from diarrhea from any cause, including cholera, and in individuals of any age. In technical terms, this ORS solution contains 75 mEq/l of sodium and 75 mmol/l of glucose, and have a total osmolarity of 245 mOsm/l."

Oriental medicine (traditional),"Oriental medicine (traditional): Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), or Chinese medicine, is an ancient medical system that takes a deep understanding of the laws and patterns of nature and applies them to the human body. TCM encompasses many different practices and is rooted in the ancient philosophy of Taoism which dates back more than 5,000 years. One important way that TCM differs from Western medicine is in the connectedness of the world and the human body. This view is based on the ancient Chinese perception of humans as microcosms of the larger, surrounding universe?interconnected with nature and subject to its forces. The human body is regarded as an organic entity in which the various organs, tissues, and other parts have distinct functions but are all interdependent. In this view, health and disease relate to balance of the functions. Another distinction between TCM and western medicine is the methodology of TCM diagnosing which focuses on disturbances of qi, or vital energy. Diagnosis requires observing (especially the tongue), hearing/smelling, asking/interviewing, and touching/palpating (especially the pulse). The classic Chinese medicine text, Nei Jing (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor), documents key components of TCM theoretical framework: Yin-yang theory, the concept of two opposing, yet complementary, forces that shape the world and all life. A vital energy or life force called qi which regulates a person's spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical health. Qi is influenced by yin and yang and circulates within the body along pathways called meridians. Health is an ongoing process of maintaining balance and harmony in the circulation of qi. The Eight Principles are used to analyze symptoms and categorize conditions: cold/heat, interior/exterior, excess/deficiency, and yin/yang. The Five Elements - fire, earth metal, water, and wood each correspond to a particular organ or tissue in the body and explain how the body works. TCM emphasizes individualized treatment. Treatment modalities include acupuncture, herbal formulations, acupressure, qi gong, oriental massage, and tai chi. At the heart of TCM is the tenet that the root cause of illnesses, not their symptoms, must be treated."
Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency,"Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency: A rare metabolic disorder, OTC is one of the urea-cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a series of five liver enzymes that help rid the body of ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of protein. When one of these enzymes is missing or deficient, ammonia accumulates in the blood and travels to the brain, causing coma, brain damage and death. OTC deficiency is the most common of the urea-cycle disorders, occurring in one out of every 40,000 births. The genetic mutation responsible for OTC occurs on the X chromosome, so women are typically carriers, while their sons with the gene suffer the disease. Severe OTC deficiency is a devastating disease. Typically, newborns slip into a coma within 72 hours of birth. Most suffer severe brain damage. Half die in the first month, and half of the survivors die by age 5. Treatment includes a low-protein formula called keto-acid and sodium benzoate, a preservative, and another type of sodium, which binds to ammonia and helps eliminate it from the body."
Orphan disease,"Orphan disease: A disease that has not been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry because it provides little financial incentive for the private sector to make and market new medications to treat or prevent it. An orphan disease may be a rare disease (according to US criteria, a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people) or a common disease that has been ignored (such as tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, and malaria) because it is far more prevalent in developing countries than in the developed world."
Ortho- (prefix),"Ortho- (prefix): Prefix meaning straight or erect. From the Greek ""orthos"" that means just that: straight or erect. Examples of terms involving ortho- include orthodontics (straightening the teeth), orthopaedics (straightening the child), orthopnea (breathing easily only in an upright position), orthostatic (an upright posture), etc."
Orthodontic treatment (dental braces),"Orthodontic treatment (dental braces): The use of devices to move teeth or adjust underlying bone. The ideal age for starting orthodontic treatment is between ages 8 to 14 years while growth is still occurring. An evaluation for orthodontic treatment is recommended by the age of 7. Teeth can be moved by removable appliances or by fixed braces. Crowding of teeth can require extraction of teeth. Retainers may be necessary long after dental braces are placed, especially with orthodontic treatment of adults."
Orthopedist,"Orthopedist: An orthopedic surgeon, a physician who corrects congenital or functional abnormalities of the bones with surgery, casting, and bracing. Orthopedists also treat injuries to the bones. Sometimes spelled orthopaedist."
Orthopod,Orthopod: Slang term for an orthopedist.
Orthoscopic,"Orthoscopic: Having correct vision, producing correct vision, free from optical distortion, or designed to correct distorted vision."
Orthostatic hypotension,"Orthostatic hypotension: A temporary lowering of blood pressure, usually related to suddenly standing up. Healthy people may experience orthostatic hypotension if they rise quickly from a seated position, especially after a meal. Orthostatic hypotension occurs most commonly in older people. The change in position causes a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness, dizziness, and, sometimes, a temporary loss of consciousness. Tilt-table testing can be used to confirm a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Tilt-table testing involves placing the patient on a table with a foot support. The table is tilted upward, and blood pressure and pulse are measured while symptoms are recorded in various positions. Also known as postural hypotension."
Orthotic,"Orthotic: A support, brace, or splint used to support, align, prevent, or correct the function of movable parts of the body. Shoe inserts are orthotics that are intended to correct an abnormal or irregular walking pattern, by altering slightly the angles at which the foot strikes a walking or running surface. Other orthotics include neck braces, lumbosacral supports, knee braces, and wrist supports."
Os,"OS: The left eye (oculus sinister), as opposed to the right eye (oculus dexter)."
OS (lens prescription),"OS (lens prescription): Abbreviation of ""oculus sinister."" Latin for ""left eye."" By contrast, OD stands for ""oculus dexter"" which is Latin for the right eye."
Oscitation,"Oscitation: The act of yawning, the involuntary opening of the mouth with respiration, breathing first inward, then outward. Yawning is often caused by suggestion. Repeated yawning is commonly a sign of drowsiness. It can also sometimes be a sign of depression."
OSHA,"OSHA: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, an agency of the US government under the Department of Labor with the responsibility of ensuring safety at work and a healthful work environment. OSHA's mission is to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths. Since OSHA was created in 1971, occupational deaths in the US have declined by half and injuries by 40%. Nevertheless, 4,547 workers were killed on the job in 2010 (3.5 per 100,000 full?time equivalent workers) ? more than 87 a week or more than 12 deaths every day. (This is a slight decline from the 4,551, fatal work injuries in 2009)."

Osmole,"Osmole: In biochemistry, the amount of a substance that dissociates in solution to form one mole of osmotically active particles."
Osseous,"Osseous: Having to do with bone, consisting of bone, or resembling bone."
Ossification,"Ossification: The process of creating bone, that is of transforming cartilage (or fibrous tissue) into bone. The human skeleton initially consists largely of cartilage which is relatively soft and is gradually transformed into hard bone during infant and child development. The verb corresponding to ""ossification"" is ""ossify."" Cartilage becomes ossified as it is converted into bone. Bone is osseous tissue. ""Os"" is a synonym for ""bone."" The Latin word ""os"" means ""bone"" as does the related Greek word ""osteon."""
Osteitis,Osteitis: Inflammation of the bone.
Osteitis deformans,"Osteitis deformans: Better known today as Paget disease, this is a chronic bone disorder that typically results in enlarged, deformed bones due to excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue that can cause bones to weaken and may result in bone pain, arthritis, bony deformities and fractures. The disease is named for an English surgeon, Sir James Paget (1814-1899). Paget disease is rarely diagnosed in people under 40. Men and women are affected equally. Because Paget disease may be familial, after age 40, brothers, sisters and children of someone with Paget disease may wish to have an alkaline phosphatase blood test every 2 or 3 years to screen for Paget disease. Many people do not know they have Paget disease because they have a mild case of the disease with no symptoms. Sometimes, symptoms may be confused with those of arthritis or other disorders. The symptoms of Paget disease can include: Paget disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests: The outlook with Paget disease is generally good, particularly if treatment is given before major changes have occurred in the affected bones. Paget disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, thighs, and lower legs. In general, symptoms progress slowly, and the disease does not spread to normal bones. Treatment can control Paget disease and lessen symptoms but is not a cure. Paget's disease may lead to other medical conditions, including: Paget disease is NOT associated specifically with osteoporosis. Although Paget disease and osteoporosis can occur in one and the same person, they are completely different disorders. But, despite their marked differences, many treatments for Paget disease can also be used to treat osteoporosis. The goal of drug treatment is to control Paget disease activity for as long a period of time as possible. Treatment options include aspirin, other anti-inflammatory medications, pain medications, and medications that slow the rate of bone turnover, such as calcitonin (Calcimar, Miacalcin) and the bisphosphonates including etidronate (Didronel), alendronate (Fosamax), pamidronate (Aredia), tiludronate (Skelid), and risedronate (Actonel). There are generally three major complications of Paget disease for which surgery may be recommended. Complications resulting from enlargement of the skull or spine may injure the nervous system. However, most neurologic symptoms, even those that are moderately severe, can be treated with medication and do not require neurosurgery. In general, people with Paget's disease should receive 1000-1500 mg of calcium, adequate sunshine, and at least 400 units of vitamin D daily. This is especially important in patients being treated with bisphosphonates. Patients with a history of kidney stones should discuss calcium and vitamin D intake with their physician. Exercise is very important in maintaining skeletal health, avoiding weight gain, and maintaining joint mobility. Since undue stress on affected bones should be avoided, patients should discuss any exercise program with their physician before beginning."
Osteo- (prefix),"Osteo- (prefix): Combining form meaning bone. From the Greek ""osteon"", bone. Appears for instance in osteoarthritis, osteochondroma osteodystrophy, osteogenesis, osteomyelitis, osteopathy, osteopetrosis, osteoporosis, osteosarcoma, etc."
Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis: A type of arthritis caused by inflammation, breakdown, and eventual loss of cartilage in the joints. Also known as degenerative arthritis."
Osteoarthropathy,"Osteoarthropathy: Any disease of the bones and joints. From osteo-, bone + -arthro-, joint, + pathy, disease."
Osteoblast,Osteoblast: A cell that makes bone. It does so by producing a matrix that then becomes mineralized. Bone mass is maintained by a balance between the activity of osteoblasts that form bone and other cells called osteoclasts that break it down.
Osteochondroma,"Osteochondroma: An abnormal, solitary, benign growth of bone and cartilage, typically at the end of a long bone. Osteochondromas are usually discovered in persons 15 to 25 years of age and are the most common benign bone tumor. An osteochondroma is typically detected when the area around it is injured or when it becomes large."
Osteoclasia,"Osteoclasia: Destruction and reabsorption of bone tissue, as occurs when broken bones heal."
Osteoclasis,"Osteoclasis: The surgical destruction of bone tissue. Osteoclasis is performed to reconstruct a bone that is malformed, often a broken bone that healed improperly. The bone is broken and then reshaped with the aid of metal pins, casting, and bracing."
Osteodystrophy,Osteodystrophy: A bone disorder that adversely affects bone growth. See also renal osteodystrophy.
Osteogenesis,Osteogenesis: The production of bone.
Osteogenesis imperfecta,"Osteogenesis imperfecta: A group of inherited connective tissue diseases, all of which result from mutations that affect collagen in connective tissue in the body, and all of which result in fragile bones. The best known types of osteogenesis imperfecta are types I and II. Also known as brittle bone disease."
Osteolytic,"Osteolytic: Pertaining to the dissolution of bone, especially the loss of calcium from bone. ""Punched-out"" osteolytic lesions are characteristic of metastatic lung and breast cancer and multiple myeloma."
Osteomalacia,"Osteomalacia: Softening of bone, particularly in the sense of bone weakened by demineralization (the loss of mineral) and most notably by the depletion of calcium from bone. Osteomalacia may be caused by poor dietary intake or poor absorption of calcium and other minerals needed to harden bones. Osteomalacia is a characteristic feature of vitamin D deficiency in adults. The treatment of osteomalacia is by dietary change. Hormone supplements may also be helpful for post-menopausal women. From the Greek osteo- (bone) + malakia (softness) = softness of bone."
Osteopathy,"Osteopathy: A system of therapy founded in the 19th century that is based on the concept that the body can formulate its own remedies against diseases when its parts are in a normal structural relationship, it has a normal environment, and it enjoys good nutrition. Although osteopathy takes a holistic approach to medical care, it also embraces modern medical knowledge, including use of medication, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy when warranted. Osteopathy is particularly concerned with maintaining correct relationships between bones, muscles, and connective tissues. The practice of osteopathy often includes chiropractic-like adjustments of skeletal structures. Craniosacral therapy, a practice in which the bones and tissues of the head and neck are manipulated, also arose in osteopathy."
Osteopetrosis,"Osteopetrosis: A genetic disease that is characterized by abnormally dense thick bone. A severe autosomal recessive form of osteopetrosis can occur in infants and children, and a milder autosomal dominant form can occur in teens and adults. In the recessive form, the thickened bone obliterates the marrow cavity, causing anemia, and ?narrows the openings of the skull, causing compression of nerves to the ears and eyes, ultimately resulting in deafness and blindness. Fractures are common in both forms. Also known as marble bone disease."
Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis: Thinning of the bones, with reduction in bone mass, due to depletion of calcium and bone protein. Osteoporosis predisposes a person to fractures, which are often slow to heal and heal poorly. It is most common in older adults, particularly postmenopausal women, and in patients who take steroids or steroidal drugs. Unchecked osteoporosis can lead to changes in posture, physical abnormality (particularly the form of hunched back known colloquially as dowager?s hump), and decreased mobility. Treatment of osteoporosis includes exercise (especially weight-bearing exercise that builds bone density), ensuring that the diet contains adequate calcium and other minerals needed to promote new bone growth, use of medications to improve bone density, and sometimes for postmenopausal women, use of hormone therapy."
Osteosynthesis,"Osteosynthesis: A surgical procedure that stabilizes and joins the ends of fractured (broken) bones by mechanical devices such as metal plates, pins, rods, wires or screws. Osteosynthesis refers particularly to internal fixation of a fracture by such means, as opposed to external fixation of a fracture by a splint or cast."
Ostomy,Ostomy: An operation to create an opening from an area inside the body to the outside.
Ot-,"Ot-: Prefix meaning ear. It's used before a vowel, as in otalgia (painful ear) and otitis (inflammation of ear), and before a consonant, ot- becomes oto-, as in otolaryngologist and otoscope. From the Greek ""otos"" pertaining to the ear."
OTC (over-the-counter),"OTC (over-the-counter): Available without a prescription. OTC drugs are available without a prescription, simply ""over the counter."" OTC drugs are in contrast to prescription drugs that require a doctor's order."
Othello syndrome,"Othello syndrome: The delusion of infidelity of a spouse or partner. The Othello syndrome affects males and, less often, females. It is characterized by recurrent accusations of infidelity, searches for evidence, repeated interrogation of the partner, tests of their partner's fidelity, and sometime stalking. The syndrome may appear by itself or in the course of paranoid schizophrenia, alcoholism, or cocaine addiction. As in Othello, the play by Shakespeare, the syndrome can be highly dangerous and result in disruption of a marriage, homicide and suicide. The Othello syndrome was named by the English psychiatrist John Todd (1914-1987) in a paper he published with K. Dewhurst entitled ""The Othello Syndrome: a study in the psychopathology of sexual jealousy"" (Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorder, 1955, 122: 367). Todd was also the first to name the Alice in Wonderland syndrome. The Othello syndrome is also known as delusional jealousy, erotic jealousy syndrome, morbid jealousy, Othello psychosis, or sexual jealousy."
Otitis media,"Otitis media: Inflammation of the middle ear characterized by the accumulation of infected fluid in the middle ear, bulging of the eardrum, pain in the ear and, if eardrum is perforated, drainage of purulent material (pus) into the ear canal. Otitis media is the most frequent diagnosis in sick children in the U.S., especially affecting infants and preschoolers. Almost all children have one or more bouts of otitis media before age 6. The eustachian tube is shorter in children than adults which allows easy entry of bacteria and viruses into the middle ear, resulting in acute otitis media. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (strep) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. flu) account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media and viruses the remaining 15%. Babies under 6 weeks of age tend to have infections from different bacteria in the middle ear. Bottle-feeding is a possible risk factor for otitis media. Breastfeeding temporarily passes the mother's immunity to the baby which helps prevent acute otitis media. It is alleged by some investigators that the position of the breastfeeding child may be better than the bottle-feeding position for eustachian tube function. However, this has not been proven. If a child needs to be bottle-fed, holding the infant rather than allowing the child to lie down with the bottle is thought by some to be better. A child should not take the bottle to bed because falling asleep with milk in the mouth increases the incidence of tooth decay. Upper respiratory infections are a prominent risk factor for acute otitis media so exposure to groups of children as in child-care centers results in more frequent colds and therefore more ear. Irritants such as tobacco smoke in the air also increase the chance of otitis media. Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are predisposed to ear infections. Children who have acute otitis media before 6 months of age have more frequent later ear infections. Young children with otitis media may be irritable, fussy, or have problems feeding or sleeping. Older children may complain about pain and fullness in the ear. Fever may be present in a child of any age. These symptoms are often associated with signs of upper respiratory infection such as a runny or stuffy nose or a cough. The buildup of pus within the middle ear causes pain and dampens the vibrations of the eardrum (so there is usually transient hearing loss during the infection). Severe ear infections may cause the eardrum to rupture. The pus then drains from the middle ear into the ear canal. The hole in the eardrum from the rupture usually heals with medical treatment. The treatment for acute otitis media is antibiotics usually for 7-10 days. About 10% of children do not respond within the first 48 hours of treatment. Even after antibiotic treatment, 40% of children are left with some fluid in the middle ear which can cause temporary hearing loss lasting for up to 3-6 weeks. In most children, the fluid eventually disappears (resorbs) spontaneously (on its own). Children who have recurring bouts of otitis media may have a tympanostomy tube (ear tube) placed into the ear during surgery to permit fluid to drain from the middle ear. If a child has a bulging eardrum and is experiencing severe pain, a myringotomy (surgical incision of the eardrum) to release the pus may be done. The eardrum usually heals within a week. Acute otitis media is not contagious (although the cold that preceded it may be). A child with otitis media can travel by airplane but, if the eustachian tube is not functioning well, changes in pressure (such as in a plane) can cause discomfort. A child with a draining ear should, however, not fly (or swim)."
Oto-,"Oto-: Prefix meaning ear, as in otology (the study and medical care of the ear) and otoplasty (plastic surgery to reshape the outer ear)."
Otolaryngology,"Otolaryngology: A medical and surgical specialty concerned with the diagnosis, management, and treatment of diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat (ENT) and related structures of the head and neck, including the sinuses, larynx (voice box), oral cavity, and upper pharynx (mouth and throat). Subspecialty areas within otolaryngology include pediatric otolaryngology (children), otology/neurotology (ears, balance, and tinnitus), allergy, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, head and neck, laryngology (throat), and rhinology (nose). Some otolaryngologists limit their practices to one or more of these seven areas. Otolaryngology is commonly called ENT. It is the oldest medical specialty in the US."
Ototoxicity,"Ototoxicity: toxicity (the state of being poisonous or damaging) to the ear. The term ototoxicity is used in medicine to refer to substances, typically medications, which are damaging to the auditory nerve or to the vestibular system of the ear. The effects of an ototoxic substance may be permanent or temporary as well as mild to severe in intensity. Symptoms of ototoxicity include dizziness, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, poor coordination, and unsteady gait. Over 100 classes of drugs have been linked to ototoxicity in some capacity."
Ounce,"Ounce: A measure of weight equal to 1/16th of a pound or, metrically, 28.35 grams. The abbreviation for ounce is oz."
Ova,Ova: Plural of ovum.
Ovarian cyst,"Ovarian cyst: A fluid-filled sac in the ovary. The most common type of ovarian cyst is called a follicular cyst. It results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the fluid-filled cyst that contains an egg. In some cycles, this follicle grows larger than normal and does not rupture to release the egg. Normally it resolves with simple observation over the course of days to months. Other types of ovarian cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic or endometrioid cysts). Still other types of ovarian cysts are called dermoid cysts (or ovarian teratomas). These bizarre (usually benign) tumors can contain many different body tissues such as hair, teeth, bone, cartilage, etc. Most ovarian cysts are never noticed by the woman and resolve without her ever knowing that it was there. When a cyst causes symptoms, pain is by far the most common presentation. The pain from an ovarian cyst can be caused from rupture of the cyst, rapid growth of the cyst and stretching, bleeding into the cyst, or twisting of the cyst around its blood supply. The diagnosis of an ovarian cyst is usually conformed (or made) by ultrasound, the best imaging technique for ovarian cysts. The treatment of these tumors is dependent upon the woman's age, the size of the cyst, and its appearance on ultrasound. Treatment can consist of simple observation, or it could include blood tests such as a CA-125 to help evaluate the growth for the potential of cancer. It should be noted that the interpretation of the CA-125 blood test has limitations in that women without cancer may have an elevated blood level, and those with cancer may have a negative blood test. If the tumor is causing severe pain, or if it is not resolving or is suspicious in any way, then it can be removed through laparoscopy or, if needed, through an open laparotomy (bikini incision). Once the cyst is removed, it is sent to the pathologist who looks at it under a microscope to make the final diagnosis as to the type of cyst it is. The outlook (prognosis) depends on the nature of the ovarian cyst. With virtually all benign cysts, the outcome is excellent."
Ovarian teratoma,"Ovarian teratoma: Also called a dermoid cyst of the ovary, this is a bizarre tumor, usually benign, in the ovary that typically contains a diversity of tissues including hair, teeth, bone, thyroid, etc. A dermoid cyst develops from a totipotential germ cell (a primary oocyte) that is retained within the egg sac (ovary). Being totipotential, that cell can give rise to all orders of cells necessary to form mature tissues and often recognizable structures such as hair, bone and sebaceous (oily) material, neural tissue and teeth. Dermoid cysts may occur at any age but the prime age of detection is in the childbearing years. The average age is 30. Up to 15% of women with ovarian teratomas have them in both ovaries. Dermoid cysts can range in size from a centimeter (less than a half inch) up to 45 cm (about 17 inches) in diameter. These cysts can cause the ovary to twist (torsion) and imperil its blood supply. The larger the dermoid cyst, the greater the risk of rupture with spillage of the greasy contents which can create problems with adhesions, pain etc. Although the large majority (about 98%) of these tumors are benign, the remaining fraction (about 2%) becomes cancerous (malignant). Removal of the dermoid cyst is usually the treatment of choice. This can be done by laparotomy (open surgery) or laparoscopy (with a scope). Torsion (twisting) of the ovary by the cyst is an emergency and calls for urgent surgery."
Ovary,"Ovary: The female gonad, one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. The ovaries are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics, such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy."
Over-the-counter (OTC) drug,Over-the-counter (OTC) drug: A drug for which a prescription is not needed.
Overactive bladder,"Overactive bladder: A sudden involuntary contraction of the muscular wall of the bladder causing urinary urgency, an immediate unstoppable need to urinate. It is a form of urinary incontinence (the unintentional loss of urine) and affects about 1 in 11 adults, particularly older adults. Treatment may include pelvic muscle strengthening, behavioral therapy, and medications. Also called urge incontinence."
Overweight,"Overweight: The term ""overweight"" is used in two different ways. In one sense it is a way of saying imprecisely that someone is heavy. The other sense of ""overweight"" is more precise and designates a state between normal weight and obesity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) now defines overweight in terms of the BMI (the body mass index) which is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m)squared. Since the BMI describes the body weight relative to height, it correlates strongly (in adults) with the total body fat content. Overweight is a BMI of 27.3 % or more for women and 27.8 % or more for men, according to the NIH. Obesity is a BMI of 30 and above, according to the NIH."
Ovulation,"Ovulation: The release of the ripe egg (ovum) from the ovary. The egg is released when the cavity surrounding it (the follicle) breaks open in response to a hormonal signal. Ovulation occurs around 14 or 15 days from the first day of the woman?s last menstrual cycle. When ovulation occurs, the ovum moves into the Fallopian tube and becomes available for fertilization."
Oxter,"Oxter: The armpit. From the Old English oxta or ohsta. The word oxter is used in certain areas of the world (Scotland, Ireland, Northern England), reminding us that there are many local and colloquial names for parts of the human anatomy. Synonymous with axilla."
Oxy,"Oxy: Street name for OxyContin, prescription painkiller that has become a popular and dangerous recreational drug. OxyContin is a time-release morphine-like narcotic intended to relieve chronic pain of moderate to severe proportions. One pill of OxyContin is designed to last 12 hours. The active ingredient in OxyContin is oxycodone, an opioid, a close relative of morphine, heroin, codeine, fentanyl, and methadone. ""Oxy"" has been widely abused. It is highly addicting. Those who abuse it usually crush the pills -- to disable their time-release mechanism -- and then snort or inject them for a powerful and immediate opiate high."

Those who abuse ""Oxy"" usually crush the pills -- to disable their time-release mechanism -- and then snort or inject them for a powerful and immediate opiate high."
Oxygen,"Oxygen: The odorless gas that is present in the air and necessary to maintain life. Oxygen may be given in a medical setting, either to reduce the volume of other gases in the blood or as a vehicle for delivering anesthetics in gas form. It can be delivered via nasal tubes, an oxygen mask, or an oxygen tent. Patients with lung disease or damage may need to use portable oxygen devices on a temporary or permanent basis."
Oxygen tent,"Oxygen tent: A tent-like device that is used in a medical setting to deliver high levels of oxygen to a bedridden patient. The tent covers the entire head and upper body, and oxygen is pumped in from a tank."
Oxygenation,"Oxygenation: The addition of oxygen to any system, including the human body. Oxygenation may also refer to the process of treating a patient with oxygen, or of combining a medication or other substance with oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygenation is an increased amount of oxygen in organs and tissues resulting from the administration of oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than 1 atmosphere."
Oxyhemoglobin,"Oxyhemoglobin: The oxygen-loaded form of hemoglobin, the predominant protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a protein molecule that binds to oxygen. Hemoglobin forms an unstable, reversible bond with oxygen. In its oxygen-loaded form, it is called oxyhemoglobin and is bright red. In the oxygen-unloaded form it is called deoxyhemoglobin and is purple-blue."
Oxymetholone,"Oxymetholone: A synthetic male steroid hormone that is sometimes used to treat wasting in patients with HIV disease. Since it promotes large gains in body mass, it has sometimes been used illegally by bodybuilders and athletes. It has also been used in the treatment of anemia."
Oxytocin,"Oxytocin: A hormone made in the brain that plays a role in childbirth and lactation by causing muscles to contract in the uterus (womb) and the mammary glands in the breast. Animal studies have shown that oxytocin also has a role in pair bonding, mate-guarding, and social memory. Oxytocin is a peptide (a compound consisting of 2 or more amino acids) that is secreted by the hypothalamus and transported to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. Oxytocin is related to another hormone called vasopressin."

p.o.,"p.o.: Abbreviation meaning by mouth, orally (from the Latin ""per os"", by mouth)."
p.r.n.,"p.r.n.: Abbreviation meaning ""when necessary"" (from the Latin ""pro re nata"", for an occasion that has arisen, as circumstances require, as needed)."
PA (physician assistant),"PA (physician assistant): A physician assistant (PA) is a mid-level medical practitioner who works under the supervision of a licensed doctor (an MD) or osteopathic physician (a DO). The physician assistant came about in the 1960s as a response to the need for more clinicians The first PA program was developed by Dr. Eugene Stead, chairman of the Department of Medicine at Duke University, to train PAs for rural areas with dwindling numbers of physicians and nurses. Today the term ""physician assistant"" has a more precise definition as it applies to the mid-level practitioner who is able to practice medicine under the auspices of a licensed physician. Although the physician need not be present during the time the PA performs his or her duties, there must be a method of contact between the supervising physician and the PA at all times. The PA must be competent in the duties he or she is performing and the physician for whom the PA is working must also be licensed and trained to perform the relevant duties. Examples of the duties of a general PA include: PAs can practice in virtually all medical and surgical specialties, provided they are properly trained and supervised. Thus, PAs can assist in surgeries. A PA must have at least a bachelor's degree. Although there is not yet a requirement to hold a degree beyond the bachelor's level, the current trend is for PAs to have a master's degree. PA training programs are accredited by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. Each state in the U.S. has its own specific licensing and practicing restrictions for PAs. Most states require PAs to pass the certification examination of the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants."
PA X-ray,PA X-ray: An?X-ray?picture in which the beams pass from back-to-front (posteroanterior). As opposed to an AP (anteroposterior) image in which the rays pass through the body from front-to-back
Pacemaker,"Pacemaker: A system that sends electrical impulses to the heart in order to set the heart rhythm. The pacemaker can be the normal ""natural"" pacemaker of the heart or it can be an electronic device. The natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node, one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system, the system that controls the heart rate. This stunningly designed system generates electrical impulses and conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood. The sinus node consists of a cluster of cells that are situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The electrical impulses are generated there. The sinus node is also called the sinoatrial node or, for short, the SA node. The electrical signal generated by the sinus node moves from cell to cell down through the heart until it reaches the atrioventricular node (AV node), a cluster of cells situated in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles. The AV node serves as a gate that slows the electrical current before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have a chance to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart. Although there are different types of artificial pacemakers, all are designed to treat bradycardia, a heart rate that is too slow. Some pacemakers function continuously and stimulate the heart at a fixed rate or at an increased rate during exercise. A pacemaker can also be programmed to detect an overly long pause between heartbeats, and then stimulate the heart. For more information, see Artificial pacemaker."
Pachy- (prefix),"Pachy- (prefix): Thick. As in pachydactyly (thick fingers), pachydermatous (thick fingers) and pachyonychia (thick nails). From the Greek pachys, thick."
Pachyderma,"Pachyderma: Thick skin, like that of a pachyderm (an elephant, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus). The adjective is pachydermatous. Pachyderma can occur in several medical conditions, such as chronic lymphedema. From the Greek pachydermos meaning ""thick skin"" from pachys meaning ""thick"" + derma meaning ""skin."""
Paget disease,"Paget disease: A chronic bone disorder that typically results in enlarged, deformed bones due to excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue that can cause bones to weaken and may result in bone pain, arthritis, deformities or fractures. The disease is named for the great English surgeon and pathologist, Sir James Paget (1814-1899). Paget's disease is rarely diagnosed in people under 40. Men and women are affected equally. Because Paget's disease may be familial, after age 40, brothers, sisters and children of someone with Paget's disease may wish to have an alkaline phosphatase blood test every 2 or 3 years to screen for Paget's disease. Many people do not know they have Paget's disease because they have a mild case of the disease with no symptoms. Sometimes, symptoms may be confused with those of arthritis or other disorders. The symptoms of Paget's disease can include: Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests: The outlook with Paget's disease is generally good, particularly if treatment is given before major changes have occurred in the affected bones. Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, thighs, and lower legs. In general, symptoms progress slowly, and the disease does not spread to normal bones. Treatment can control Paget's disease and lessen symptoms but is not a cure. Paget's disease may lead to other medical conditions, including: Paget's disease is NOT associated specifically with osteoporosis. Although Paget's disease and osteoporosis can occur in one and the same person, they are completely different disorders. But, despite their marked differences, many treatments for Paget's disease can also be used to treat osteoporosis. The goal of drug treatment is to control Paget's disease activity for as long a period of time as possible. Treatment options include aspirin, other anti-inflammatory medications, pain medications, and medications that slow the rate of bone turnover, such as calcitonin (Calcimar, Miacalcin) and the bisphosphonates including etidronate (Didronel), alendronate (Fosamax), pamidronate (Aredia), tiludronate (Skelid), and risedronate (Actonel). There are generally three major complications of Paget's disease for which surgery may be recommended. Complications resulting from enlargement of the skull or spine may injure the nervous system. However, most neurologic symptoms, even those that are moderately severe, can be treated with medication and do not require neurosurgery. In general, people with Paget's disease should receive 1000-1500 mg of calcium, adequate sunshine, and at least 400 units of vitamin D daily. This is especially important in patients being treated with bisphosphonates. Patients with a history of kidney stones should discuss calcium and vitamin D intake with their physician. Exercise is very important in maintaining skeletal health, avoiding weight gain, and maintaining joint mobility. Since undue stress on affected bones should be avoided, patients should discuss any exercise program with their physician before beginning."
Pain,"Pain: An unpleasant sensation that can range from mild, localized discomfort to agony. Pain has both physical and emotional components. The physical part of pain results from nerve stimulation. Pain may be contained to a discrete area, as in an injury, or it can be more diffuse, as in disorders like fibromyalgia. Pain is mediated by specific nerve fibers that carry the pain impulses to the brain where their conscious appreciation may be modified by many factors. Pain is also a term specifically used to denote a painful uterine contraction occurring in childbirth. The word ""pain"" comes from the Latin ""poena"" meaning a fine, a penalty."
Pain management,"Pain management: The process of providing medical care that alleviates or reduces pain. Mild to moderate pain can usually be treated with analgesic medications, such as aspirin. For chronic or severe pain, opiates and other narcotics may be used, sometimes in concert with analgesics; with steroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when the pain is related to inflammation; or with antidepressants, which can potentiate some pain medications without raising the actual dose of the drug and which affect the brain's perception of pain. Narcotics carry with them the potential for side effects and addiction. However, the risk of addiction is not normally a concern in the care of terminal patients. For hospitalized patients with severe pain, devices for self-administration of narcotics are frequently used. Other procedures can also be useful in pain management programs. For bedridden patients, simply changing position regularly or using pillows to support a more comfortable posture can be effective. Massage, acupuncture, acupressure, and biofeedback have also shown some validity for increased pain control in some patients."
Pain unit,Pain unit: A measurement of the intensity of pain. See also: Dol.
Painful urination,Painful urination: See: Dysuria.
Palate,"Palate: The roof of the mouth. The front portion is bony (hard palate), and the back portion is muscular (soft palate)."
Paleostriatum,"Paleostriatum: A pale-appearing spherical area in the brain. The paleostriatum is specifically part of what is called the lentiform nucleus which, in turn, is part of the striate body, a component of the basal ganglia, large masses of gray matter at the base of the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Cells within the paleostriatum may be preferentially damaged and perish in carbon monoxide poisoning, barbiturate intoxication, cyanide poisoning, hydrogen sulfide poisoning, profound prolonged hypoglycemia, hypoxia, hypotension, and Wilson disease. Paleostriatum means old stratum. It was so named because it was thought to have evolved before the neostriatum (the new stratum), a different part of the striate body of the brain. The paleostriatum is also called the globus pallidus, globus being the Latin for globe and pallidus referring to its pallor."
Palindrome,"Palindrome: In genetics, a DNA or RNA sequence that reads the same in both directions. The sites of many restriction enzymes that cut (restrict) DNA are palindromes. In rheumatology, palindromic rheumatism is a form of joint inflammation in which the joints involved by the arthritis appear to change periodically from one region of the body to another and back again. In general usage, a palindrome is a word (such as the name ""Eve""), phrase, sentence (such as ""Madam I'm Adam""), or number (such as 2002) that reads the same in both directions, backward or forward."
Palliative treatment,"Palliative treatment: To palliate a disease is to treat it partially and insofar as possible, but not cure it completely. Palliation cloaks a disease. Also sometimes called symptomatic treatment. To take a case, a 91-year-old man was found to have a tumor in his lung. He did not have chest surgery because of his age and the general rule that cancer moves more slowly with age. Instead, he had radiotherapy of the tumor: palliation, to slow the progression of local disease, as opposed to a cure. The Latin ""pallium"" referred to a type of cloak in ancient Greece and Rome and, later, to a white woolen band with pendants in front and back worn by the pope or an archbishop as a symbol of full episcopal authority. Pallium was modified to form ""palliate,"" an adjective meaning ""cloaked"" or ""concealed"" and a verb meaning ""to cloak,"" ""to cloth,"" or ""to shelter."" Today ""palliation"" implies the disguising or concealing of badness or evil and suggests the alleviation of the vile effects of wickedness or illness."
Palm,"Palm: The grasping side of the hand; the flexor surface of the hand. In contrast to the back of the hand, the extensor surface of the hand. From the Latin ""palma"" for the outstretched palm of the hand. The palm tree is so named from the resemblance of the shape of its frond to the palm of the hand."
Palmar,"Palmar: Pertaining to the palm (the grasping side) of the hand. The ancient Romans used the word ""palma"" for the outstretched palm of the hand. By comparison, the term ""volar"" applies to both the palm and sole. It comes from word ""vola"" which the Romans used for ""the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot."""
Palmitate,"Palmitate: An antioxidant and a vitamin A compound that is added to low-fat and fat-free milk to replace the vitamin content lost through the removal of milk fat. Palmitate (more formally known as retinyl palmitate) contains palmitic acid, a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, which is the major fatty acid found in palm oil. The palmitic acid is attached to the alcohol form of vitamin A, called retinol, to make vitamin A stable in milk. The name ""palmitate"" comes from the French ""palmitique"" from palmite, the pith of the palm tree."
Palpable,"Palpable: Something that can be felt. For example, a palpable growth is one that can be detected by touch."
Palpitations,"Palpitations: Unpleasant sensations of irregular and/or forceful beating of the heart. In some patients with palpitations, no heart disease or abnormal heart rhythms can be found. In others, palpitations result from abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)."
Palsy,"Palsy: Paralysis, generally partial, whereby a local body area is incapable of voluntary movement. For example, Bell's palsy is localized paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face."
Pancolitis,"Pancolitis: Ulcerative colitis that involves the entire colon (the large intestine). Ulcerative colitis itself is a relatively common disease involving inflammation of the large intestine (the colon). The cause is unknown. It is a form of inflammatory bowel disease and has some similarity to a related disorder, Crohn's disease. The lower end of the colon (the rectum) is always involved in ulcerative colitis. When the inflammation is limited to the rectum, it is called ulcerative proctitis. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation may extend to varying degrees up into the upper parts of the colon. When the entire colon is involved, the terms pancolitis or universal colitis are used. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intermittent rectal bleeding. Ulcerative colitis characteristically waxes and wanes. Many patients experience long remissions, even without medication. Ulcerative colitis may mysteriously resolve (""burn out"") after a long history of symptoms. Direct visualization (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with sampling of the lining of the bowel is the most accurate diagnostic test. Especially in new cases, infections and other diseases that can mimic ulcerative colitis have to be considered and excluded. Long-standing ulcerative colitis increases the risk for colon cancer. Ulcerative colitis can also be associated with inflammation in joints, spine, skin, eyes, the liver and its bile ducts. The treatment of ulcerative colitis involves medications and/or surgery. Since inflammatory bowel disease is currently an area of active and productive research, new treatments are anticipated which, it is hoped, will be of value in ulcerative colitis."
Pancreas,"Pancreas: A spongy, tube-shaped organ that is about 6 inches long and is located in the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen. It is connected to the upper end of the small intestine. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body. The pancreas makes pancreatic juices and hormones, including insulin and secretin. Pancreatic juices contain enzymes that help digest food in the small intestine. Both pancreatic enzymes and hormones are needed to keep the body working correctly. As pancreatic juices are made, they flow into the main pancreatic duct, which joins to the common bile duct, which connects the pancreas to the liver and the gallbladder and carries bile to the small intestine near the stomach. The pancreas is thus a compound gland in the sense that it is composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The exocrine function of the pancreas involves the synthesis and secretion of pancreatic juices. The endocrine function resides in the million or so cellular islands (the islets of Langerhans) that are embedded between the exocrine units of the pancreas. Beta cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete insulin, which helps control carbohydrate metabolism. Alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete glucagon, which counters the action of insulin."
Pancreatic insufficiency,"Pancreatic insufficiency: Not enough of the digestive enzymes normally secreted by the pancreas into the intestine. Pancreatic insufficiency is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. The pancreas is a spongy, tube-shaped organ about 6 inches long. It is located in the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen. It is connected to the duodenum, the upper end of the small intestine. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body. The pancreas makes pancreatic juices and hormones, including insulin. Pancreatic juices, also called enzymes, help digest food in the small intestine. Insulin controls the amount of sugar in the blood. Both enzymes and hormones are needed to keep the body working right. As pancreatic juices are made, they flow into the main pancreatic duct. This duct joins the common bile duct, which connects the pancreas to the liver and the gallbladder. The common bile duct, which carries bile (a fluid that helps digest fat), connects to the small intestine near the stomach."
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas. Of the many causes of pancreatitis, the most common are alcohol consumption and gallstones. Other causes include medications (azathioprine, estrogen, thiazides, metronidazole, valproic acid, and tetracycline), trauma, abdominal surgery, abnormalities of the pancreas and intestine, and infections such as mumps. Acute pancreatitis usually begins with pain in the upper abdomen that may last for a few days. The pain may be sudden and intense, or it may begin as a mild pain that is aggravated by eating and slowly grows worse. The abdomen may be very tender. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and fever. The patient often feels and looks very sick. Chronic pancreatitis usually follows many years of alcohol abuse and may cause pain; malabsorption of food, leading to weight loss; and diabetes, if the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (islet cells) are damaged."
Pancytopenia,"Pancytopenia: A shortage of all types of blood cells. Pancytopenia can be caused by a side effect of many medications (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, and others) or diseases (such as lupus and bone marrow disorders). Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause and may be supplemented by medications that stimulate the bone marrow."
Pandemic,"Pandemic: An epidemic (a sudden outbreak) that becomes very widespread and affects a whole region, a continent, or the world due to a susceptible population. By definition, a true pandemic causes a high degree of mortality (death) By contrast: The word ""pandemic"" comes from the Greek ""pan-"", ""all"" + ""demos,"" ""people or population"" = ""pandemos"" = ""all the people."" A pandemic affects all (nearly all) of the people. By contrast, ""epi-"" means ""upon."" An epidemic is visited upon the people. And ""en-"" means ""in."" An endemic is in the people."
Panhypopituitarism,"Panhypopituitarism: Inadequate or absent production of the anterior pituitary hormones due to various causes. The anterior pituitary produces the hormones thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL). Also known as hypopituitarism. The condition may occur at birth or may be acquired later in life. Acquired hypopituitarism is more common than the congenital (present at birth) form. Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, decrease in sex drive, infertility, sensitivity to cold, decreased facial or body hair in men, and puffiness of the face. Acquired panhypopituitarism can occur as a result of tumors in the pituitary gland. It can also arise due to head injuries, radiation treatment, autoimmune conditions, stroke, brain infections, or brain surgery. Pituitary dwarfism is dwarfism caused by a lack of growth hormone, usually due to malfunction of the pituitary gland. Children with growth hormone deficiency may grow normally for the first two to three years of life, but they then fall behind their peers in height. They are normally proportioned. This is a key point. Treatment is with human growth hormone given in childhood. Also known as hypopituitary dwarfism and growth hormone deficiency."
Panic,"Panic: A sudden strong feeling of fear that prevents reasonable thought or action. The word comes from the name of the Greek woodland god Pan, who was a frightening figure'part human, part goat'and whose pet caprice was to terrify people who ventured into rural areas."
Panic disorder,"Panic disorder: An anxiety disorder that is characterized by sudden attacks of fear and panic. Panic attacks may occur without a known reason, but more frequently they are triggered by fear-producing events or thoughts, such as taking an elevator or driving. Symptoms of panic attacks include rapid heartbeat, strange chest sensations, shortness of breath, dizziness, tingling, and anxiousness. Hyperventilation, agitation, and withdrawal are common results. Panic disorder is believed to be due to an abnormal activation of the body's hormonal system, causing a sudden 'fight or flight' response. Treatment involves cognitive behavioral therapy, using exposure to effect symptom reduction, and use of medication."
Panniculus,"Panniculus: a sheet or layer of tissue. The term panniculus is most commonly used in the lay press to refer to an abdominal panniculus adiposus, a sheet of fat tissue that is present in the lower abdominal area. An abdominal panniculus may be seen with obesity, following pregnancy, or after significant weight loss. In severe cases, the fat layer may appear to hang or be suspended and reach the level of the knees or lower. An operation termed a panniculectomy (a kind of abdominoplasty) is designed to remove part of this fat tissue."
PAP,PAP: 1. Prostatic acid phosphatase. 2. Pulmonary artery pressure.
Papilledema,"Papilledema: Swelling of the head of the optic nerve, a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The optic nerve head, also called the optic disk or papilla, is the area where the optic nerve (the nerve that carries messages from the eye to the brain) enters the eyeball. The finding of papilledema is made with the ophthalmoscope (the instrument that shines light through the pupil illuminating the retina while the doctor looks through it). The optic nerve head is abnormally elevated in papilledema, almost always in both eyes. The causes of papilledema include cerebral edema (swelling of the brain, as from encephalitis or trauma), tumors and other lesions that occupy space within the skull, increased production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), decreased resorption of CSF (due to venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage), obstruction of the ventricular system within the brain, hydrocephalus, craniosynostosis (premature closure of the sutures of the skull), and a condition called pseudotumor cerebri. The finding of papilledema requires immediate further evaluation and, if need be, intervention. Also known as a choked disk."
Para,"Para: Any woman who has given birth once or more is termed a ""para."" Note that, for a pregnancy to count as a ""birth,"" it must go to at least 20 weeks' gestation (the mid-point of a full-term pregnancy) or yield an infant that weighs at least 500 grams, irrespective of whether the infant is live born or not. A woman who is para I (a primipara) has given birth once; a woman who is para II has given birth twice; and so on. The term ""para"" comes from the Latin ""pario,"" to bring forth or bear."
Para- (prefix),"Para- (prefix): A prefix with many meanings, including: alongside of, beside, near, resembling, beyond, apart from, and abnormal. For example, the parathyroid glands are called ""para-thyroid"" because they are adjacent to the thyroid. For another example, paraumbilical means alongside the umbilicus (the belly button). The prefix ""para-"" comes straight from the Greek."
Paracentesis,"Paracentesis: The removal of fluid from a body cavity via a needle, a trocar, a cannula, or another hollow instrument. A paracentesis may be used for diagnosis or treatment, as, for example, in ascites, where there is free fluid in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. If the cause of the ascites is uncertain, diagnostic paracentesis is done in order to obtain fluid that can be examined. Therapeutic paracentesis may then be done to remove more fluid, as part of the plan of treatment. Paracentesis of the chest cavity is called a thoracentesis."
Parainfectious,"Parainfectious: Occurring at the time of and in association with an acute infection or an episode of infection. For example, transverse myelitis (a disorder of the spinal cord) can occur parainfectiously in association with a number of viral and bacterial illnesses."
Paralysis,"Paralysis: Loss of voluntary movement (motor function). Paralysis that affects only one muscle or limb is partial paralysis, also known as palsy; paralysis of all muscles is total paralysis, as may occur in cases of botulism."
"Paralysis, stomach","Paralysis, stomach: Formally called gastroparesis, this is a medical condition in which the muscle of the stomach is paralyzed by a disease of either the stomach muscle itself or the nerves controlling the muscle. As a consequence, food and secretions do not empty normally from the stomach, and there is nausea and vomiting. Gastroparesis may be associated with paralysis of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract (the small intestine and colon). The most common cause of gastroparesis is diabetes mellitus. (So often is gastroparesis due to diabetes that there is a term, gastroparesis diabeticorum, that refers exclusively to it). A nuclear medicine test designed to study gastric emptying is the most common means of diagnosis of gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is treated with medications to increase the contractions of the stomach's muscle, occasionally with surgery, and experimentally with electrical pacing. The word ""gastroparesis"" is compounded from ""gastro"", pertaining to the stomach + ""paresis"", a loss of strength = a loss of strength of the stomach = stomach paralysis."
Paralytic ileus,"Paralytic ileus: Obstruction of the intestine due to paralysis of the intestinal muscles. The paralysis does not need to be complete to cause ileus, but the intestinal muscles must be so inactive that it prevents the passage of food and leads to a functional blockage of the intestine. Ileus commonly follows some types of surgery, especially abdominal surgery. It also can result from certain drugs, spinal injuries, inflammation anywhere within the abdomen that touches the intestines, and diseases of the intestinal muscles themselves. Irrespective of the cause, ileus causes constipation, abdominal distention, and nausea and vomiting. On listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope, few or no bowel sounds are heard (because the bowel is inactive). Also called paralytic ileus. Also simply called ileus."
Paraphilia,"Paraphilia: One of several complex psychiatric disorders that are manifested as deviant sexual behavior. For example, in men, the most common forms are pedophilia (sexual behavior or attraction toward children) and exhibitionism (exposing one's body in a public setting). Other paraphilias include compulsive sexual behavior (nymphomania), sadism, masochism, fetishism, bestiality (zoophilia), and necrophilia. Treatment may include cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, behavior modification, use of antidepressant medications, and use of medications that alter hormone production, particularly of testosterone. However, the cause and treatment of paraphilia are poorly understood, and treatment is rarely effective. In addition, many professionals prefer not to pathologize sexual behavior that involves only willing adults, even if the behavior might be deemed deviant in mainstream society. In cases where the behavior is potentially criminal, as in pedophilia, treatment is usually delivered within the penal system."
Parasite,"Parasite: A plant or an animal organism that lives in or on another and takes its nourishment from that other organism. Parasitic diseases include infections that are due to protozoa, helminths, or arthropods. For example, malaria is caused by Plasmodium, a parasitic protozoa."
Parasitic,"Parasitic: Having to do with a parasite, as in a parasitic infection; or acting like a parasite by taking nourishment from another."
Parasitic worm,"Parasitic worm: A worm classified as a parasite. (A parasite is a disease-causing organism that lives on or in a human or another animal and derives its nourishment from its host.) Lice are examples of parasites that live on humans; bacteria and viruses are examples of parasites that live either on humans or in humans; parasitic worms (also called helminths) live in humans. Helminth eggs contaminate food, water, air, feces, pets and wild animals, and objects such as toilet seats and door handles. The eggs enter the body of a human through the mouth, the nose and the anus. Once inside the body, helminth eggs usually lodge in the intestine, hatch, grow and multiply. They can sometimes infest other body sites. Diagnosis of helminth diseases in humans usually requires a medical history and physical examination, a laboratory analysis of stools, and sometimes other tests. Treatment in most cases involves the use of highly effective anti-worm drugs known as vermifuges that kill the worms. Prevention of helminth diseases usually requires frequent washing of hands, frequent cleaning of bathrooms and kitchens, and thorough cooking of the foods they infest -- mainly beef, pork, sausage and bear meat. Water supplies should be chlorinated, if possible. Common helminths and the problems they cause include the following: The word ""helminth"" is derived from the Greek ""helmins"" (worm). Helminthology is the study of parasitic worms."
Parasitosis,"Parasitosis: Infestation or infection with parasites. See also: Delusional parasitosis, Morgellon's disease."
Paraskevidekatriaphobia,"Paraskevidekatriaphobia: Fear of Friday the 13th. The word ""paraskevidekatriaphobia"" was devised by Dr. Donald Dossey who told his patients that ""when you learn to pronounce it, you're cured!"""
Parasomnia,"Parasomnia: A sleep disorder in which odd or dangerous events occur that intrude on sleep. The parasomnias include sleep talking, sleepwalking (somnambulism), sleep terrors, REM behavior disorder, and nocturnal dissociative disorder. Sleep talking may range from a word or two to an entire speech of which the sleep talker has no recollection; it is harmless. Sleepwalking involves nocturnal trips, tends to occur in children and can run in families. Sleep terrors are like severe nightmares but with intense fear often accompanied by screaming and fighting. Fifteen per cent of children experience night terrors after general anesthesia, occurring anywhere up to 2 weeks after surgery. They appear to be awake but are actually in a deep sleep and will not respond to shaking or being talked to. REM behavior disorder involves acting out dreams during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; it is most common in older men (who usually can recall the dreams) and treatment is with an antidepressant or tranquillizer. Nocturnal dissociative disorder is a condition in which people leave bed and re-enact episodes of sexual or physical abuse."
Parasuicide,"Parasuicide: An apparent attempt at suicide, commonly called a suicidal gesture, in which the aim is not death. For example, a sublethal drug overdose or wrist slash. Previous parasuicide is a predictor of suicide. The increased risk of subsequent suicide persists without decline for at least two decades."
Parasympathetic nervous system,"Parasympathetic nervous system: The part of the involuntary nervous system that serves to slow the heart rate, increase intestinal and glandular activity, and relax the sphincter muscles. The parasympathetic nervous system, together with the sympathetic nervous system, constitutes the autonomic nervous system."
Parathyroid gland,"Parathyroid gland: A gland that regulates calcium, located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. The parathyroid gland secretes a hormone called parathormone (or parathyrin) that is critical to calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Although the number of parathyroid glands can vary, most people have four, one above the other on each side. They are plastered against the back of the thyroid and therefore at risk for being accidentally removed during thyroidectomy. "
Parathyroid hormone,Parathyroid hormone: See Parathormone.
Parenchyma,"Parenchyma: The key elements of an organ essential to its functioning, as distinct from the capsule that encompasses it and other supporting structures."
Parenchymal,Parenchymal: Pertaining to the parenchyma of an organ. See: Parenchyma.
Parentectomy,"Parentectomy: A slang term meaning removal of a parent (or both parents) from the child. It is of relevance to the hospitalization of children. Dr. M. Murray Peshkin (1892-1990), the medical director of the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital in Denver from 1940 to 1959, noticed that some of his most severe asthma patients improved markedly as soon as they were removed from their homes and hospitalized -- before their treatments had had a chance to work. Peshkin came to advocate parentectomy, a change in environment for severe asthmatic children who had not improved with other treatments. He attributed parentectomy's success both to removal of the child from allergens in their homes and from the psychological conflicts they might have had with their parents."
Parenteral,"Parenteral: Not delivered via the intestinal tract. For example, parenteral nutrition is feeding that is delivered intravenously."
Parenteral nutrition,Parenteral nutrition: Intravenous feeding. Also known as parenteral alimentation.
Paresthesia,"Paresthesia: An abnormal sensation of the body, such as numbness, tingling, or burning."
Parietal,"Parietal: Adjective from the Latin ""parietalis"" meaning ""belonging to the wall"" that the ancient anatomists used to designate the wall, as of a body cavity. For examples, there are the:"
Parietal pericardium,"Parietal pericardium: The outer layer of the pericardium which is a conical sac of fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great blood vessels. The pericardium has outer and inner coats. The outer coat is tough and thickened, loosely cloaks the heart, and is attached to the central part of the diaphragm and the back of the sternum (breastbone). The inner coat is double with one layer closely adherent to the heart while the other lines the inner surface of the outer coat with the intervening space being filled with fluid. This small amount of fluid, the pericardial fluid, acts as a lubricant to allow normal heart movement within the chest. The word ""pericardium"" means around the heart. The inner part of the pericardium that closely envelops the heart is called the visceral pericardium or epicardium."
Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease: A slowly progressive neurologic disease that is characterized by a fixed inexpressive face, tremor at rest, slowing of voluntary movements, gait with short accelerating steps, peculiar posture and muscle weakness (caused by degeneration of an area of the brain called the basal ganglia), and low production of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Most patients are over 50, but at least 10 percent are under 40. Treatment involves use of medication, such as levodopa (brand name: Larodopa) and carbidopa (brand name: Sinemet). A surgical procedure known as deep brain stimulation, in which externally controlled electrodes are implanted into the brain, has also been shown to be helpful. There are no blood or laboratory tests to diagnose the condition. Although it is a chronic and progressive disease, the degree of disability varies among affected persons. Also known as paralysis agitans and shaking palsy."
Parkinsonism,"Parkinsonism: 1. Parkinson disease.
2. A syndrome similar to Parkinson disease, for example, as a side effect of an antipsychotic drug."
Paronychia,"Paronychia: Inflammation of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail due to infection or inflammation. The infection may be bacterial (most commonly, staph or strep) or fungal pathogens. The term ""paronychia"" is compounded from ""para-"", next to + the Greek ""onyx"", nail = next to the nail. Paronychia is synonymous with perionychia."
Paroxysm,"Paroxysm: In medicine, a paroxysm is a violent attack. It may be due to the sudden occurrence of symptoms or the acute exacerbation (the abrupt worsening) of preexisting symptoms. You may have ""a paroxysm of coughing"" as opposed, for example, to ""a lingering cough."" The word ""paroxysm"" comes from the Greek ""para-,"" during + ""oxys,"" sharp or acute. The root ""oxys"" was also used by the founder of modern chemistry Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94) to coin the word ""oxygen."""
Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia,"Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: Bouts of rapid, regular heart beating that originate in the upper chamber of the heart (atrium). Abbreviated PAT. PAT is caused by abnormalities in the atrioventricular (AV) node that lead to rapid firing of electrical impulses from the atrium that bypass the AV node under certain conditions, including excess alcohol consumption, stress, caffeine use, overactive thyroid or excessive thyroid hormone intake, and use of certain drugs. PAT is an example of an arrhythmia in which the abnormality is in the electrical system of the heart, while the heart muscle and valves may be normal. Also known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia."
Partial seizure,"Partial seizure: A seizure that affects only one part of the brain. Symptoms depend on which part is affected. One part of the body, or multiple body parts confined to one side of the body, may start to twitch uncontrollably. Partial seizures may involve head turning, eye movements, lip smacking, mouth movements, drooling, rhythmic muscle contractions in a part of the body, apparently purposeful movements, abnormal numbness, tingling, and a crawling sensation over the skin. Partial seizures can also include sensory disturbances, such as smelling or hearing things that are not there, or having a sudden flood of emotions. Although the patient may feel confused, consciousness is not lost. Also known as a focal seizure or a local seizure."
Parturition,"Parturition: Childbirth, the process of delivering the baby and placenta from the uterus to the vagina to the outside world. Also called labor and delivery. Parturition comes from the Latin parturire, ""to be ready to bear young"" and is related to partus, the past participle of parere, ""to produce."""
Parvovirus infection,"Parvovirus infection: Infection with one of a family of small single-stranded DNA viruses. (Parvovirus means small virus, from the Latin parvus, small.) One type, parvovirus B19, infects only humans. There are also animal parvoviruses, but they do not infect humans. A person cannot catch parvovirus B19 from a dog or cat. The diagnosis of parvovirus B19 can be confirmed by a blood test. Parvovirus infection in childhood: The most common illness caused by parvovirus B19 is ""fifth disease."" It occurs most often in children. The child typically has a ""slapped-cheek"" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. The rash may itch. The child does not usually seem very ill. The rash resolves in 7 to 10 days. Once a child recovers, he or she has lasting immunity and is protected against future infection. Parvovirus infection in adulthood: Adults can and do become infected with the virus. In adults, the flu-like symptoms are often more severe and the condition is called parvovirus infection, not fifth disease. Adults typically do not get a rash of the face, but can have the lacey rash of the body. Parvovirus arthritis: Adults with parvovirus commonly have joint pains and swelling. This form of arthritis usually resolves within weeks, but about 10% of patients can have a more prolonged arthritis that does mimic rheumatoid arthritis. (The rheumatoid factor blood test is usually negative, but can be positive.) Treatment involves medications that reduce inflammation in the joints. Parvovirus infection during pregnancy: Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can cause a miscarriage or cause the baby to have unborn baby to have severe anemia. This occurs in less than 5% of all pregnant women who are infected with parvovirus B19, most commonly during the first half of pregnancy. There is no evidence that parvovirus B19 infection causes birth defects or mental retardation. Prevention: There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent parvovirus B19 infection. Frequent hand washing is recommended as a practical and probably effective method to reduce the spread of parvovirus. Excluding persons with fifth disease from work, child care centers, schools, or other settings is not likely to prevent the spread of parvovirus B19, since ill persons are contagious before they develop the characteristic rash."
PAS,PAS: 1. Physician-assisted suicide. 2. Personal alert system (an alarm system for an elderly or infirm person). 3. Periodic acid-Schiff (a stain used to detect carbohydrates in tissue).
Passive exercise,"Passive exercise: Movement of the body, usually of the limbs, without effort by the patient. The patient is passive."
Pasteurization,"Pasteurization: A method of treating food by heating it to a certain point to kill pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms but not harm the flavor or quality of the food. Milk is pasteurized by heating it to about 145?F (63?C) for 30 minutes or, using the ""flash"" method, by heating it to 160?F (71?C) for 15 seconds, followed by rapid cooling to below 50?F (10?C), at which temperature it is stored. Pasteurization is also used with beer, wine, fruit juices, cheese and egg products. Fresh-squeezed unpasteurized fruit juices are a potential hazard, as some E. coli outbreaks have sadly shown. Named for the French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) who invented pasteurization, developed the germ theory, founded the field of bacteriology and created the first vaccines against anthrax and rabies. Pasteur's impact upon medicine was so profound that his name remains attached, not only to pasteurization but also to many other matters (the Pasteur effect; pasteurella; pasteurellaceae; pasteurellaceae infections; pasteurella haemolytica; pasteurella infections; pasteurella multocida; pasteurellosis, pneumonic; pasteurism; etc)"
PAT,PAT: Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
emoral syndrome (PFS),"Patellofemoral syndrome (PFS): The commonest cause of chronic knee pain, PFS characteristically causes vague discomfort of the inner knee area, aggravated by activity (running, jumping, climbing or descending stairs) or by prolonged sitting with knees in a moderately bent position (the so-called ""theater sign"" of pain upon arising from a desk or theater seat). The knee may be mildly swollen. If chronic symptoms are ignored, the loss of quadriceps strength may cause the leg to ""give out."" PFS is caused by an abnormality in how the kneecap (patella) slides over the lower end of the thigh bone (the femur). Normally, the patella (kneecap) is pulled up over the end of the femur in a straight line by the quadriceps (thigh) muscle. In PFS, there is patellar ""tracking"" toward the lateral (outer) side of the femur. This off-kilter path permits the underside of the patella to grate along the femur leading to chronic inflammation and pain. Females are at greater risk than males for PFS. Knock-kneed and flat-footed runners and persons with an unusually shaped patella are predisposed to PFS. Initial pain management is icing, anti-inflammatory drugs (Advil/Motrin; Aleve) and avoiding motions which irritate the kneecap. Treatment and rehabilitation are designed to create a straighter pathway for the patella to follow during quadriceps contraction. Selective strengthening of the inner portion of the quadriceps muscle helps normalize the tracking of the patella. Cardiovascular conditioning can be maintained by stationary bicycling (low resistance but high rpms), pool running, or swimming (flutter kick). Changes in training that may have led to the PFS pain should be reviewed and running shoes examined for proper biomechanical fit to avoid repeating the painful PFS cycle. Occasionally bracing with patellar centering devices is required. Stretching and strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups are essential to an effective and lasting rehabilitation of PFS. ""Quad sets"" are the foundation for such a program and are done by contracting the thigh muscles while the legs are straight and holding the contraction for a count of ten. Sets of 10 contractions are done between 15-20 times per day. Under optimal circumstances, there should be a rapid recovery and return at full functional level to sports. PFS has also been called ""housemaid's knee"", ""secretary's knee"" and chondromalacia patella."
Patent (adjective),"Patent (adjective): Open, unobstructed, affording free passage. Thus, for example, the bowel may be patent (as opposed to obstructed). Pronounced ""pa-tent"" with the accent on the first syllable."
Patent (noun),"Patent (noun): A device giving exclusive control and possession. Before the commercialization of biomedical inventions, the word ""patent"" in this sense had no place in a medical dictionary. Now the patent is the foundation of the biotechnology industry."
Patho-,"Patho-: A prefix derived from the Greek ""pathos"" meaning ""suffering or disease."" Patho- serves as a prefix for many terms including pathogen (disease agent), pathogenesis (development of disease), pathology (study of disease), etc. The corresponding suffix is -pathy."
Pathogenesis,Pathogenesis: The development of a disease and the chain of events leading to that disease.
Pathogenic,"Pathogenic: Capable of causing disease. For example, pathogenic E. coli are Eschericia coli bacteria that can make a person ill."
Pathognomonic,"Pathognomonic: A sign or symptom that is so characteristic of a disease that it can be used to make a diagnosis. For example, Koplik spots in the mouth opposite the first and second upper molars are pathognomonic of measles."
Pathologic,"Pathologic: 1. Indicative of or caused by disease, as in a pathologic fracture, pathologic tissue, or pathologic process. 2. Pertaining to pathology, the branch of medicine that studies disease and especially the essential nature of disease."
Pathologist,Pathologist: A physician who identifies diseases and conditions by studying abnormal cells and 'tissues.
Pathology,"Pathology: The study of disease. Pathology has been defined as ""that branch of medicine which treats of the essential nature of disease."" The word ""pathology"" comes from the Greek words ""pathos"" meaning ""disease"" and ""logos"" meaning ""a treatise"" = a treatise of disease. The word ""pathology"" is sometimes misused to mean disease as, for example, ""he didn't find any pathology"" (meaning he found no evidence of disease). A medical doctor that specializes in pathology is called a pathologist. Pathologists are experts at interpreting microscopic views of body tissues."
Pathophysiology,"Pathophysiology: Deranged function in an individual or an organ due to a disease. For example, a pathophysiologic alteration is a change in function as distinguished from a structural defect."
pathy,"pathy: A suffix derived from the Greek ""pathos"" meaning ""suffering or disease"" that serves as a suffix in many terms including myopathy (muscle disease), neuropathy (nerve disease), retinopathopathy (disease of the retina), sympathy (literally, suffering together), etc. The corresponding prefix is patho-, as in pathobiology and pathology."
Patient,"Patient: A person under health care. The person may be waiting for this care or may be receiving it or may have already received it. There is considerable lack of agreement about the precise meaning of the term ""patient."" It is diversely defined as, for examples: From the Latin verb ""patior"" meaning ""to suffer"" both in the sense of feeling pain and in the sense of forbearance. Thus, the two uses of the word ""patient"" -- as a noun denoting ""someone who suffers"" and as an adjective meaning ""to bear with forbearance"" -- stem from the same origin."
Patient autonomy,Patient autonomy: The right of patients to make decisions about their medical care without their health care provider trying to influence the decision. Patient autonomy does allow for health care providers to educate the patient but does not allow the health care provider to make the decision for the patient.
Pavlov pouch,"Pavlov pouch: At different points along the dogs' digestive tracts, the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1848-1936) surgically created pockets (""Pavlov pouches"") from which he could obtain secretions, the aim being to study the physiology of the digestive tract. He did so from the salivary glands down to the stomach, liver and pancreas with considerable success and in 1904 (the 4th year it was awarded) he received the Nobel Prize for ""his work on the physiology of digestion, through which knowledge on vital aspects of the subject has been transformed and enlarged."""
PCA,"PCA: Commonly used abbreviation for patient-controlled analgesia. Analgesia simply means relief of pain. PCA is a method by which the patient controls the amount of pain medicine (analgesia) they receive. There are a number of different PCA systems. In the classic PCA system, the patient receives a preset dose of morphine by pressing a button on a computerized pump that is connected to an IV catheter. With PCA the patient may receive a small continuous flow of morphine and add more morphine as needed to provide a more constant level of comfort. Studies have shown that patients using PCA often use less morphine than do patients who are not on PCA. In a very different type of PCA system, the pain reliever fentanyl (Duragesic) is delivered transdermally (through the skin), eliminating the need for an IV and for programming a pump."
PCBs,"PCBs: PolyChlorinated Biphenyls, are a group of organic chemicals which can be odorless or mildly aromatic solids or oily liquids. They were formerly used in the USA as hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, adhesives, fire retardants, way extenders, de-dusting agents, pesticide extenders, inks, lubricants, cutting oils, in heat transfer systems, carbonless reproducing paper. In 1974, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. This law requires the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) to determine safe levels of chemicals in drinking water which do or may cause health problems. These non-enforceable levels, based solely on possible health risks and exposure, are called Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLG). The MCLG for PCBs has been set at zero. Zero is not a realistically enforceable limit, therefore, the EPA has set an enforceable standard called a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). The MCL is 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) because EPA believes, given present technology and resources, this is the lowest level to which water systems can reasonably be required to remove this contaminant should it occur in drinking water. The FDA requires that infant foods, eggs, milk and other dairy products, fish and shellfish, poultry and red meat contain no more than 0.2-3 parts of PCBs per million parts (0.2-3 ppm) of food. Since EPA banned most uses of PCBs in 1979, current levels are due mainly to the cycling of this persistent contaminant from soil to air to soil again. PCBs continue to be released from landfills, incineration of municipal refuse and sewage sludge, and improper (or illegal) disposal of PCB materials, such as waste transformer fluid, to open areas. PCBs are very persistent in soil and water, with no known break down processes other than slow degradation by microbes. They adhere to soils or evaporate, and so will not usually leach to ground water. PCB-contaminated sediments in lakes or rivers can slowly release PCB back into water, from which it eventually evaporates. In water, a small amount of PCBs may remain dissolved, but most stick to organic particles and bottom sediments. PCBs are taken up by small organisms and fish in water. They are also taken up by other animals that eat these aquatic animals as food. PCBs accumulate in fish and marine mammals, reaching levels that may be many thousands of times higher than in water. Farmed salmon contain higher levels of PCBs than wild ones. This reflects the fact that farmed salmon may be fed ground-up smaller fish that have themselves been contaminated in polluted ocean waters. Short-term health effects of relatively short term exposure at levels above MCL are acne-like eruptions and pigmentation of the skin; hearing and vision problems; spasms. Long-term health effects from a lifetime of exposure at levels above MCL include effects similar to acute poisonings, irritation of nose, throat and gastrointestinal tracts, changes in liver function, and cancer when people are exposed This information is from the Consumer Factsheet on: POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS from the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry: Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in Human Food and Animal Feed."
PCO,"PCO: 1. Abbreviation in medical records for ""Patient complains of."" 2. Abbreviation for polycystic ovary. See also: Polycystic ovarian syndrome."
PCO disease,"PCO disease: PCO stands for PolyCystic Ovarian. PCO disease is an hormonal problem that causes women various symptoms including: Women with PCO are at a higher risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and uterine (endometrial) cancer. Much of this risk can be reversed by exercise and weight loss. It is also important for women with PCO to have regular periods -- if a woman does not have regular periods, her risk of endometrial cancer rises -- so medication is prescribed to induce regular periods. For acne or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called spironolactone can help. For PCO women who desire pregnancy, a medication called clomiphene (CLOMID) can be used to induce ovulation (cause egg production). A type of surgery called a ""wedge resection,"" in which a piece of the ovary is removed, seems to help some women. No one is sure what causes PCO. However, the ovaries of women with PCO contain a number of small cysts. Hence, the name poly (many) cystic ovarian disease. The name ""Stein-Leventhal"" is after the late American gynecologists Irving F. Stein, Sr. and Michael Leo Leventhal."
PCP,PCP: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction),PCR (polymerase chain reaction): PCR (polymerase chain reaction):?PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?is a technique in molecular?genetics?that permits the?analysis?of any short sequence of?DNA?(or?RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA for analysis.
PCT,"PCT: The abbreviation ""PCT"" stands for a number of things including porphyria cutanea tarda, literally, the late skin form of porphyria, a genetic photosensitive (light-sensitive) skin disease with onset in adult life with substances called uroporphyrins in the urine due to a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), an enzyme required for the synthesis of heme (part of hemoglobin, the pigment in red blood cells that carries oxygen). The hallmarks of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are blisters which become ulcerated in areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, especially on the face, ears and dorsum (back) of the hands. The affected areas of skin also tend to be fragile and show hyperpigmentation (excess pigment) and hypertrichosis (excess hair). PCT, the most common form of porphyria, comes in two clinical familial and a sporadic form: Iron overload is frequently present in PCT and may be associated with varying degrees of damage of the liver. A severe form of PCT, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), has its onset in infancy with the accumulation of protoporphyrin in the red blood cells. The level of the enzyme UROD is very low in red cells. The UROD gene has been mapped to 1p34. Mutations have been identified in the UROD gene, including DNA base substitutions and deletions. These mutations result in reduced activity of the enzyme. Some mutation result in PCT and others in the recessively inherited HEP. HEP is the homozygous form of familial PCT. Treatment is directed first at reducing iron overload by regular phlebotomy (removal of blood). Then treatment with the drug chloroquine usually induces rapid remission that is sustained while chloroquine is continued in regular low doses."
PDR,"PDR: Physicians' Desk Reference (please see entry to Physicians' Desk Reference). PDR less frequently stands for ""postdelivery room""."
Pediatric,Pediatric: Pertaining to children.
Pediatrics,"Pediatrics: The field of medicine that is concerned with the health of infants, children, and adolescents; their growth and development; and their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults."
Pedophilia,"Pedophilia: Adult sexual fondness for and activity with children. Pedophilia is a form of paraphilia (deviant sexual behavior). If acted out, pedophilia is legally defined as sexual child abuse. Pedophilia includes fondling a child's genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation of children through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials. Pedophiles who have sexually abused children require intense psychological and pharmacological therapy prior to release into the community because of the high rate of repeat offenders. Treatment is rarely effective because the disorder is not yet well understood. The incidence of pedophilia has been markedly underestimated. It is essential that pedophilia be reported so that appropriate steps can be taken to protect the children involved and all other children."
Pedophobia,"Pedophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of babies and children. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is groundless. Rearing a child or being around active children can both produce anxiety. From the Greek ""pais"" (child) and ""phobos"" (fear). Related terms include: androphobia, an abnormal and persistent fear of men; gynephobia, a comparably irrational and excessive fear of women."
PEEP,"PEEP: Abbreviation for positive end-expiratory pressure. A method of ventilation in which airway pressure is maintained above atmospheric pressure at the end of exhalation by means of a mechanical impedance, usually a valve, within the circuit. The purpose of PEEP is to increase the volume of gas remaining in the lungs at the end of expiration in order to decrease the shunting of blood through the lungs and improve gas exchange. PEEP is done in ARDS (acute respiratory failure syndrome) to allow reduction in the level of oxygen being given."
Peeping tom,"Peeping tom: Peeping tom (voyeurism) is a disorder that involves achieving sexual arousal by observing an unsuspecting and non-consenting person who is undressing or unclothed, and/or engaged in sexual activity. This behavior may conclude with masturbation by the voyeur. The voyeur does not seek sexual contact with the person he is observing. Other names for this behavior are ""peeping"" or ""peeping Tom."""
PEF,PEF: Peak expiratory flow.
PEG,"PEG: Stands for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, a surgical procedure for placing a feeding tube without having to perform an open laparotomy (operation on the abdomen). The aim of PEG is to feed those who cannot swallow. PEG may be done by a surgeon, otolaryngologist (ENT specialist) or gastroenterologist (GI specialist). It is done in a. hospital or outpatient surgical facility. Local anesthesia (usually lidocaine or another spray) is used to anesthetize the throat. An endoscope (a flexible, lighted instrument) is passed through the mouth, throat and esophagus to the stomach. The surgeon then makes a small incision (cut) in the skin of the abdomen and pushes an intravenous cannula (an IV tube) through the skin into the stomach and sutures (ties) it in place. The patient can usually go home the same day or the next morning. Possible complications include wound infection and dislodging or malfunction of the tube. PEG takes less time, carries less risk and costs less than a classic surgical gastrostomy which requires opening the abdomen."
Peliosis hepatis,"Peliosis hepatis: A rare condition in which the liver contains multiple, randomly-distributed blood-filled spaces or cavities ranging in size from millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Peliosis hepatis has been associated with the use of anabolic steroids and other hormones such as oral contraceptive pills. It has also been observed in association with both benign and malignant liver tumors, infections, and the use of certain medications. Although peliosis hepatis typically does not cause symptoms, rupture of the blood-filled cavities can lead to serious and potentially fatal internal hemorrhage."
Pellagra,"Pellagra: A disease due to deficiency of niacin, a B-complex vitamin. Pellagra is the ""disease of the four D's"" -- Pellagra is now rare in developed countries which enjoy balanced diets and fortified foods, but it was once a huge public health problem in the US. Three million Americans contracted pellagra and 100,000 died of it from 1906-40. Pellagra was especially a problem for the poor in the South whose meals usually consisted of the ""three M's"": meat (pork fatback); molasses; and meal (cornmeal). Today pellagra continues to be a problem in developing countries where there is significant malnutrition or where niacin-deficient foods such as corn and rice are the primary sources of nutrition. The puzzle of pellagra was solved by Dr. Joseph Goldberger. Dr. Goldberger was assigned in 1914 by the US Public Health Service to the South to deal with pellagra. After inspecting Southern orphanages, mental hospitals and prisons, Goldberger made the pivotal observation that the malnourished inmates of those institutions often developed pellagra while the better-fed staff did not. Pellagra, he deduced, did not arise from germs, as was commonly believed, but rather from a nutritional deficiency. To prove this, Dr. Goldberger, his assistants and even his wife engaged in experiments called ""filth parties."" They injected themselves with blood or ingested the scabs, feces and body fluids of patients. None developed pellagra. He also did decisive experiments with Mississippi prison inmates (who ""volunteered"" in return for a full pardon). Dr. Goldberger fed them a poor diet that he believed caused pellagra and within months, many developed the disease. He then added meat, fresh vegetables and milk to their diet and reversed all of the signs and symptoms of pellagra. Dr. Goldberger never identified the dietary principle that had this extraordinary effect. He died in 1929 (of kidney cancer). Eight years later, the factor was found to be niacin. This discovery was made in 1937 at the University of Wisconsin. Niacin is abundant in red meat, fish, poultry, and green leafy vegetables. Niacin can prevent pellagra (and can cure it). The name ""pellagra"" comes from the Italian ""pelle"", skin + ""agra"", rough = rough skin, referring to the skin problems in pellagra."
Pelvic,"Pelvic: Having to do with the pelvis, the lower part of the abdomen, located between the hip bones."
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Ascending infection of the female upper genital tract (the female structures above the cervix). PID is the most common and serious complication of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), aside from AIDS, among women. The signs and symptoms of PID include fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, extreme pain, including pain during intercourse, and vaginal bleeding. PID can scar the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and related structures and lead to ectopic pregnancies, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and other serious consequences. The infectious microorganisms in PID migrate upward from the urethra and cervix into the upper genital tract. Many different organisms can cause PID, but most cases are associated with gonorrhea and genital chlamydial infections, two very common STDs. The gonococcus (Neisseria gonorrhea), which causes gonorrhea, probably travels up into the fallopian tubes, where it causes sloughing (casting off) of some cells and invades others. It multiplies within and beneath these cells. The infection then spreads to other organs, resulting in more inflammation and scarring. The presence of a cervical mucus plug normally helps prevent the spread of microorganisms to the upper genital tract, but it is less effective during ovulation and menses. The gonococcus may gain access more easily during menses, if menstrual blood flows backward from the uterus into the fallopian tubes, carrying the organisms with it. This may explain why symptoms of PID caused by gonorrhea often begin immediately after menstruation as opposed to any other time during the menstrual cycle. Women with STDs are at greater risk of developing PID. A prior episode of PID increases the risk because the body's defenses are often damaged during the initial bout of upper genital tract infection. Sexually active teenagers are more likely to develop PID than are older women. The more sexual partners a woman has, the greater is her risk of developing PID. Women who douche once or twice a month may also be more likely to have PID. Douching may push the microorganisms up into the upper genital tract and it may also ease the discharge, masking the infection, so the woman delays seeking health care. The diagnosis of PID can be difficult to make. If symptoms such as lower abdominal pain are present, a physical exam may be done to determine its location, check for abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge and for evidence of cervical chlamydial infection or gonorrhea. Other tests, such as a sonogram, endometrial biopsy, or laparoscopy may be used to distinguish between PID and other serious problems that may mimic PID. Because cultures of specimens from the upper genital tract are difficult to obtain and because multiple organisms may be responsible for an episode of PID, the treatment is to prescribe at least two antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of infectious agents. The symptoms may go away before the infection is cured. Even if symptoms do go away, the woman should finish taking all of the medicine. Women should be re-evaluated by their physicians two to three days after treatment is begun to be sure the antibiotics are working to cure the infection. About a quarter of women with suspected PID must be hospitalized. This may be necessary if the patient is severely ill; if she cannot take oral medication and needs intravenous antibiotics; if she is pregnant or is an adolescent; if the diagnosis is uncertain and may include an abdominal emergency such as appendicitis; or if she has HIV. The sexual partners of women with PID often have no symptoms, although they may be infected. They should therefore be treated even if they do not have symptoms to prevent reinfection and another bout of PID. If used correctly and consistently, latex condoms prevent transmission of gonorrhea and partially protect against chlamydial infection."
Pelvic pain,"Pelvic pain: : Pain perceived in the area of the pelvis, the lower part of the abdomen located between the hip bones. The term pelvic pain is most commonly used to refer to pain arising from reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina) in women. Pelvic pain can have numerous causes, including menstrual cramps; pain from a rupture of an ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst, or other mass; endometriosis; and pelvic inflammatory disease. Nongynecologic pelvic pain sources can include urinary tract infections, intestinal obstruction, colitis, tumors, appendicitis, or other conditions."
Pelvis,"Pelvis: The lower part of the abdomen, located between the hip bones. Structures in the female pelvis include the uterus, vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and rectum. Structures in the male pelvis include the bladder, rectum, prostate, testicles, and penis."
Penicillin,"Penicillin: The most famous of all antibiotics, named for the fungal mold Penicillium notatum from which it is derived. Penicillin acts by destroying the cell wall of bacteria. Penicillin is active against a number of types of bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Clostridium, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus. Most staphylococci now are resistant to penicillin. Today, manyderivatives of penicillin are available which act on more types of bacteria than penicillin itself. The name ""penicillium"" was taken from the Latin ""penicillum"" meaning ""a painter's brush"" because the fronds of the fungus were thought to look like a painter's brush. For information about the pharmacology of penicillin, see Penicillin V, See also: Penicillin history."
Penile,Penile: Of or pertaining to the penis.
Penis,"Penis: The external male sex organ. The penis contains two chambers, the corpora cavernosa, which run the length of the organ. These chambers are filled with spongy tissue and surrounded by a membrane called the tunica albuginea. The spongy tissue contains smooth muscles, fibrous tissues, spaces, veins, and arteries. The urethra, which is the channel for urine and ejaculate, runs along the underside of the corpora cavernosa. The urethra emerges at the glans, the rounded tip of the penis."
the,"Penis, erection of the: The state of the penis when it is filled with blood and becomes rigid. The penis contains two chambers called the corpora cavernosa, which run the length of the organ, are filled with spongy tissue, and are surrounded by a membrane called the tunica albuginea. The spongy tissue contains smooth muscles, fibrous tissues, spaces, veins, and arteries. The urethra, which is the channel for urine and ejaculate, runs along the underside of the corpora cavernosa. Erection begins with sensory and mental stimulation. Impulses from the brain and local nerves cause the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, allowing blood to flow in and fill the open spaces. The blood creates pressure in the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand. The tunica albuginea helps to trap the blood in the corpora cavernosa, thereby sustaining erection. Erection is reversed when muscles in the penis contract, stopping the inflow of blood and opening outflow channels."
"Penis, small","Penis, small: A penis that is abnormally small, also known as micropenis. In medical practice, the dimension of the penis that is measured is the length. This measurement is taken along the upper surface of the shaft of the penis to the tip, using a measuring tape or preferably a ruler. The ruler is pressed firmly into the soft tissue over the pubic bone (the symphysis pubis) since, in obese boys and men, a seemingly small penis may be partly engulfed by the fat pad at its base and actually be quite normal in length. Normal standards are available for penile length. True micropenis reflects failure of normal development (a birth defect) of the penis or failure of normal hormonal stimulation of the penis."
PEP,"PEP: The abbreviation PEP stands for a number of things in medicine including post-exposure prophylaxis. Prophylaxis means a defense or protection. Post-exposure prophylaxis, for example, might concern the treatment of a health care worker exposed by a needle stick to HIV with a drug such as AZT to protect them from being infected with HIV."
Peptic ulcer,"Peptic ulcer: An ulcer in the lining of the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus. Peptic ulcers affect millions of people in the US yearly. Ulcer formation is related to Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomach, use of anti-inflammatory medications, and cigarette smoking. Peptic ulcer pain may not correlate with the presence or severity of ulceration. Complications of peptic ulcers include bleeding, perforation, and blockage of the stomach (gastric obstruction). Diagnosis is made via barium X-ray or endoscopy. Treatment involves use of antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori, elimination of risk factors, and prevention of complications."
Peptide,"Peptide: A molecule consisting of 2 or more amino acids. Peptides are smaller than proteins, which are also chains of amino acids. Molecules small enough to be synthesized from the constituent amino acids are, by convention, called peptides rather than proteins. The dividing line is at about 50 amino acids. Depending on the number of amino acids, peptides are called dipeptides, tripeptides, tetrapeptides, and so on."
Percentile,"Percentile: The percentage of individuals in a group who have achieved a certain quantity'such as height, weight, or head circumference'or a developmental milestone. For example, the fiftieth percentile for walking well is 12 months of age."
Percutaneous,"Percutaneous: Through the skin. For example, a percutaneous biopsy is a biopsy that is obtained by putting a needle through the skin in order to obtain tissue within the body for examination."
Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL),Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL): A technique for removing large and/or dense stones and staghorn kidney stones. PNL is done via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm (about 3/8 inch) in diameter. There is no surgical incision. PNL is done under anesthesia and real-time live x-ray control (fluoroscopy).
Perforated Bowel,"Perforated bowel: This is a break, or hole, in the wall of the large intestine (bowel). A perforated bowel is a surgical emergency that requires urgent treatment, because with a perforation, the contents of the bowel can spill into the abdominal cavity. This can cause life-threatening infection of the abdominal cavity.  There are many causes of a perforated bowel, including infection, inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, trauma, diverticulitis, and ischemic colitis. Ruptured bowel is another term to describe perforated bowel."
Perfusion,"Perfusion: The passage of fluid through the circulatory system (blood stream) or lymphatic system to an organ or a tissue, usually referring to the delivery of blood to an area"
Peri-,"Peri-: Prefix meaning around or about, as in pericardial (around the heart) and periaortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes around the aorta)."
Perianal,"Perianal: Located around the anus, the opening of the rectum to the outside of the body."
Periappendiceal,Periappendiceal: Near the appendix. Perforation of the appendix can lead to a periappendiceal abscess (a collection of pus near the appendix).
Pericardial,"Pericardial: Referring to the pericardium, the sac of fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart."
Pericardium,"Pericardium: The conical sac of fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great blood vessels. The pericardium's outer coat (the parietal pericardium) is tough and thickened, loosely cloaks the heart, and is attached to the central part of the diaphragm and the back of the breastbone. Its inner coat (the visceral pericardium or epicardium) is double, with one layer closely adherent to the heart and the other lining the inner surface of the outer coat. The intervening space between these layers is filled with pericardial fluid. This small amount of fluid acts as a lubricant to allow normal heart movement within the chest. Also known as the pericardial sac. See also: Pericarditis."
Perinatal,"Perinatal: Pertaining to the period immediately before and after birth. The perinatal period is defined in diverse ways. Depending on the definition, it starts at the 20th to 28th week of gestation and ends 1 to 4 weeks after birth."
Perinatal transmission,"Perinatal transmission: Transmission of a disease-causing agent (a pathogen) from mother to baby during the perinatal period, the period immediately before and after birth. The perinatal period is defined in diverse ways. Depending on the definition, it starts at the 20th to 28th week of gestation and ends 1 to 4 weeks after birth. The perinatally transmitted pathogen might, for example, be HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus) and transmission might occur across the placenta or in the breast milk. Also called vertical transmission."
Perinatologist,"Perinatologist: An obstetrical subspecialist concerned with the care of the mother and fetus at higher-than-normal risk for complications. Since the perinatal period, depending on the definition, starts at the 20th to 28th week of gestation and ends 1 to 4 weeks after birth, a perinatologist logically could be a obstetrician or pediatrician but, in practice, a perinatologist is an obstetrician. The comparable area of pediatrics is neonatology. A high-risk baby might be cared for by a perinatologist before birth and by a neonatologist after birth. The word ""perinatologist"" is a linguistic sandwich of the Greek ""peri-"" meaning ""around or about"", ""natal"" from the Latin ""natus"" meaning ""born"" and ""ologist"" from the Greek ""logos"" meaning ""student of."""
Perineum,Perineum: The area between the anus and the scrotum in the male and between the anus and the vulva (the labial opening to the vagina) in the female. An episiotomy is a surgical procedure to widen the outlet of the birth canal to facilitate delivery of the baby and avoid a jagged rip of the perineum.
Periodic abstinence,"Periodic abstinence: Also known as fertility awareness, natural family planning, and the rhythm method, this approach entails not having sexual intercourse on the days of a woman's menstrual cycle when she could become pregnant or using a barrier method (such as a condom, the diaphragm or a cervical cap) for birth control on those days. Because a sperm may live in the female's reproductive tract for up to 7 days and the egg remains fertile for about 24 hours, a woman can get pregnant within a substantial window of time -- from 7 days before ovulation to 3 days after. Methods to approximate when a woman is fertile are usually based on the menstrual cycle, changes in cervical mucus, or changes in body temperature. This approach to birth control will likely fail and the woman to become pregnant."
Periodic breathing,"Periodic breathing: Clusters of breaths separated by intervals of apnea (no breathing) or near-apnea. As opposed to normal breathing which is usually regular. Periodic breathing was originally thought to arise from serious neurologic or cardiovascular disease and therefore to carry a poor outlook. It is now known that periodic breathing also tends to occur during sleep, it can occur in healthy persons, and the apnea in periodic breathing is usually central (without respiratory movements) rather than obstructive (caused by upper-airway blockage). Periodic breathing during sleep occurs typically in patients with congestive heart failure."
Periodontal disease,"Periodontal disease: A bacterial infection that destroys the attachment fibers and supporting bones that hold the teeth in the mouth. Left untreated, periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss. The main cause of periodontal disease is bacterial plaque, a sticky, colorless film that constantly forms on teeth."
Periodontitis,"Periodontitis: Gum disease. The word ""periodontitis"" literally means ""inflammation around the tooth."" Periodontitis and all periodontal diseases are bacterial infections that destroy the attachment fibers and supporting bone that hold the teeth in the mouth. Left untreated, these diseases can lead to tooth loss. The main cause of periodontal disease is a bacterial plaque, a sticky, colorless film that constantly forms on teeth. Periodontics is the branch of dentistry concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases affecting the gums and supporting structures of the teeth. Periodontists are also expert in the placement and maintenance of dental implants. Periodontics is one of the 8 dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association."
Perionychium,"Perionychium: The tissue surrounding the nail, whether it be a fingernail or a toenail, including the tissue bordering the root and sides of the nail. The word is composed of ""peri-"" meaning around or surrounding + the Greek word ""onyx"" for nail = around the nail."
Perioperative,"Perioperative: Literally, around (the time of) surgery. More specifically, the period of time extending from when the patient goes into the hospital, clinic, or doctor's office for surgery until the time the patient is discharged home."
Peripheral,"Peripheral: Situated away from the center, as opposed to centrally located. For example, peripheral vision means the type of vision that allows one to see objects that are not in the center of one's visual field. The word ""peripheral"" comes from the Greek ""peripheria"" (""peri-"", around or about + ""pherein"", to bear, carry). An IV (intravenous) catheter is a peripheral line."
Peripheral nervous system,"Peripheral nervous system: The portion of the nervous system that is outside the brain and spinal cord. Abbreviated PNS. The nerves in the PNS connect the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs, such as the eye and ear, and to other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels, and glands. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and the autonomic nerves. The autonomic nerves are concerned with automatic functions of the body, specifically with the regulation of the heart muscle, the tiny muscles that line the walls of blood vessels, and glands."
Peripheral neuropathy,"Peripheral neuropathy: A problem with the functioning of the nerves outside the spinal cord. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include numbness, weakness, burning pain (especially at night), and loss of reflexes."
Peripheral vascular disease,"Peripheral vascular disease: A disease of blood vessels outside the heart. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) affects the peripheral circulation, as opposed to the cardiac circulation. PVD comprises diseases of both peripheral arteries and peripheral veins. PVD is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Intermittent claudication due to inadequate blood flow to the leg is an example of peripheral artery disease (PAD) while varicose veins and spider veins are examples of peripheral vein disease. See: Peripheral artery disease; Varicose Veins & Spider Veins."
Peripheral vision,"Peripheral vision: Side vision. The ability to see objects and movement outside of the direct line of vision. Peripheral vision is the work of the rods, nerve cells located largely outside the macula (the center) of the retina. The rods are also responsible for night vision and low-light vision but are insensitive to color. As opposed to central vision."
Peristalsis,"Peristalsis: The rippling motion of muscles in the digestive tract. In the stomach, this motion mixes food with gastric juices, turning it into a thin liquid."
Peritoneal,Peritoneal: Having to do with the peritoneum.
Peritoneal dialysis,"Peritoneal dialysis: A dialysis technique that uses the patient's own body tissues inside the abdominal cavity as a filter. A plastic tube called a dialysis catheter is surgically placed through the abdominal wall, into the abdominal cavity. A special fluid is then flushed into the abdominal cavity and washed around the intestines. The intestinal walls act as a filter between this fluid and the bloodstream. By using different types of solutions, waste products and excess water can be removed from the body. This form of dialysis can be done either 'manually or by machine at home, thereby avoiding hospitalization or receiving dialysis treatment at a dialysis center."
Peritoneum,Peritoneum: The membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers most of the abdominal organs.
Pernicious anemia,"Pernicious anemia: Low red blood cell count caused by inadequate vitamin B12. Abbreviated PA. Patients with PA do not produce intrinsic factor (IF), a substance that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12 from foods. The resulting inadequacy of vitamin B12 hampers the production of red blood cells. PA can be treated by injection of vitamin B12: oral administration will not work because people with PA cannot absorb orally administered vitamin B12. Also known as Addison's anemia."
Personality disorder,"Personality disorder: A disorder characterized by the chronic use of mechanisms of coping in an inappropriate, stereotyped, and maladaptive manner. Personality disorders are enduring and persistent styles of behavior and thought, not atypical episodes. The personality disorders encompass a group of behavioral disorders that are different and distinct from the psychotic and neurotic disorders. The official psychiatric manual, the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition), defines a personality disorder as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that differs markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. Personality disorders are a long-standing and maladaptive pattern of perceiving and responding to other people and to stressful circumstances. Ten personality disorders, grouped into 3 clusters, are defined in the DSM-IV: See also: Multiple personality disorder; Passive-aggressive personality disorder; and Schizotypal personality disorder."
Pertussis,"Pertussis: Pertussis, also known as ""whooping cough,"" is a highly contagious, acute respiratory illness characterized by fits of coughing and caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Whooping cough, a communicable, potentially deadly illness characterized by fits of coughing followed by a noisy, ""whooping"" indrawn breath. It is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The illness is most likely to affect young children, but sometimes appears in teenagers and adults, even those who have been previously immunized. Immunization with DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccine provides protection, although that immunity may wear off with age. In adolescents or adults with history of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity, classic manifestations may or may not occur. The only symptom may be prolonged cough. During the early phase of pertussis, antibiotic treatment may decrease the duration and severity of cough, but, among adolescents and adults, the diagnosis is rarely established during this phase. Antibiotic treatment later in the course of disease probably does not affect the course of symptoms, but may be useful to reduce the spread of the infection. Treatment is usually supportive therapy. See also: DPT immunization, DTaP immunization."
Pes,Pes: Latin word meaning foot.
Pestilence,"Pestilence: The pestilence referred to the bubonic plague and it now refers to any epidemic disease that is highly contagious, infectious, virulent and devastating. The plague was a highly contagious, infectious, virulent, and devastating disease due to bacteria called Yersinia pestis which mainly infects rats and other rodents that serve as the prime reservoir for the bacteria. Fleas function as the prime vectors carrying the bacteria from one species to another. The fleas bite the rodents infected with Y. pestis and then they bite people and so transmit the disease to them. Transmission of the plague to people can also occur from eating infected animals such as squirrels (for example, in the southeastern U.S.) Once someone has the plague, they can transmit it to another person via aerosol droplets. The word ""pestilence"" comes from ""pestis,"" the Latin word for ""plague."" During the period of 1348-1350, the ""Black Death"" was responsible for the deaths of at least 1/3 the population of Europe. Because the plague was responsible for so many deaths, the plague and death have long been linked in literature. The 14th- century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer spoke of ""pestilence"" in ""The Pardoner's Tale"": ""Ther cam a privee theef men clepeth Deeth, / That in this contree al the peple sleeth, / And with his spere he smoot his herte atwo, / And wente his wey withouten wordes mo. / He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence."" ""La Peste"" (The Plague), a novel by the Nobel Prize-winning 20th- century French writer Albert Camus, is set in the Algerian city of Oran overrun by a deadly epidemic of the plague."
Petechiae,"Petechiae: Pinpoint flat round red spots under the skin surface caused by intradermal hemorrhage (bleeding into the skin). Petechiae are red because they contain red blood that has leaked from the capillaries into the skin. Petechiae are quite tiny (less than 3 millimeters in diameter) and do not blanch when pressed upon. There are many conditions in which petechiae may be seen. These conditions range from very minor to very major. The common causes of petechiae include local injury and trauma, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, viral infections that impair blood coagulation (clotting), thrombocythemia (an abnormally low platelet level), certain medical treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), leukemia and other bone marrow malignancies that may lower the number of platelets, and sepsis (bloodstream infection). Petechiae are commonly seen right after birth in the newborn and after violent vomiting or coughing. Drugs such as the anticoagulants warfarin (Coumadin) or heparin, aspirin, and cortisone can also cause petechiae."
Petit mal,"Petit mal: A form of epilepsy with very brief, unannounced lapses in consciousness. A petit mal seizure involves a brief loss of awareness, which can be accompanied by blinking or mouth twitching. Petit mal seizures have a very characteristic appearance on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Petit mal (little illness in French) seizures are also known as absence seizures. Petit mal seizures take the form of a staring spell: the person suddenly seems to be ""absent."""
pH,"pH: A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a fluid. The pH of any fluid is the measure of its hydrogen ion (H+) concentration relative to that of a given standard solution. The pH may range from 0 to 14, where 0 is most acid, 14 most basic, and 7 is neutral. Mathematically, the pH is the logarithm (to the base 10) of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+]. The pH is approximately equal to the negative logarithm of the H+ ion concentration expressed in molarity. See also: Blood pH; Urine pH."
Ph.D.,"Ph.D.: Doctor of Philosophy. (From the New Latin, philosophize doctor). Ph.D.'s are involved in clinical care (as in clinical psychology), biomedical research, health administration and other areas in medicine."
Phago-,"Phago-: Eating, devouring. From the Greek ""phago"" meaning ""to eat."" Examples of words starting with phago- include: phagocyte, a cell that can engulf particles; and phagophobia, an excessive fear of eating."
Phagocyte,"Phagocyte: A cell that can engulf particles, such as bacteria and other microorganisms or foreign matter. The principal phagocytes include the neutrophils and monocytes, both of which are types of white blood cells."
Phagocytosis,"Phagocytosis: The process by which a cell engulfs particles such as bacteria, other microorganisms, aged red blood cells, foreign matter, etc. The principal phagocytes include the neutrophils and monocytes (types of white blood cells). The prefix ""phago-"" comes from the Greek ""phago"" meaning ""to eat."""
Phalanges,"Phalanges: The bones of the fingers and of the toes. There are generally three phalanges (distal, middle, proximal) for each digit except the thumbs and large toes. The singular of phalanges is phalanx."
Phalanx,"Phalanx: Anatomically, any one of the bones in the fingers or toes. (Plural: phalanges.) There are 3 phalanges (the proximal, middle, and distal phalanx) in most of the fingers and toes. However, the thumb and large toe have only two phalanges that accounts for their being shorter. A ""phalanx"" in ancient Greece was a military formation composed of heavily armed troops in close deep ranks. The soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder, several rows deep, often with their shields joined. A phalanx was a formidable group that was difficult to penetrate. The bones in the fingers and toes were first called ""phalanges"" by the Greek philosopher-scientist Aristotle (384-322 BC) because they are arranged in ranks suggesting the military formation."
Pharmacist,"Pharmacist: A professional who fills prescriptions and, in the case of a compounding pharmacist, makes them. Pharmacists are very familiar with medication ingredients, interactions, and cautions."
Pharmacologist,Pharmacologist: A specialist in the science of medications. A pharmacologist is usually especially knowledgeable about new and obscure medications that may be needed for hard-to-treat or rare illnesses and about drug interactions and how to prevent them. Pharmacologists usually act as consultants to primary care physicians or specialists.
Pharmacology,"Pharmacology: The study of drugs, their sources, their nature, and their properties. Pharmacology is the study of the body's reaction to drugs. It emerged as a major area in American medicine largely due to the efforts of John Jacob Abel (1857- 1938) who stressed the importance of chemistry in medicine, did research on the endocrine glands, first isolated epinephrine (adrenaline), crystallized insulin (1926), and became the first pharmacology professor in the U.S."
Pharmacopoeia,"Pharmacopoeia: An official authoritative listing of drugs. Aspirin has, for example, long been in the pharmacopoeia. By extension, a pharmacopoeia is a collection or stock of drugs."
Pharyngitis,Pharyngitis: Inflammation of the pharynx. Pharyngitis is a common cause of sore throat.
Pharynx,Pharynx: The hollow tube that is about 5 inches long and starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus. The pharynx serves as a vestibule or entryway for the trachea and esophagus.
Phe,Phe: Phenylalanine.
Phenothiazine,"Phenothiazine: One of a group of tranquilizing drugs with antipsychotic actions thought to act by blocking dopaminergic transmission (messages sent using the substance dopamine) within the brain. Examples of phenothiazines include: chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine), fluphenazine (Duraclon), mesoridazine (Serentil), perphenazine (Etrafon and Trilafon), prochlorperazine (Compazine), promazine (Robinul and Anectine), thioridazine (Mellaril), trifluoperazine (Stelazine) and triflupromazine (Robinul)."
Phenylalanine,"Phenylalanine: An essential amino acid. (The human body cannot make it so it is essential to the diet.) Phenylalanine that is ingested is largely transformed (hydroxylated) to form the amino acid tyrosine, which is used in protein synthesis. Too little phenylalanine curbs physical and intellectual growth. Too much phenylalanine, as in phenylketonuria (PKU), is highly toxic to the brain. Phenylanine was first isolated in 1879 and first synthesized in 1882. Symbol: Phe. See also Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency; Phenylketonuria (PKU); Maternal phenylketonuria."
Phenylketonuria,"Phenylketonuria: The inherited inability to metabolize (process) the essential amino acid phenylalanine due to complete or near-complete deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Newborns are screened for phenylketonuria (PKU) by a blood test, usually with the Guthrie card bloodspot obtained from a heelprick. Treatment is with a special diet low in phenylalanine. The goal is to normalize the levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine in the blood to prevent brain damage. Failure of treatment results in profound irreversible mental retardation, microcephaly (an abnormally small head), epilepsy, and behavior problems. It is clear that if the diet is not followed closely, especially during childhood, some impairment is inevitable. Maternal phenylketonuria requires a diet low in phenylalanine. Phenylketonuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, as are lesser degrees of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Phenylketonuria is abbreviated and commonly referred to as PKU."
Pheochromocytoma,"Pheochromocytoma is a type of neuroendocrine tumor (from chromaffin cells in adrenal glands) that results in the irregular secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Symptoms include hypertension, palpitations, and headaches. Most pheochromocytomas are benign; malignant pheochromocytomas are rare. Beta blockers and/or antihypertensive medications reduce symptoms. Another common treatment is surgery (tumor and/or adrenal gland removal)."
Pheresis,"Pheresis: Procedure in which the blood is filtered, separated, and a portion retained, with the remainder being returned to the individual. There are various types of pheresis. In leukapheresis, the leukocytes (white blood cells) are removed. In plateletpheresis, the thrombocytes (blood platelets) are removed. And in plasmapheresis, the liquid part of the blood (the plasma) is removed. From the Greek ""aphairesis"" meaning withdrawal."
Phlebitis,"Phlebitis: Inflammation of a vein. With phlebitis, there is infiltration of the walls of the vein and, usually, the formation of a clot (thrombus) in the vein (thrombophlebitis). Phlebitis in a leg, for example, causes the leg to swell with fluid (edema). Phlebitis can be superficial and not very serious, or it can be deep and carry the potential for dislodging blood clots to the lungs."
Phlebo- (prefix),"Phlebo- (prefix): Means vein. From the Greek ""phleps"", vein, which came from the root ""phlein"", to gush or overflow. Appears in phlebitis (inflammation of the veins), phlebotomist (a person who draws blood from veins), and phlebotomy (a venipuncture)."
Phlebotomy,"Phlebotomy: Obtaining blood from a vein. In the old days, this was done by incising (cutting) a vein and just letting the blood flow into a container. Today phlebotomy is done more neatly by puncturing a vein with a needle. Phlebotomy may be done in order to obtain blood for diagnostic tests or to remove blood for treatment purposes (eg, to relieve the iron overload in hemochromatosis)."
Photosensitivity,"Photosensitivity: Oversensitivity of skin to light. Photosensitivity can be a side effect of medications or result from diseases, such as lupus. Treatment depends on the severity of the reaction and the cause. Photosensitivity can be prevented by avoiding skin exposure to ultraviolet light."
Phototherapy,"Phototherapy: Treatment with light. For example, a newborn with jaundice may be put under special lights to help reduce the amount of bilirubin pigment in the skin."
PHS,"PHS:The Public Health Service, the agency responsible for the public health of the American people. The Public Health Service (PHS) administers a number of critically important health agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Founding: In 1798, Congress established the U. S. Marine Hospital Service -- the predecessor of today's U.S. Public Health Service -- to provide health care to sick and injured merchant seamen. In 1870, the Marine Hospital Service was reorganized as a national hospital system with centralized administration under a medical officer, the Supervising Surgeon, who was later given the title of Surgeon General. The Surgeon General: Dr. John Woodworth was appointed as the first Supervising Surgeon in 1871. Woodward established a cadre of medical personnel to administer the Marine Hospital System. On January 4, 1889, the Congress recognized this new personnel system by formally authorizing the Commissioned Corps. The Corps was established along military lines to be a mobile force of professionals subject to reassignment to meet the needs of the Service. Originally, the Corps was composed only of physicians. However, over the years, as the functional responsibilities of the PHS and the Corps have broadened, a broad range of health professionals has been included in the PHS. Reorganization: Before 1968, the Surgeon General was the head of the PHS, and all program, administrative, and financial management authorities flowed through the Surgeon General, who reported directly to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1968, the Secretary delegated line responsibility for the PHS to the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Office of the Surgeon General was abolished and the position of Surgeon General became that of a principal deputy to the Assistant Secretary for Health with responsibility for advising and assisting on professional medical matters. In addition, a primary role developed in which the Surgeon General became the PHS spokesperson on certain health issues. In 1987, the Office of the Surgeon General (OSG) was reestablished as a staff office within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. Concomitant with this action, the Surgeon General again became responsible for management of the Commissioned Corps personnel system. In carrying out all responsibilities, the Surgeon General reports to the Assistant Secretary for Health, who is the principal advisor to the Secretary on public health and scientific issues. Current Status: There currently are more than 6,100 officers on active duty. Officers are assigned to all of the PHS Agencies and to a number of agencies outside of PHS, including the Bureau of Prisons, U. S. Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency, Health Care Financing Administration, and the Commission on Mental Health of the District of Columbia."
Phthisis,"Phthisis: A good trivia or crossword item. An over-consonanted Greek word meaning ""a dwindling or wasting away."" Pronounced TIE-sis. Phthisis is an archaic name for tuberculosis. A person afflicted with tuberculosis in the old days was destined to dwindle and waste away like Mimi, the heroine of Puccini's 1896 opera ""La Boheme."" Nephronophthisis is derived from ""nephron"" + ""phthisis."" The nephron is the fundamental functional unit in the kidney and includes the renal tubule and glomerulus. In nephronophthisis the kidney is progressively destroyed."
Physical child abuse,"Physical child abuse: Next to child neglect, physical abuse is the second most frequently reported form of child abuse, accounting for 25% of all cases of child abuse. Physical child abuse is physical injury inflicted upon the child with cruel and/or malicious intent. Physical abuse can be the result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, burning, shaking, or otherwise harming a child physically. The parent or caretaker who abused the child may not have intended to hurt the child, but rather the child's injury may have resulted from overly harsh discipline or physical punishment. There is, in this regard, a substantial debate going on about certain forms physical discipline such as spanking and slapping and their relationship to more orthodox forms of physical abuse."
Physical therapy,"Physical therapy: A branch of rehabilitative health that uses specially designed exercises and equipment to help patients regain or improve their physical abilities. Abbreviated PT. PT is appropriate for many types of patients, from infants born with musculoskeletal birth defects, to adults suffering from sciatica or the after effects of injury or surgery, to elderly poststroke patients."
Physician,"Physician: A person who is trained in the art of healing. In the UK, a physician is a specialist in internal or general medicine, whereas in the US a physician is any doctor of medicine. The term generally refers to a person who has earned a Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathy (DO), or Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree and who is accepted as a practitioner of medicine under the laws of the state, province, and/or nation in which he or she practices."
Physician assistant (PA),"Physician assistant (PA): A physician assistant (PA) is a mid-level medical practitioner who works under the supervision of a licensed doctor (an MD) or osteopathic physician (a DO). The physician assistant came about in the 1960s as a response to the need for more clinicians and better access to health care. The first PA program was developed by Dr. Eugene Stead, chairman of the Department of Medicine at Duke University, to train PAs for rural areas with dwindling numbers of physicians and nurses. Today the term ""physician assistant"" has a more precise definition as it applies to the mid-level practitioner who is able to practice medicine under the auspices of a licensed physician. Although the physician need not be present during the time the PA performs his or her duties, there must be a method of contact between the supervising physician and the PA at all times. The PA must be competent in the duties he or she is performing and the physician for whom the PA is working must also be licensed and trained to perform the relevant duties. Examples of the duties of a general PA include: PAs can practice in virtually all medical and surgical specialties, provided they are properly trained and supervised. Thus, PAs can assist in surgeries. A PA must have at least a bachelor's degree. Although there is not yet a requirement to hold a degree beyond the bachelor's level, the current trend is for PAs to have a master's degree. PA training programs are accredited by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. Each state in the U.S. has its own specific licensing and practicing restrictions for PAs. Most states require PAs to pass the certification examination of the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants."
Physicians' Desk Reference,"Physicians' Desk Reference: A thick volume that provides a guide to prescription drugs available in the United States. Although not exactly recommended fare for bedtime reading, the PDR is the most commonly used drug reference. The information is the same as the leaflet in the drug package, also known as the package insert. Drug companies pay to have their drug included, so many generic medicines will not be in the book. Abbreviated PDR."
Physiologic,"Physiologic: Something that is normal, that is due neither to anything pathologic nor significant in terms of causing illness. For example, physiologic jaundice is jaundice that is within normal limits."
the newborn,Physiologic jaundice of the newborn: Yellowish staining of the skin and whites of the newborn's eyes (sclerae) by pigment of bile (bilirubin). In newborn babies a degree of jaundice is normal. It is due to the breakdown of red blood cells (which release bilirubin into the blood) and to the immaturity of the newborn's liver (which cannot effectively metabolize the bilirubin and prepare it for excretion into the urine). Normal physiologic jaundice of the newborn typically appears between the 2nd and 5th days of life and clears with time. Physiologic jaundice of the newborn is also referred to as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and neonatal jaundice.
Physiology,"Physiology: The study of how living organisms function, including such processes as nutrition, movement, and reproduction."
PI,"PI: In medicine, not a private investigator but a principal investigator, the person who directs a research project or program."
Pia mater,"Pia mater: One of the meninges, the pia mater is the delicate innermost membrane enveloping the brain and spinal cord. It is known informally as the pia."
Pica,"Pica: A craving for something that is not normally regarded as nutritive, such as dirt, clay, paper, or chalk. Pica is a classic clue to iron deficiency in children, and it may also occur with zinc deficiency. Pica is also seen as a symptom in several neurobiological disorders, including autism and Tourette's syndrome, and it is sometimes seen during 'pregnancy."
Pigmentation,"Pigmentation: The coloring of the skin, hair, mucous membranes, and retina of the eye. Pigmentation is due to the deposition of the pigment melanin, which is produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. Other pigment-related terms include hyperpigmentation (too much pigment), hypopigmentation and underpigmentation (too little pigment), and depigmentation (loss of pigment)."
Pill,"Pill: In pharmacy, a medicinal substance in a small round or oval mass meant to be swallowed. Pills often contain a filler and a plastic substance such as lactose that permits the pill to be rolled by hand or machine into the desired form. The pill may then be coated with a varnishlike substance. The word pill is a shortened version of the French pilule, a pill. Originally from the Latin pila, a ball."
Piloerection,"Piloerection: Erection of the hair of the skin due to contraction of the tiny arrectores pilorum muscles that elevate the hair follicles above the rest of the skin and move the hair vertically, so the hair seems to 'stand on end.'"
Pisa syndrome,Pisa syndrome: A condition in which there is sustained involuntary flexion of the body and head to one side and slight rotation of the trunk so the person appears to lean like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The Pisa syndrome is an adverse effect (a side-effect) of some medications. It occurs sometimes following the long-term use of narcoleptics (drugs used to treat schizophrenia) or cholinesterase inhibitors (a class of drugs used to treat Alzheimer disease).
Pitting edema,"Pitting edema: Observable swelling of body tissues due to fluid accumulation that may be demonstrated by applying pressure to the swollen area (such as by depressing the skin with a finger). If the pressing causes an indentation that persists for some time after the release of the pressure, the edema is referred to as pitting edema. Any form of pressure, such as from the elastic in socks, can induce pitting with this type of edema. Edema can be caused by either systemic diseases (diseases affecting multiple organ systems) or by local conditions involving just the affected extremities. In systemic diseases that cause edema, the fluid accumulation is primarily due to the body's retention of too much salt (sodium chloride), causing the body to retain water. Picture of Pitting Edema "
Pituitary,"Pituitary: 1. As an adjective, pertaining to the pituitary gland or its hormonal secretions. 2. As a noun, the pituitary gland itself. "
Pituitary gland,"Pituitary gland: The main endocrine gland. It is a small structure in the head. It is called the master gland because it produces hormones that control other glands and many body functions including growth. The pituitary consists of the anterior and posterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary is the front portion of the pituitary. Hormones secreted by it influence growth, sexual development, skin pigmentation, thyroid function, and adrenocortical function. These influences are exerted through the effects of pituitary hormones on other endocrine glands except for growth hormone which acts directly on cells. The effects of underfunction of the anterior pituitary include growth retardation (dwarfism) in childhood and a decrease in all other endocrine gland functions normally under the control of the anterior pituitary (except the parathyroid glands). The results of overfunction of the anterior pituitary include overgrowth (gigantism) in children and a condition called acromegaly in adults. The posterior pituitary is the back portion of the pituitary. It secretes the hormone oxytocin which increases uterine contractions and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which increases reabsorption of water by the tubules of the kidney. Underproduction of ADH results in a disorder called diabetes insipidus characterized by inability to concentrate the urine and, consequently, excess urination leading potentially to dehydration. The urine is ""insipid"" (overly dilute). "
Placebo,"Placebo: A ""sugar pill"" or any dummy medication or treatment. For example, in a controlled clinical trial, one group may be given a real medication while another group is given a placebo that looks just like it in order to learn if the differences observed are due to the medication or to the power of suggestion. Placebos are widely used in drug trials."
Placenta,"Placenta: A temporary organ that joins the mother and fetus, transferring oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus and permitting the release of carbon dioxide and waste products from the fetus. The placenta is roughly disk-shaped, and at full term it measures about 7 inches in diameter and slightly less than 2 inches thick. The upper surface of the placenta is smooth, and the under surface is rough. The placenta is rich in blood vessels. The placenta is expelled with the fetal membranes during the birth process; together, these structures form the afterbirth."
"Placenta, succenturiate","Placenta, succenturiate: An extra placenta separate from the main placenta. In anatomy ""succenturiate"" means accessory to an organ. In this case, a succenturiate placenta is an accessory placenta."
Plan B,"Plan B: Brand name for a progestin-only emergency contraceptive designed to prevent pregnancy within 72 hours after a contraceptive accident or unprotected sex. However, early treatment is significantly more effective. Each 12 hours of delay in the start of treatment after intercourse generally reduces efficacy by 50%. Levonorgestrel, the active ingredient, is believed to act principally by interfering with the process of ovulation. It may also interfere with fertilization or implantation. It is not effective once implantation has begun. It is not an abortifacient. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, and menstrual changes."
Plant thorn arthritis,"Plant thorn arthritis: a type of joint inflammation that results from plant matter within the joint from a thorn puncture. Plant thorn arthritis is a noninfectious cause of arthritis that is typically seen in just one joint (monoarthritis). The diagnosis of plant thorn arthritis is made by detection of a piece of thorn within the joint by imaging tests or surgical removal and identification of the thorn fragments. The involved joint may be swollen, painful, reddened, stiff, and may have a reduced range of motion. A surgical procedure known as a synovectomy with joint lavage (joint washout cleaning) is the treatment for plant thorn arthritis. Also known as: plant thorn synovitis"
Plantar,Plantar: Having to do with the sole of the foot.
Plantar response,"Plantar response: The plantar response, also known as the Babinski response, is an important neurologic examination based upon what the toes do when the sole (the plantar surface) of the foot is stroked. If the big toe goes up, that may well mean trouble. The plantar response is obtained by stimulating the external portion (the outside) of the sole. The examiner begins the stimulation back at the heel and goes forward to the base of the toes. There are diverse ways to elicit the plantar response . A useful way that requires no special equipment is with firm pressure from the examiner's thumb. Just stroke the sole firmly with the thumb from back to front along the outside edge. Too vigorous stimulation may cause withdrawal of the foot or toe, which can be mistaken as a plantar response . Most newborn babies show a plantar response, a reflection of their immature nervous system. Upon stimulation of the sole, they extend the great toe. Many young infants do this, too, and it is perfectly normal. However, in time during infancy the plantar response vanishes and, under normal circumstances, should never return. A plantar response in an older child or adult is abnormal. It is a sign of a problem in the central nervous system (CNS), most likely in a part of the CNS called the pyramidal tract. Asymmetry of the plantar response -- when it is present on one side but not the other -- is abnormal. It is a sign not merely of trouble but helps to lateralize that trouble (tell which side of the CNS is involved). The plantar response is known by a number of other names including the toe or big toe sign or phenomenon and the Babinski reflex, phenomenon or sign. It is wrong to say that the plantar response is positive or negative; it is present or absent."
Plaque,"Plaque:1. An semi-hardened accumulation of substances from fluids that bathe an area. Examples include dental plaque and cholesterol plaque. 2. In dermatology, a plaque is a patch of a small area of skin that appears different than the surrounding skin and is usually raised."
Plaque psoriasis,"Plaque psoriasis: The most common form of psoriasis -- about 80% of people with psoriasis have this type. Plaque psoriasis can appear on any skin surface, although the knees, elbows, scalp, and trunk and are the most common locations. It is characterized by well-defined plaques of red raised skin. The flaky silvery white buildup on top of the plaques is called scale; it is composed of dead skin cells. This scale comes loose and sheds constantly from the plaques. Skin symptoms include pain, itching and cracking. The technical name for plaque psoriasis is psoriasis vulgaris (vulgaris means common)."
Plasma,"Plasma: The liquid part of the blood and lymphatic fluid, which makes up about half of the volume of blood. Plasma is devoid of cells and, unlike serum, has not clotted. Blood plasma contains antibodies and other proteins. It is taken from donors and made into medications for a variety of blood-related conditions."
Plasma osmolarity,"Plasma osmolarity: The osmolarity of blood plasma, which is a measure of the hydration status. The plasma osmolarity is sensitive to changes in hydration status during dehydration and rehydration. The normal plasma osmolarity is in the range of 280-300 mOs/kg. This may vary somewhat from laboratory to laboratory."
Plasmodium,"Plasmodium: The genus of the class of Sporazoa that includes the parasite that causes malaria. Plasmodium is a type of protozoa, a single-celled organism that is able to divide only within a host cell. The main types of Plasmodium are P. falciparum, the species that causes falciparum malaria, the most dangerous type of malaria; P. malariae, the species that causes quartan malaria; P. ovale, a species found primarily in east and central Africa that causes ovale malaria; and P. vivax, the species that causes vivax malaria, which tends to be milder than falciparum malaria."
Platelet,"Platelet: An irregular, disc-shaped element in the blood that assists in blood clotting. During normal blood clotting, the platelets clump together (aggregate). Although platelets are often classed as blood cells, they are actually fragments of large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes."
Platelet aggregation,Platelet aggregation: The clumping together of platelets in the blood. Platelet aggregation is part of the sequence of events leading to the formation of a thrombus (clot).
Platelet count,"Platelet count: The calculated number of platelets in a volume of blood, usually expressed as platelets per cubic millimeter (cmm) of whole blood. Platelets are the smallest cell-like structures in the blood and are important for blood clotting and plugging damaged blood vessels. Platelet counts are usually done by laboratory machines that also count other blood elements such as the white and red cells. They can also be counted by use of a microscope. Normal platelet counts are in the range of 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (or 150 - 400 x 109 per liter). These values many vary slightly between different laboratories."
plegia,"plegia: Suffix meaning paralysis or a stroke. As in cardioplegia (paralysis of the heart), hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body), paraplegia (paralysis of the legs), and quadriplegia (paralysis of all four extremities). From the Greek plege meaning a blow or stroke."
Pleiotropic cytokine,"Pleiotropic cytokine: cytokine that affects the activity of multiple cell types. A cytokine is a small protein that has a specific effect on the interactions between cells, on communications between cells, or on the behavior of cells."
Pleomorphic,"Pleomorphic: Many-formed. For example, a pleomorphic tumor would be a growth that is composed of different types of tissues. Also known as protean."
Plethoric,"Plethoric: Florid, red-faced. Persons with polycythemia vera commonly have a plethoric facial appearance."
Pleura,"Pleura: One of the two membranes around the lungs. These two membranes are called the visceral and parietal pleurae. The visceral pleura envelops the lung, and the parietal pleura lines the inner chest wall. There is normally a small quantity (about 3 to 4 teaspoons) of fluid that is spread thinly between the visceral and parietal pleurae. The pleural fluid acts as a lubricant between the two membranes."
Pleural,"Pleural: Pertaining to the pleura, the thin covering that protects the lungs. The term ""pleural"" is pronounced like ""plural"" (but does not have plural meanings)."
Pleuritis,"Pleuritis: Inflammation of the pleura which may be caused by infection, injury or tumor. When the pleura becomes inflamed, it can produce more than the normal amount of fluid, causing a pleural effusion."
Plexus,"Plexus: 1. In medicine, a network or tangle of lymphatic vessels, nerves, or veins. For example, the brachial plexus is a network of nerves leading to the arm. In general, any interwoven entity made up of elements in a structure or system."
PLP,PLP: See: Proteolipid protein.
Plummer-Vinson syndrome,"Plummer-Vinson syndrome: Iron deficiency anemia, esophageal webs, and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). The iron deficiency is typically chronic and severe. It triggers the growth of web-like membranes in the throat which cause dysphagia. The syndrome is more common in women. Treatment is iron supplementation and, if need be, dilation of the web to permit normal swallowing and the passage of food. Named after American internist Henry S. Plummer (1874-1937) and surgeon Porter P Vinson (1890-1959). Also known as sideropenic dysphagia and, in the UK, as Paterson-Kelly syndrome."
PMD,PMD: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
PMDD,PMDD: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
PML,"PML: Stands for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a rapidly progressive, often fatal viral infection of the brain. Commonly abbreviated as PML. PML is believed to be due to the Jacob-Creutzfeldt (JC) papovavirus. The virus infects oligodendrocytes (support cells in the brain). The signs and symptoms of PML include headaches, memory loss, changes in mental status, speech and vision difficulties, loss of strength, limb weakness, seizures, partial paralysis and loss of coordination. The disease leads to coma and then to death."
PMR (polymyalgia rheumatica),"PMR (polymyalgia rheumatica): A disorder of the muscles and joints of older persons characterized by pain and stiffness, affecting both sides of the body, and involving the shoulders, arms, neck, and buttock areas."
Pneumo-,"Pneumo-: Prefix pertaining to breathing, respiration, the lungs, pneumonia, or air."
Pneumocystis,"Pneumocystis: Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously classified as Pneumocystis carinii), the organism that causes pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Pneumocystis jiroveci is found worldwide, in humans and animals. Serologic evidence indicates that most healthy children have been exposed to it by age 3 to 4. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) occurs in immunosuppressed individuals and in premature, malnourished infants. The symptoms of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), nonproductive cough, and fever. Chest X-rays show infiltrates in both lungs. Typically, in untreated PCP, increasing pulmonary involvement leads to death. There is considerable debate over the classification of Pneumocystis. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of Pneumocystis jiroveci in induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) material (washings of the respiratory tree). In situations where these two techniques cannot be used, transbronchial biopsy or open lung biopsy may prove necessary. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies can identify the organisms with higher sensitivity than conventional microscopy. Treatment is with medication."
Pneumocystis carinii,Pneumocystis carinii: Now called Pneumocystis jiroveci. See: Pneumocystis.
Pneumocystis pneumonia,Pneumocystis: See: Pneumocystis.
Pneumocyte,"Pneumocyte: One of the cells lining the alveoli (the air sacs) in the lung. The alveoli are, in fact, lined with two types of cells termed the type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes:"
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia: Inflammation of one or both lungs, with dense areas of lung inflammation. Pneumonia is frequently but not always due to infection. The infection may be bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic. Symptoms may include fever, chills, cough with sputum production, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is suggested by the symptoms and confirmed by chest X-ray testing. Treatment includes antibiotics."
"Pneumonia, bilateral","Pneumonia, bilateral: Pneumonia in both lungs (right and left). Also known as double pneumonia."
PNS (peripheral nervous system),"PNS (peripheral nervous system): That portion of the nervous system that is outside the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two major divisions of the nervous system. The other is the central nervous system (CNS) which is made up of the brain and spinal cord. The nerves in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connect the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear), other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels and glands. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and what are called the autonomic nerves. The autonomic nerves are concerned with automatic functions of the body. Specifically, autonomic nerves are involved with the regulation of the heart muscle, the tiny muscles lining the walls of blood vessels, and glands. ""Peripheral"" in anatomy and medicine (as elsewhere) is the opposite of ""central."" It means situated away from the center. The word ""peripheral"" comes from the Greek ""peripheria"" (""peri-"", around or about + ""pherein"", to bear, carry). An IV (intravenous) catheter is a peripheral line."
Poison,"Poison: Any substance that can cause severe organ damage or death if ingested, breathed in, injected into the body or absorbed through the skin. Many substances that normally cause no problems, including water and most vitamins, can be poisonous if taken in excessive quantity. Poison treatment depends on the 'substance."
Poisoning,"Poisoning: Taking a substance that is injurious to health or can cause death. Poisoning is still a major hazard to children, despite child-resistant (and sometimes adult-resistant) packaging and dose-limits per container. See also poison, Poison Control Centers."
Polio,"Polio: Abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an acute and sometimes devastating disease caused by a virus. Man is the only natural host for polio virus. The virus enters the mouth and multiplies in lymphoid tissues in the throat and intestine. Small numbers of virus enter the blood and go to other sites where the virus multiplies more extensively. Another round of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) leads to invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), the spinal cord and brain, the target sites struck by the virus. In polio, there is inflammation of the central nervous system, especially the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and the brainstem (the portion of the brain between the cerebral hemispheres and spinal cord). Polio can be a minor illness, as it is in 80-90% of clinical infections, chiefly in young children, and not involve the CNS. Symptoms are slight fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, and vomiting 3-5 days after exposure. Recovery occurs in 24-72 hours. This is termed the abortive type of polio. As a major illness, polio may or may not be paralytic. Symptoms usually appear without prior illness, particularly in older children and adults, 7-14 days after exposure. Symptoms are fever, severe headache, stiff neck and back, deep muscle pain, and sometimes areas of hyperesthesia (increased sensation) and paresthesia (altered sensation). There may be no further progression from this picture of viral meningitis (""aseptic"" meningitis) or there be loss of tendon reflexes and weakness or paralysis of muscle groups. Recovery is complete in the abortive and nonparalytic forms of polio. In paralytic polio, about 50% of patients recover with no residual paralysis, about 25% are left with mild disabilities, and the remaining patients have severe permanent disability. The greatest return of muscle function occurs in the first 6 months, but improvement may continue for up to 2 years. Physical therapy is the most important part of treatment of paralytic polio during convalescence. The ideal strategy with polio is clearly to prevent it by immunization against poliovirus. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) had polio and worked with the National Foundation/March of Dimes to raise money to combat this once-fearsome scourge. Polio(myelitis) is also called infantile paralysis."

Physical therapy is the most important part of treatment of paralytic polio during convalescence. The ideal strategy with polio is clearly to prevent it by immunization against poliovirus. The global polio elimination program through vaccination has been very successful, with polio occurring only in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia and Kenya as of June 2013. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) had polio and worked with the National Foundation/March of Dimes to raise money to combat this once-fearsome scourge. Polio (myelitis) is also called infantile paralysis."
Poly-,"Poly-: 1: Prefix meaning much or many. For example, polycystic means characterized by many cysts. 2: Short form for polymorphonuclear leukocyte, a type of white blood cell."
Polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome: Abbreviated PCOS. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a condition in women characterized by irregular or no menstrual periods, acne, obesity, and excess hair growth. PCOS is a disorder of chronically abnormal ovarian function and hyperandrogenism (abnormally elevated androgen levels). It affects 5%-10% of women of reproductive age. PCOS is also called the Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Women with PCOS do not ovulate -- they do not release an egg every month -- and they are at significantly higher risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer of the uterus (endometrial cancer). Much of this risk can be reversed by exercise and weight loss. Medication is generally prescribed to induce regular periods, thereby reducing the risk of uterine cancer. For acne and excess hair growth, the diuretic spironolactone (Aldactazide) can help. And for women who desire pregnancy, clomiphene (Clomid) can be used to induce ovulation. Studies have indicated that diabetic medications that are designed to improve the action of the hormone insulin may benefit women with PCOS. Long-term trials of these insulin-sensitizing drugs -- such as Avandia (rosiglitazone), Actos (pioglitazone), and Glucophage (metformin) -- for PCOS are underway. The results appear promising. A type of surgery called a ""wedge resection"" in which a piece of the ovary is removed also helps some women with PCOS. The cause of PCOS is unknown. However, the ovaries of women with the disease characteristically contain a large number of small cysts. Hence, the name polycystic ovary. Other common names are polycystic ovary disease, polycystic ovary disease, and POD. "

Polycythemia,"Polycythemia: Too many red blood cells. The opposite of anemia. polycythemia formally exists when the hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, and total RBC volume are all above normal."
Polycythemia vera (PV),"Polycythemia vera (PV): Overproduction (proliferation) of red blood cells due to bone marrow disease (myeloproferative disorder). Polycythemia vera tends to evolve into acute leukemia or a condition with the marrow replaced by scar tissue (myelofibrosis). To have Polycythemia vera, there must be polycythemia which formally exists when the hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, and total RBC volume are all above normal. For example, the hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells in whole blood), normal range is from about 42 to about 52% in adult males and from about 37 to about 48% in adult females. The hematocrit in polycythemia is significantly above 52% in men and above 48% in females. In 40 to 60% of cases there are elevations of white blood count and platelet count. B12 level is usually elevated as well."
Polydactyly,"Polydactyly: More than the normal number of fingers or toes. From the Greek ""polys"" (many) + ""dactylos"" (finger) = many fingers or, medically, too many fingers. Polydactyly is the opposite of oligodactyly (too few fingers or toes)."
Polydipsia,"Polydipsia: Constant, excessive drinking as a result of thirst. Polydipsia occurs in untreated or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus."
Polygenic disease,"Polygenic disease: A genetic disorder that is caused by the combined action of more than one gene. Examples of polygenic conditions include hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Because such disorders depend on the simultaneous presence of several genes, they are not inherited as simply as are single-gene diseases."
Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA),"Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA): A genetic autoimmune disease with an extraordinary array of clinical features but characterized most often by at least 2 of the following 3 findings: hypoparathyroidism -- underfunction of the parathyroid glands which control calcium, candidiasis (yeast infection), and adrenal insufficiency (underfunction of the adrenal gland). PGA was the first systemic (bodywide) autoimmune disease found due to a defect in a single gene. By ""autoimmune"" is meant that the immune system (which normally wards off foreign invaders of the body) turns and attacks tissues such as skin, joints, liver, lungs, etc.) of the body. Examples of common systemic autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, Sjogren syndrome, scleroderma, Goodpasture syndrome, vitiligo, Addison disease, thyroiditis, and many others. In 1997 a novel gene was identified that mapped to chromosome region 21q22.3. The gene was named AIRE for autoimmune regulator. Changes in the AIRE gene are responsible for PGA. PGA is inherited as a recessive trait such that a child with the disease has received 2 changed (mutant) AIRE genes, one from each parent. Although PGA is generally rare, it is more frequent in 3 genetically isolated populations: the Finnish, Iranian Jews, and Sardinians. The child with PGA develops problems in numerous glands (polyglandular) including hypoparathyroidism, hypogonadism (with sex gland failure), adrenal insufficiency, type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes with insufficient insulin production by the pancreas gland, and latent hypothyroidism (underfunction of the thyroid gland). Other features of APS are total baldness (alopecia totalis), inflammation of the cornea and whites of the eye (keratoconjunctivitis), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the enamel of the teeth, childhood-onset moniliasis (yeast infection), juvenile-onset pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal problems (malabsorption, diarrhea), and chronic active hepatitis. The laboratory studies attest to an immune disease with an abnormally low level of gammaglobulin antibodies in blood (hypogammaglobulinemia) and an abnormally low T4/T8 white blood cell ratio (as in AIDS). There is specific evidence for autoimmunity with antibodies directed against the adrenal and thyroid glands and against cell nuclei (antiadrenal, antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies). The treatment of PGA is directed at treating the specific problems: replacing the various hormones that are in short supply, giving insulin for the diabetes, treating the yeast infections, etc. However, there is no known cure for PGA. The prognosis (outlook) depends on whether the critical hormone deficiencies are remedied and especially whether the infections can be successfully controlled. PGA goes by a confusing array of other names including the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome, hypoadrenocorticism with hypoparathyroidism and superficial moniliasis, and polyglandular deficiency syndrome."
Polymorphic,"Polymorphic: Pertaining to a polymorphism, a variation in the DNA that is too common to be due merely to new mutation. A polymorphism must have a frequency of at least 1% in the population. Examples of polymorphic genes include those for sickle cell disease, thalassemia and G6PD deficiency. These genes are widely believed to offer an advantage against malaria."

Polymorphonuclear leukocyte,Polymorphonuclear leukocyte: A type of white blood cell with a nucleus that is so deeply lobated or divided that the cell looks to have multiple nuclei. Informally called a poly.
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR),"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR): A disorder of the muscles and joints of older persons characterized by pain and stiffness, affecting both sides of the body, and involving the shoulders, arms, neck, and buttock areas."
"Polyneuritis, acute idiopathic","Polyneuritis, acute idiopathic: Also known as the Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder characterized by progressive symmetrical paralysis and loss of reflexes usually beginning in the legs with, in most cases, nearly complete or complete recovery. The Guillain-Barre syndrome is not associated with fever. There is paralysis involving more than one limb, most commonly the legs, and that paralysis is progressive. There is areflexia (loss of reflexes) or hyporeflexia (diminution of reflexes) in the legs and arms. Other conditions that may mimic the Guillain-Barre syndrome need to be ruled out. The Guillain-Barre syndrome is due to an immune response that results in the direct destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the peripheral nerves or the axon of the nerve itself. The syndrome sometimes follow triggering events, including vaccinations. Among the vaccines reportedly associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome are the swine influenza vaccine (in 1976-1977), the oral poliovirus vaccine, and tetanus toxoid. Aside from vaccinations, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and viral infections can trigger the Guillain-Barre syndrome."
Polyuria,"Polyuria: The excessive passage of urine (at least 2.5 liters per day for an adult) resulting in profuse urination and urinary frequency (the need to urinate frequently). Polyuria is a classic sign of diabetes mellitus that is under poor control or is not yet under treatment. Polyuria occurs in some other conditions such as: Certain drugs such as the mood stabilizer lithium (Lithobid, Eskalith) and the antibiotic demeclocycline (Declomycin) can also lead to polyuria."
PON,PON: The symbol for the enzyme called paraoxonase.
Poor circulation,"Poor circulation: An inadequacy of blood flow. Inadequate blood flow to a particular area of the body can result in too little oxygen being delivered to that area, a condition known as hypoxia. The term poor circulation may be used to refer to peripheral vascular disease (or peripheral arterial disease), a condition that develops when the arteries that supply blood to the internal organs, arms, and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of atherosclerosis."
Popliteal,"Popliteal: Referring to the back of the knee. For example, the popliteal fossa is the hollow behind the knee."
Porcine,"Porcine: Having to do with swine. From the Latin ""porcus"" meaning ""pig."" Historically, Porcine insulin is obtained from pig pancreas. A porcine skin graft is one in which pig skin is used, such as in surgical treatment of burns or other serious skin injuries."
Porphyria,"Porphyria: One of a variety of hereditary diseases that are characterized by abnormalities in the reactions needed for the production of heme, an essential substance for the body, resulting in increased formation and excretion of chemicals called porphyrins. Most porphyrias affect the skin or the nervous system. Attacks may range from mild to severe. Besides having abdominal and nerve pain, the patient may suffer rapid heartbeat, mania, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, breathing problems, hallucinations, and coma. Acute attacks are often precipitated by the use of certain drugs, such as barbiturates, sulphonamides, and birth control pills; alcohol use; hormonal changes during menstruation or pregnancy; dieting or fasting; and infections. One type of porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, may have affected members of the House of Hanover in England, including 'Mad' King George, who may have suffered attacks of porphyria instead of being 'mad.'"
Porphyria cutanea tarda,"Porphyria cutanea tarda: Literally, the late skin form of porphyria, a genetic photosensitive (light-sensitive) skin disease with onset in adult life with substances called uroporphyrins in the urine due to a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), an enzyme required for the synthesis of heme (part of hemoglobin, the pigment in red blood cells that carries oxygen). The hallmarks of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are blisters which become ulcerated in areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, especially on the face, ears and dorsum (back) of the hands. The affected areas of skin also tend to be fragile and show hyperpigmentation (excess pigment) and hypertrichosis (excess hair). Porphyria cutanea tarda, the most common form of porphyria, comes in two clinical familial and a sporadic form: Iron overload is frequently present in porphyria cutanea tarda and may be associated with varying degrees of damage of the liver. A severe form of porphyria cutanea tarda, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), has its onset in infancy with the accumulation of protoporphyrin in the red blood cells. The level of the enzyme UROD is very low in red cells. The UROD gene has been mapped to 1p34. Mutations have been identified in the UROD gene, including DNA base substitutions and deletions. These mutations result in reduced activity of the enzyme. Some mutation result in porphyria cutanea tarda and others in the recessively inherited HEP. HEP is the homozygous form of familial porphyria cutanea tarda. Treatment is directed first at reducing iron overload by regular phlebotomy (removal of blood). Then treatment with the drug hydroxychloroquine usually induces a sustained remission."
Positive-strand RNA virus,"Positive-strand RNA virus: Also known as a sense-strand RNA virus, a virus whose genetic information consists of a single strand of RNA that is the positive (or sense) strand which encodes mRNA (messenger RNA) and protein. Replication in positive-strand RNA viruses is via a negative-strand intermediate. Examples of positive-strand RNA viruses include polio virus, Coxsackie virus, and echovirus. There are two types of RNA viruses. Some are positive in that they have a ""sense"" strand of RNA (coded information about how to build proteins) as their genetic material. And other RNA viruses tare negative in that they have an ""antisense"" strand (the paired opposite of the coded information). Positive-strand or sense-strand RNA viruses are therefore as opposed to negative-strand or antisense-strand RNA viruses. See also: Negative-strand RNA virus."
Post,Post: Short for postmortem examination (an autopsy).
Post-traumatic stress disorder,"Post-traumatic stress disorder: A common anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Family members of victims also can develop the disorder. PTSD can occur in people of any age, including children and adolescents. More than twice as many women as men experience PTSD following exposure to trauma. Depression, alcohol or other substance abuse, or other anxiety disorders frequently co-occur with PTSD. The diagnosis of PTSD requires that one or more symptoms from each of the following categories be present for at least a month and that symptom or symptoms must seriously interfere with leading a normal life: Traumatic events that may trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat. Among those who may experience PTSD are troops who served in the Vietnam and Gulf Wars; rescue workers involved in the aftermath of disasters like the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.; survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing; survivors of accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes; immigrants fleeing violence in their countries; survivors of the 1994 California earthquake, the 1997 North and South Dakota floods, and hurricanes Hugo and Andrew; and people who witness traumatic events. Many people with PTSD repeatedly re-experience the ordeal in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts, especially when they are exposed to events or objects reminiscent of the trauma. Anniversaries of the event can also trigger symptoms. People with PTSD also experience emotional numbness and sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and irritability or outbursts of anger. Feelings of intense guilt are also common. Most people with PTSD try to avoid any reminders or thoughts of the ordeal. PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last more than 1 month. Physical symptoms such as headaches, gastrointestinal distress, immune system problems, dizziness, chest pain, or discomfort in other parts of the body are common in people with PTSD. Often, these symptoms may be treated without the recognition that they stem from an anxiety disorder. Treatment may be through cognitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, and/or exposure therapy, in which the person gradually and repeatedly re-lives the frightening experience under controlled conditions to help him or her work through the trauma. Several types of medication, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants, can also help relieve the symptoms of PTSD. Giving people an opportunity to talk about their experiences very soon after a catastrophic event may reduce some of the symptoms of PTSD. A study of 12,000 school children who lived through a hurricane in Hawaii found that those who got counseling early on were doing much better 2 years later than those who did not."
Posterior,"Posterior: The back or behind, as opposed to the anterior. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Posteroanterior,"Posteroanterior: From back to front. A chest x-ray taken with the chest against the film plate and the x-ray machine behind the patient is a posteroanterior (PA) view. As opposed to anteroposterior (AP). For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Postherpetic neuralgia,"Postherpetic neuralgia: The most common complication of shingles, persistence of the pain associated with shingles beyond 1 month, even after the rash is gone. The pain can be severe and debilitating, and it occurs primarily in persons over age 50. The pain of postherpetic neuralgia can be reduced by certain medications including tricyclic antidepressant medications and some antiseizure medications. Capsaicin cream, a derivative of hot chili peppers, or lidocaine patches can be applied on the area after all the blisters have healed, to reduce pain. Acupuncture and electric nerve stimulation through the skin can be helpful for some patients."
Posthitis,"Posthitis: Inflammation of the prepuce (the foreskin of the penis). In the uncircumcised male, posthitis and balanitis (inflammation of the glans, the rounded head of the penis) usually occur together as balanoposthitis: inflammation of both the glans and foreskin. Circumcision prevents balanoposthitis. Without a foreskin, there can of course be no posthitis and hence no balanoposthitis. An uncircumcised boy should be taught to clean his penis with care to prevent infection and inflammation of the foreskin. Cleaning of the penis is done by gently, not forcibly, retracting the foreskin. The foreskin should be retracted only to the point where resistance is met. Full retraction of the foreskin may not be possible until the age of 3 or more. The term ""posthitis"" (pronounced pos-THI-tis) comes from the Greek ""posthe"" meaning foreskin + ""-itis"" meaning inflammation = inflammation of the foreskin."
Postmenopausal,"Postmenopausal: After menopause, the period of time after a woman has experienced 12 consecutive months without menstruation."
Postop,Postop: Short for postoperative; after a surgical operation. The opposite of postop is preop.
Postoperative,"Postoperative: After surgery. As opposed to preoperative, before surgery."
Postoperative care,"Postoperative care: Care given after surgery until the patient is discharged from the hospital or surgicenter and, in some cases, continuing on an ambulatory basis. Postoperative care is aimed at meeting the patient's physical and psychological needs directly after surgery."
Postoperative hemorrhage,"Postoperative hemorrhage: Bleeding after a surgical procedure. The hemorrhage may occur immediately after the surgery or be delayed. It need not be restricted to the surgical wound. Common causes of postoperative hemorrhage are from tissues which cannot be entirely prevented from bleeding and depend on blood clotting to stop the hemorrhage, problems in the normal clotting mechanism of blood, and clips or ties around blood vessels becoming loose."
Postpartum,"Postpartum: The period just after delivery, as with postpartum depression. Postpartum refers to the mother, and postnatal to the baby."
Postprandial,Postprandial: After mealtime. A postprandial rise in the blood glucose level is one that occurs after eating.
Postural,"Postural: Pertaining to the posture or position of the body, the attitude or carriage of the body as a whole, or the position of the limbs (the arms and legs). Postural hypotension is a drop in blood pressure (hypotension) due to a change in body position (a change in posture). It occurs when a person, often an older person, moves to a more vertical position: from sitting to standing or from lying down to sitting or standing. The change in posture causes a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain, which leads to lightheadedness and, sometimes, a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. The root of the word ""posture"" is the Latin verb ""ponere"" meaning ""to put or place."" The past participle ""positus"" gave the noun ""positura"" that travelled via France to England in the 16th century as ""posture."""
Postural hypotension,"Postural hypotension: A drop in blood pressure (hypotension) due to a change in body position (posture) when a person moves to a more vertical position: from sitting to standing or from lying down to sitting or standing. Postural hypotension is more common in older people. The change in position causes a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness and, sometimes, a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. Tilt-table testing can be used to confirm postural hypotension. Tilt-table testing involves placing the patient on a table with a foot-support. The table is tilted upward and blood pressure and pulse is measured while symptoms are recorded in various positions. No treatment is needed for postural hypotension. If someone with postural hypotension faints, they will regain consciousness by simply sitting or lying down. The person is thereafter advised to exercise caution and slow the process of changing positions from lying to sitting to standing. This simple technique can allow the body to adjust to the new position and permit the nerves to circulation of the legs to adjust slower in older person. Postural hypotension is also called orthostatic hypotension."
Posture,"Posture: The carriage of the body as a whole, the attitude of the body, or the position of the limbs (the arms and legs). ""Postural"" pertains to the posture or position. For example, postural hypotension is a drop in blood pressure (hypotension) due to a change in body position (a change in posture) when a person moves to a more vertical position: from sitting to standing or from lying down to sitting or standing. The root of the word ""posture"" is the Latin verb ""ponere"" meaning ""to put or place."" The past participle ""positus"" gave the noun ""positura"" that travelled via France to England in the 16th century as ""posture."""
Potassium,"Potassium: The major positive ion (cation) found inside cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. An abnormal increase in potassium (hyperkalemia) or decrease in potassium (hypokalemia) can profoundly affect the nervous system and heart, and when extreme, can be fatal. The normal blood potassium level is 3.5'5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or 3.5 international units."
Pott's disease,"Pott's disease: An old term for tuberculosis of the spine that caused softening and collapse of the vertebrae, often resulting in kyphosis, a ""hunchback"" deformity, which was called ""Pott's curvature."" Named for the English surgeon Sir John Percivall Pott (1714-1788) who described it."
Douglas,Pouch of Douglas: An extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and the back wall of the uterus. Also known as the rectouterine pouch.
Poultice,"Poultice: A soft moist mass about the consistency of cooked porridge that is spread on cloth and applied warm to create moist local heat where applied. Poultices help by increasing blood flow, relaxes tense muscles, soothing inflamed tissues, or drawing toxins from an infected area. The word poultice derives from the Latin pulta and the Greek poltos, both meaning porridge. Also called a cataplasm."
Power outage food safety,"Power outage food safety: If the power is out for less than 2 hours, then the food in your refrigerator and freezer will be safe to consume. While the power is out, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to keep food cold for longer. If the power is out for longer than 2 hours, follow the guidelines below: Always keep meat, poultry, fish, and eggs refrigerated at or below 40 ?F and frozen food at or below 0 ?F. This may be difficult when the power is out. Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food safely cold for about 4 hours if it is unopened. A full freezer will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed. Obtain dry or block ice to keep your refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is going to be out for a prolonged period of time. Fifty pounds of dry ice should hold an 18-cubic foot full freezer for 2 days. Plan ahead and know where dry ice and block ice can be purchased. Be prepared for an emergency by having items on hand that don't require refrigeration and can be eaten cold or heated on the outdoor grill. Shelf-stable food, boxed or canned milk, water, and canned goods should be part of a planned emergency food supply. Make sure you have ready-to-use baby formula for infants and pet food. Remember to use these items and replace them from time to time. Be sure to keep a hand-held can opener for an emergency. Consider what you can do ahead of time to store your food safely in an emergency. If you live in a location that could be affected by a flood, plan your food storage on shelves that will be safely out of the way of contaminated water. Coolers are a great help for keeping food cold if the power will be out for more than 4 hours-have a couple on hand along with frozen gel packs. When your freezer is not full, keep items close together-this helps the food stay cold longer. Digital, dial, or instant-read food thermometers and appliance thermometers will help you know if the food is at safe temperatures. Keep appliance thermometers in the refrigerator and freezer at all times. When the power is out, an appliance thermometer will always indicate the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer no matter how long the power has been out. The refrigerator temperature should be 40 ?F or below; the freezer, 0 ?F or lower. If you're not sure a particular food is cold enough, take its temperature with a food thermometer."
PPD,PPD: 1. Postpartum depression. 2. Purified protein derivative (the PPD skin test for tuberculosis).
Prandial,"Prandial: Of or relating to a meal. Prandial pain is pain while eating. Although medical terms usually have a reasonably logical derivation, this is not the case with ""prandial."" It comes from the Latin ""prandium"" which meant ""a late breakfast or lunch."" ""Prandium"" was derived in turn from the Greek ""pro-"", before + ""endios"", midday. Now, however, ""prandial"" refers to any meal -- breakfast, lunch, supper or snack."
Pre-eclampsia,"Pre-eclampsia: A condition in pregnancy characterized by abrupt hypertension (a sharp rise in blood pressure), albuminuria (leakage of large amounts of the protein albumin into the urine) and edema (swelling) of the hands, feet, and face. Pre-eclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancy. It affects about 5% of pregnancies. It occurs in the third trimester (the last third) of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia occurs most frequently in first pregnancies. It is more common in women who have diabetes or who are carrying twins. Some women seem to have a strong tendency to develop the disease and suffer from pre-eclampsia with every pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is more common in daughters of women who have been affected; in many cases the disease tends to run in families. Pre-eclampsia can be a sign of serious problems. It may, for example, indicate that the placenta is detaching from the uterus. In some cases, untreated pre-eclampsia can progress to eclampsia, a life-threatening situation for both mother and fetus characterized by coma and seizures. Initial treatment is bed rest and sometimes medication. If that becomes ineffective, the induction of labor and delivery or a C-section may have to be considered. Pre-eclampsia always resolves after a short time when the baby is born. Pre-eclampsia is sometimes written preeclampsia. The old name for the condition was toxemia."
Precordial catch syndrome (PCS),"Precordial catch syndrome (PCS): This non-serious condition involves the nerves and can cause sharp or stabbing pain in the chest. It is most common in children and teens. The pain comes on suddenly, may last for a few minutes, and is usually located in the lower left chest. The exact cause of PCS is unknown, although it may involve an irritation of the nerves in the chest wall or the lining of the lung (pleura). There are no other symptoms, and the pain goes away on its own, usually after a few minutes. There are no long-term complications, and it does not cause heart or lung damage."
Precursor,"Precursor: Forerunner. That which precedes or is derived from an available source. The term ""precursor"" is applied to an inactive substance converted to an active one (such as an enzyme, vitamin, or hormone). The term ""precursor"" applies to any chemical that is transformed into another. From the Latin ""praecursor,"" composed of ""prae-"" (or pre-), before + ""curro"" to run = to run before."
Predispose,"Predispose: To make more likely or render susceptible. Smoking predisposes to a number of diseases, including esophageal cancer."
Preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia: A condition in pregnancy characterized by abrupt hypertension (a sharp rise in blood pressure), albuminuria (leakage of large amounts of the protein albumin into the urine) and edema (swelling) of the hands, feet, and face. Preeclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancy. It affects about 5% of pregnancies. It occurs in the third trimester (the last third) of pregnancy. Preeclampsia occurs most frequently in first pregnancies. It is more common in women who have diabetes or who are carrying twins.

Treatment is by bed rest and sometimes medication. If that treatment is ineffective, the induction of labor and delivery or a C-section may have to be considered. Preeclampsia always resolves a short time after the baby is born. Preeclampsia is sometimes written pre-eclampsia. Preeclampsia was referred to as toxemia or toxic pregnancy."
"Prefixes, medical","Prefixes, medical: Medical words are often put together, cobbled from two or more building blocks. Among these building blocks are the prefixes. Examples of prefixes used in medicine include:"
Pregnancy,"Pregnancy: The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the female body. This condition can be indicated by positive results on an over-the-counter urine test, and confirmed through a blood test, ultrasound, detection of fetal heartbeat, or an X-ray. Pregnancy lasts for about nine months, measured from the date of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP). It is conventionally divided into three trimesters, each roughly three months long. The most important tasks of basic fetal cell differentiation occur during the first trimester, so any harm done to the fetus during this period is most likely to result in miscarriage or serious disability. There is little to no chance that a first-trimester fetus can survive outside the womb, even with the best hospital care. Its systems are simply too undeveloped. This stage truly ends with the phenomenon of quickening: the mother's first perception of fetal movement. It is in the first trimester that some women experience ""morning sickness,"" a form of nausea on awaking that usually passes within an hour. The breasts also begin to prepare for nursing, and painful soreness from hardening milk glands may result. As the pregnancy progresses, the mother may experience many physical and emotional changes, ranging from increased moodiness to darkening of the skin in various areas. During the second trimester, the fetus undergoes a remarkable series of developments. Its physical parts become fully distinct and at least somewhat operational. With the best medical care, a second-trimester fetus born prematurely has at least some chance of survival, although developmental delays and other handicaps may emerge later. As the fetus grows in size, the mother's pregnant state will begin to be obvious. In the third trimester, the fetus enters the final stage of preparation for birth. It increases rapidly in weight, as does the mother. As the end of the pregnancy nears, there may be discomfort as the fetus moves into position in the woman's lower abdomen. Edema (swelling of the ankles), back pain, and balance problems are sometimes experienced during this time period. Most women are able to go about their usual activities until the very last days or weeks of pregnancy, including non-impact exercise and work. During the final days, some feel too much discomfort to continue at a full pace, although others report greatly increased energy just before the birth. Pregnancy ends when the birth process begins. See also acute fatty liver of pregnancy; ectopic pregnancy; fetal alcohol syndrome; fetal alcohol effect; hyperemesis gravidarum; preeclampsia; pregnancy, tubal; prenatal care; prenatal development; birth defect; teratogen."
Pregnant,"Pregnant: The state of carrying a developing fetus within the body. The word ""pregnant"" comes from the Latin pre- meaning before + (g)natus meaning birth = before (giving) birth. The word ""prenatal"" has exactly the same origin."
Premalignant,"Premalignant: Pertaining to tissue that is not yet malignant but is poised to become malignant. Appropriate clinical and laboratory studies are designed to detect premalignant tissue while it is still in a premalignant stage. A battery of techniques are available to remove or kill the tissue, thereby preventing the development of cancer. The proper treatment method depends on the particular premalignant tissue involved. Examples of premalignant growths include polyps in the colon, actinic keratosis of the skin, dysplasia of the cervix, metaplasia of the lung, and leukoplakia (white patches in the mouth)."
Premature baby,"Premature baby: A baby born before 37 weeks of gestation have passed. Historically, the definition of prematurity was 2500 grams (about 5 1/2 pounds) or less at birth. The current World Health Organization definition of prematurity is a baby born before 37 weeks of gestation, counting from the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (the LMP). Premature birth carries greater risks the earlier it occurs before that 37-week goal. A baby born a little prematurely may suffer few if any consequences. The earlier in fetal growth and development that birth takes place, the greater is the likelihood that life-support systems will be needed, and the greater the risk for birth defects and death. Many procedures are available to prevent early birth, from bed rest to medications. If premature birth is medically necessary or inevitable, however, it may be accomplished via C-section to limit stress on the fetus and protect it from damage. Colloquially, a premature baby is commonly called a preemie."
Premenstrual,Premenstrual: Just before the start of menstruation. As in a premenstrual headache.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: An unusually severe form of premenstrual syndrome characterized by drastic mood swings, anger, depression, irritability, tension, sleep and appetite changes, fatigue, and physical problems such as pain or bloating. Abbreviated PMDD. Symptoms generally begin the week before menstruation and end a few days after menstruation has begun. Treatment can involve the use of antidepressant medications of the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) type."
Premenstrual syndrome,"Premenstrual syndrome: A combination of physical and mood disturbances that occur in the last half of a woman's menstrual cycle after ovulation which normally end with the onset of the menstrual flow. Physical features of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) include breast tenderness and bloating. Psychological changes include anger and depression. Monthly chemical changes may be responsible for PMS. The chemical changes may involve sex hormones, neurotransmitters, and opioid peptides. PMS can be mimicked and must be distinguished from other disorders. The most helpful diagnostic tool for PMS is a menstrual diary. Treatment of PMS includes exercise, dietary changes, emotional support from family and friends, and medications. The medications for PMS include diuretics, pain killers, oral contraceptives, drugs that suppress ovarian function and antidepressants. Abbreviated PMS."
Premie,Premie: Short and slangy for a premature baby. A preterm infant. Also often spelled (for obscure reasons) preemie.
Prenatal,"Prenatal: Occurring or existing before birth. Prenatal care is the regular health care women should receive from an obstetrician or midwife during pregnancy. Prenatal development is the growth of a single-celled zygote formed by the combination of a sperm and an egg into a baby. Prenatal diagnosis is diagnosis before birth by techniques such as ultrasound, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and amniocente+D13sis. The word ""prenatal"" comes from the Latin ""pre-,"" before + ""(g)natus,"" birth = before birth. ""Antenatal"" is often used in lieu of ""prenatal"" in the UK, Australia, etc."
Prenatal development,"Prenatal development: The process of growth and development within the womb, in which a single-cell zygote (the cell formed by the combination of a sperm and an egg) becomes an embryo, a fetus, and then a baby. The first two weeks of development are concerned with simple cell multiplication. This tiny mass of cells then adheres to the inside wall of the uterus. The next three weeks see intense cell differentiation, as the cell mass divides into separate primitive systems. At the end of eight weeks, the embryo has taken on a roughly human shape, and is called a fetus. For the next twenty weeks the fetus' primitive circulatory, nervous, pulmonary, and other systems become more mature, and it begins to move its limbs. At 28 weeks, fat begins to accumulate under the skin, toenails and fingernails appear, and downy hair sprouts on the body and scalp. The fetus may open its eyes periodically. For the remaining weeks of development, the fetus continues to gain weight, and its internal systems reach full development."
Preop,Preop: Short for preoperative; before a surgical operation. The opposite of preop is postop.
Preoperative care,"Preoperative care: Care given before surgery when physical and psychological preparations are made for the operation, according to the individual needs of the patient. The preoperative period runs from the time the patient is admitted to the hospital or surgicenter to the time that the surgery begins."
Prepubertal,"Prepubertal: Before puberty, the period during which secondary sex characteristics start to develop and the capability for sexual reproduction is attained."
Prepuce,"Prepuce: The fold of skin that covers the head of the penis. Also known as the foreskin. Only about 1 in every 20 boys is born with a retractable foreskin. This reflects the fact that the histologic (tissue) development of the foreskin is usually not complete at birth. The foreskin is thus not fully separable from the glans in about 96% of newborn boys. By a year of 1 year, the foreskin can be retracted in 50% of boys and by 3 years, the foreskin can be retracted in 80% to 90% of uncircumcised boys."
Prescription,"Prescription: A physician's order for the preparation and administration of a drug or device for a patient. A prescription has several parts. They include the superscription or heading with the symbol ""R"" or ""Rx"", which stands for the word recipe (meaning, in Latin, to take); the inscription, which contains the names and quantities of the ingredients; the subscription or directions for compounding the drug; and the signature which is often preceded by the sign ""s"" standing for signa (Latin for mark), giving the directions to be marked on the container."
Prescription drug,"Prescription drug: A drug requiring a prescription, as opposed to an over-the-counter drug, which can be purchased without one."
Pressor,"Pressor: Causing a rise in blood pressure. A pressor base is a substance (chemically classified as a base) capable of raising the blood pressure. A pressor nerve is a nerve that, when stimulated, increases the blood pressure. A pressor reflex is a nerve reflex that constricts arterioles (small blood vessels) and thereby increases the blood pressure. A pressor substance is any substance that elevates arterial blood pressure. For example, prostacyclin (also known as prostaglandin PGI2) is a potent pressor agent. The word ""pressor"" comes from the French verb ""presser"" meaning ""to exert pressure"" or ""to squeeze."""
Pressure urticaria,"Pressure urticaria: An uncommon type of hives (urticaria) that occurs after the skin has been under pressure, often the feet after standing or the buttocks after sitting for a long time or areas where clothing is tight. The hives may begin hours after the pressure on the skin has ceased. The hives last 8 to 72 hours and may be painful, itchy, or burning. They may be accompanied by low fever, chills, fatigue, joint and muscle aches, and/or headaches. Triggers include pressure from using tools (such as a screwdriver or a hammer), clapping the hands, carrying a bag or suitcase, sexual intercourse, and the use of tampons. Antihistamines may not help. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral steroids may be used. The disease tends to be chronic and last for years. The cause is unknown."
Prevalence,"Prevalence: The proportion of individuals in a population having a disease or characteristic. Prevalence is a statistical concept referring to the number of cases of a disease that are present in a particular population at a given time, whereas incidence refers to the number of new cases that develop in a given period of time."
Priapism,"Priapism: Abnormally persistent erection of the penis in the absence of desire. Treatments include medications, anesthesia, and drainage of blood from the penis."
Primary,"Primary: First or foremost in time or development. The primary teeth (the baby teeth) are those that come first. Primary may also refer to symptoms or a disease to which others are secondary. A primary tumor is one that is at the original site at which it arose. For example, a primary brain tumor is one that arose in the brain as opposed to one that arose elsewhere and metastasized (spread) to the brain. The original tumor is sometimes called ""the primary."""
Primary immunodeficiency disease,"Primary immunodeficiency disease: A disorder caused by an inherited flaw in the immune system that increases the susceptibility to infections. Primary immunodeficiency diseases are unlike secondary or acquired immune deficiency diseases, which are caused by infectious, chemical or radiological agents. AIDS is a prototype of an acquired immune deficiency disease. It has been estimated that there are 100 different primary immunodeficiency diseases. All are genetic conditions in which specific cells of the immune system do not function properly. Clinical symptoms range from mild or nonexistent as in the case of selective IgA deficiency to severe symptoms as in the case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), commonly referred to as ""bubble-boy"" syndrome. Although the susceptibility to infections is a major consequence of the primary immunodeficiency diseases, they may cause other health problems as well, including allergies, asthma, swollen joints, digestive tract problems, growth problems or an enlarged liver and spleen. Many people with primary immune deficiency diseases require treatment which may include intravenous gamma globulin infusions, antibiotic therapies, or bone marrow transplantation. The primary immune deficiency disorders range in frequency. Some disorders such as selective IgA deficiency are quite common, occurring as often as 1/500 to 1/1000 individuals. Others disorders such as SCID are rare affecting perhaps one person per million. Approximately 25,000 to 50,000 Americans are severely affected by primary immune deficiency disorders."
Private mutation,"Private mutation: A rare gene mutation that is usually found only in a single family or a small population. A private mutation occurs and is passed to a few family members, but not to future generations."
Pro-,"Pro-: A combining form (from both Greek and Latin) with many meanings including ""before, in front of, preceding, on behalf of, in place of, and the same as."" Used as a word, pro of course means professional and, in medicine, it is short for prothrombin."
Probe,"Probe: 1: In surgery, a probe is a slender flexible rod with a blunt end used to explore, for example, an opening to see where it goes. 2: In molecular genetics, a probe is a labeled bit of DNA or RNA used to find its complementary sequence or locate a particular clone."
Probiotic,Probiotic: Usually a dairy food or diet supplement that contains live bacteria that may replace or add to the beneficial bacteria in the GI tract.
Probiotics,Probiotics: live microorganisms (usually bacteria) that are similar to beneficial microorganisms found in the human gut that are taken as dietary supplements or found in foods. Most probiotics are bacteria similar to those naturally found in the intestine. Common examples are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium . They may occur naturally in yogurts and certain fermented foods. Probiotics have been used as treatment for various gastrointestinal conditions including irritable bowel syndrome and traveler's diarrhea.
PROC,PROC: Protein C
Process,"Process: In anatomy, a projection from a structure. For example, the process of the mandible is the part of the lower jaw that projects forward."
Proclivity,"Proclivity: An inclination or a predisposition toward something, especially a strong inherent inclination toward something objectionable. For example, a patient might be said to have a proclivity toward alcohol."
Proctitis,"Proctitis: Inflammation of the rectum. Proctitis may be due to a considerable number of causes, including infectious agents and ulcerative colitis. Infectious proctitis is often due to agents such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, and herpes simplex virus, all of which can be acquired during anoreceptive intercourse. Proctitis is also a hallmark of ulcerative colitis, in which case it may be accompanied by intermittent rectal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea."
Prodrug,"Prodrug: A precursor (forerunner) of a drug. A prodrug must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. For example, sulfasalazine is a prodrug. It is not active in its ingested form. It has to be broken down by bacteria in the colon into two products -- 5-aminosalicylic acid (5ASA) and sulfapyridine -- before becoming active as a drug."
Progeny,"Progeny: The children and other descendants. For example one might say that the progeny of someone with a genetic (inherited) condition such as Huntington disease are themselves at risk for the disease. The word ""progeny"" is the progeny of the Latin verb ""progignere "" meaning ""to beget."""
Progeria,"Progeria is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age prematurely. The classic type of childhood progeria is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) or ""Benjamin Button"" disease, which is commonly referred to as progeria. It is characterized by dwarfism, baldness, pinched nose, small face and small jaw relative to the head size, delayed tooth formation, aged-looking skin, diminution of fat beneath the skin, stiff joints, and premature arteriosclerosis. Children with progeria syndrome usually appear normal at birth. However, within a year, their growth rate slows and their appearance begins to change and age prematurely. They often suffer from symptoms typically seen in elderly people, especially severe cardiovascular disease. Death occurs on average at age 13, usually from a heart attack or stroke. Progeria is due to a single-letter ""misspelling"" in a gene on chromosome 1 that codes for lamin A, a protein that is a key component of the membrane surrounding the cell's nucleus. Most children with classic progeria harbor exactly the same misspelling in the lamin A (LMNA) gene, a substitution of just a single DNA base -- a change from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) -- among the gene's 25,000 base pairs. In a few progeria patients, there may be a different single base substitution such as guanine (G) to adenine (A) just two bases upstream. In every instance, the parents are normal indicating that the misspelling is a new, or ""de novo,"" mutation in the child. The minute change in the LMNA gene changes the way in which the sequence is spliced by the cell's protein-making machinery. The end result is the production of an abnormal lamin A protein that is missing a stretch of 50 amino acids near one of its ends. Different mutations in other regions of the LMNA gene are responsible for a half-dozen other rare, genetic disorders. Those disorders are Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 2, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder type 2B1, the Dunnigan type of familial partial lipodystrophy, mandibuloacral dysplasia, and a familial form of dilated cardiomyopathy. There currently are no diagnostic tests or treatments for progeria which remains relentlessly progressive and fatal. Although Hutchinson (1886) and Guilford (1904) did describe the disorder, it was recorded that on ""March 19, 1754, died in Glamorganshire of mere old age and gradual decay of nature at 17 years and 2 months, Hopkins Hopkins, the little Welshman.... He never weighed more than 17 pounds but for three years past no more than 12."" The term ""progeria"" is derived from the Greek word for old age, ""geras."""
Progesterone,"Progesterone: A female hormone, the principal hormone that prepares the uterus to receive and sustain fertilized eggs."
Progestin,Progestin: Any one of a group of steroid hormones that have the effect of progesterone.
Prognosis,Prognosis: The forecast of the probable outcome or course of a disease; the patient's chance of 'recovery.
Progressive,"Progressive: Increasing in scope or severity, advancing, or going forward. For example, a disease that is progressive is worsening."
Proinflammatory,"Proinflammatory: Capable of promoting inflammation. For example, air pollution may have proinflammatory effects."
Prolactin,"Prolactin: A hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates lactation (milk production). It also has many other functions, including essential roles in the maintenance of the immune system. Abnormally high prolactin can delay puberty, interfere with ovulation in women, decrease libido in men, and decrease fertility. Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) may be due to a benign tumor in the pituitary gland called a prolactinoma."
Proliferative,"Proliferative: Growing and increasing in number rapidly. For example, the lymphoproliferative disorders are diseases in which there is malignant growth of lymphoid cells and of cells from the reticuloendothelial system (which take up and sequester inert particles). As another example, the myeloproliferative disorders are malignancies of certain bone marrow cells including those that give rise to the red blood cells, the granulocytes (types of white blood cells), and the platelets (crucial to blood clotting). ""Proliferative"" comes from the French who derived it from the Latin ""proles"" (offspring or descendants) + the combining form ""-fer"" (bearing). Cells that are proliferating are bearing offspring.</ p>"
Pronation,"Pronation: Rotation of the forearm and hand so that the palm is down (and the corresponding movement of the foot and leg with the sole down), as opposed to supination. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Prone,"Prone: With the front (or ventral) surface downward. To lie prone is to lie face downward. Prone is as opposed to supine. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Prophylactic,"Prophylactic: A preventive measure. The word comes from the Greek for ""an advance guard,"" an apt term for a measure taken to fend off a disease or another unwanted consequence. A prophylactic is a medication or a treatment designed and used to prevent a disease from occurring. For example, prophylactic antibiotics may be used after a bout of rheumatic fever to prevent the subsequent development of Sydenham's chorea. A prophylactic is also a drug or device, particularly a condom, for preventing pregnancy."
Prophylaxis,Prophylaxis: The prevention of disease.
Proprioception,"Proprioception: The ability to sense stimuli arising within the body regarding position, motion, and equilibrium. Even if a person is blindfolded, he or she knows through proprioception if an arm is above the head or hanging by the side of the body. The sense of proprioception is disturbed in many neurological disorders. It can sometimes be improved through the use of sensory integration therapy, a type of specialized occupational therapy."
Propylthiouracil (PTU),"Propylthiouracil (PTU): A drug that blocks the production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. PTU is used to treat hyperthyroidism, to reduce the excessive thyroid activity before surgery and to treat and maintain patients not having surgery."
Prostaglandin,"Prostaglandin: One of a number of hormone-like substances that participate in a wide range of body functions such as the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, control of blood pressure, and modulation of inflammation. Prostaglandins are derived from a chemical called arachidonic acid."
Prostaglandin E2,"Prostaglandin E2: One of the prostaglandins, a group of hormone-like substances that participate in a wide range of body functions such as the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, control of blood pressure, and modulation of inflammation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) is released by blood vessel walls in response to infection or inflammation that acts on the brain to induce fever. The enzyme mPGES-1 is involved in the production of PGE2 and is an important ""switch"" for activating the fever response."
Prostaglandin F2-alpha,"Prostaglandin F2-alpha: One of the prostaglandins, a group of hormone-like substances that participate in a wide range of body functions such as the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, control of blood pressure, and modulation of inflammation. Prostaglandin F2-alpha(PGF-2 alpha) is a stable prostaglandin that stimulates the contraction of uterine and bronchial smooth muscle and produces vasoconstriction (tightening) in some blood vessels. As a pharmaceutical, the generic name of PGF-2 alpha is dinoprost. It is used for the induction of abortion, for evacuation of the uterus after a missed abortion, and in the treatment of hydatidiform mole."
Prostate,"Prostate: A gland within the male reproductive system that is located just below the bladder. Chestnut shaped, the prostate surrounds the beginning of the urethra, the canal that empties the bladder. The prostate is actually not one but many glands, 30-50 in number, between which is abundant tissue containing many bundles of smooth muscle. The secretion of the prostate is a milky fluid that is discharged into the urethra at the time of the ejaculation of semen. The origin of the name ""prostate"" is quite curious. The word is from the Greek ""prostates"", to stand before. The anatomist Herophilus called it the prostate because, as he saw matters, it stands before the testes."
Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer: A malignant tumor of the prostate, the gland that produces some of the components of semen. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death of males in the US. It is often first detected as a hard nodule found during a routine rectal examination. The PSA blood test is a screening test for prostate cancer. Diagnosis of prostate cancer is established when cancer cells are identified in prostate tissue obtained via biopsy. In some patients, prostate cancer is life threatening. In many others, prostate cancer can exist for years without causing any health problems. Treatment options for prostate cancer include observation, radiation therapy, surgery, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy."
Prostate enlargement,"Prostate enlargement: Most prostatic enlargement is due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a problem that bothers men increasingly with advancing age. The process of BPH generally begins in a man's 30s, evolves very slowly and usually causes symptoms only after he has passed the half-century mark. In BPH the normal elements of the prostate gland grow in size and number. Their sheer bulk may compress the urethra which courses through the center of the prostate and impedes the flow of urine through the urethra from the bladder to the outside. The urethral compression leads to urine retention and the need for frequent urination. If severe enough, complete blockage can occur. BPH is very common. Half of all men over 50 develop symptoms of PBH, but only 10% need medical or surgical intervention. BPH is completely benign. It is not a precursor (a forerunner) to prostate cancer. Treatment of BPH is usually reserved for men with significant symptoms. Watchful waiting with medical monitoring once a year is appropriate for most men with BPH. The medical therapy of BPH includes medication. The prostate enlargement in BPH is directly dependent on dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the principal androgen hormone in the prostate, certain medication blocks the enzyme needed to make DHT and so lowers blood and tissue DHT levels and helps reduce the size of the prostate. Other medication belongs to a class of drugs called alpha-1 blockers which relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and the bladder neck. Relaxing these muscles helps relieve the urinary obstruction caused by the enlarged prostate."
Prostate gland,"Prostate gland: A gland in the male reproductive system that is located just below the bladder. It surrounds part of the urethra, the canal that empties the bladder. The prostate gland helps to control urination, and it forms part of the content of semen. Also known as simply the prostate."
Prostatodynia,"Prostatodynia: A type of inflammation of the prostate not due to bacterial infection and in which there are no objective findings, such as the presence of infection-fighting cells, in the urine of men who suffer from the disease. The prostate is a walnut-sized organ below the male bladder that surrounds the urethra and contributes fluid to the semen. Prostatodynia is typically a chronic, painful disease. The symptoms (including chills, fever, pain in the lower back and genital area, body aches, burning or painful urination, and the frequent and urgent need to urinate) characteristically go away and then come back without warning. The urine and fluid from the prostate reveal no evidence of a known infecting organism or of cells that the body usually produces to fight infection. Treatment is ineffective. Therapy with antibiotics and with drugs that relax the muscles of the prostate gland is often attempted and fails."
Prosthesis,"Prosthesis: An artificial replacement of a part of the body, such as a tooth, a facial bone, the palate, or a joint. A prosthesis may be removable, as in the case of most prosthetic legs or a prosthetic breast form used after mastectomy. Other types of prosthetic devices, such as artificial hips or teeth, are permanently implanted. With advances in medical science, a few experimental prostheses have been integrated with body tissues, including the nervous system. These highly advanced devices can respond to commands from the central nervous system, more closely approximating normal movement and utility than older prostheses."
Prosthetic,"Prosthetic: Referring to a prosthesis, an artificial substitute or replacement of a part of the body such as a tooth, eye, a facial bone, the palate, a hip, a knee or another joint, the leg, an arm, etc. A prosthesis is designed for functional or cosmetic reasons or both. Typical prostheses for joints are the hip, knee, elbow, ankle, and finger joints. Prosthetic implants can be parts of the joint such as a unilateral knee. Joint replacement and arthroplasty mean the same thing. A prosthesis may be removable, as in the case of most prosthetic legs or a prosthetic breast form used after mastectomy. A person who uses a removable prosthesis, for example, an artificial hand, may want to have more than one available for different types of tasks. Other types of prosthetic devices are permanently implanted, like an artificial hip, testicle or tooth. With advances in the biomedical sciences, a few experimental prostheses have been integrated with body tissues, including the nervous system. These highly advanced devices can respond to commands from the central nervous system, more closely approximating normal movement and utility. An auditory prosthesis is a device that substitutes for or enhances the ability to hear. It is more commonly called a hearing aide. The word ""prosthesis"" comes via New Latin from the Greek ""prostithenai"" meaning ""to add to, or to put in addition."" The plural of prosthesis is prostheses."
Protean,"Protean: Very variable; easily changing; or continually changing. Protean is not to be confused with protein (a member of a large group of chemicals necessary to and found in all living things). Protean refers to Proteus, the mythologic master of disguise. According to the ancient Greeks, Proteus was the shepherd who looked after Poseidon's sea creatures. Proteus had the gift of prophecy. Determined not to share his knowledge, he changed his shape to avoid attention. The only way to learn what he knew was to sneak up behind him during his nap and hold him (while he frantically changed from shape to shape) until he revealed what he knew. Protean means as mutable and adaptable as the mythological shepherd. For example, the ways in which AIDS may present are numerous, and thus, protean."
Protease,Protease: An enzyme that can split a protein into the peptides from which it was originally created.
Protein,"Protein: One of the three nutrients used as energy sources (calories) by the body. Proteins are essential components of the muscle, skin, and bones. Proteins and carbohydrates each provide 4 calories of energy per gram, whereas fats provide 9 calories per gram."
Protein malnutrition,"Protein malnutrition: Insufficient intake of nitrogen-containing food (protein) to maintain a nitrogen balance or nitrogen equilibrium. Children are particularly prone to develop protein malnutrition. To grow, children have to consume enough nitrogen-containing food (protein) to maintain a positive nitrogen balance, whereas adults need only be in nitrogen equilibrium. See also kwashiorkor."
Proteins,"Proteins: Large molecules composed of one or more chains of amino acids in a specific order determined by the base sequence of nucleotides in the DNA coding for the protein. Proteins are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. Each protein has unique functions. Proteins are essential components of muscles, skin, bones and the body as a whole. Examples of proteins include whole classes of important molecules, among them enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. Proteins are one of the three types of nutrients used as energy sources by the body, the other two being carbohydrate and fat. Proteins and carbohydrates each provide 4 calories of energy per gram, while fats produce 9 calories per gram."
Proteolipid protein,"Proteolipid protein: Abbreviation: PLP. Also called lipophilin. The most abundant protein of myelin, the covering and insulation around nerves. The gene PLP1 that codes for PLP is on the X chromosome. Mutations in PLP cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by loss of myelin. PMD causes nystagmus (rhythmical oscillation of the eyeballs), psychomotor developmental delay, tremor, spasticity (increased muscular tone), and ataxia (wobbliness). The mutations in PLP result in the loss of myelin that translates into the neurological problems. The severity of myelin loss is dependent on the particular PLP mutation and can range from early lethal forms of PMD to a mild disorder known as spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2). Among the mutations in PLP1 gene that can cause PMD is a duplication of PLP in which the duplicated region may be far away from the original PLP locus in chromosome region Xq22. The PLP duplication is almost always present in the mothers of affected boys and usually can be traced to the maternal grandfather."
Prothrombin,"Prothrombin: A coagulation (clotting) factor that is needed for the normal clotting of blood. A cascade of biochemical events leads to the formation of the final clot. In this cascade, prothrombin is a precursor to thrombin. Prothrombin is also known as thrombinogen and, in medical jargon, as pro. See also: Prothrombin mutation G20210A; and Prothrombin time."
Prothrombin time,"Prothrombin time: A test that is done to gauge the integrity of part of the blood clotting process. Prothrombin time is commonly used to screen for bleeding disorders as well as to monitor the accuracy of blood-thinning treatment (anticoagulation) with drugs such as warfarin (brand names: Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin). It measures the time needed for clot formation after thromboplastin and calcium are added to plasma. Familiarly known as pro time."
Protozoa,"Protozoa: A parasitic single-celled organism that can divide only within a host organism. For example, malaria is caused by the protozoa Plasmodium."
Proximal,"Proximal: Toward the beginning, the nearer of two (or more) items. For example, the proximal end of the femur is part of the hip joint, and the shoulder is proximal to the elbow. The opposite of proximal is distal. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Pruritic,"Pruritic: Itchy. For example, a scab may be 'pruritic."
Pruritus,"Pruritus: Itching. Pruritus can result from drug reaction, food allergy, kidney or liver disease, cancers, parasites, aging or dry skin, contact skin reaction, such as poison ivy, and for unknown reasons."
PSA,"PSA: Prostate specific antigen. A test for PSA may be used to screen for cancer of the prostate and to monitor treatment of the disease. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. Although most PSA is carried out of the body in semen, a very small amount escapes into the blood stream. The PSA test is done on blood. Since the amount of PSA in blood is normally minute, the PSA test requires a very sensitive method based on monoclonal antibody technology. PSA in blood can be by itself as free PSA or it can join with other substances in the blood as bound PSA. Total PSA is the sum of free and bound forms. This is what is measured as the standard PSA test. The PSA value used most frequently as the highest normal level is 4 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter). However, since the prostate gland generally increases in size and produces more PSA with increasing age, it is normal to have lower levels in young men and higher levels in older men. Age-specific PSA levels are as follows (age group, upper normal): (40 - 49, 2.5), (50 - 59, 3.5), (60 - 69, 4.5), (70 - 79, 6.5). The use of age-specific PSA ranges for the detection of prostate cancer is controversial. Not all studies have agreed that this is better than simply using a level of 4 ng/mL as the highest normal value. The PSA test is used in several distinctly different ways with respect to detecting prostate cancer. It can be used in men who are not known to have the disease as a screening test. It can be used to gauge the aggressivity of prostate cancer. And it can be used in men with prostate cancer to monitoring their disease. PSA is not specific to prostate cancer. Other diseases can cause an elevated PSA. The most frequent is benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), an increase in the size of the prostate that typically occurs with aging. Infection of the prostate gland (prostatitis) is another relatively common cause of an elevated PSA. Other confounding conditions that can increase PSA include ischemia or infarction, urethral instrumentation, and urinary retention, and prostate biopsy. The PSA test has other limitations. A small proportion of prostate cancers do not produce a detectable increase in blood PSA, even with advanced disease. Many early cancers will also not produce enough PSA to cause a significantly abnormal blood level. It is therefore important not to rely only on blood PSA testing. The most useful additional test is a physical prostate exam known as the digital rectal exam (DRE)."
Pseudomembranous colitis,Pseudomembranous colitis: Severe inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. Pseudomembranous colitis is characterized by pus and blood in the stool and often caused by antibiotics.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa: The versatile ""blue-green pus bacteria"" that opportunistically infects people, especially those who are immunocompromised. Pseudomonas rarely causes infection in healthy individuals but it is a major cause of hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections. It tends to infect people with immunodeficiency or burns and those with indwelling catheters or on respirators. Infection with pseudomonas can lead to urinary tract infections, sepsis (blood stream infection), pneumonia, pharyngitis, and many other medical problems. Pseudomonas colonizes the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and contributes to the chronic progressive pulmonary disease and death rate in CF. Pseudomonas normally resides in the soil, marshes, and coastal marine habitats. It can survive under conditions that few other organisms can tolerate, it produces a slime layer that resists phagocytosis (engulfment), and it is resistant to most antibiotics. Pseudomonas can multiply in an extraordinary assortment of environments including eyedrops, soaps, sinks, anesthesia and resuscitation equipment, fuels, humidifiers and even stored distilled water. It has also been reported in kidney dialysis machines. The characteristic color of the pus is due to a bluish pigment (pyocyanin) and a greenish pigment produced by pseudomonas. The complete sequence of the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been determined. Published in Nature (Stover et al. 406:959-964, 2000), it was the largest bacterial genome sequenced to that time. The 6.3-Mbp genome contains 5570 predicted genes on one chromosome."
Pseudotumor cerebri,"Pseudotumor cerebri: Increased pressure within the brain in the absence of a tumor. Pseudotumor cerebri can cause headache, ringing in the ears, double vision, loss of visual accuracy, and even complete blindness. It is most common in obese woman of childbearing age. Although its cause is usually not known, pseudotumor cerebri is sometimes linked to use of tetracycline, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, lithium, or amiodarone, or overuse of vitamin A. Diagnosis is made via brain imaging and lumbar puncture. Drugs to reduce cerebrospinal fluid production or hyperosmotic drugs may be used to reduce fluid buildup. Excess cerebrospinal fluid may be removed with repeated spinal taps, shunting, or a type of surgery called optic nerve sheath fenestration that allows the excess fluid to escape. Steroids may be prescribed to reduce swelling of brain tissue. Also known as benign intracranial hypertension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis: A reddish, scaly rash often located over the surfaces of the elbows, knees, scalp, and around or in the ears, navel, genitals or buttocks. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that is mediated by T lymphocytes. It is also a very common disease, Chronic plaque psoriasis affects approximately 2% of people around the world. About 10% to 15% of patients with psoriasis develop joint inflammation (inflammatory arthritis). Treatment options include topical steroid creams, topical vitamin D derivatives, other medications, injections of biologic agents, and exposure to ultraviolet light. See also: Erythrodermic psoriasis; Flexural psoriasis; Guttate psoriasis; Inverse psoriasis; Plaque psoriasis ; Psoriatic arthritis."
Psoriatic arthritis,Psoriatic arthritis: Joint inflammation that is associated with psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is a potentially destructive and deforming form of arthritis that affects approximately 10 percent of persons with psoriasis.
PSP,"PSP: Progressive supranuclear palsy, a neurologic disorder of unknown origin that gradually destroys cells in many areas of the brain, leading to serious and permanent problems with the control of gait and balance. The most obvious sign of the disease is an inability to aim the eyes properly, which occurs because of damage in the area of the brain that coordinates eye movements. Some patients describe this effect as a blurring. Another common visual problem is an inability to maintain eye contact during a conversation. This can give the mistaken impression that the patient is hostile or uninterested. Patients also often show alterations of mood and behavior, including depression and apathy as well as progressive mild dementia. The disease is ""progressive"" because it worsens over time; ""supranuclear"" because the main problem is not in the nuclei (clusters of cells in the brainstem) that directly control eye movements, but in higher centers that control the nuclei; and ""palsy,"" which means weakness, in this case of eye movement. PSP characteristically begins with loss of balance. Nearly all patients eventually develop the characteristic difficulty in moving the eyes up and down, the sign that often arouses a doctor's suspicion of the correct diagnosis. Although PSP gets progressively worse, no one dies from PSP itself. Difficulty swallowing can eventually permit aspiration of food into the trachea (windpipe). PSP may also be complicated by the effects of immobility, especially pneumonia, and by injuries from falls. PSP is the disease that led to the death of the British comedian Dudley Moore in 2002. He developed pneumonia as a terminal event. PSP affects about 20,000 Americans, one in every 100,000 people over the age of 60. Patients are usually in middle or advanced age. Men are affected more often than women. There is currently no effective treatment for PSP. In some patients the slowness, stiffness, and balance problems of PSP may respond to antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, or levodopa combined with anticholinergic agents or amantadine, but the effect is usually temporary. The speech, vision, and swallowing difficulties usually do not respond to any drug treatment. Antidepressant medications have been used with some modest success in PSP. The most commonly used of these drugs are fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and imipramine (Tofranil). The anti-PSP benefit of these drugs seems not to be related to their ability to relieve depression. Non-drug treatment for PSP can take many forms. Patients frequently use weighted walking aids because of their tendency to fall backward. Bifocals or special glasses called prisms are sometimes prescribed for PSP patients to remedy the difficulty of looking down. Formal physical therapy is of no proven benefit in PSP, but certain exercises can be done to keep the joints limber. A surgical procedure that may be useful when there are swallowing disturbances is a gastrostomy to permit feeding directly into the stomach. PSP was first described as a distinct disorder in 1964, when three scientists published a paper that distinguished the condition from Parkinson's disease (which is far more common). PSP is sometimes referred to as Steele-Richardson-Olszewksi syndrome after the scientists who defined the disorder. It is also sometimes called dementia-nuchal dystonia."
Psychiatric,"Psychiatric: Pertaining to or within the purview of psychiatry, the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. Psychiatric may refer to mental illness. For example, the 42-year-old man had a long history of psychiatric disease."
Psycho-oncology,"Psycho-oncology: The psychological, social, behavioral, and ethical aspects of cancer. Psycho-oncology addresses the two major psychological dimensions of cancer: (1) the psychological responses of patients to cancer at all stages of the disease, and that of their families and caretakers; and (2) the psychological, behavioral and social factors that may influence the disease process. The dimensions of psycho-oncology have changed as more children and adults have earned the title of cancer survivor. The impact of cancer is far greater than the millions of new cancer cases worldwide each year. Many cancer patients remain out of sight of the health services due to societal stigma and lack of resources to diagnose, treat and support. Regardless of the prognosis, cancer is a cause of anxiety and depression in more than one-third of the cancer patients. Cancer has a profound effect on the function of the family in both social and economic terms. Across our globe there are inequality and differences in all aspects of cancer. Cancer incidence and survival are related to socio-economic status but also on the individual level we distinguish between individual differences and effects of the cancer experience. Psycho-oncology is highly multi-disciplinary. It shares boundaries and interests with the major specialties within oncology including the clinical disciplines (such as surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and radiotherapy), cancer epidemiology, immunology, endocrinology, cancer biology, pathology, bioethics, palliative care, rehabilitation medicine, clinical trials research, experimental design, clinical decision making and, of course, psychiatry and psychology. Cancer is, after all, a disease of both the body and the mind."
"Psychologist, clinical","Psychologist, clinical: A professional specializing in diagnosing and treating diseases of the brain, emotional disturbance, and behavior problems. Psychologists can only use talk therapy as treatment; you must see a psychiatrist or other medical doctor to be treated with medication. Psychologists may have a master's degree (MA) or doctorate (Ph.D.) in psychology. They may also have other qualifications, including Board certification and additional training in a type of therapy."
Psychology,"Psychology: The study of the mind and mental processes, especially in relation to behavior. There are a number of fields of psychology. Clinical psychology is concerned with diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain, emotional disturbances, and behavior problems. Child psychology is the study of the mental and emotional development of children and is part of developmental psychology, the study of changes in behavior that occur through the life span. Cognitive psychology deals with how the human mind receives and interprets impressions and ideas. Social psychology looks at how the actions of others influence the behavior of an individual."
Psychosis,"Psychosis: In the general sense, a mental illness that markedly interferes with a person's capacity to meet life's everyday demands. In a specific sense, it refers to a thought disorder in which reality testing is grossly impaired. Symptoms can include seeing, hearing, smelling, or tasting things that are not there; paranoia; and delusional thoughts. Depending on the condition underlying the psychotic symptoms, symptoms may be constant or they may come and go. Psychosis can occur as a result of brain injury or disease, and is seen particularly in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Psychotic symptoms can occur as a result of drug use, but this is not true psychosis. Diagnosis is by observation and interview. Treatment is with neuroleptic medication, either the newer, safer, atypical neuroleptics like risperidone (brand name: Risperdal) or the older neuroleptics like haloperidol (brand name: Haldol.) In cases that do not respond to medication, electroshock therapy (ECT) is sometimes valuable."
Psychotropic drug,"Psychotropic drug: Any drug capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior. Some legal drugs, such as lithium for bipolar disorder, are psychotropic. Many illicit drugs, such as cocaine, are also psychotropic. Also known as psychodynamic drug."
Psychotropic medication,"Psychotropic medication: Any medication capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior. Some medications such as lithium, which may be used to treat depression, are psychotropic. Also called a psychodynamic medication. From the Greek psycho-, the mind + trop, a turning = (capable of) turning the mind."
PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography),"PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography): See: Cholangiography, percutaneous transhepatic."
Ptosis,"Ptosis: Downward displacement. For example, ptosis of the eyelids is drooping of the eyelids."
PTSD,PTSD: Post-traumatic stress disorder.
PTU,"PTU: Propylthiouracil, an antithyroid medication, a drug that blocks the production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. PTU is used to treat hyperthyroidism in order to reduce the excessive thyroid activity before surgery and to treat and maintain patients not having surgery."
Puerperal fever,"Puerperal fever: Fever that lasts for more than 24 hours within the first 10 days after a woman has had a baby. Puerperal fever is due to an infection, most often of the placental site within the uterus. If the infection involves the bloodstream, it constitutes puerperal sepsis. Puerperal fever has gone by a number of different names including childbirth fever, childbed fever and postpartum fever. In Latin a ""puerpera"" is a woman in childbirth since ""puer"" means child and ""parere"" means to give birth. The puerperium is the time immediately after the delivery of a baby. Historical note: Three of the names most closely associated with puerperal fever are Alexander Gordon, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Ignaz Philip Semmelweiss. Dr. Alexander Gordon (1752-1799) in Aberdeen, Scotland was the first to identify the cause of puerperal fever. In 1795, Gordon wrote: ""I will not venture positively to assert that the Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas are precisely of the same specific nature... (but) that they are concomitant epidemics I have unquestionable proofs. For these two epidemics began in Aberdeen at the same time, and afterwards kept pace together; they arrived at their acme together, and they both ceased at the same time. After delivery the infectious matter is readily and copiously admitted by the numerous patulous orifices, which are open to imbibe it, by the separation of the placenta from the uterus."" Gordon added that: ""The disease seized such women only as were visited, or delivered by a practitioner...or nurse who has previously attended patients afflicted with the disease. It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention that I was myself the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women."" In 1843 Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809?-1894), Professor of Anatomy & Physiology at Harvard, wrote in his celebrated paper entitled ""On the Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever"" that: ""...if one case of puerperal fever arises in a physician's practice there is an increased risk of a second, two cases suggest that the physician should do no obstetrics for at least a month, and three prima facie evidence that he is the source of the contagion."" The Viennese physician Ignaz Philip Semmelweiss (1818-1862) provided proof of the cause of puerperal fever. ?In 1847 he ordered hand washing in chlorinated water before delivering infants and the mortality from childbed fever declined dramatically. Semmelweiss wrote that: ""Puerperal fever is caused by conveyance to the pregnant woman of putrid particles derived from living organisms, through the agency of the examining fingers....... Consequently must I make my confession that God only knows the number of women whom I have consigned prematurely to the grave."""
Puerperium,"Puerperium: The time immediately after the delivery of a baby. (In Latin a ""puerpera"" is a woman in childbirth since ""puer"" means child and ""parere"" means to give birth.) Puerperal fever is childbirth (or childbed) fever due to an infection usually of the placental site within the uterus. If that infection involves the bloodstream, it constitutes puerperal sepsis."
Pulmonary arterial hypertension,Pulmonary arterial hypertension: See: Pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary edema,Pulmonary edema: Fluid in the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism,"Pulmonary embolism: Sudden closure of a pulmonary artery or one of its branches, caused by a blood-borne clot or foreign material that plugs the vessel."
Pulmonary fibrosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis: Scarring throughout the lungs that can be caused by many conditions, such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asbestosis, and certain medications. Pulmonary fibrosis can also occur without an identifiable cause, in which case it is referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and diminished exercise tolerance. Treatment involves use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and/or other medications that suppress the body's immune system. The goal of treatment is to decrease lung inflammation and subsequent scarring. Responses to treatment vary. Toxicity and side effects of treatment can be serious. Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis are generally cared for by lung specialists."
Pulmonary hypertension,Pulmonary hypertension: High blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This elevated blood pressure can lead to severe shortness of breath and death. Lung transplantation is considered in severe cases that are unresponsive to treatments.
Pulmonary medicine,"Pulmonary medicine: The branch of medicine that deals with the causes, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases affecting the lungs. Pulmonary medicine deals with many diseases and conditions, including: ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, lung transplants, occupational lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis of the lungs, and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). Pulmonary medicine is also sometimes called pulmonology which is the science concerned with the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the lungs."
Pulse,Pulse: The rhythmic dilation of an artery that results from beating of the heart. Pulse is often measured by feeling the arteries of the wrist or neck.
Pump-oxygenator,"Pump-oxygenator: A machine that does the work both of the heart (pump blood) and the lungs (oxygenate the blood). Used, for example, in open heart surgery. Blood returning to the heart is diverted through the machine before returning it to the arterial circulation. Also called a heart-lung machine. John H. Gibson invented the heart-lung machine which was first successfully used in open-heart surgery in 1953."
Puncture wound,Puncture wound: An injury that is caused by a pointed object that pierces or penetrates the skin. Puncture wounds carry a danger of tetanus.
Pupil,"Pupil: The opening of the iris. The pupil may appear to open (dilate) and close (constrict), but it is really the iris that is the prime mover; the pupil is merely the absence of iris. The pupil determines how much light is let into the eye. Both pupils are usually of equal size. If they are not, the condition is called anisocoria."
Purine,"Purine: One of the two classes of bases in DNA and RNA. The purine bases are guanine (G) and adenine (A). Uric acid, the offending substance in gout, is a purine end-product."
Purpura,"Purpura: Hemorrhage (bleeding) into the surface of the skin. The area of skin with purpura is greater than 3 millimeters in diameter. The appearance of an individual area of purpura varies with the duration of the lesions. Early purpura is red and becomes darker, then purple, and brown-yellow as it fades."
Purulent,"Purulent: Pertaining to pus. Containing or composed of pus. The term ""purulent"" is often used in regard to drainage. For example, gonorrhea in men usually causes a purulent discharge from the penis."
Pus,"Pus: A thick, whitish-yellow fluid that results from the accumulation of white blood cells, liquefied tissue, and cellular debris. Pus is commonly a sign of infection or foreign material in the body."
Pustule,"Pustule: A pustule is a small collection of pus in the top layer of skin (epidermis) or beneath it in the dermis. Pustules frequently form in sweat glands or hair follicles. Pus is a mixture of inflammatory cells and liquid. Put somewhat more simply, a pustule is a little pocket full of pus."
Pustulosis,"Pustulosis: A highly inflammatory skin condition that results in large, fluid-filled, blister-like areas (pustules). Pustulosis typically occurs on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet. The skin of these areas peels and flakes (exfoliates)."
Putrid throat,"Putrid throat: a historic term for a severely inflamed throat, with tissue destruction, and fetid odor, often due to strep throat (streptococcal pharyngitis) or diphtheria."
PUVA,"PUVA: PUVA stands for psoralen (P) and ultraviolet A (UVA) therapy in which the patient is exposed first to psoralens (drugs containing chemicals that react with ultraviolet light) and then to UVA light. PUVA is used to treat vitiligo (white patches on the skin). It is time-consuming and care must be taken to avoid side effects, which can sometimes be severe. The treatment involves taking psoralen by mouth (orally) or applying it to the skin (topically). This is followed by carefully timed exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light from a special lamp or to sunlight. Patients usually receive treatments in their doctor's office so they can be carefully watched for any side effects. Patients must minimize exposure to sunlight at other times. The goal of PUVA therapy in vitiligo is to repigment the white patches. PUVA is also highly effective in treating severe psoriasis, a common chronic disorder of the skin characterized by reddish, scaly patches of inflammation, most commonly affecting the elbows, knees, scalp, or groin. Psoriasis can be mild or severe. When severe, it can adversely affect functions of daily living including work and social activities. About 10-15% of people with psoriasis develop arthritis -- psoriatic arthritis. However, PUVA therapy has its hazards. It increases the risk for cancer of the skin, a risk that includes melanoma, a highly malignant and sometimes fatal form of skin cancer. Patients who receive long-term PUVA treatment should therefore be carefully monitored throughout their lives. These patients should also report to their healthcare practitioners any peculiar skin abnormalities, including abnormally pigmented areas and skin that is changing color or size, itching, or painful. PUVA treatment is also called psoralen photochemotherapy."
PV,PV: Polycythemia vera.
PVB,PVB: Premature ventricular beat. See: Extrasystole.
PVC,PVC: Premature ventricular contraction.
PX,PX: Medical abbreviation for prognosis.
Pyarthrosis,"Pyarthrosis: Infectious arthritis. Pyarthrosis is typically caused by a bacterial infection in the joint. Diagnosis is made by analysis of fluid that has been removed from the joint, including microscopic examination and culture. Pyarthrosis requires drainage of the joint and antibiotics, usually intravenously administered. Pyarthrosis is also referred to as suppurative, septic, or bacterial arthritis."
Pyelo,"Pyelo: a prefix that means that a term is related to the renal pelvis, e.g. pyelonephritis, pyelogram."
Pyelonephritis,"Pyelonephritis: Bacterial infection of the kidneys. Pyelonephritis can be acute or chronic, and it is most often due to the ascent of bacteria from the bladder up the ureters to infect the kidneys. Symptoms include flank (side) pain, fever, shaking chills, sometimes foul-smelling urine, frequent and urgent need to urinate, and general malaise. Tenderness is elicited by gently tapping over the kidney with a fist (percussion). Diagnosis is made via urinalysis, which reveals white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. Usually there is also an increase in circulating white cells in the blood. Treatment involves use of appropriate antibiotics. Often called simply pyelo."
Pyridoxine,"Pyridoxine: One of the vitamin B6 group (which also includes pyridoxal and pyridoxamine) that is transformed in the body to pyridoxal phosphate, which functions as a coenzyme, a substance that enhances the action of an enzyme and thereby helps catalyze and speed a biochemical reaction. (A number of vitamins serve as coenzymes.) The vitamin B6 group is especially important to the function of the central nervous system, skin, and blood. Vitamin B6 is involved in the formation of red blood cells since pyridoxal phosphate is the rate-limiting substance in making heme, a component of hemoglobin, the key oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells. The diet rarely lacks vitamin B6. Most foods contain it. However, deficiency of vitamin B6 within the body may occur due to poor absorption of it from the intestine or inactivation of it by some drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, estrogens, isoniazid, and penicillamine). Other causes of vitamin B6 include alcoholism and conditions such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes that increase the metabolic demand, creating a relative shortage of vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 deficiency causes convulsions in infants and anemia in adults. An outbreak of convulsions in infants followed the inadvertent destruction of vitamin B6 in infant formulas. Several genetic syndromes also involve problems with vitamin B6."
Pyrimidine,Pyrimidine: One of the two classes of bases in DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine bases are thymine (T) and cytosine (C) in DNA and cytosine (C) and uracil (U) in RNA.
Pyrosis,"Pyrosis: A technical term for what is popularly called heartburn, a burning sensation in the upper abdomen. In many languages there is a technical term such as pyrosis and a popular term for the same phenomenon. For example, pyrosis is popularly known in French as br?lure epigastrique and in Spanish as ardor de est?mago. Pyrosis is the Greek word meaning burning."

The function of the quadriceps is to extend (to straighten out) the leg."
Quadriparesis,"Quadriparesis: Weakness of all four limbs, both arms and both legs, as from muscular dystrophy."
life,"Quality of life: The patient's ability to enjoy normal life activities. Quality of life is an important consideration in medical care. Some medical treatments can seriously impair quality of life without providing appreciable benefit, whereas others greatly enhance quality of life."
Quaque (on prescription),"Quaque (on prescription): If a medicine is to be taken every so- many hours, it is written ""q_h""; the ""q"" standing for the Latin word for once ""quaque"" and the ""h"" indicating the number of hours.

However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
Quiescence,"Quiescence: Inactivity, quietness. In cells, quiescence is the state of not dividing. In neurons (nerve cells), quiescence is the state of not firing. The word comes from the Latin ""quiescere"", to become quiet. Quiescence suggests a temporary cessation of activity."
Quiescent,"Quiescent: Inactive, resting. For example, tuberculosis can be a quiescent (inactive) infection."
Quinine,"Quinine: The original antimalarial agent, quinine took its name from the Peruvian Indian word ""kina"" meaning ""bark of the tree"" referring to the cinchona tree. From this tree, quinine was first obtained. The Peruvian Indians called it ""the fever tree."" Quinine, a large and complex molecule, is the most important alkaloid found in cinchona bark. Until World War I, it was the only effective treatment for malaria. In fact, quinine was the first chemical compound to be successfully used to treat an infectious disease. Quinine was isolated in crystalline form in 1820 by J.B. Caventou and P.J. Pelletier. In one of the classical achievements of synthetic organic chemistry, R.B. Woodward and W. Doering first made synthetic quinine in 1944. Quinine acts by interfering with the growth and reproduction of the Plasmodium, the malarial parasite that lives within the victim's red blood cells. Quinine causes the parasites to disappear from the blood and the symptoms of the disease are thereby alleviated. However, when quinine treatment ends, many patients relapse. They suffer another attack of malaria due to the failure of quinine to kill the malarial parasites in cells of the body other than the red blood cells. These parasites persist and, after a time, they reinvade the red blood cells and precipitate the relapse. Since quinine does not permanently cure malaria, better drugs were sought. A number were discovered that replaced quinine during and after World War II. Some of these drugs (such as chloroquine and chloroguanide) are more effective than quinine in suppressing the growth of the blood forms of the malarial parasite. Others (such as primaquine and pyrimethamine) act upon both the blood and tissue phases of the parasite, producing a complete cure and preventing a relapse. Quinine has been used outside of malaria as a remedy for fever and pain and to treat and prevent leg cramps. Prolonged administration of quinine may produce toxic symptoms such as deafness, disturbances in vision, skin rashes, and digestive upsets."
Quinquagenarian,Quinquagenarian: Someone in his or her fifties. See also: Age by decade.
RA,RA: Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints.
Race,"Race: An ethnic stock or division of humans. Naturalists and ethnographers have long divided humans into a variable number of distinct races. However, DNA and other genetic studies have revealed that that most genetic variation, about 94%, is within so-called racial groups while these racial groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater genetic variation within racial groups than between them. The concept of race is a superficial and subjective one. All of humankind is a single species."
Radial,"Radial: A word with diverse meanings in medicine and the biomedical sciences: The word ""radial"" comes from the Latin ""radius"" meaning a spoke in a wheel which this bone was thought to resemble. The word ""radiation"" is derived from the same Latin word -- ""radius."""
Radiation,Radiation: 1. Rays of energy. Gamma rays and X-rays are two of the types of energy waves often used in medicine. 2. The use of energy waves to diagnose or treat disease. See also: Irradiation.
Radiation therapy,"Radiation therapy: The use of high-energy rays to damage cancer cells, stopping them from growing and dividing. Like surgery, radiation therapy is a local treatment that affects cancer cells only in the treated area. Radiation can come from a machine (external radiation) or from a small container of radioactive material implanted directly into or near a tumor (internal radiation). External radiation therapy is usually given on an outpatient basis in a hospital or clinic. Patients are not radioactive during or after external radiation therapy. For internal radiation therapy, the patient stays in the hospital for a few days. The implant may be temporary or permanent. After an implant is removed, there is no radioactivity in the body. The amount of radiation in a permanent implant goes down to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital. Side effects of radiation therapy depend on the treatment dose and the part of the body treated. The most common side effects of radiation are fatigue, skin reactions (such as a rash or redness) in the treated area, and loss of appetite. Radiation therapy can cause inflammation of tissues and organs in and around the body site that is radiated. Radiation therapy can also cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells. Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be unpleasant, they can usually be treated or controlled. Furthermore, in most cases, they are not permanent."
Radiculopathy,"Radiculopathy: Any disease of the spinal nerve roots and spinal nerves. Radiculopathy is characterized by pain that seems to radiate from the spine, extending outward to cause symptoms away from the source of the spinal nerve root irritation. Causes of radiculopathy include deformities of the discs between the vertebrae. Patients with diabetes can be affected by a form of radiculopathy that may be caused by inadequate blood supply to the spinal nerve roots. Also known as radiculitis."
requency ablation,"Radiofrequency ablation: The use of electrodes to generate heat and destroy abnormal tissue. In radiofrequency ablation (RFA), heat is generated locally by a high frequency, alternating current that flows from the electrodes. A probe is inserted into the center of the tumor and the non-insulated electrodes, which are shaped like prongs, are projected into the tumor. The local heat that is generated melts the tissue (coagulative necrosis) that is adjacent to the probe. This results in a 3 cm to 5.5 cm sphere of dead tissue per treatment session. The probe is left in place for about 10 to 15 minutes. Radiofrequency ablation has been used for thermal ablation in bone, liver, kidney, heart, prostate, breast, brain, lymph nodes, nerve ganglia, and soft tissue. Radiofrequency ablation has various clinical applications including treating arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), tumors, osteoid osteoma, and nerve ganglion ablation. The cells killed by radiofrequency ablation are not removed, but are gradually replaced by fibrosis and scar tissue. Over the coming months, the treated tissue shrinks. If there is local recurrence, it occurs at the edge, and in some cases may be retreated. Heat has been used in medicine as long as history. Thousands of years ago, Hindu medics used heated metal bars to stop bleeding. Hippocrates said ""what is not cured by the knife may be cured by fire."" Electrocautery has been used for many decades in surgery to stop bleeding, coagulate blood vessels, and cut tissue. The radiofrequency ablation generator uses a slight modification of this old technology to deposit the energy over a larger tissue volume. Radiofrequency ablation also cauterizes tissue as it heats it, thus limiting blood loss. The needle pathway may also be treated, further reducing the risk of bleeding."
Radiography,Radiography: The process of obtaining images (radiographs) of internal structures of the body using X-rays.
Radioisotope,"Radioisotope: A version of a chemical element that has an unstable nucleus and emits radiation during its decay to a stable form. Radioisotopes have important uses in medical diagnosis, treatment, and research."
Radiologist,"Radiologist: A physician specialized in radiology, the branch of medicine that uses ionizing and nonionizing radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Like other physicians, a radiologist must have graduated from an accredited medical school or school of osteopathy, passed a licensing examination, and completed at least 4 years of graduate medical or osteopathic education (residency). Radiologists are usually board certified, that is, they have taken and passed an examination and thus are approved to practice in the field of radiology by either the American Board of Radiology (for a medical doctor) or the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (for an osteopathic doctor). A radiologist can also subspecialize. Subspecialties in radiology listed by the American College of Radiology give a idea of the breadth of the field:"
Radiology,"Radiology: The medical specialty concerned with radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, including both ionizing radiation such as X-rays and nonionizing radiation such as ultrasound. Also known as roentgenology."
Radiolucent,"Radiolucent: Permeable to one or another form of radiation, such as X-rays. Radiolucent objects do not block radiation but let it pass. Plastic is usually radiolucent. The opposite of radiolucent is radiopaque."
Radiomimetic,"Radiomimetic: Imitating radiation. A radiomimetic drug is one that imitates the effects of radiation as in the case of chemicals such as nitrogen mustards which are used in cancer chemotherapy. The ""mimetic"" part of ""radiomimetic"" comes from the Greek verb ""mimeisthai"" meaning ""to imitate"" and from ""mimos"" meaning ""mime."" (The English word ""mime"" also comes from ""mimos"" as do ""mimic"" and ""mimicry."")"
Radiopaque,"Radiopaque: Opaque to one or another form of radiation, such as X-rays. Radiopaque objects block radiation rather than allow it to pass through. Metal, for instance, is radiopaque, so metal objects that a patient may have swallowed are visible on X-rays. Radiopaque dyes are used in radiology to enhance X-ray pictures of internal anatomic structures. The opposite of radiopaque is radiolucent."
Radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy: The treatment of disease with ionizing radiation. Also called radiation therapy. In radiotherapy, high-energy rays are often used to damage cancer cells and stop them from growing and dividing. A specialist in the radiation treatment of cancer is called a radiation oncologist. Like surgery, radiation therapy is a local treatment; it affects cancer cells only in the treated area. Radiation can come from a machine (external radiation). It can also come from an implant (a small container of radioactive material) placed directly into or near the tumor (internal radiation). Some patients receive both kinds of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy is usually given on an outpatient basis in a hospital or clinic, for example, 5 days a week for several weeks. Patients are not radioactive during or after the treatment. For internal radiation therapy, the patient usually stays in the hospital for a few days. The radiation implant may be temporary or permanent. Because the level of radiation is highest during the hospital stay, patients may not be able to have visitors or may have visitors only for a short time. Once an implant is removed, there is no radioactivity in the body. The amount of radiation in a permanent implant goes down to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital. With radiation therapy, the side effects depend on the treatment dose and the part of the body that is treated. The most common side effects are tiredness, skin reactions (such as a rash or redness) in the treated area, and loss of appetite. Radiation therapy can also cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, cells that help protect the body against infection. Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be unpleasant, they can usually be treated or controlled and, in most cases, they are not permanent."
Radius,"Radius: The smaller of the two bones of the forearm, located on the thumb's side. (The larger bone in the forearm is the ulna.)"
Raised hemidiaphragm,Raised hemidiaphragm: See: Elevated hemidiaphragm.
Rale,"Rale: An abnormal lung sound that can be heard through a stethoscope. Rales may be sibilant (whistling), dry (crackling), or wet (sloshy), depending on the amount and density of fluid refluxing back and forth in the air passages."
Ramsay Hunt syndrome,"Ramsay Hunt syndrome: A herpes virus infection of the geniculate nerve ganglion that causes paralysis of the facial muscles on the same side of the face as the infection. The geniculate ganglion is a sensory ganglion associated with the VIIth cranial nerve. The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is usually associated with a rash and blisters. The syndrome is named for the pre-eminent 20th-century American neurologist James Ramsay Hunt (1872-1937). One common error in writing his name is to spell Ramsay as Ramsey and another common error is to put a hyphen between the Ramsay and the Hunt. There is none. There are three variations or types of Ramsay Hunt syndromes, including:"
Ramus,"Ramus: In anatomy, a branch, such as a branch of a blood vessel or nerve. For example, the ramus acetabularis arteriae circumflexae femoris medialis is the branch of an artery that goes to the socket of the hip joint. The plural of ramus is rami."
Random,Random: Determined solely by chance.
Random number table,"Random number table: A table of numbers generated in an unpredictable, haphazard sequence. Tables of random numbers are used to create a random sample. A random number table is therefore also called a random sample table. Random numbers were traditionally selected from a printed table. Today random numbers can be generated by computer."
Randomized controlled trial,"Randomized controlled trial: (RCT) A study in which people are allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive one of several clinical interventions. One of these interventions is the standard of comparison or control. The control may be a standard practice, a placebo (""sugar pill""), or no intervention at all. Someone who takes part in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is called a participant or subject. RCTs seek to measure and compare the outcomes after the participants receive the interventions. Because the outcomes are measured, RCTs are quantitative studies. In sum, RCTs are quantitative, comparative, controlled experiments in which investigators study two or more interventions in a series of individuals who receive them in random order. The RCT is one of the simplest and most powerful tools in clinical research."
Range,"Range: In medicine and statistics, the difference between the lowest and highest numeric values. For example, if five premature infants are born, weighing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 pounds, respectively, the range of their birth weights is 2 to 6 pounds."
motion,"Range of motion: The full movement potential of a joint, usually its range of flexion and extension. For example, a knee might lack 10 degrees of full extension due to an injury."
RANTES,"RANTES: A cytokine that is a member of the interleukin-8 superfamily of cytokines. RANTES is a protein. It is a selective attractant for memory T lymphocytes and monocytes. It binds to CCR5, a coreceptor of HIV. RANTES is an acronym for Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted. It is also known as CCL5."
Rape,"Rape: Forced sexual intercourse; sexual assault; sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor. Rape may be heterosexual (involving members of opposite sexes) or homosexual (involving members of the same sex). Rape involves insertion of an erect penis or an inanimate object into the female vagina or the male anus. Legal definitions of rape may also include forced oral sex and other sexual acts. Heterosexual rape usually refers to an assault in which a male forces himself upon a female, and homosexual rape usually refers to an assault in which a male forces himself upon another male. However, both terms (heterosexual and homosexual rape) have been used to refer to an assault in which a female forces herself upon a male or a female. Sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor is known legally as statutory rape. The adult can be found guilty of statutory rape even if the minor was a willing partner. Gang rape is a sexual assault in which several persons force themselves upon a victim. Date rape is a sexual assault in which the victim is psychologically pressured, drugged or sedated before the rape. Date rape is so-named because it often involves a dating couple. The male may spike a female's alcoholic beverage, making her unable to resist his advances or even unable to remember the rape. Would-be date rapists have used sleeping pills to sedate their intended victims. In addition to adding sleep-inducing medications to alcohol, date rapists also have combined them with marijuana, cocaine and other drugs. Rape can also occur in a marriage. Typically, the husband forces himself on his wife at a time when she is unwilling to have sexual intercourse. Victims of rape suffer physical and mental trauma. Physical trauma may include cuts, bruises and abrasions in the pelvic area as well as elsewhere on the body. Mental trauma may include overwhelming feelings of humiliation, embarrassment and defilement. Rape victims should seek treatment at a hospital. There, doctors and nurses can treat the injuries, administer antibiotics to prevent sexually- transmitted diseases, and provide counseling or any other additional therapy (mental or physical) that the patient requires. The hospital team's evaluation and report will help document the condition of the patient for legal purposes. ""Rape"" is derived from the Latin word ""rapere"" (to seize)."
Rapid plasma reagin test,"Rapid plasma reagin test: A screening blood test for syphilis. Rapid plasma reagin is commonly abbreviated RPR. A negative (""nonreactive"") RPR test result is compatible with a person not having syphilis. However, a person may have a negative RPR test and still have syphilis since, in the early stages of the disease, the RPR often gives negative results. This is a false negative RPR. The RPR test is sometimes positive in the absence of syphilis. For example, a false positive RPR can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy. The VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test is similar to the RPR test. It is also designed to detect an antibody substance in the bloodstream when syphilis is present but, as with the RPR, early syphilis infections may give a false negative result. The VDRL, like the RPR, can also give false positive results."
Rash,"Rash: Breaking out (eruption) of the skin. A rash can be caused by an underlying medical condition, hormonal cycles, allergies, or contact with irritating substances. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the rash. Medically, a rash is referred to as an exanthem."
Raw egg,"Raw egg: Uncooked, unpasteurized egg. Salmonella enteritidis, a harmful bacterium, can be transmitted from infected hens directly to the interior of their eggs before the shells are formed. Even eggs with clean, uncracked shells can be infected. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) now estimate that 1 egg in 20,000 may be contaminated. Although the number of eggs affected is quite small, there have been a number of cases of foodborne illness related to infected eggs. A person infected with Salmonella enteritidis usually has fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming the contaminated egg. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Although most people recover fully, the diarrhea may require hospitalization. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems may have a more severe illness. In them, the infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and cause death unless the infection is treated promptly with antibiotics. If eggs are thoroughly cooked, the Salmonella are destroyed. Many dishes made in restaurants or commercial or institutional kitchens, however, are made from pooled eggs. If 500 eggs are pooled, one batch in 20 will be contaminated and everyone who eats eggs from that batch is at risk. Shell eggs are safest when stored in the refrigerator, individually and thoroughly cooked, and promptly consumed. The larger the number of Salmonella present in the egg, the more likely it is to cause illness. Keeping eggs well refrigerated prevents any Salmonella present in the eggs from growing to higher numbers, so eggs should be held refrigerated until they are needed. Cooking reduces the number of bacteria present in an egg. Undercooked egg whites and yolks have been associated with outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis infections. Both should be consumed promptly and not be held in the temperature range of 40 to 140 degrees F for more than 2 hours, according to the CDC. The CDC also recommends discarding cracked or dirty eggs; washing hands and cooking utensils with soap and water after contact with raw eggs; avoiding eating raw eggs as in homemade ice cream or eggnog; and avoiding restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked unpasteurized eggs. (Knowing whether a restaurant has used raw eggs may not be easy.)"
Raynaud's phenomenon,"Raynaud's phenomenon: A condition resulting in discoloration of fingers and/or toes when a person is exposed to changes in temperature (cold or hot) or emotional events. The skin discoloration occurs because an abnormal spasm of the blood vessels causes a diminished blood supply. Initially, the digits involved turn white because of diminished blood supply, then turn blue because of prolonged lack of oxygen and finally, the blood vessels reopen, causing a local ""flushing"" phenomenon, which turns the digits red. This three-phase color sequence (white to blue to red), most often upon exposure to cold temperature, is characteristic of Raynaud's phenomenon.  Raynaud's phenomenon occurs with a number of conditions including rheumatic diseases (scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), hormone imbalance (hypothyroidism and carcinoid), trauma (frostbite, vibrating tools), medications (propranolol/INDERAL, estrogens, nicotine, bleomycin) and, uncommonly, cancer. The phenomenon is named for the French physician Maurice Raynaud (1834-1881)."
RBC,"RBC: Short for red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen and carbon dioxide through the blood. This rather remarkable feat is thanks to hemoglobin, the pigment that makes red cells (and blood) look red. The red blood cells are also known as red corpuscles or erythrocytes (literally, red hollow vessels). RBC also stands for the red cell count, the number of red blood cells in a given volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter."
RCT,RCT: Randomized controlled trial.
RDA,"RDA: Abbreviation for the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Or, popularly, the Recommended Daily Allowance."
RDS (respiratory distress syndrome),"RDS (respiratory distress syndrome): Formerly known as hyaline membrane disease, a syndrome of respiratory difficulty in newborn infants caused by a deficiency of a molecule called surfactant. RDS almost always occurs in newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation. The more premature the baby is, the greater is the chance of developing RDS. RDS is more likely to occur in newborns of diabetic mothers. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, is secreted by lung cells. The air-fluid interface of the film of water lining the alveoli of the lung (where the exchange of oxygen and CO2 occurs) exerts large forces that cause the alveoli to close if surfactant is deficient. Lung compliance is decreased, and the work of inflating the stiff lungs is increased. The preterm newborn is further handicapped because his or her ribs are more easily deformed (compliant). Breathing efforts therefore result in deep sternal (breastbone) retractions but poor air entry if the ribs are compliant compared with the lungs. This results in diffuse atelectasis (collapse of the lungs). Rapid, labored, grunting respirations usually develop immediately or within a few hours after delivery, with retractions above and below the breastbone and flaring of the nostrils. The extent of atelectasis (lung collapse) and the severity of respiratory failure progressively worsen. Not all infants with RDS have signs of respiratory distress; extremely low birth weight newborns (i.e., < 1000 g) may be unable to initiate respirations at birth because their lungs are so stiff; they may fail to initiate breathing in the delivery room. The incidence of RDS can be reduced by assessment of fetal lung maturity to determine the optimal time for delivery. When a fetus must be delivered prematurely, giving betamethasone systemically to the mother for at least 24 hours before delivery induces fetal surfactant production and usually reduces the risk of RDS or decreases its severity. If untreated, severe RDS can result in multiple organ failure and death. However, if the newborn's ventilation is adequately supported, surfactant production will begin and RDS will resolve by 4 or 5 days. Recovery is hastened by treatment with pulmonary surfactant."
Reabsorption,"Reabsorption: Being absorbed again. For example, the kidney selectively reabsorbs substances it has already secreted into the renal tubules, such as glucose, protein, and sodium. These reabsorbed substances are returned to the blood."
Reagent,"Reagent: A substance that is used to produce a chemical reaction that allows researchers to detect, measure, produce, or change other substances."
Rebound effect,"Rebound effect: The production of increased negative symptoms when the effect of a drug has passed or the patient no longer responds to the drug. If a drug produces a rebound effect, the condition it was used to treat may come back even stronger when the drug is discontinued or loses effectiveness."
Recalcitrant,"Recalcitrant: Stubborn. For example, a recalcitrant case of pneumonia stubbornly resists treatment."
Recent memory,"Recent memory: Short-term memory. Also called working memory. Recent memory is a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Recent memory is involved in the selection, initiation, and termination of information-processing functions such as encoding, storing, and retrieving data. One test of recent memory is memory span, the number of items, usually words or numbers, that a person can hold onto and recall. In a typical test of memory span, an examiner reads a list of random numbers aloud at about the rate of one number per second. At the end of a sequence, the person being tested is asked to recall the items in order. The average memory span for normal adults is 7 items."
Receptor,"Receptor: 1. In cell biology, a structure on the surface of a cell (or inside a cell) that selectively receives and binds a specific substance. There are many receptors. There is a receptor for (insulin; there is a receptor for low-density lipoproteins (LDL); etc. To take an example, the receptor for substance P, a molecule that acts as a messenger for the sensation of pain, is a unique harbor on the cell surface where substance P docks. Without this receptor, substance P cannot dock and cannot deliver its message of pain. Variant forms of nuclear hormone receptors mediate processes such as cholesterol metabolism and fatty acid production. Some hormone receptors are implicated in diseases such as diabetes and certain types of cancer. A receptor called PXR appears to jump-start the body's response to unfamiliar chemicals and may be involved in drug-drug interactions.
2. In neurology, a terminal of a sensory nerve that receives and responds to stimuli."
Medial Rectus Muscle,"Recession of medial rectus muscle is a type of surgery used to correct certain types of strabismus, or a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other. This surgery changes the length or position of the medial rectus muscle, which is one of the muscles that control the side-to-side movement of the eyes."
Recombinant,"Recombinant: A person with a new combination of genes, a combination not present in either parent, due to parental recombination of those genes."
Recombinant DNA technology,"Recombinant DNA technology: A series of procedures that are used to join together (recombine) DNA segments. A recombinant DNA molecule is constructed from segments of two or more different DNA molecules. Under certain conditions, a recombinant DNA molecule can enter a cell and replicate there, either on its own or after it has been integrated into a chromosome."
Recommended Daily Allowance,Recommended Daily Allowance: Popular name for the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).
Recommended Dietary Allowance,"Recommended Dietary Allowance: The RDA, the estimated amount of a nutrient (or calories) per day considered necessary for the maintenance of good health by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council/ National Academy of Sciences. The RDA is updated periodically to reflect new knowledge. It is popularly called the Recommended Daily Allowance."
Rectal (adjective),"Rectal (adjective): Having to do with the rectum, the last 6 to 8 inches of the large intestine that serves to store solid waste until it leaves the body through the anus. The word ""rectal"" comes from the Latin ""rectus"" meaning ""straight"" (which the human rectum is not)."
Rectal bleeding,"Rectal bleeding: Blood passed rectally. Blood in the stool can be bright red or maroon in color. Larger amounts of blood that remain in the intestine long enough can turn the stool black. Blood in the stool also may be invisible to the naked eye (occult). The causes of blood in the stool range from harmless, annoying conditions of the gastrointestinal tract such as hemorrhoids to very serious conditions such as cancer. Blood in the stool should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. See: Anal fissure; Colon cancer; Crohn's disease; Diverticulosis; Peptic ulcer; and Gastric cancer. "
Rectocele,"Rectocele: Bulging of the front wall of the rectum into the vagina. Rectocele is due to weakening of the pelvic support structures and thinning of the rectovaginal septum (the tissues separating the rectum from the vagina). Also called a proctocele. Risk factors for a rectocele include a history of multiple, difficult or prolonged deliveries, forceps or other assisted methods of delivery, perineal tears, an episiotomy into the rectum or anal sphincter muscles, hysterectomy, and constipation and straining with bowel movements. Rectoceles may cause no symptoms. If they do, the symptoms may be vaginal and/or rectal. Vaginal symptoms include vaginal bulging, the sensation of a mass in the vagina, pain with intercourse or even something hanging out of the vagina that may become irritated. Rectal symptoms include constipation difficult defecation, and unusually frequent urge to have a bowel movement. A rectocele should only be treated if it causes significant symptoms. The treatment may be medical or surgical. Medical options include a high fiber diet and ample fluids (to avoid constipation), stool softeners, and a pessary inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs. Surgery is meant to repair the rectocele."
Rectouterine pouch,"Rectouterine pouch: An extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and back wall of the uterus. The term ""cul-de-sac,"" aside from being any ""blind pouch or cavity that is closed at one end,"" is used specifically to refer to the rectouterine pouch. From that fact comes: In French, ""cul-de-sac"" literally is ""bottom of (a)sack."" As early as the 13th century, a cul-de-sac was a dead-end street (or a dead-end way), a blind alley. (The third letter in ""cul"" is silent in French; in English it is spoken. So, in French ""cul"" is pronounced ""ku"" and in English ""kul""). The rectouterine pouch is also known as excavatio recto-uterina (literally, the rectouterine excavation) and the pouch of Douglas, after the Scottish anatomist James Douglas (1675-1742) who explored this region of the female body and left his name attached to at least 3 other structural features in the area."
Rectum,Rectum: The last 6 to 8 inches of the large intestine. The rectum stores solid waste until it leaves the body through the anus.
Recur,"Recur: To occur again; to return. For example, a symptom, sign, or disease can recur."
Recurrence,"Recurrence: The return of a sign, symptom, or disease after a remission. The reappearance of cancer cells at the same site or in another location is a form of recurrence."
Recurrent,"Recurrent: Appearing or occurring again. For example, a recurrent fever is a fever that has returned after an intermission, a recrudescent fever."
Red blood cell,"Red blood cell: The blood cell that carries oxygen. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide). Hemoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment. It gives the cell its red color (and name). The mature red blood cell (RBC) is a non-nucleated biconcave disk. Thanks to this unusual shape and its hemoglobin content, the RBC is superbly suited to the transport of oxygen. A red blood cell is sometimes simply referred to as a red cell. It is also called an erythrocyte or, rarely today, a red blood corpuscle. "
Red blood cells,"Red blood cells: The blood cells that carry oxygen. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide). Hemoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment. It gives the cells their red color (and their name). The abbreviation for red blood cells is RBCs. Red blood cells are sometime simply called red cells. They are also called erythrocytes or, rarely today, red blood corpuscles. "
Red eye,"Red eye: Also called conjunctivitis. Redness or irritation of the conjunctivae, the membranes on the inner part of the eyelids and the membranes covering the whites of the eyes. These membranes react to a wide range of bacteria, viruses, allergy-provoking agents, irritants and toxic agents. Viral and bacterial forms of conjunctivitis are common in childhood. The leading cause of a red eye is virus infection. Viral pink eye is usually associated with more of a watery discharge, not green or yellow in color, and is frequently associated with viral cold-like symptoms. The eyelids may be swollen. Sometimes looking at bright lights is painful. While viral pink eye, may not require an antibiotic, the doctor should see the child, as occasionally this form of pink eye can be associated with infection of the cornea, (the clear portion of the front of the eyeball). This infection must be correctly detected and treated. Viral pink eye is highly contagious. The bacteria that most commonly cause pink eye are staphylococcus, pneumococcus, and streptococcus. Symptoms include eye pain, swelling, redness, and a moderate to large amount of discharge, usually yellow or greenish in color. The discharge commonly accumulates after sleep. The eyelids may be stuck together requiring a warm wash cloth applied to the eyes to remove the discharge. Chlamydia is a form a bacterial that is an uncommon form of pink eye in the U.S., but is very common in Africa and the Middle Eastern countries. It can cause pink eye in adults and neonates. It is a cause of pink eye in adolescents and adults that can be sexually transmitted. Allergic pink eye is usually accompanied by intense itching, tearing, and swelling of the eye membranes. Frequent causes include seasonal pollens, animal dander, and dust. It is frequently seasonal, and goes along with other typical ""allergy"" symptoms such as sneezing, itchy nose, or scratchy throat. Chemical pink eye can result when any irritating substance enters the eyes. Common offending irritants are household cleaners, sprays of any kind, smoke, smog, and industrial pollutants. Prompt, thorough washing of the eyes with very large amounts of water is very important. Persistent conjunctivitis can be a sign of an uncommon underlying illness in the body. Most often these are rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conjunctivitis is also seen in Kawasaki's disease (a rare disease associated with fever in infants and young children) and certain inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Bright redness of the whites of the eyes can also occur when the tiny blood vessels covering the whites of the eyes rupture from trauma or changes in pressure within the head (for example, after forceful laughing or vomiting, when diving under water, or even bending upside down). This condition is called subconjunctival hemorrhage, and, while it can appear impressive, it is generally harmless."
Reduction division,"Reduction division: The first cell division in meiosis, the process by which germ cells are formed. In reduction division, the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46 chromosomes) to haploid (23 chromosomes). Also known as first meiotic division and first meiosis."
Referral,"Referral: The recommendation of a medical or paramedical professional. If you get a referral to ophthalmology, for example, you are being sent to the eye doctor. In HMOs and other managed care schemes, a referral is usually necessary to see any practitioner or specialist other than your primary care physician (PCP), if you want the service to be covered. The referral is obtained from your PCP, who may require a telephone or office consultation first. The term ""referral"" can refer both to the act of sending you to another doctor or therapist, and to the actual paper authorizing your visit."
Reflex,"Reflex: An involuntary reaction. For example, the corneal reflex is the blink that occurs upon irritation of the eye."
Reflux,Reflux: The term used when liquid backs up into the esophagus from the stomach.
Refraction,"Refraction: In opthalmology, the bending of light that takes place within the human eye. Refractive errors include nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. Lenses can be used to control the amount of refraction and correct those errors."
Refractory,"Refractory: Not yielding, or not yielding readily, to treatment."
Regimen,"Regimen: A plan or a regulated course, such as a diet, exercise, or treatment, that is designed to give a good result. A low-salt diet is one type of dietary regimen."
Regional enteritis,"Regional enteritis: Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine primarily in the small and large intestines but which can occur anywhere in the digestive system between the mouth and the anus. Named after Burrill Crohn who described the disease in 1932. The disease usually affects persons in their teens or early twenties. It tends to be chronic, recurrent with periods of remission and exacerbation. In the early stages, it causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. With time, deeper and larger ulcers develop, causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel and the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed, leading to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs. When only the large intestine (colon) is involved, the condition is called Crohn's colitis. When only the small intestine is involved, the condition is called Crohn's enteritis. When only the end of the small intestine (the terminal ileum) is involved, it is termed terminal ileitis. When both the small intestine and the large intestine are involved, the condition is called Crohn's enterocolitis (or ileocolitis). Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss can be symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Diagnosis is by barium enema, barium x-ray of the small bowel, and colonoscopy. Treatment includes medications for inflammation, immune suppression, antibiotics, or surgery. (The disease is also called granulomatous enteritis)."
Regurgitation,"Regurgitation: A backward flowing. For example, vomiting is a regurgitation of food from the stomach, and the sloshing of blood back into the heart when a heart valve is incompetent is a regurgitation of blood."
Rehab,Rehab: An abbreviation for rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation,"Rehabilitation: The process of helping a person who has suffered an illness or injury restore lost skills and so regain maximum self-sufficiency. For example, rehabilitation work after a stroke may help the patient walk and speak clearly again."
Rehydration,"Rehydration: The process of restoring lost water (dehydration) to the body tissues and fluids. Prompt rehydration is imperative whenever dehydration occurs, from diarrhea, exposure, lack of drinking water, or medication use. Rehydration can be by the oral route or by the intravenous administration of fluids."
Reinnervation,Reinnervation: Restoration of nerve function after it has been lost. Reinnervation may occur spontaneously or be achieved by nerve grafting. The EMG (electromyogram) may show evidence of denervation with subsequent reinnervation in motor neuron diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) because the remaining healthy motor neurons can reinnervate the denervated muscles.
Rejection,"Rejection: In transplantation biology, when the body's immune system attacks transplanted cells, tissues, or organs. For example, a transplanted kidney may be rejected."
Relapse,Relapse: The return of signs and symptoms of a disease after a remission.
REM sleep,"REM sleep: REM sleep is the portion of sleep when there are rapid eye movements (REMs). Dreams occur during REM sleep. We typically have 3 to 5 periods of REM sleep per night. They occur at intervals of 1-2 hours and are quite variable in length. An episode of REM sleep may last 5 minutes or over an hour. About 20% of sleep is REM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, perhaps an hour and half of that time, 90 minutes, is REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by a number of other features including rapid, low-voltage brain waves detectable on the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, irregular breathing and heart rate and involuntary muscle jerks. By contrast, NREM (non-REM) sleep is dreamless sleep. During NREM, the brain waves on the EEG are typically slow and of high voltage, the breathing and heart rate are slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth of sleep leading to REM sleep. About 80% of sleep is NREM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, all but maybe an hour and a half is spent in dreamless NREM sleep."
Remedy,Remedy: Something that consistently helps treat or cure a disease.
Remission,Remission: Disappearance of the signs and symptoms of cancer or other disease. A remission can be temporary or permanent.
Renal,"Renal: Having to do with the kidney. For example, renal cancer is cancer of the kidneys."
Renal calculi,"Renal calculi: Kidney stones. A common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Occurs in 1 in 20 people at some time in their life. Development of the stones is related to decreased urine volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine collecting area (the pelvis) of the kidney and may range in size from tiny to staghorn stones the size of the renal pelvis itself . The pain is usually of sudden onset, very severe and colicky (intermittent), not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Predisposing factors may include recent reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause hyperuricemia (high uric acid) and a history of gout. Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones may not. There are several factors which influence the ability to pass a stone. These include the size of the person, prior stone passage, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, and the size of the stone. A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. If a stone does not pass, urologic intervention may be needed. The process of stone formation is also called nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis. ""Nephrolithiasis"" is derived from the Greek nephros- (kidney) + lithos (stone) = kidney stone ""Urolithiasis"" is from the French word ""urine"" which, in turn, stems from the Latin ""urina"" and the Greek ""ouron"" meaning urine = urine stone."
Renal stone,"Renal stone: A stone in the kidney (or lower down in the urinary tract). Also called a kidney stone. Renal stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones occur in 1 in 20 people at some time in their life. The development of the stones is related to decreased urine volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine collecting area (the pelvis) of the kidney and may range in size from tiny to staghorn stones the size of the renal pelvis itself. The cystine stones (below) compared in size to a quarter (a U.S. $0.25 coin) were obtained from the kidney of a young woman by percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL), a procedure for crushing and removing the dense stubborn stones characteristic of cystinuria. The pain with kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and colicky (intermittent), not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Factors predisposing to kidney stones include recent reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause hyperuricemia (high uric acid) and a history of gout. Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones may not.

""Nephrolithiasis"" is derived from the Greek nephros- (kidney) lithos (stone) = kidney stone ""Urolithiasis"" stems from the Latin ""urina"" and the Greek ""ouron"" meaning urine = urine stone. The stones themselves are called renal caluli. The word ""calculus"" (plural: calculi) is the Latin word for pebble."
rep,"rep: 1) Roentgen equivalent physical, a unit of absorbed radiation approximately equivalent to one roentgen. 2) An abbreviation for repetition when referring to an exercise maneuver. 3) An abbreviation for representative of sales for a pharmaceutical or health products company."
Reproduction,"Reproduction: The production of offspring. Reproduction need not be sexual; for example, yeast can reproduce by budding."
Reproductive cells,"Reproductive cells: The eggs and sperm are the reproductive cells. Each mature reproductive cell is haploid in that it has a single set of 23 chromosomes containing half the usual DNA amount. Except for the eggs and sperm, each cell in the human body -- there are 100 trillion cells in each of us -- contains the entire human genome, all the genetic information necessary to build a human being, and this information is encoded within the cell nucleus in 6 billion base pairs, subunits of DNA, packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes, one chromosome in each pair coming from each parent. The reproductive cells -- the eggs and sperm -- are thus notable exceptions to the usual rules concerning chromosomes, genes, and DNA."
"Reproductive organs, female","Reproductive organs, female: The internal genital structures of the female include the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus (womb) and vagina. The ovaries or ""egg sacs"" are a pair of female reproductive organs located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries have two functions: they produce eggs (ova) and female hormones. Each month, during the menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a Fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone). These hormones control the development of female body characteristics, such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. The Fallopian tubes, one on each side, transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus (the womb). The Fallopian tubes have small hair-like projections called cilia on the cells of the lining. These tubal cilia are essential to the movement of the egg through the tube into the uterus. These tubes bear the name of the 16th-century Italian physician and anatomist Gabriele Falloppio. The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ located in a woman's lower abdomen, between the bladder and rectum. The upper part is the corpus. The corpus is made up of two layers of tissue. In women of childbearing age, the inner layer of the uterus (endometrium) goes through a series of monthly changes known as the menstrual cycle. Each month, endometrial tissue grows and thickens in preparation to receive a fertilized egg. Menstruation occurs when this tissue is not used, disintegrates, and passes out through the vagina. The outer layer of the corpus (myometrium) is a muscle that expands during pregnancy to hold the growing fetus and contracts during labor to deliver the child. The cervix is the lower, narrow part of the uterus. It forms a canal that opens into the vagina. The vagina is the muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of the body. The word ""vagina"" is a Latin word meaning ""a sheath or scabbard"", a scabbard into which one might slide and sheath a sword. The ""sword"" in the case of the anatomic vagina was presumably the penis."
"Research, controlled","Research, controlled: A study that compared results from a treated group and a control group. The control group may receive no treatment, a placebo, or a different treatment. See also blinded study, control group, double-blinded study."
Resection,Resection: Surgical removal of part of an organ.
Reservoir,"1. A place where something such as water is kept in reserve.
2. The part of a device in which something is kept in reserve or stored, as an Ommaya reservoir.
3. For an infectious agent, an animal, person, plant, soil, or other substance in which the agent normally abides. See: Reservoir of infection.
From the French reservoir, from reserver meaning to reserve."
infection,"Reservoir of infection: Any person, animal, plant, soil or substance in which an infectious agent normally lives and multiplies. The reservoir typically harbors the infectious agent without injury to itself and serves as a source from which other individuals can be infected. The infectious agent primarily depends on the reservoir for its survival. It is from the reservoir that the infectious substance is transmitted to a human or another susceptible host."
Resident,"Resident: In medicine, a physician who has finished medical school and is receiving training in a specialized area, such as surgery, internal medicine, pathology, or radiology. Board certification in all medical and surgical specialties requires the satisfactory completion of a residency program and successful completion of a specialty board examination."
Residual,"Residual: Something left behind. With residual disease, the disease has not been eradicated."
Resistance,"Resistance: Opposition to something, or the ability to withstand something. For example, some forms of the staphylococcus bacterium are resistant to treatment with antibiotics."
Resorption,"Resorption: The process of losing substance. For example, when bone is surgically reshaped, it undergoes both new formation and resorption."
Respiration,Respiration: The act of inhaling and exhaling air in order to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide.
Respiratory,Respiratory: Having to do with respiration.
Respiratory depression,"Respiratory depression: another term for hypoventilation, meaning that ventilation of the lungs is inadequate to perform needed gas exchange. Sometimes a respiratory rate of fewer than 12 breaths per minute is used as a definition of respiratory depression. Hypoventilation leads to an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis (a decrease in blood pH). Respiratory depression can result from a number of different disease processes. It can also be a side effect of medications, such as opioid pain medications and sedatives."
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS),"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): Formerly known as hyaline membrane disease, a syndrome of respiratory difficulty in newborn infants caused by a deficiency of a molecule called surfactant. RDS almost always occurs in newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation. The more premature the baby is, the greater is the chance of developing RDS. RDS is more likely to occur in newborns of diabetic mothers. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, is secreted by lung cells. The air-fluid interface of the film of water lining the alveoli of the lung (where the exchange of oxygen and CO2 occurs) exerts large forces that cause the alveoli to close if surfactant is deficient. Lung compliance is decreased, and the work of inflating the stiff lungs is increased. The preterm newborn is further handicapped because his or her ribs are more easily deformed (compliant). Breathing efforts therefore result in deep sternal (breastbone) retractions but poor air entry if the ribs are compliant compared with the lungs. This results in diffuse atelectasis (collapse of the lungs). Rapid, labored, grunting respirations usually develop immediately or within a few hours after delivery, with retractions above and below the breastbone and flaring of the nostrils. The extent of atelectasis (lung collapse) and the severity of respiratory failure progressively worsen. Not all infants with RDS have signs of respiratory distress; extremely low birth weight newborns (i.e., < 1000 g) may be unable to initiate respirations at birth because their lungs are so stiff; they may fail to initiate breathing in the delivery room. The incidence of RDS can be reduced by assessment of fetal lung maturity to determine the optimal time for delivery. When a fetus must be delivered prematurely, giving betamethasone systemically to the mother for at least 24 hours before delivery induces fetal surfactant production and usually reduces the risk of RDS or decreases its severity. If untreated, severe RDS can result in multiple organ failure and death. However, if the newborn's ventilation is adequately supported, surfactant production will begin and RDS will resolve by 4 or 5 days. Recovery is hastened by treatment with pulmonary surfactant."
Respiratory insufficiency,Respiratory insufficiency: The condition in which the lungs cannot take in sufficient oxygen or expell sufficient carbon dioxide to meet the needs of the cells of the body. Also called pulmonary insufficiency.
Respiratory rate,"Respiratory rate: The number of breaths per minute or, more formally, the number of movements indicative of inspiration and expiration per unit time. In practice, the respiratory rate is usually determined by counting the number of times the chest rises or falls per minute. The aim of measuring respiratory rate is to determine whether the respirations are
normal, abnormally fast (tachypnea), abnormally slow (bradypnea), or nonexistent (apnea)."
Respiratory syncytial virus,"Respiratory syncytial virus: A virus that causes mild respiratory infections, colds, and coughs in adults and can produce severe respiratory problems, including bronchitis and pneumonia, in young children and anyone with compromised immune, cardiac, or pulmonary systems. Abbreviated RSV. RSV is spread via respiratory secretions and is highly contagious. Infections usually occur during annual community outbreaks, often lasting 4 to 6 months, during the late fall, winter, or early spring. RSV typically features fever, prominent nasal secretions, and congestion coupled with wheezing for 1 to 2 weeks. Having immunity against RSV requires having a continuous, solid level of antibodies against the virus. There is particular concern about RSV occurring in premature babies, because their immune systems lack maturity and antibodies. There is no RSV vaccine."
Rest,"Rest: 1. Repose. Relaxation.
2. A fragment of embryonic tissue that has been retained after the period of embryonic development. Also called an embryonic rest."
Resting phase,"Resting phase: More appropriately called interphase. The interval in the cell cycle between two cell divisions when the individual chromosomes cannot be distinguished, interphase was once thought to be the resting phase but it is far from a time of rest for the cell. It is the time when DNA is replicated in the cell nucleus."
Restless Anal Syndrome,"Restless anal syndrome is a proposed variant of restless legs syndrome described in a 2021 case report in relation to an infection with the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). It was described by doctors in Japan after a patient with COVID-19 disease developed restless, deep anal discomfort associated with an urge to move that worsened with rest and in the evening and improved with exercise."
Restless leg syndrome,"Restless leg syndrome: An uncomfortable (creeping, crawling, tingling, pulling, twitching, tearing, aching, throbbing, prickling, or grabbing) sensation in the calves that occurs while sitting or while lying down. The result is an uncontrollable urge to relieve the uncomfortable sensation by
moving the legs. Restless leg syndrome is a common cause of painful legs. The leg pain typically eases with motion of the legs and becomes more noticeable at rest, worsens during the early evening or later at night, and may cause insomnia."
Restless legs,Restless legs: See: Restless leg syndrome.
Resuscitation,"Resuscitation: The procedure of restoring to life, as in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Retina,"Retina: The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the eye, senses light, and creates impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain. There is a small area, called the macula, in the retina that contains special light-sensitive cells. The macula allows us to see fine details clearly. The eye has a number of other components. These include the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, optic nerve and vitreous. The cornea is the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye. The iris is the colored part of the eye that helps regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil is the dark aperture in the iris that determines how much light is let into the eye. The lens is the transparent structure inside the eye that focuses light rays onto the retina. The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to the brain and carries the impulses formed by the retina to the visual cortex of the brain. The vitreous humor is a clear gel that fills the middle of the eye."
Retinoid,"Retinoid: 1. Vitamin A (retinol) or a naturally occurring or synthetic substance chemically related to it. (Retinoid literally means ""like retinol."")
2. In ophthalmology, resembling the retina."
Retinopathy,"Retinopathy: Any disease of the retina, the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. The type of retinopathy is often specified, such as arteriosclerotic retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, or hypertensive retinopathy."
Retromingent,"Retromingent: Urinating backwards. Also an animal such as a raccoon that urinates backwards. As in: ""You have revealed yourself as a miserable, carping, retromingent vigilante, and I for one am sick of wasting my time communicating with you"" (Benjamin C. Bradlee, Editor, The Washington Post). From the Latin retro- (back) + mingent from mingere (to urinate)."
Reuptake,"Reuptake: The reabsorption of a secreted substance by the cell that originally produced and secreted it. The process of reuptake, for example, affects serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a chemical messenger). It is produced by nerve cells in the brain and is used by nerves to communicate with one another. A nerve releases the serotonin that it has produced into the space surrounding it. The serotonin either travels across that space and attaches to receptors on the surface of nearby nerves or it attaches to receptors on the surface of the nerve that produced it, to be taken up by the nerve, recycled, and released again. This process is referred to as reuptake. A balance is reached for serotonin between attachment to the nearby nerves and reuptake. A medication that acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) blocks the reuptake of serotonin and thereby changes the level of serotonin in the brain. Reuptake is sometimes written as re-uptake."
Reverse transcriptase,"Reverse transcriptase: An enzyme that permits DNA to be made, using RNA as the template. A retrovirus, such as the HIV virus, can propagate itself by converting its RNA into DNA with reverse transcriptase."
RF,RF: Rheumatoid factor.
Rh factor,"Rh factor: An antigen found on the surface of red blood cells. Red blood cells with the antigen are said to be Rh positive (Rh+). Those without the surface antigen are said to be Rh negative (Rh-). Blood used in transfusions much match donors for Rh status as well as for ABO blood group, as Rh- patients will develop anemia if given R+ blood. Rh typing is also important during abortion, miscarriage, pregnancy, and birth, as mother and fetus may not be Rh-compatible. Rh stands for rhesus monkeys, in whose blood this antigen was first found. See also RhoGAM, Rh incompatibility."
Rhabdomyolysis,"Rhabdomyolysis: A condition in which skeletal muscle is broken down, releasing muscle enzymes and electrolytes from inside the muscle cells. Risks of rhabdomyolysis include muscle breakdown and kidney failure because the cellular component myo-
globin is toxic to the kidneys. Rhabdomyolysis is relatively uncommon, but it most often occurs as the result of extensive muscle damage as, for example, in crush injury or electrical shock. Drugs or toxins may also cause this disorder. Underlying diseases that can also lead to rhabdomyolysis include collagen vascular diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus."
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of joints. Rheumatoid disease can also involve inflammation of tissues in other areas of the body, such as the lungs, heart, and eyes. Because it can affect multiple organs of the body, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic illness. Although rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic illness, patients may experience long periods without symptoms or signs."
Rhinitis,Rhinitis: Irritation of the nose.
Rhinoplasty,"Rhinoplasty: Plastic surgery on the nose, known familiarly as a nose job. Rhinoplasty is a facial cosmetic procedure that is usually performed to enhance the appearance of the nose. During this type of rhinoplasty, the nasal cartilage and bones are modified, or tissue is added. Rhinoplasty is also performed to repair nasal fractures and other structural problems. In these cases, the goal is to restore preinjury appearance or to create a normal appearance."
Rhinorrhea,"Rhinorrhea: Medical term for a runny nose. From the Greek words ""rhinos"" meaning ""of the nose"" and ""rhoia"" meaning ""a flowing."""
Rhinovirus,"Rhinovirus: a virus type of the Picornavirus family that causes many common colds and upper respiratory infections. Less commonly, these viruses may cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Rhinoviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses and over 100 types identified. Rhinovirus infection is easily spread from person-to-person. Symptoms of rhinovirus infection usually develop within 12-72 hours of exposure and include sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, hoarseness, headache, ear pressure, sneezing, and nasal irritation. Fever, when present, is typically low-grade. Symptoms of Rhinovirus infection usually last for 7-11 days and resolve on their own. Treatment includes rest, hydration, and decongestant or antihistamine medications."
Rhogam,"RhoGAM: RhO(D) immune globulin, an injectable drug that is used to protect an Rh+ fetus from antibodies in an Rh- mother's blood and to prevent Rh allergy in the mother."
Rib,"Rib: One of the 12 paired arches of bone that form the skeletal structure of the chest wall (the rib cage). The ribs attach to the vertebrae of the spine in the back. The 12 pairs of ribs consist of 7 pairs of ribs that attach to the sternum in the front and are known as true, or sternal, ribs; and 5 pairs of lower ribs that do not connect directly to the sternum and are known as false ribs. The upper 3 false ribs connect to the costal cartilages of the ribs just above them. The last 2 false ribs usually have no anchor in front and are known as floating, fluctuating, or vertebral ribs."
Rib cage,"Rib cage: The structure formed by the thoracic vertebrae and ribs, the sternum (breastbone), and the costal cartilages (that attach the ribs to the sternum). A cage is an enclosure made of ""open work"" that usually houses animals. The rib cage was thought to resemble an animal cage (although the largest ""animals"" it holds are the heart and lungs). The rib cage is also called the thoracic cage."
Ribonucleic acid (RNA),Ribonucleic acid (RNA): A nucleic acid molecule similar to DNA but containing ribose rather than deoxyribose. RNA is formed upon a DNA template. There are several classes of RNA molecules. They play crucial roles in protein synthesis and other cell activities:
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP),"Ribonucleoprotein (RNP): A combination of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein. In autoimmune diseases, antibodies can form against ribonucleoprotein. They are called anti-RNP antibodies."
Rift Valley fever,"Rift Valley fever: A viral disease that is acute, causes fever in domestic animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels) and humans, and is associated with mosquito-borne epidemics during years of heavy rainfall. Rift Valley fever is more deadly than West Nile virus. Rift Valley fever has not occurred in the United States (through 2003). However, there has been concern that it could become permanently established in the US if it does enter the country. People with Rift Valley fever usually have flu-like symptoms but may develop complications such as kidney or liver disease. In outbreaks, the death rate has been about 15% for those seriously ill with Rift Valley fever. Rift Valley fever is caused by the RVF virus. It is found mainly in regions of eastern and southern Africa where sheep and cattle are raised. RVF primarily affects livestock and can cause disease in a large number of domestic animals (a situation referred to as an ""epizootic""). An RVF epizootic can lead to an epidemic among people exposed to animals with RFV. The most notable epizootic of RVF to date occurred in Kenya in 1950-1951 and resulted in the death of an estimated 100,000 sheep. The first epidemic of RVF in West Africa was reported in 1987. Epizootics of RVF tend to occur during years in which there is heavy rainfall and localized flooding. The excessive rain allows mosquito eggs, usually of the genus Aedes, to hatch. The mosquito eggs are infected with the RVF virus, and the resulting mosquitoes transfer the virus to the livestock on which they feed. Once the livestock are infected, other species of mosquitoes can become infected from the animals and spread the disease. People get RVF from the bites of mosquitoes. (In addition, it is possible that the virus can be transmitted by other biting insects.) People can also get the RVF by exposure to the blood or other body fluids of infected animals. This exposure may be in slaughtering or handling of infected animals or by touching contaminated meat during the preparation of food. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has resulted from contact with laboratory specimens containing the virus. Most people with RVF have no symptoms or only a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. People with more serious symptoms usually experience fever, weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, they recover within two days to one week after the onset of illness. But RFV can progress to hemorrhagic fever (bleeding which can lead to shock), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain which can cause headaches, seizures, or coma), and eye disease. About 1% of people infected with RVF die of the disease. A common long-term complication of RVF involves the eye. It is due to inflammation of the retina (at the back of the eye), About 1-10% of affected patients suffer some permanent loss of vision. There is no established treatment for RVF. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in animal trials. Interferon, immune modulators, and convalescent-phase plasma may possibly help in the treatment of RVF. Sleeping outdoors at night in regions where outbreaks occur risks exposure to mosquito vectors. Animal herdsmen, abattoir workers, and other individuals who work with animals in RVF-endemic areas (areas where the virus is present) have an increased risk of infection. Persons in high-risk professions, such as veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers, have an increased chance of contracting the virus from an infected animal. International travelers increase their chances of getting the disease when they visit RVF-endemic locations during periods when sporadic cases or epidemics are occurring. To avoid RFV, the use of mosquito repellents and bednets is strongly recommended. Exposure to blood and tissues of animals that may be infected is taboo."
Right atrium,Right atrium: The right upper chamber of the heart. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the vena cava and pumps it into the right ventricle which then sends it to the lungs to be oxygenated. 
Rigor,"Rigor: A word with two different but related meanings in medicine: The alternate spelling rigour is chiefly British. From the French, from the Latin rigor, meaning stiffness, from rigere, to be stiff."
Rigor mortis,"Rigor mortis: Literally, the stiffness of death. The rigidity of a body after death. Rigor mortis is a good example of a Latin term (one in this case that was coined in the 19th century) remaining intact in contemporary medical usage (and crime writing). Rigor mortis is due to a biochemical change in the muscles that occurs several hours after death, though the time of its onset after death depends on the ambient temperature. The biochemical basis of rigor mortis is hydrolysis in muscle of ATP, the energy source required for movement. Without ATP, myosin molecules adhere to actin filaments and the muscles become rigid."
Ringing in the ears,"Ringing in the ears: Medically called tinnitus, can be due to many causes including ear infections, fluid in the ears, Meniere syndrome (the combination of tinnitus and deafness), some medications such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aging, and ear trauma (such as from the noise of planes, firearms, or loud music). In rare situations, tinnitus may also be due to an aneurysm or an acoustic neuroma (a benign tumor on the acoustic nerve). Woodwind players are more likely to experience tinnitus than other orchestral players, probably because they usually sit just in front of the brass. If tinnitus persists or its cause is unknown, a hearing test (audiogram) should be done. Measures can be taken to lessen the intensity of tinnitus or to mask it."
Ringworm (tinea),Ringworm (tinea): Ringworm is a fungal infection of the skin previously thought to be due to a parasite (worm). The medical term for ringworm is tinea. The skin infections are sometimes characterized by round lesions in the upper layers of the skin. Fungi that cause ringworm are known as dermatophytes. 
RIRS (retrograde intrarenal surgery),"RIRS (retrograde intrarenal surgery): Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) is a procedure for doing surgery within the kidney using a viewing tube called a fiberoptic endoscope. In RIRS the scope is placed through the urethra (the urinary opening) into the bladder and then through the ureter into the urine-collecting part of the kidney. The scope thus is moved retrograde (up the urinary tract system) to within the kidney (intrarenal). RIRS may be done to remove a stone. The stone is seen through the scope and can then be manipulated or crushed by an ultrasound probe or evaporated by a laser probe or grabbed by small forceps, etc. RIRS is performed by a specialist, an urologist (endourologist) with special expertise in RIRS. The procedure is usually done under general or spinal anesthesia. The advantages of RIRS over open surgery include a quicker solution of the problem, the elimination of prolonged pain after surgery, and much faster recovery."
Risk factor,"Risk factor: Something that increases a person's chances of developing a disease. For example, cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, and obesity is a risk factor for heart disease."
RLL,"RLL: Right lower lobe, the lower-right lobe of the lung."
RLQ,"RLQ: Right lower quadrant, the lower-right quarter of the abdomen."
RML,"RML: Right middle lobe, the middle-right lobe of the lung."
RNA,RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
RNA virus,"RNA virus: A virus in which the genetic material is RNA. The RNA may be either double- or single-stranded. There are 6 classes of viruses. The DNA viruses constitute classes I and II. The RNA viruses make up the remaining classes. Class III viruses have a double-stranded RNA genome. Class IV viruses have a positive single-stranded RNA genome, the genome itself acting as mRNA (messenger RNA. Class V viruses have a negative single-stranded RNA genome used as a template for mRNA synthesis. Class VI viruses have a positive single- stranded RNA genome but with a DNA intermediate not only in replication but also in mRNA synthesis."
Robust,"Robust: In statistics, a term applied to a test or procedure that is not seriously disturbed by violations of the assumptions on which it is based. For example, it was an ""unexpected and robust difference in the rate of events."" (Dr. Harold J. Burstein, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Oct 9, 2003)"
Rock (drug),"Rock (drug): A street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a ready-to-use free base for smoking. Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine using ether, rock cocaine (also called crack) is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. On the illicit market, rock or crack, is sold in small, inexpensive dosage units. Smoking this form of the drug delivers large quantities of cocaine to the lungs, producing effects comparable to intravenous injection. These effects are felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense, and do not last long. Cocaine is the most potent stimulant of natural origin, a bitter addictive anesthetic (pain blocker) which is extracted from the leaves of the coca scrub (Erythroxylon coca) indigenous to the Andean highlands of South America. (From the name of the plant came the name cocaine and its street name coke and Coke as in Coca Cola, which once contained it). There is great risk associated with cocaine use whether the drug is ingested by snorting, injecting, or smoking. Excessive doses of cocaine may lead to seizures and death from respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), or heart failure. There is no specific antidote for cocaine overdose. Evidence suggests that users who smoke or inject cocaine may be at even greater risk than those who snort it. Cocaine smokers suffer from acute respiratory problems including coughing, shortness of breath, and severe chest pains with lung trauma and bleeding. In addition, it appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted."
Rod,"Rod: A type of specialized light-sensitive cell (photoreceptor) in the retina of the eye that provides side vision and the ability to see objects in dim light (night vision). By contrast, the cones are the retinal photoreceptors that provide sharp central vision and color vision."
Roentgenology,"Roentgenology: Radiology, the science of radiation and, specifically, the use of both ionizing (like X-ray) and nonionizing (like ultrasound) modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Roentgenology is named for Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen who discovered X-rays. Roentgen, a professor of physics in Germany, wanted to prove his hypothesis that cathode rays could penetrate substances besides air. When he saw that he could film his thumb and forefinger and their bones on a screen, the story goes that he replaced the screen with a photographic plate and X-rayed his wife's hand. Roentgen's report of his findings, ""On a New Kind of Rays,"" was published by the Physical-Medical Society of Wurzburg in December 1895."
Rohypnol,"Rohypnol: The trade name for flunitrazepam, which has been abused as a 'date rape' drug. Rohypnol produces sedative-hypnotic effects including muscle relaxation and amnesia. It can produce physical and psychological dependence and can be lethal when mixed with alcohol and/or other depressants."
Rosacea,"Rosacea: A chronic skin disease that causes persistent redness over the areas of the face and nose that normally blush: mainly the forehead, the chin, and the lower half of the nose. The tiny blood vessels in these areas enlarge (dilate) and become more visible through the skin, appearing like tiny red lines (telangiectasias). Pimples that look like teenage acne can occur. Rosacea occurs most often between the ages of 30 and 60, especially in people with fair skin. It affects both sexes. Although it tends to occur more in women than in men, it is often worse in men. In most people the symptoms come and go, although it tends to worsen with time. Rosacea can be treated but not cured. Topical antibiotics such as metronidazole, and oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, are often used. Short-term topical cortisone (steroid) preparations of the right strength may also be used to reduce local inflammation. Avoiding smoking, food and drink that cause flushing (such as spicy food, hot beverages, and alcoholic drinks), and other triggers such as temperature extremes helps to minimize symptoms."
Rotator cuff,"Rotator cuff: A group of four tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. Each of these tendons attaches to a muscle that moves the shoulder in a specific direction. The four muscles whose tendons form the rotator cuff are the subscapularis muscle, which moves the arm by turning it inward (internal rotation); the supraspinatus muscle, which is responsible for elevating the arm and moving it away from the body; the infraspinatus muscle, which assists the lifting of the arm during outward turning (external rotation) of the arm; and the teres minor muscle, which also helps in the outward turning (external rotation) of the arm. Damage to the rotator cuff is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain."
Round,Round: To go around and see a patient in a hospital or other in-patient setting.
Roundworm,"Roundworm: A type of parasitic worm that hatches in the intestines and lives there. The eggs of the roundworm usually enter the body through contaminated water or food or on fingers placed in the mouth after the hands have touched a contaminated object. Symptoms of roundworm infections include fatigue, weight loss, irritability, poor appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Treatment with medication results in a cure in about a week. Without treatment, anemia and malnutrition can develop. An example of a roundworm is Trichuris trichiura, also known as the human whipworm. This worm is found worldwide, but infections are most frequent in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices, and among children. Infection with T. trichiura is not foreign to the US; it occurs in the southern US."
RP,RP: Retinitis pigmentosa.
RPR test,"RPR test: Rapid plasma reagin, a blood test for syphilis that looks for an antibody that is present in the bloodstream when a patient has syphilis. A negative (nonreactive) RPR is compatible with a person not having syphilis, but in the early stages of the disease, the RPR often gives false negative results. Conversely, a false positive RPR can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy. See also syphilis; syphilis test, VDRL."
RSV,RSV: RSV in clinical medicine is the abbreviation for respiratory syncytial virus. See: Respiratory syncytial virus.
RT,"RT: 1. Respiratory therapist.
2. Radiation therapy.
3. Reverse transcriptase."
RT-PCR,RT-PCR: a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA). The technique consists of two parts: RT-PCR has been used to measure viral load with HIV and may also be used with other RNA viruses such as measles and mumps.
RUL,"RUL: Right upper lobe, the upper-right lobe of the lung."
Rule out,"Rule out: Term used in medicine, meaning to eliminate or exclude something from consideration. For example, a normal chest x-ray may ""rule out"" pneumonia."
Runny nose,"Runny nose: The production of extra mucus by the nose. Rhinorrhea is the medical term for this common problem. The nose makes extra mucus whenever something that is in the nose, such as pollen or dust, needs to be removed. Mucus formation is also part of the histamine reaction to allergies and of the body's defenses during respiratory infections."
Rupture,Rupture: A break or tear in any organ (such as the spleen) or soft tissue (such as the achilles tendon).
RUQ,"RUQ: Right upper quadrant, the upper-right quarter of the abdomen."
RV (rotavirus),"RV (rotavirus): RV is an abbreviation for rotavirus, a leading cause of severe winter diarrhea in young children. There are currently two rotavirus vaccines available in the U.S. Rotavirus was discovered in 1973 and took its name from its wheel- like appearance (rota means wheel in Latin)."
RVF,"RVF: 1. Rift Valley fever, the disease and the virus that causes it.
2. Right ventricular failure, failure of the right ventricle of the heart.
3. Residual volume fraction, a measure proportional to the ambulatory venous pressure."
SA node,"SA node: The SA node (SA stands for sinoatrial) is one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system, the system that controls the heart rate. This stunningly designed system generates electrical impulses and conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood. The SA node is the heart's natural pacemaker. The SA node consists of a cluster of cells that are situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The electrical impulses are generated there. The SA node is also called the sinus node. The electrical signal generated by the SA node moves from cell to cell down through the heart until it reaches the atrioventricular node (AV node), a cluster of cells situated in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles. The AV node serves as a gate that slows the electrical current before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have a chance to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart. The autonomic nervous system, the same part of the nervous system as controls the blood pressure, controls the firing of the SA node to trigger the start of the cardiac cycle. The autonomic nervous system can transmit a message quickly to the SA node so it in turn can increase the heart rate to twice normal within only 3 to 5 seconds. This quick response is important during exercise when the heart has to increase its beating speed to keep up with the body's increased demand for oxygen."
SAA,SAA: 1.Serum amyloid A (an acute-phase protein which increases early in the course of inflammation). 2. Spondylitis Association of America (for improving the lives of people with ankylosing spondylitis and related conditions and curing these diseases).
"Sabin, Florence R.","Sabin, Florence R.: (1871-1953) American anatomist and medical researcher. Her excellent and innovative work on the origins of the lymphatic system, blood cells, and immune system cells, and on the pathology of tuberculosis was well-recognized during her lifetime. She was also a trailblazer for women in science. She was the first woman to hold a full professorship at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and the first woman to head a department at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. In her retirement years, she pursued a second career as a public health activist in Colorado, and in 1951 received a Lasker Award for this work. Florence Rena Sabin was born in Central City, Colorado, the daughter of George K. Sabin, a mining engineer, and Serena Miner Sabin, a schoolteacher. Her mother died of puerperal fever when Sabin was seven. She and her older sister Mary grew up in Denver, in Chicago with their uncle Albert Sabin, and in Vermont with their paternal grandparents. Both sisters attended Vermont Academy and Smith College. She was encouraged by the college physician to study medicine at Johns Hopkins' new co-educational medical school. She received her B.S. from Smith College in 1893, then taught high school for three years to earn enough to fund her first year of medical training. Sabin entered the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1896. Her skill and originality in laboratory classes attracted the attention of the anatomist Franklin P. Mall. He became Sabin's mentor, advocate, and intellectual role model, encouraging her pursuit of ""pure"" (rather than applied) science, and suggesting two projects which would help establish her research reputation. One of these was a three-dimensional model of a newborn baby's brainstem, which became the basis of a widely used textbook, An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain, published in 1901. The other project was an investigation of the embryological development of the lymphatic system. After a year's internship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sabin won a research fellowship and subsequently published two well-received papers. In 1902, she became the first woman faculty member at Johns Hopkins, teaching embryology and histology in the Department of Anatomy. She was promoted to associate professor in 1905, and to full professor in 1917, becoming the first woman to hold that rank at Johns Hopkins. Sabin stayed on the faculty at Johns Hopkins until 1925, and during that time distinguished herself both as a researcher and a teacher. She did important work on the origins of the lymphatic system, demonstrating (by injecting colored substances into the lymphatic channels) that its structures were formed from the embryo's veins rather than from other tissues, as other researchers believed. She also investigated the origins of blood vessels, blood cells, and connective tissue. To do this, she perfected the technique of supravital staining, which allowed the study of the living cells. Although she was an inspiring teacher and enjoyed working with her students, by the early 1920s, Sabin was longing to devote her full energies to her research. In 1923, Simon Flexner, director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, invited her to join the Institute, and head its Department of Cellular Studies. She accepted his offer, and began her work there in 1925, the first woman to be appointed a full member at the Rockefeller Institute. At the Rockefeller Institute, Sabin led research on the pathology of tuberculosis. Her team was part of a consortium of researchers working with the Medical Research Committee of the National Tuberculosis Association. During her thirteen years at Rockefeller, Sabin made major contributions to the understanding of tuberculosis, in particular by close study of the immune system responses to various chemical fractions isolated from the tuberculosis bacteria. Between 1930 and 1934, she also wrote a biography of her mentor, Franklin P. Mall, who had died in 1917. In 1938, Sabin retired from the Rockefeller Institute and moved back to Colorado to live with her sister Mary. She maintained a lively correspondence with her research colleagues, attended conferences, and served on various advisory and governing boards for organizations such as the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1944, she was asked to chair the Health Committee of Colorado's Post-War Planning Committee. This committee investigated health services in the state, drafted a series of health bills later known as the ""Sabin Program,"" and then campaigned for their passage. Four of the six bills were passed in 1947. After this, Sabin served as chair of an Interim Board of Health and Hospitals of Denver, and then as Manager of the Denver Department of Health and Charities until 1951. In the latter post, she launched a vigorous campaign to clean up the city, improve its sanitation, enforce health regulations for restaurants and food suppliers, and screen the population for tuberculosis and syphilis. Within two years, Denver's tuberculosis incidence was reduced from 54.7 to 27 per 100,000, and the syphilis frequency from 700 to 60 per 100,000. Sabin was probably the best-known American woman scientist of her era and received many awards and honors during her life. In 1924 she became the first woman president of the American Association of Anatomists, and the next year, the first woman elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences. In 1951, she received the Lasker Foundation's Public Service Award for her public health work in Colorado. The same year, the Medical School of the University of Colorado dedicated a new biological sciences building in her honor. In 1959 the State of Colorado honored her by placing a statue of Sabin in the National Statuary Hall of the US Capitol. Such honors acknowledged Sabin's substantial scientific and public health achievements, of course, and some also lauded her for being a role model for women in the professions."
Sacral,"Sacral: Referring to the sacrum. For example, sacral agenesis is absence of all or part of the sacrum."
Sacrococcygeal,Sacrococcygeal: Pertaining to both the sacrum and coccyx (the tailbone). Teratomas are often in the sacrococcygeal region in children.
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SI Joint Pain),"Sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SI Joint Pain): : Pain arising from abnormalities or injury of the sacroiliac (SI) joints. The SI joints connect the spine to the pelvis and are formed by the connection of the sacrum and the right and left iliac bones. The sacrum, or lower portion of the spine, is made up of five vertebrae that are fused together and do not move. The iliac bones are the two large bones that make up the pelvis. Many conditions can cause pain arising from the sacroiliac joint, including degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis), gout, rheumatoid arthritis, conditions that alter the normal walking pattern, and pregnancy (due to a normal relaxation of the ligaments in the joint that prepares the pelvis for childbirth). Treatment can involve anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and/or surgery."
Sacroiliitis,"Sacroiliitis is an inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, which is located on either side of the low back where the spine joins the hips (pelvic bones). Sacroiliitis can occur on one or both sides. Symptoms include pain in the buttocks or low back that can spread down the leg. Other symptoms can include stiffness in the hips or low back and worsening pain when sitting for a long time or when rolling over in bed. Causes of sacroiliitis can include any type of arthritis, infection, trauma, or pregnancy and childbirth."
Sacrum,"Sacrum: The large heavy bone at the base of the spine, which is made up of fused sacral vertebrae. The sacrum is located in the vertebral column, between the lumbar vertebrae and the coccyx. It is roughly triangular in shape and makes up the back wall of the pelvis. The female sacrum is wider and less curved than the male. The name comes from the Latin ""os sacrum"" (holy bone). Why it was sacred is matter of conjecture."
Sagittal,"Sagittal: A vertical plane passing through the standing body from front to back. The mid-sagital, or median, plane splits the body into left and right halves. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Salabrasion,"Salabrasion: A technique in which salt or a salt solution is used to abrade the skin, for example to remove the pigment from a tattoo or permanent makeup."
Salicylic acid,"Salicylic acid: A substance obtained from plants (white willow back and wintergreen leaves) and also synthesized which is versatile and possesses bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and keratolytic actions. Salicylic acid is used as a food preservative and as an antiseptic in toothpaste. It is a peeling agent in ointments, creams, gels, and shampoos applied to reduce the scaling of the skin or scalp in psoriasis. It is the active ingredient in many skin products for the treatment of acne since it causes skin cells to slough off more readily, preventing them from clogging up the pores. Salicylic acid reacts with acetic acid to acetylsalicylic acid, better known as aspirin. Salicylic acid is also chemically known as orthohydroxybenzoic acid."
Salient,Salient: Standing out. Projecting. Diseases may be classified or recognized by salient features.
Saline,"Saline: Relating to salt. As an adjective, ""saline"" means ""salty, containing salt."" As a noun ""saline"" is a salt solution, often adjusted to the normal salinity of the human body. Salt, in medicine, is referring to sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is common table salt and the salt concentrated in the earth and in sea water. Certain concentrations of both sodium and chloride in the blood are essential for normal body functions. Saline solutions are commonly used in medicine as fluid replacements to treat or prevent dehydration."
Saliva,"Saliva: a watery secretion in the mouth produced by the salivary glands that aids in the digestion of food. Saliva also serves to moisten and cleanse the mouth, including the tongue and teeth, and contains substances that can play a role in the prevention of infection. Saliva aids digestion by moistening food and contains enzymes that begin the digestion process. Also known as spit."
Salt,"Salt: In medicine, salt usually refers to sodium chloride, table salt, used for seasoning food, for the preservation of meat, etc. Salt is found in the earth and in sea water and is isolated by evaporation and crystallization from sea water and other water impregnated with particles of salt. The salt content of food is usually given in terms of ""Sodium."" For example, the label on a can of lentil soup may list ""Sodium 440mg"" per cup (242g). The adjective for ""salt"" most often used in medicine is not salty but ""saline."""
Salvage therapy,Salvage therapy: A final treatment for people who are not responsive to or cannot tolerate other available therapies for a particular condition.
Sanguine,"Sanguine: 1) Having a ruddy (reddish) complexion. 2) Cheerful, hopeful, confident, and optimistic; impulsive. The word ""sanguine"" from the Latin ""sanguineus"" for ""blood"" has long been used in English for things relating to the blood. A person who is ruddy in complexion is sanguine. His (or her) ruddy countenance was once thought to be due to their having a predominance of one of the four humors -- blood."
Sapphism,Sapphism: Female homosexuality. Named after the poet Sappho who lived on the Greek island of Lesbos (circa 600 BC). She was a lesbian by geography and sexual orientation. Also called lesbianism.
Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis: A disease of unknown origin that causes small lumps (granulomas) due to chronic inflammation in body tissues. Sarcoidosis can appear in almost any body organ, but it most often starts in the lungs or lymph nodes. It can also affect the eyes, liver, and skin; and less often it affects the spleen, bones, joints, skeletal muscles, heart, and central nervous system. In the majority of cases, the granulomas clear up with or without treatment. In cases where the granulomas do not heal and disappear, the tissues tend to remain inflamed and become scarred."
Sarcoma,"Sarcoma: One of a group of tumors usually arising from connective tissue. Most sarcomas are malignant. Many types are named after the type of cell, tissue, or structure involved, as in angiosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma,and osteosarcoma."
Scabicide,"Scabicide: A medication used to treat scabies. Although they were the most effective treatment, medications such as the lindane solution Kwell contain benzene, and are no longer recommended for use."
Scaffold,"Scaffold: 1. In genetics, the chromosome structure consisting entirely of nonhistone proteins remaining after all the DNA and histone proteins have been removed from a chromosome.
2. In genomic mapping, a series of contigs that are in the right order but not necessarily connected in one continuous stretch of sequence."
Scaling,Scaling: Abnormal shedding or accumulation of an upper layer of skin (the stratum corneum).
Scan,"Scan: As a noun, the data or image obtained from the examination of organs or regions of the body by gathering information with a sensing device. For specific scans, please see their alphabetical listings (such as Bone scan, CAT scan, Spiral CAT scan, Nuchal fold scan, and Thyroid scan)."
Scapula,"Scapula: The shoulder blade (or ""wingbone""), the familiar flat triangular bone at the back of the shoulder. The word ""scapula"" (with the accent on the first syllable) is Latin. The Romans always employed the plural ""scapulae"", the shoulder blades. Because the shoulder blade resembles the blade of a trowel (a small shovel), the word ""scapula"" is thought to have come from the Greek ""skaptein"" meaning ""to dig."" The term ""subscapular"" means under (sub) the scapula. The subscapularis muscle originates beneath the scapula. This muscle moves the arm by turning it inward (internal rotation). The subscapularis muscle tendon is part of the rotator cuff."
Scarification,"Scarification: The making of many small, superficial scratches in the skin. Scarification may be done in giving a smallpox vaccination or in removing a tattoo and leaving a scar in its place."
Scarlatina,"Scarlatina: Also called scarlet fever, a disease caused by infection with group A streptococcal bacteria that occurs in a small proportion of people with strep throat. The incubation period between contracting strep and the onset of scarlet fever is short, typically 72 hours but may range from 1 to 7 days. Illness usually begins with a fever and sore throat and may be accompanied by chills, vomiting, abdominal pain and malaise. The strep bacteria produces a toxin that causes a rash that appears 1 to 2 days after the onset of illness. The rash initially appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body. Typically the rash begins as small red macules which gradually become elevated. The redness fades over a few days and the patient is left with a rough ""sandpaper"" feeling rash. While the rash is still red the patient may develop what are called Pastia's lines, bright red coloration of the creases under the arm and in the groin. The rash usually lasts for 3 days. As the rash fades, desquamation (peeling) may occur around the finger tips, toes, and groin area. The throat culture should be positive for group A Strep. There is a rapid antigen test (throat swab). Therapy is designed to treat the infection with antibiotics (usually penicillin) and relieve symptoms with analgesics, rest, and plenty of fluids. Scarlet fever is usually not a serious illness when treated promptly. Improvement typically begins within 24 hours of starting treatment. Very rarely do the bacteria spread to other parts of the body. If it does, the result may be ear infections, sinusitis, glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever."
Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia: One of several brain diseases whose symptoms may include loss of personality (flat affect), agitation, catatonia, confusion, psychosis, unusual behavior, and social withdrawal. The illness usually begins in early adulthood. The cause of schizophrenia is not known, but there appear to be both genetic (inherited) and environmental components to the disease. Schizophrenia is not caused by abuse or poor parenting practices. Treatment involves use of neuroleptic medication and supportive interpersonal therapy. The prognosis is fairly good, with two-thirds of those diagnosed recovering significantly."
Scler-,"Scler-: (Or sclero-) A confusing prefix that can refer exclusively to hardness (from the Greek ""skleros"" meaning hard) but that can also refer to the sclera of the eye. Sclerodactyly, for example, is localized thickening and tightness of the skin of the fingers or toes and scleroderma is disease of connective tissue with the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin with hardening of the skin. By contrast, scleroconjunctival relates to the sclera and the conjunctiva of the eye, sclerokeratitis refers to inflammation of the sclera and cornea and scleromalacia pertains to degenerative thinning of the sclera."

Scleroderma,"Scleroderma: A disease of connective tissue that causes scar tissue (fibrosis) to form in the skin and sometimes also in other organs of the body. Scleroderma is classified into diffuse and limited forms. Diffuse scleroderma affects many internal and external areas of the body, including the skin of the entire body, the bowels, and the lungs. Limited scleroderma affects only certain body sections. The CREST syndrome is the most common limited form of scleroderma. CREST stands for The cause of scleroderma is unknown. There is some evidence that genes play at least a partial role in causing the disease. The immune system plays a central role in the disease process. It is not unusual to find other autoimmune diseases in families of scleroderma patients. The treatment of scleroderma is directed toward the particular organ system that is causing symptoms. The disease occurs more frequently in females than in males."
Sclerosis,"Sclerosis: Localized hardening of skin. Sclerosis is generally caused by underlying diseases, such as diabetes and scleroderma. Treatment is directed toward the cause."
Scopolamine,"Scopolamine: A naturally occurring member of a large chemical class of compounds called alkaloids. Scopolamine was first introduced into medical usage in 1902. The name comes from that of the 18th-century Italian naturalist Giovanni Scopoli. Scopolamine and atropine, comes from the plant Atropa belladonna also called ""deadly nightshade."" It was once used by the Spanish ladies to dilate their pupils and make their cheeks rosy. It has also been used as a poison. When scopolamine is given in lower (non-poisonous) doses, it causes ""mad as a hatter, dry as a beet, hot as a hen"" hallucinations, fever, flushed skin and cardiac arrhythmias. The jimson weed seeds are sometimes used for this sense of euphoria (a ""high""). Scopolamine together with morphine provided childbirth without pain (or without the memory of pain), once a much sought-after objective. Known as twilight sleep, this combination of drugs could cause serious problems. It completely removed the mother from the birth experience and it gravely depressed the baby's central nervous system. This sometimes made for a drowsy depressed baby with depressed breathing capacity. Twilight sleep therefore has fallen entirely out of favor and is now a chapter in the history of obstetrics."
Script,Script: An informal colloquial term for a prescription. Derived from prescription by removing both its beginning and ending to save a little bit of time and effort.
ulous,"Scrofulous: 1. Literally, relating to scrofula (tuberculosis (or TB like bacteria) of the lymph nodes, particularly of the neck). 2. Figuratively, morally contaminated and corrupt."
Scrotum,"Scrotum: The pouch of skin that contains the testes, epididymides, and lower portions of the spermatic cords."
Scrub,"Scrub: 1. As a verb, to wash the hands and forearms very thoroughly, as before engaging in surgery. To scrub implies the use of a brush (and often an implement to clean under the nails). To scrub, to scrub in (on a surgical procedure), and to scrub up are synonymous.
2. As a noun, a person who scrubs, as for surgery.
3. As an adjective, pertaining to scrubbing in for surgery, as a scrub nurse or a scrub tech."
Scrub in,"Scrub in: To wash the hands and forearms very thoroughly, as for surgery. To scrub in implies the use of a brush (and often an implement to clean under the nails). To scrub in, to scrub up, and to scrub are synonymous."
Scrub up,"Scrub up: To wash the hands and forearms very thoroughly, as before surgery. To scrub up implies the use of a brush (and often an implement to clean under the nails). To scrub up, to scrub in (on a surgical procedure), and to scrub are synonymous."
Scrubs,"Scrubs: A protective garment designed to be worn by the doctor, nurse, and others in the operating room. The garment was originally a gown. Scrubs now include the shirt and pants worn by those who scrub in for surgery. The wearing of scrubs extends outside surgery in some hospitals and clinics. It is a fashion statement to wear scrubs outside, as to shop in a supermarket. Wearing scrubs has become a badge of the profession, like wearing a white coat or carrying a stethoscope. Scrubs were once all one color, often a drab blue (known as Dr. blue) or a mint green. Now scrubs come in a rainbow of colors and in floral, aloha, and animal prints and there are scrubs for children. Scrubs are characteristically of cotton. Now there are also scrubs made of blends of polyester and cotton to maintain ""a wrinkle-free professional looking appearance with little fuss."""
Scurvy,"Scurvy: A disorder that is caused by lack of vitamin C. Symptoms include anemia; soft, bleeding gums; and bumps under the skin near muscles. Scurvy in early childhood can cause musculoskeletal problems. Treatment involves including foods that are high in vitamin C in the diet and taking vitamin C supplements if necessary."
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD),"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that tends to occur as the days grow shorter in the fall and winter. It is believed that affected persons react adversely to the decreasing amount of light and the colder temperature as autumn and winter progress. The symptoms of SAD include regularly occurring symptoms of depression (excessive eating and sleeping, weight gain) during the fall or winter months and full remission from depression in the spring and summer months, with no nonseasonal depressive episodes. A craving for sugary and/or starchy foods has also been said to be characteristic of SAD and separate it from other depressive disorders. Seasonal affective disorder has not been recognized very long as a medical condition. The term first appeared in print in 1985. Seasonal affective disorder is also sometimes called winter depression or the hibernation reaction."
Seborrhea,"Seborrhea: A chronic inflammatory disease of the skin characterized by the accumulation of scales of greasy skin. There may be yellow crusted plaques that are itchy. Seborrhea often affects the scalp. Other sites include the face, ears, eyebrows and eyelids, umbilicus, and genitalia, Seborrhea of the scalp is commonly known as dandruff. Treatment is with frequent use of dandruff shampoos and topical steroids if necessary. Also called seborrheic dermatitis."
Seborrheic dermatitis,Seborrheic dermatitis: A medical name for what is popularly called seborrhea.
Secondary amenorrhea,"Secondary amenorrhea: The cessation of menstruation for abnormal reasons. Causes include anorexia nervosa, disease of the female reproductive tract, and overexercise. Secondary amenorrhea can also be caused by certain medications, notably the birth control medication medroxyprogesterone (brand name: Depo-Provera); in this case, amenorrhea is an expected effect."
Section,"Section: 1) In anatomy, a slice of tissue. A biopsy obtained by surgery is usually sectioned (sliced), and these sections are inspected under a microscope. 2) In obstetrics, short for Cesarean section. 3) In surgery, the division of tissue during an operation."
"Section, Cesarean","Section, Cesarean: Also referred to as a C-section. A procedure in which a baby, rather than being born vaginally, is surgically extracted (removed) from the uterus. As the name ""Cesarean"" suggests, this is not exactly a new procedure. It was done in ancient civilizations upon the death of a pregnant woman who was near full term in order to salvage the baby. Julius Caesar (or one of his predecessors) was born by this procedure. Hence, the name ""Cesarean."" The term ""section"" in surgery refers to the division of tissue. What is being divided here is the abdominal wall of the mother as well as the wall of the uterus in order to extract the baby. In Shakespeare's Macbeth the Witches' prophecy was that ""...none of woman born/ Shall harm Macbeth"" (IV.i). Unfortunately for Macbeth, the Scottish nobleman Macduff was ""from his mother's womb/ Untimely ripped,"" and thus not naturally ""born of woman"" (V.vii). Macduff was the only agent capable of destroying Macbeth. He killed Macbeth in battle. As the name ""Cesarean"" suggests, this is not exactly a new procedure.

Sedative,"Sedative: A drug that calms a patient, easing agitation and permitting sleep. Sedatives generally work by modulating signals within the central nervous system. If sedatives are misused or accidentally combined, as in the case of combining prescription sedatives with alcohol, they can dangerously depress important signals that are needed to maintain heart and lung function. Most sedatives also have addictive potential. For these reasons, sedatives should be used under supervision and only as necessary."
Sedimentation rate,"Sedimentation rate: A blood test that detects and monitors inflammation in the body. Abbreviated sed rate. The sed rate measures the rate at which red blood cells in a test tube separate from blood serum over time, becoming sediment at the bottom of the test tube. The sed rate increases as inflammation increases. The sed rate can also become elevated in diseases that feature the production of abnormal proteins, such as multiple myeloma. Also known as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR."
Seizure,"Seizure: Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, which may produce a physical convulsion, minor physical signs, thought disturbances, or a combination of symptoms. The type of symptoms and seizures depend on where the abnormal electrical activity takes place in the brain, what its cause is, and such factors as the patient's age and general state of health. Seizures can be caused by head injuries, brain tumors, lead poisoning, maldevelopment of the brain, genetic and infectious illnesses, and fevers. In fully half of the patients with seizures, no cause can yet be found. Seizure is abbreviated sz. See also epilepsy."
Seizure disorders,"Seizure disorders: One of a great many medical conditions that are characterized by episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). Some seizure disorders are hereditary, but others are caused by birth defects or environmental hazards, such as lead poisoning. Seizure disorders are more likely to develop in patients who have other neurological disorders, psychiatric conditions, or immune-system problems. In some cases, uncontrolled seizures can cause brain damage, lowered intelligence, and permanent mental and physical impairment. Diagnosis is by observation, neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG), and in some cases more advanced brain imaging techniques. Treatment is usually by medication, although in difficult cases a special diet or brain surgery may be tried. See also epilepsy, seizure types and specific seizure disorders: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Ramsey Hunt syndrome, seizure."
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is one of the commonly prescribed drugs for treating depression. SSRIs affect the chemicals that nerves in the brain use to send messages to one another. These chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, are released by one nerve and taken up by other nerves. Neurotransmitters that are not taken up by other nerves are taken up by the same nerves that released them. This process is termed ""reuptake."" SSRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, an action which allows more serotonin to be available to be taken up by other nerves. The most commonly prescribed SSRIs as of 1999 were paroxetine (brandname Paxil), fluoxetine (brandname Prozac) and sertraline (brandname Zoloft). All three of these SSRIs appear equally efficacious, according to a 1999 study. The rate of patients switching from one class of drugs to another did not differ among the drug classes studied and there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who switched from an SSRI to another SSRI (or another type of antidepressant), regardless of whether paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) or sertraline (Zoloft) was the initial therapy. These three SSRIs therefore are ""equivalent in their effectiveness"" but they ""...are not interchangeable, because patients who discontinue one SSRI for lack of tolerability or response can generally be treated effectively with another."" (Reference: J Clin Psychiatry 1999;60:574-579.)"
Semen,"Semen: The fluid that is released through the penis during orgasm. Semen is made up of fluid and sperm. The fluid comes from the prostate, seminal vesicles, and other sex glands. The sperm are manufactured in the testicles. The seminal fluid helps transport the sperm during orgasm. Seminal fluid contains sugar as an energy source for sperm."
Semen DNA analysis,"Semen DNA analysis: The detection and investigation in a sample of semen. Let us assume that a man's semen is alleged to be on a piece of fabric. To learn whether the cloth is stained by the suspect's semen, DNA testing can be done. Here is how it works: The DNA tests of semen can take several days or several weeks before results are available, depending upon which techniques have been used by the lab (and which lab has done the DNA testing). DNA tests can show that the semen is not from the suspect. Or these tests can show that the DNA in the sperm is not detectably different from the suspect's. But DNA testing can never prove with complete certainty that the semen is from the suspect."
Senile,"Senile: 1. Pertaining to old age. 2. Pertaining to the physical decline associated with old age. 3. Pertaining to the mental decline once associated with old age but now known to be due to dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease or cerebral atherosclerosis. ""The road to senility is paved with plaques."" (Paul F. Wehrle, MD [1921-2004] pediatrician and vaccine researcher) From the Latin senilis, from senectus meaning old age, old men, gray hair. See also: Senile chorea; Senile keratosis; Senile lentigo"
Senility,"Senility: 1. Originally, old age. 2. The physical decline associated with old age. 3. The mental decline once associated with old age but now known to be due to dementia, as for instance Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. ""The road to senility is paved with plaques."" (Paul F. Wehrle, MD [1921-2004] pediatrician and vaccine researcher who helped eradicate smallpox) From the French senilite, from the Latin senectus meaning old age, old men, gray hair."
Sensation,"Sensation: In medicine and physiology, sensation refers to the registration of an incoming (afferent) nerve impulse in that part of the brain called the sensorium, which is capable of such perception. Therefore, the awareness of a stimulus as a result of its perception by sensory receptors. (Sensory is here synonymous with sensation.) The word ""sensation"" comes (as does the term ""sensorium"") from the Latin sensus, ""the faculty of perceiving."""
Sense,"Sense: In biology and medicine, the faculty of sensory reception. The ability to convey specific types of external or internal stimuli to the brain and perceive them. Sensory reception occurs through a process known as transduction in which stimuli are converted into nerve impulses which are relayed to the brain. This process may involve the special senses -- hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch -- in which the corresponding sensory receptors are concentrated in the ear, eye, olfactory (smell) apparatus, taste buds, and skin. The skin is rich in sensory receptors that convey the sensations not only of touch but also of heat and cold, pressure, and pain. Other sensory receptors are situated in internal organs such as the throat, stomach and heart. There are also other senses such as the sense of equilibrium (which is related to the flow of endolymph, a fluid found in the inner ear) and the sense of position (proprioception)."
Sensitivity,"Sensitivity: 1. In psychology, the quality of being sensitive. As, for example, sensitivity training, training in small groups to develop a sensitive awareness and understanding of oneself and of ones relationships with others. 2. In disease epidemiology, the ability of a system to detect epidemics and other changes in disease occurrence. 3. In screening for a disease, the proportion of persons with the disease who are correctly identified by a screening test. 4. In the definition of a disease, the proportion of persons with the disease who are correctly identified by defined criteria."
Sensorium,"Sensorium: The totality of those parts of the brain that receive, process and interpret sensory stimuli. The sensorium is the supposed seat of sensation, the place to which impressions from the external world are conveyed and perceived. The sensorium also refers to the entire sensory apparatus of the body. In medicine, ""sensorium"" is sometimes used as a generic term for the intellectual and cognitive functions. For example: ""A 77-year old woman with cirrhosis was admitted (to the hospital) with a one-week history of altered sensorium."" (New Engl J Med 343: 1933, 2000) The term ""sensorium"" comes (as does the word ""sensation"") from the Latin sensus, ""the faculty of perceiving."" The plural of ""sensorium"" is rarely used but in case of need you can choose between ""sensoriums"" and ""sensoria."""
Sepsis,"Sepsis: The presence of bacteria (bacteremia), other infectious organisms, or toxins created by infectious organisms in the bloodstream with spread throughout the body. Sepsis may be associated with clinical symptoms of systemic illness, such as fever, chills, malaise, low blood pressure, and mental-status changes. Sepsis can be a serious situation, a life-threatening condition that requires urgent and comprehensive care. Treatment depends on the type of infection but usually begins with antibiotics or similar medications. Also known as blood poisoning and septicemia."
Septic,"Septic: Infected, or denoting infection. For example, septic shock is shock that is caused by infection."
Septicemia,"Septicemia: Systemic (bodywide) illness with toxicity due to invasion of the bloodstream by virulent bacteria coming from a local site of infection. The symptoms of chills, fever and exhaustion are caused by the bacteria and substances they produce. The disorder is treated with massive doses of antibiotics. Also known as blood poisoning."
Septum,"Septum: A dividing wall or enclosure. For example, the septum of the nose is the thin cartilage that divides the left and right chambers of the nose from each other."
"Septum, heart","Septum, heart: The septum of the heart is the dividing wall between the right and left sides of the heart. That portion of the septum that separates the two upper chambers (the right and left atria) of the heart is termed the atrial (or interatrial) septum while the portion of the septum that lies between the two lower chambers (the right and left ventricles) of the heart is called the ventricular (or interventricular) septum. The word ""septum"" is borrowed from the Latin ""saeptum"" meaning a ""dividing wall or enclosure."""
Sequela,"Sequela: A pathological condition resulting from a prior disease, injury, or attack. As for example, a sequela of polio. Verbatim from the Latin ""sequela"" (meaning sequel). Plural: sequelae."
Sequelae,Sequelae: See: Sequela.
Sequester,"Sequester: 1. In medicine, to set apart, detach or separate a small portion of tissue from the rest. May be naturally occurring or iatrogenic. 2. In bone, for a piece of dead bone to separate from the sound bone. 3. In biochemistry, to isolate a constituent of a system by chelation or other means. From the French sequester, from the late Latin sequestrare, meaning to place in safe keeping."
Ser,Ser: Serine. See also: Amino acid symbols.
Serendipity,"Serendipity: An accidental and fortunate discovery. A celebrated instance of serendipity in biomedical research took place in 1928 at St Mary's Hospital in London. While studying staphylococci (staph bacteria), the physician and microbiologist Alexander Fleming happened to noticed that on a dish containing agar on which he had been growing germs, near some mold, the germs were less common. He grew more of the mold and named it penicillin from its Latin name Penicillium. Fleming found the mould was effective against bacteria that caused diseases such as anthrax, meningitis and diphtheria. The word serendipity was coined by Horace Walpole in the fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip (1754). Serendip was an old Persian name for Sri Lanka."
Serine,"Serine: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. A dietary nonessential amino acid, serine is present in many proteins participates in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, and is in the active sites of many enzymes. Symbol: Ser."
Seroconversion,"Seroconversion: The development of detectable antibodies in the blood that are directed against an infectious agent. Antibodies do not usually develop until some time after the initial exposure to the agent. Following seroconversion, a person tests positive for the antibody when given tests that are based on the presence of antibodies, such as ELISA."
Serositis,"Serositis: Inflammation of the serous tissues of the body (the tissues that line the lungs, heart, abdomen, and inner abdominal organs)."
Serotonin,"Serotonin: A neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. Serotonin can trigger the release of substances in the blood vessels of the brain that in turn cause the pain of migraine. Serotonin is also key to mood regulation; pain perception; gastrointestinal function, including the perception of hunger and satiety; and other physical functions."
Serration,Serration: A finely notching like that along the cutting edge of a saw. The serratus muscles take their name from their serrated appearance. See: Serratus anterior; Serratus magnus; Serratus posterior inferior; Serratus posterior superior.
Serum,"Serum: The clear liquid that can be separated from clotted blood. Serum differs from plasma, the liquid portion of normal unclotted blood containing the red and white cells and platelets. It is the clot that makes the difference between serum and plasma. Terms in this dictionary with the word ""serum"" include maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and serum hepatitis. The term ""serum"" also is used to designate any normal or pathological fluid that resembles serum as, for example, the fluid in a blister. ""Serum"" is a Latin word that refers to the ""whey"", the watery liquid that separates from the curds in the process of cheesemaking."
Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT),"Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT): An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. SGOT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood SGOT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGOT levels. SGOT is also called aspartate aminotransferase (AST)."
Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT),"Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT): An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. SGPT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood SGPT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGPT levels. Also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT)."
Serving size,"Serving size: 1. The portion of food used as a reference on the nutrition label of that food.
2. The recommended portion of food to be eaten. The National Cancer Institute defines a serving as:"
Sesquipedalian,"Sesquipedalian: A long polysyllabic word that means having many syllables or using long words. From the Latin sesqui- meaning one and a half times + ped, pes meaning foot. In Ars Poetica, the Roman poet Horace cautioned young poets against using ""sesquipedalia verba"" -- ""words a foot and a half long."" For example, Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanosconiosis."
Seven-day measles,"Seven-day measles: An acute highly contagious viral disease with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and a spreading skin rash, the measles, (also known as rubeola) is a potentially disastrous disease. It can be complicated by ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (that can cause convulsions, mental retardation, and even death), the sudden onset of low blood platelet levels with severe bleeding (acute thrombocytopenic purpura) or a chronic brain disease that occurs months to often years after an attack of measles (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). During pregnancy measles may trigger miscarriages or premature delivery. Measles can be prevented through vaccination. The disease is also called the hard measles and (depending on how long one thinks it lasts) the seven-day measles, the eight-day measles, or the ten-day measles, and morbilli. The name measles comes from the Middle English maselen meaning many little spots referring, of course, to the rash."
Sexual sadism,"Sexual sadism: Individuals with sexual sadism disorder have persistent fantasies in which sexual excitement results from inflicting psychological or physical suffering (including humiliation and terror) on a sexual partner. This disorder is different from minor acts of aggression in normal sexual activity; for example, rough sex. In some cases, sexual sadists are able to find willing partners to participate in the sadistic activities. At its most extreme, sexual sadism involves illegal activities such as rape, torture, and even murder, in which case the death of the victim produces sexual excitement. It should be noted that while rape may be an expression of sexual sadism, the infliction of suffering is not the motive for most rapists, and the victim's pain generally does not increase the rapist's sexual excitement. Rather, rape involves a combination of sex and gaining power over the victim. These individuals need intensive psychiatric treatment and may be jailed for these activities."
SGOT,"SGOT: Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, an enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. SGOT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood SGOT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGOT levels. SGOT is also called aspartate aminotransferase (AST)."
SGPT,"SGPT: Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, an enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. SGPT is released into blood when the liver or heart are damaged. The blood SGPT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGPT levels. Also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT)."
Shark attack,"Shark attack: Attack of a person by a shark. Not all shark attacks are feeding events. Sharks sometimes grab people by mistake. Other times an attack may protect a shark's space, much as a dog barks at and bites intruders. To decrease the chance of becoming a victim of a shark attack, observe the following rules: Provoked attacks are caused by humans touching sharks. Often this involves unhooking sharks or removing them from fishing nets. However, recently there have been a number of incidents involving divers who were attacked after grabbing or feeding a shark while underwater. Unprovoked attacks happen when sharks make the first contact. This can take three forms:"
Shigellosis,"Shigellosis: Epidemic and opportunistic (causes disease when the immune system is suppressed) dysentery that is due to infection with shigella bacteria. Shigellosis causes intestinal pain and diarrhea, with mucus and blood in the stool. It is especially common in tropical countries but frequently occurs elsewhere. It is a particular hazard for people with AIDS or other immunodeficiency states. Treatment is with antibiotics against the shigella bacteria."
Shin bone fever,"Shin bone fever: Called shin bone fever because it characteristically causes fever and pain in the legs, this disease is also known as trench fever. It is a disease borne by body lice that was first recognized in the trenches of World War I, when it is estimated to have affected more than a million people in Russia and on the fronts in Europe. Trench fever was again a major problem in the military in World War II and is seen endemically in Mexico, Africa, E. Europe, and elsewhere. Urban trench fever occurs among the homeless people and people with alcoholism today. Outbreaks have been documented, for example, in Seattle, Baltimore (among injection-drug users), Marseilles (France) and Burundi. The cause of trench fever is Bartonella quintana (also called Rochalimaea quintana), an unusual organism that multiplies in the gut of the body louse. Transmission of the rickettsia to people can occur by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded (scuffed) skin or into the conjunctivae (whites of the eyes). The disease is classically a 5-day fever. The onset of symptoms is sudden with high fever, severe headache, back pain and leg pain and a fleeting rash. Recovery takes a month or more. Relapses are common. It is now clear, that at least in its urban form among the homeless, trench fever can be associated with nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms (New England Journal of Medicine 340: 184-189, 1999). The organism (B. quintana) that causes trench fever also has been found responsible for a disease called bacillary angiomatosis in people infected with HIV and for infection of the heart and great vessels (endocarditis) with bloodstream infection. Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever, quintan fever, five-day fever, Meuse fever, His' disease, His-Werner disease, Werner-His disease."
Shin spot,Shin spot: A light brown or reddish oval or round scaly patch on the skin of the shin. Shin spots can be due to diabetes. See: Diabetic dermopathy.
Shingles,"Shingles: An acute infection caused by the herpes zoster virus, the same virus as causes chickenpox. Shingles is most common after the age of 50 and the risk rises with advancing age. Shingles occurs because of exposure to chickenpox or reactivation of the herpes zoster virus. The virus remains latent (dormant) in nerve roots for many years following chickenpox. Shingles is an extraordinarily painful condition that involves inflammation of sensory nerves. It causes numbness, itching or pain followed by the appearance of clusters of little blisters in a strip pattern on one side of the body. The pain can persist for weeks, months or years after the rash heals and is then known as post-herpetic neuralgia. People with shingles are contagious to persons who have not had chickenpox and can catch chickenpox from close contact with a person who has shingles. The Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing or reducing the symptoms of shingles, and it is recommended for people 60 years and older. Treatment includes antiviral medication and pain medication. The term shingles has nothing to do with a shingle on a roof or the small signboard outside the office of a doctor but is derived from the Latin cingulum meaning girdle, the idea being that shingles often girdles part of the body. See also shingles pain and postherpetic neuralgia."
Ship fever,"Ship fever: An old name for epidemic typhus, which was common in the crowded conditions aboard ship. Ship Fever and Other Stories (1996) by Andrea Barrett received the National Book Award. See: Typhus, epidemic."
Shock,"Shock: In medicine, a critical condition that is brought on by a sudden drop in blood flow through the body. The circulatory system fails to maintain adequate blood flow, sharply curtailing the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to vital organs. It also compromises the kidneys and so restricts the removal of wastes from the body. Shock can be due to a number of different mechanisms, including not enough blood volume and not enough output of blood by the heart. The signs and symptoms of shock include low blood pressure (hypotension); overbreathing (hyperventilation); a weak, rapid pulse; cold, clammy, grayish-bluish (cyanotic) skin; decreased urine flow (oliguria); and a sense of great anxiety and foreboding, confusion, and sometimes combativeness. Shock, which is a major medical emergency, is common after serious injury. Emergency care for shock involves keeping the patient warm, giving fluids by mouth or, if necessary, intravenously, and frequently the administration of drugs that act to improve cardiac and circulatory function."
"Shock, secondary","Shock, secondary: Secondary shock is often associated with heat stroke, crushing injuries, heart attack (myocardial infarction), poisoning, fulminating infections, burns, and other life-threatening conditions. The pathologic characteristics of this state reflect changes in the capillaries, which become dilated and engorged with blood. This may develop over time and is characterized by weakness, restlessness, low body temperature, low blood pressure, cold sweat, reduced urinary output and progressive decrease in blood pressure that may lead to death unless appropriate treatment is provided."
a chromosome,"Short arm of a chromosome: The short arm of a human chromosome is symbolized by convention as ""p"". The ""p"" comes from the French ""petit"" meaning small. All human chromosomes have 2 arms, the p (short) arm and the q (long) arm. They are separated from each other only by a primary constriction, the centromere, the point at which the chromosome is attached to the spindle during cell division. The symbol ""q"" was chosen for the long arm simply because it followed ""p"" in the alphabet."
breath,Shortness of breath: Difficulty in breathing. Medically referred to as dyspnea. Shortness of breath can be caused by respiratory (breathing passages and lungs) or circulatory (heart and blood vessels) conditions and other conditions such as severe anemia or high fever. See also dyspnea.
Shotty,"Shotty: Resembling shot or pellets of lead, shotgun pellets and, hence, hard and round. The term ""shotty"" was in use in the 19th century. It is now generally obsolete but it is still in medicinal usage. Shotty is very commonly used in describing the feel of lymph nodes (the lymph glands) when they are palpated (felt) through the skin. ""Shotty"" lymph nodes are ones that are not only hard and round but also small and surely of no consequence."
Shoulder,"Shoulder: A structure made up of two main bones: the scapula (shoulder blade) and the humerus (the long bone of the upper arm). The end of the scapula, called the glenoid, is a socket into which the head of the humerus fits, forming a flexible ball-and-socket joint. The scapula is an unusually shaped bone. It extends up and around the shoulder joint at the rear to create a roof called the acromion and around the shoulder joint at the front to constitute the coracoid process. The shoulder joint is cushioned by cartilage that covers the face of the glenoid socket and the head of the humerus. The joint is stabilized by a ring of fibrous cartilage around the glenoid socket that is called the labrum. Ligaments connect the bones of the shoulder and tendons join these bones to surrounding muscles. The biceps tendon attaches the biceps muscle to the shoulder and helps stabilize the joint. Four short muscles that originate on the scapula pass around the shoulder where their tendons fuse together to form the rotator cuff."
SHP,SHP: Schonlein-Henoch purpura.
Shunt,"Shunt: 1) To move a body fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid, from one place to another. 2) A catheter (tube) that carries cerebrospinal fluid from a ventricle in the brain to another area of the body. A shunt may be placed to relieve pressure from hydrocephalus, for example."
Sicca syndrome,"Sicca syndrome: An autoimmune disease, also known as Sjogren syndrome, that classically combines dry eyes, dry mouth, and another disease of connective tissue such as rheumatoid arthritis (most common), lupus, scleroderma or polymyositis. There is a great preponderance of females. About 90% of Sjogren syndrome patients are female, usually in middle age or older. Sjogren syndrome is an inflammatory disease of glands and other tissues of the body. Inflammation of the glands that produce tears (the lacrimal glands) leads to decreased tears and dry eyes. Inflammation of the glands that produce the saliva in the mouth (salivary glands, including the parotid glands) leads to dry mouth. The syndrome can consequently be complicated by infections of the eyes, breathing passages, and mouth. Sjogren syndrome is typically associated with antibodies, antibodies produced by the body that are directed against a variety of body tissues (autoantibodies). The diagnosis of the syndrome can also be aided by a biopsy of an affected gland. The treatment of Sjogren syndrome is directed toward the particular areas of the body that are involved by the disease and the complications such as infection. The term ""sicca"" refers to the dryness of the eyes and mouth. The syndrome is named after the Swedish ophthalmologist Henrik Samuel Conrad Sjogren (1899-1986) who, after seeing a woman of middle age with the disease, collected 19 such cases and in his doctoral thesis in 1933 delineated the syndrome. Sjogren's thesis was not considered of sufficient importance to earn him the title of ""docent"", denying him a career in academic medicine. The syndrome he discovered nonetheless came to be accepted around the world."
Sick sinus syndrome,"Sick sinus syndrome: A condition that features symptoms including dizziness, confusion, fainting, and heart failure that is due to a problem with the sinoatrial node (SA node) of the heart, which acts as the body's natural pacemaker. If the SA node is not functioning normally, the patient usually has an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia), but other rhythm disturbances, including rapid heart rate (tachycardia) and an alternating fast and slow heart rate (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome) can also occur. These disturbances can cause poor pumping by the heart, which can impair the circulation. Diagnosis is usually made via electrocardiogram (EKG). Treatment includes use of medications, such as calcium antagonists."
Siddha medicine,"Siddha medicine: An ancient system of medicine prevalent in South India. The word Siddha comes from the Tamil word for perfection. In Siddha medicine, the individual is a microcosm of the universe. The human body consists of the five primordial elements - earth, water, fire, air and space, the three humours-vatha, pitta and kapha and seven physical constituents. Food is the basic building material of the human body and gets processed into humours, tissues and wastes. The equilibrium of humours is considered as health and its disturbance or imbalance leads to a diseased state. There is equal emphasis on the body, mind and spirit and strives to restore the innate harmony of the individual. Treatment is aimed at restoring balance to the mind-body system. Diet, lifestyle, yoga and meditation play a major role not only in maintaining health but also in curing diseases."
Side effects,"Side effects: Problems that occur when treatment goes beyond the desired effect. Or problems that occur in addition to the desired therapeutic effect. Example -- A hemorrhage from the use of too much anticoagulant (such as heparin) is a side effect caused by treatment going beyond the desired effect. Example -- The common side effects of cancer treatment including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased blood cell counts, hair loss, and mouth sores are instances of side effects that occur in addition to the desired therapeutic effect. Drug manufacturers are required to list all known side effects of their products. When side effects of necessary medication are severe, sometimes a second medication, lifestyle change, dietary change, or other measure may help to minimize them."
Sigmoid,"Sigmoid: In human anatomy, the lower colon (the lower portion of the large bowel). Sigmoid is short for sigmoid colon. From the Greek letter sigma, which is shaped like a C. Sigmoid also means curved in two directions like the letter S. For example, a sigmoid curve is an S-shaped curve."
Sign,"Sign: Any objective evidence of disease, as opposed to a symptom, which is, by nature, subjective. For example, gross blood in the stool is a sign of disease; it is evidence that can be recognized by the patient, physician, nurse, or someone else. Abdominal pain is a symptom; it is something only the patient can perceive."
Sign language,"Sign language: A language that employs signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and postures of the body, used primarily by people who are deaf. There are many different sign languages as, for example, British and American sign languages. British sign language (BSL) is not easily intelligible to users of American sign language (ASL). Unlike ASL, BSL uses a two-handed alphabet. In developing countries, deaf people may use the sign language of educators and missionaries from elsewhere in the world. For example, some deaf individuals in Madagascar use Norwegian sign language. By contrast, deaf children in Nicaragua have created their own sign language. Study of the emerging Nicaruagan sign language (NSL) has revealed that children naturally possess learning abilities capable of giving language its fundamental structure. See also: American sign language."
Signature,"Signature: That part of the prescription that contains the doctor's directions to the patient. For example, the signature might say ""take twice daily with food"". Also known as the sig.. The word ""signature"" comes from the Latin ""signare"" meaning ""to sign or mark."""
Silver,"Silver: Is noted in the periodic table as Ag with an atomic number 47. It is a precious metal used in jewelry, dental fillings, silverware and other consumer goods. A metal used in some medications and in many ""natural"" remedies. Silver has antibiotic properties. However, overuse of silver, or use of products containing silver by people with certain health conditions, can result in silver poisoning (argyria). See also argyria."
Silver bullet,"Silver bullet: Or magic bullet. 1. The perfect drug to cure a disease with no danger of side effects. The term magic bullet was first used in this sense by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich to describe antibody and, later, the drug salvarsan that he created to treat syphilis. 2. In general, a magical solution to any vexing problem."
Silver poisoning,"Silver poisoning : Silver poisoning, medically termed argyria, causes ashen gray discoloration of the skin (and other tissues of the body). Due to chronic use of silver salts. For example, a medical report related the case of a woman, now in her 50s, with discolored skin. At 11 she had been given nose drops of unknown composition for ""allergies,"" her skin had turned gray, and at 15 a skin biopsy confirmed the presence of silver deposition. There had been silver in her nose drops. One time when she was in a hospital, the nurses were alarmed because they thought she had cyanosis (a dusky blue-grey color). Suspensions of silver are currently available in some health food stores and pharmacies. These silver preparations are promoted as useful for AIDS, cancer, sore throat, meningitis, parasites, chronic fatigue, acne and other disorders."
Simian crease,"Simian crease: A single transverse crease in the palm, a minor variation associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and a number of chromosomal and other abnormalities. Also called a four-finger crease; single palmar flexion crease; single upper palm crease."
Sinus,"Sinus: 1. An air-filled cavity in a dense portion of a skull bone. The sinuses decrease the weight of the skull. The sinuses are formed in four right-left pairs. The frontal sinuses are positioned behind the forehead, while the maxillary sinuses are behind the cheeks. The sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses are deeper in the skull behind the eyes and maxillary sinuses. The sinuses are lined by mucous-secreting cells. Air enters the sinuses through small opening in bone called ostia. If an ostium is blocked, air cannot pass into the sinus and likewise mucous cannot drain out. See also: Sinusitis. 2. A channel permitting the passage of blood or lymph fluid that is not a blood or lymphatic vessel, such as the sinuses of the placenta. 3. A tract or fistula leading to a cavity which may be filled with pus. The word was borrowed from the Latin noun ""sinus,"" which means ""curve, fold, or hollow."" The same root gave rise to ""sinuous""."
Sinus bradycardia,"Sinus bradycardia: A regular but unusually slow heart beat (50 beats/minute or less at rest). Sinus bradycardia can be the result of many things including good physical fitness, medications, and some forms of heart block. ""Sinus"" refers to the sinus node, the heart's natural pacemaker which creates the normal regular heartbeat. ""Bradycardia"" means that the heart rate is slower than normal. Fainting can occur with sinus bradycardia if the heart slows down even more. This can occur, for example, when the vagus nerve sends a signal to the heart that suddenly drops the heart rate. Choking or gagging can trigger this response which is called the vasovagal reflex. US President George W. Bush has sinus bradycardia and had an episode of fainting due to a vasovagal response after choking on a pretzel."
Sinus node,"Sinus node: The sinus node is one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system, the system that controls the heart rate. This stunningly designed system generates electrical impulses and conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood. The sinus node is the heart's natural pacemaker. The sinus node consists of a cluster of cells that are situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The electrical impulses are generated there. The sinus node is also called the sinoatrial node or, for short, the SA node. The electrical signal generated by the sinus node moves from cell to cell down through the heart until it reaches the atrioventricular node (AV node), a cluster of cells situated in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles. The AV node serves as a gate that slows the electrical current before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have a chance to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart. The autonomic nervous system, the same part of the nervous system as controls the blood pressure, controls the firing of the sinus node to trigger the start of the cardiac cycle. The autonomic nervous system can transmit a message quickly to the sinus node so it in turn can increase the heart rate to twice normal within only 3 to 5 seconds. This quick response is important during exercise when the heart has to increase its beating speed to keep up with the body's increased demand for oxygen."
Sinus rhythm,"Sinus rhythm: The normal regular rhythm of the heart set by the natural pacemaker of the heart called the sinoatrial (or sinus) node. It is located in the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). Normal cardiac impulses start there and are transmitted to the atria and down to the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). Sinus arrhythmia refers to the normal increase in heart rate that occurs during inspiration (when you breathe in). This is a normal response and is more accentuated in children than adults. Sinus tachycardia refers to a fast heartbeat (tachycardia) because of rapid firing of the sinoatrial (sinus) node. This occurs in response to exercise, exertion, excitement, pain, fever, excessive thyroid hormone, low blood oxygen (hypoxia), stimulant drugs (such as caffeine), etc. The lack of normal sinus rhythm is an arrhythmia, an abnormal heart rhythm."
Sinusitis,"Sinusitis: Inflammation of the lining membrane in any of the hollow areas (sinuses) of the skull around the nose. Sinusitis may be caused by anything that interferes with air flow into the sinuses and the drainage of mucous out of the sinuses. The sinus openings, called ostia, may be obstructed by swelling of the tissue lining the ostia and adjacent nasal passage tissue; for example, from colds, allergies, and tissue irritants (nasal sprays, cocaine, cigarette smoke). Less commonly, sinuses can become obstructed by tumors or growths. Stagnated mucous then provides a perfect environment for bacterial infection. The common symptoms of sinusitis include headache; facial tenderness or pain; fever; cloudy, discolored nasal drainage; a feeling of nasal stuffiness; sore throat; and cough. Acute sinusitis is usually treated with antibiotic therapy. Chronic forms of sinusitis require long courses of antibiotics and may require a sinus drainage procedure."
Situational syncope,"Situational syncope: The temporary loss of consciousness in a particular kind of situation. The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse, and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating or defecating, and coughing. It can also be due to the emotional stress, fear, or pain. When experiencing the trigger condition, the person often becomes pale and feels nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before losing consciousness. Situational syncope is caused by a reflex of the involuntary nervous system called the vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction leads the heart to slow down (bradycardia), and at the same time it leads the nerves that serve the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels to dilate (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and circulating blood tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is deprived of oxygen, and the fainting episode occurs. Situational syncope is also known as vasovagal syncope, vasodepressor syncope, and Gower syndrome. See also syncope, vasovagal reaction."
Six fingers or toes,"Six fingers or toes: The presence of an extra sixth finger or toe, a very common congenital malformation (birth defect). This condition is called hexadactyly. The word hexadactyly literally means six digits. In medical usage, hexadactyly does not specify whether the six digits are fingers or toes (although in Greek ""dactylos"" is without equivocation a finger). The 6th digit can be located in three different locations: on either side of the extremity or somewhere in between. With the hand for example, the extra finger can be out beyond the little finger (which is called ulnar hexadactyly) or out beyond the thumb (radial hexadactyly) or, finally, between two of the normally expected fingers (intercalary hexadactyly). Far and away the most frequent form of hexadactyly is ulnar (postaxial) hexadactyly. Next comes radial (preaxial) hexadactyly. And far and away the rarest form of hexadactyly is intercalary hexadactyly. Hexadactyly in itself can be innocuous, absolutely harmless and very easily remedied, when the hexadactyly is an isolated finding and the baby is otherwise entirely normal. Ulnar hexadactyly with just a rudimentary tag of a sixth digit, for instance, can be very simply treated by tying it off with one suture. However, hexadactyly can also be one of a number of congenital malformations affecting the baby. These cases are more complicated and require further evaluation. Hexadactyly can be seen on some prenatal ultrasound scans. To present a real case, an ultrasound scan showed ""a rudimentary 6th digit on both hands."" A more detailed ultrasound confirmed ""a 6th digit on ulnar side of each hand"" and showed that 6th digit ""is small and just a floppy skin tag."" No other morphological (physical) abnormalities of the fetus were visible. Another ultrasound with even greater resolution revealed ""a rudimentary digit/skin tag on the palmar surface of the hand lying between the 4th and 5th digits."" Again, no abnormality was seen elsewhere on the baby. The differential diagnostic list of disorders causing hexadactyly is pretty long. But many were excluded by the absence of other malformations. It also seemed a particular type of hexadactyly. If it were an intercalated extra digit (with the extra finger situated between the other fingers), the list would be much smaller and only a very few entities such as the Pallister-Hall syndrome and Greig syndrome (but there would usually be other things to see in either of these 2 syndromes). The final diagnosis in this case has not yet been made. We have present the case to convey the quandary that can occur when hexadactyly is discovered antenatally (before birth) today. Hexadactyly is the most frequent form of polydactyly, a diagnosis that encompasses all cases of extra digits, irrespective of the number of extra digits in a particular case."
Skeletal muscle,"Skeletal muscle: Along with smooth and cardiac muscle, one of the types of muscle tissue in the body. Skeletal muscle represents the majority of muscle tissue. It is the type of muscle that powers movement of the skeleton, as in walking and lifting."
the,"Skeleton, bones of the: The human body has 206 bones. These consist of 80 axial (head and trunk) bones and 126 appendicular (upper and lower extremity) bones. Axial bones: The 80 axial bones comprise 29 bones in the head and 51 bones in the trunk. Head bones: The 29 head bones consist of 8 cranial bones, 14 facial bones, the hyoid bone, and 6 auditory (ear) bones. Trunk bones: The 51 trunk bones consist of 26 vertebrae, 24 ribs and the sternum. Appendicular bones: The 126 appendicular bones are made up of 64 bones in the upper extremities (the arms, wrists, and hands) and 62 bones in the lower extremities (the legs, ankles, and feet). Upper extremity bones: The 64 upper extremity bones consist of 10 shoulder and arm, 16 wrist and 38 hand bones. Lower extremity bones: The 62 lower extremity bones consist of 10 hip and leg, 14 ankle and 38 foot bones."
Skin,"Skin: The body's outer covering, which protects against heat and light, injury, and infection. Skin regulates body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin, which weighs about 6 pounds, is the body's largest organ. It is made up of two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis. The outer layer of the skin (epidermis) is mostly made up of flat, scale-like cells called squamous cells. Under the squamous cells are round cells called basal cells. The deepest part of the epidermis also contains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, which gives the skin its color. The inner layer of skin (dermis) contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands that produce sweat, which helps regulate body temperature, and sebum, an oily substance that helps keep the skin from drying out. Sweat and sebum reach the skin's surface through tiny openings called pores."
Skin color,"Skin color: The color of skin which is complexly determined. Skin color depends on many factors including reddening caused by inflammation, the hemoglobin level in the blood, and the darkening caused by increased deposition of the pigment melanin. Melanin itself is a polymer that comes in two types -- a red-yellow form known as pheomelanin and a black-brown form known as eumelanin. The genetics of skin color are similarly complex. Skin color is clearly polygenic, determined by a number of genes. These genes include TYR (tyrosinase), MATP (membrane-associated transport protein) and P (the pink-eyed dilution protein). There may be 20 or so other genes that affect skin color."
Skin erosion,"Skin erosion: Skin erosion is a loss of some or all of the epidermis (the outer layer) leaving a denuded surface. Erosion is an eating away of a surface. The word ""erosion"" comes from the Latin ""erodere"" meaning to eat out."
"Skin graft, pedicle","Skin graft, pedicle: A graft technique in which a piece of skin from a nearby area remains attached at one of its corners, while the main part of the piece is reattached over the area that needs to be covered."
Skull,"Skull: The skull is a collection of bones which encase the brain and give form to the head and face. The bones of the skull include the following: the frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, zygomatic, maxilla, nasal, vomer, palatine, inferior concha, and mandible. The early English word ""skulle"" came from the Nordic words ""skal"" and ""skul"" meaning a bowl. It is also thought that the Nordic toast ""Skoal!"" came from ""skal"" since ceremonial drinks were served in a bowl (or skull)."
Slanted ear,"Slanted ear: An ear that is slanted more than usual. Technically, an ear is slanted when the angle of the slope of the auricle is more than 15 degrees from the perpendicular. Considered a minor anomaly. The presence of 2 or more minor anomalies in a child increases the probability that the child has a major malformation."
SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus),"SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease occurs when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus have unusual antibodies in their blood that are targeted against their own body tissues. Lupus can cause disease of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system. When only the skin is involved, the condition is called discoid lupus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Up to 10% of people with discoid lupus (lupus limited to the skin) eventually develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). SLE is eight times more common in women than men. The causes of SLE are unknown. However, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs may all play a role. Eleven criteria have been established for the diagnosis of SLE: The treatment of SLE is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity. People with SLE can help prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure and by not abruptly discontinuing medications."
Sleep,"Sleep: The body's rest cycle. Sleep is triggered by a complex group of hormones that are active in the main, and that respond to cues from the body itself and the environment. About 80 percent of sleep is dreamless, and is known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. During NREM sleep, the breathing and heart rate are slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into four stages of increasing depth of sleep: Level 1 sleep is a transition period between sleep and wakefulness; Level 2 sleep features significant slowing of heartbeat and breathing, and makes up about 50 percent of all sleep; and Level 3 and 4 (Delta) sleep are marked by very slow respiration and heartbeat. Level 4 sleep leads to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also known as Level 5 sleep. Dreams occur during three to five periods of REM sleep each night. REM sleep occurs at intervals of one to two hours, and is variable in length. REM sleep is characterized by irregular breathing and heart rate, and involuntary muscle jerks. Most adults need around eight hours of sleep on a regular schedule to function well, although some require less, and others more. (It has been said that men need an hour less sleep than women.) Children, particularly teenagers, often need nine or ten hours for optimal functioning."
Sleep apnea,"Sleep apnea: The temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, often resulting in daytime sleepiness. Apnea is a Greek word that means ""want of breath."" The most common form of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles of the soft palate around the base of the tongue and the uvula relax, obstructing the airway. The airway obstruction causes the level of oxygen in the blood to fall (hypoxia), increases the stress on the heart, elevates blood pressure, and prevents the patient from entering REM sleep, the restful and restorative stage of sleep. In other words, sleep apnea causes deprivation of quality sleep. The symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include loud snoring and/or abnormal pattern of snoring with pauses and gasps. Other symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, memory changes, depression, and irritability. In some patients sleep apnea can contribute to high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, and heart attack. Obstructive sleep apnea typically affects middle-age, overweight men, and may affect women in later years. Obstructive apnea can be aggravated by alcohol, sleeping pills and tranquilizers taken at bedtime. Sleep laboratories are now available to monitor different stages of sleep, diagnose sleep apnea, determine the type (obstructive or central) and severity of sleep apnea, and design treatment. General measures in treating obstructive sleep apnea include losing excessive weight, avoiding alcohol and sedatives, sleeping on one side, and medications to relieve nasal congestion. CPAP -- which stands for continuous positive airway pressure -- is an effective treatment for sleep apnea. A mask is worn over the nose during sleep while compressed air is gently forced through the nose to keep the airway open. Different patients need different mask sizes and different pressure levels for optimal treatment results. Another type of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is ENT surgery. In an operation called UPPP, the surgeon removes excessive soft tissue from the back of the throat to relieve obstruction. See also: CPAP."
Sleep drug,"Sleep drug: Any drug used to help sleep. Most prescription sleep drugs are sedative hypnotic agents. They include Valium, Xanax, Restoril, Ambien, and Sonata."
Sleep paralysis,"Sleep paralysis: A frightening form of paralysis that occurs when a person suddenly finds himself or herself unable to move for a few minutes, most often upon falling asleep or waking up. Sleep paralysis is due to an irregularity in passing between the stages of sleep and wakefulness. The symptoms of sleep paralysis include sensations of noises, smells, levitation, paralysis, terror, and images of frightening intruders. Once considered very rare, up to half of all people are now believed to experience sleep paralysis sometime during their life. Sleep paralysis is not considered to be a sign of a serious condition, although it can be frightening. Sleep paralysis occurs as a person is moving into or out of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the deepest part of sleep. During REM sleep, the body is largely disconnected from the brain, effectively leaving the body paralyzed. Sleep paralysis is the result of premature (or persistent) mind-body disconnection as one is about to enter into (or exit from) REM sleep. Sleep paralysis occurs most often after jet lag or periods of sleeplessness that interrupt the normal REM patterns, or after changes in sleep patterns. It affects both sexes equally and occurs at all ages but is most common in teenagers. Medically, sleep paralysis is sometimes called waking paralysis, predormital (before-sleep) paralysis, postdormital (after-sleep) paralysis, and REM sleep atonia."
Sliding hiatal hernia,"Sliding hiatal hernia: Hiatal hernias are categorized as being either sliding or para-esophageal. Sliding hiatal hernias are those in which the junction of the esophagus and stomach, referred to as the gastro- esophageal junction, and part of the stomach protrude into the chest. The junction may reside permanently in the chest, but often it juts into the chest only during a swallow. This occurs because with each swallow the muscle of the esophagus contracts causing the esophagus to shorten and to pull up the stomach. When the swallow is finished, the herniated part of the stomach falls back into the abdomen. Para-esophageal hernias are hernias in which the gastro- esophageal junction stays where it belongs (attached at the level of the diaphragm), but part of the stomach passes or bulges into the chest beside the esophagus. The para- esophageal hernias themselves remain in the chest at all times and are not affected by swallows. A para-esophageal hiatal hernia that is large, particularly if it compresses the adjacent esophagus, may impede the passage of food into the stomach and cause food to stick in the esophagus after it is swallowed. Ulcers also may form in the herniated stomach due to the trauma caused by food that is stuck or acid from the stomach. Fortunately, large para-esophageal hernias are uncommon."
SLS (Sjogren-Larsson syndrome),"SLS (Sjogren-Larsson syndrome): The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is a genetic (inherited) disease usually characterized by a triad of clinical findings consisting of ichthyosis (thickened fish-like skin), spastic paraplegia (spasticity of the legs) and mental retardation. The skin changes in the SLS are similar to those in congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, a genetic disease that results in fish-like, reddened skin. Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) is a regular feature. Ecchymoses (bruises) are present at birth or soon after in SLS. The spasticity can also affect the arms as well as the legs, resulting in spastic paraplegia. The mental retardation is significant. Most of the patients never walk. About half the patients have seizures. Eye problems are also part of the syndrome. About half of cases have pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Glistening white dots on the retina are characteristic. People with SLS tend to be unusually short. Sjogren in 1956 (and Sjogren and Larsson in 1957) suggested that all Swedes with the syndrome are descended from one ancestor in whom a mutation (a genetic change) occurred about 600 years ago. This mutation is now present in at least 1% of the population in northern Sweden. This phenomenon is called founder effect (because everyone is descended from one ""founder"" within what was once a tiny group of people). The gene for SLS has been found situated on chromosome number 17 (in band 17p11.2). The presence in a person of one copy of the gene (the heterozygous state) is harmless. However, if two gene carriers (heterozygotes) mate, the risk for each of their children is one-quarter to receive both of their SLS genes and to have the syndrome. The inheritance of SLS is thus termed autosomal (non-sexlinked) recessive. The laboratory findings are critically important. There is a deficiency of an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase 10 (FALDH10)in SLS. The syndrome is due to a deficit of FALDH10 and the gene for the SLS gene is synonymous with the FALDH10 gene. Some clinical improvement has been reported to occur with fat restriction in the diet and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides. Persons of diverse and different ethnic origins are now known with the SLS. They include not only Swedes but, for example, members of families of other European, Arabic, and native American (AmerIndian) descent. This is evidence for genetic homogeneity (what appears clinically to be one genetic disease is in reality due to a diversity of mutations. All of the mutations causing SLS have proved to be changes in the FALDH gene. The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is sometimes called the T. Sjogren syndrome to distinguish it from the sicca syndrome, which was described by Henrick Sjogren, a Swedish ophthalmologist. The Sjogren of the Sjorgren-Larsson syndrome was Torsten Sjogren (1896-1974), professor of psychiatry at the celebrated Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm and a pioneer in modern psychiatry and medical genetics. Tage Larsson was similarly a Swedish physician. The Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is also known as the ichthyosis, spastic neurologic disorder, and oligophrenia (an old word for mental retardation) syndrome; fatty alcohol: NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency (FAO deficiency); fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (FALDH deficiency); and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase 10 deficiency (FALDH10 deficiency)."
SLV,SLV: Sapporo-like virus. See: Sapovirus.
Calorie,"Calorie: A unit of food energy. The word calorie is ordinarily used instead of the more precise, scientific term kilocalorie. A kilocalorie represents the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a liter of water 1' centigrade at sea level. Technically, a kilocalorie represents 1,000 true calories of energy."
Small eye,"Small eye: Also called microphthalmia, an abnormally small eye, a congenital malformation (birth defect) of the globe. The related term ""anophthalmia"" means no eye and refers to absence of the globe and ocular tissue from the orbit. Microphthalmia may involve one or both eyes. It may occur in isolation with no associated malformations or it may be part of a multiple congenital malformation syndrome as, for example, the congenital rubella syndrome, the triploidy syndrome (due to the presence of 69 chromosomes), the trisomy 13 syndrome (Patau syndrome, due to an extra chromosome 13), and the Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome (due to deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 4). Also called microphthalmos. Microphthalmia comes from the Greek micro-, small + the ophthalmos, eye = small eye."
Small for gestational age (SGA),"Small for gestational age (SGA): SGA infants weigh 2500 g or less at birth and are considered to have intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), given their gestational age. By contrast, an infant may weighs 2500 g or less simply because of prematurity."
Small intestine,Small intestine: The part of the digestive tract that extends from the stomach to the large intestine.
Small round blue cell tumor,"Small round blue cell tumor: a group of childhood tumors that is characterized by a similar appearance under the microscope. The appearance is that of small, round, primitive cells that stain blue with conventional staining techniques for biopsy analysis. The small round blue cell tumors include neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the Ewing's family of tumors. Sometimes other tumor types are included in this group. In any case, small round blue cell tumors are malignant tumors that are hard to distinguish from each other using conventional microscopic analysis. Specialized laboratory testing, including molecular diagnostic tests, are used to differentiate one type of these tumors from another. It is essential to determine the exact type of tumor, because the treatments for these tumors are different based on their type."
Smell,"Smell: The sense that provides information about an object's scent, often giving clues to the palatability of food, the safety of air, and other matters. The organs of smell are made up of patches of tissue called the olfactory membranes that are each about the size of a postage stamp. These membranes are located in a pair of clefts just under the bridge of the nose. Most air breathed in normally flows through the nose, but only a small part reaches the olfactory clefts'just enough to get a response to an odor. When a person sniffs to detect a smell, air moves faster through the nose, increasing the flow to the olfactory clefts and carrying more odor to these sensory organs."
Smooth muscle,"Smooth muscle: Along with skeletal and cardiac muscle, one of the types of muscle tissue in the body. Smooth muscle generally forms the supporting tissue of blood vessels and hollow internal organs, such as the stomach, intestine, and bladder. It is considered smooth because it does not have the microscopic lines (the striations) seen in the other two types of muscle."
Snoring,"Snoring: A rough rattling noise made on inspiration during sleep by vibration of the soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth) and the uvula (the prominent structure dangling down at the back of the mouth). On inspiration, air on its way to the lungs travels by the tongue, the soft palate, the uvula, and the tonsils. When a person is awake, the muscles in the back of the throat tighten to hold these structures in place and prevent them from collapsing and vibrating in the airway. During sleep, the soft palate and uvula may vibrate causing the sounds of snoring. Snoring is believed to occur in anywhere from 30% of women to over 40% of men."
Snort,"Snort: Take in a drug by nasal inhalation. For example, snorting cocaine is inhaling cocaine powder through the nose where it is absorbed through the nasal tissues into the bloodstream."
Snot,"Snot: A popular and pejorative, term for nasal mucus (mucus produced in the nose)."
Snuff,"Snuff: Tobacco in the form of a powder that is inhaled into the nose, not smoked. Snuff and chewing tobacco are the two main forms of smokeless tobacco in use in the United States. Cancers of the oral cavity (i.e., the mouth, lip, and tongue) have been associated with the use of chewing tobacco as well as snuff. Studies indicate that the tumors often arise at the site of placement of the tobacco. Smokeless tobacco was formally classified as a ""known human carcinogen"" by the US government in 2000. The anatomical snuffbox is a hollow seen on the radial aspect (the thumbside of the back) of the wrist when the thumb is extended fully."
Social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder: Excessive fear of embarrassment in social situations that is extremely intrusive and can have debilitating effects on personal and professional relationships. Also called social phobia. Phobias are persistent, irrational fears of certain objects or situations. They recognize that their fear may be excessive or unreasonable, but are unable to overcome it. The symptoms and signs of social phobia include blushing, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, muscle tension, nausea or other stomach discomfort, lightheadedness, and other symptoms of anxiety. Social phobia can be extremely disabling to a person's work, social and family relationships. People with this disorder tend to lead difficult and diminished lives. The emotional toll of the disease is great. Many people with social phobia have trouble reaching their educational and professional goals or even maintaining employment. They may depend on others financially and try to relieve anxiety with alcohol and drugs. In extreme cases, a person may begin to avoid all social situations and become housebound. Effective treatments for social phobias include medications, a specific form of psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Medications for social phobias include antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as drugs known as high-potency benzodiazepines. People with a specific form of social phobia, called performance phobia, can be helped with drugs called beta-blockers. Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches patients to react differently to the situations and bodily sensations that trigger anxiety symptoms. For example, a type of cognitive-behavioral treatment known as ""exposure therapy"" involves helping patients become more comfortable with situations that frighten them by gradually increasing exposure to the situation."
Sociophobia,"Sociophobia: Fear of social gatherings, fear of socializing, fear of embarrassment in social situations that is extremely intrusive and can have markedly debilitating effects on personal and professional relationships. Phobias are persistent, excessive, irrational fears of certain objects or situations. People plagued by phobias recognize that their fears may be outsized and unreasonable, but are unable to overcome them. They are essentially addicted to their fears. The signs and symptoms of sociophobia include blushing, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, muscle tension, nausea or other stomach discomfort, lightheadedness, and other symptoms of anxiety. Untreated severe sociophobia may be disabling to a person's work, social and family relationships. In extreme cases, a sociophobe may begin to avoid all social situations and become housebound. Treatments for sociophobia include medications, a specific form of psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or a combination of medication and psychotherapy. ""Sociophobia"" is derived from the Latin ""socius"" (companion) and the Greek ""phobos"" (fear)."
Sodium,"Sodium: The major positive ion (cation) in the fluid surrounding cells in the body. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When sodium is combined with chloride, the resulting substance is a crystal called table salt. Excess dietary sodium is largely excreted in the urine, but too much salt in the diet tends to increase the blood pressure. Too much or too little sodium in the blood (called hypernatremia or hyponatremia respectively) can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes can be fatal. Normal blood sodium level is 135'145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L) or 135'145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L) in international units."
Somatic,Somatic: 1. Relating to the body. a. As distinguished from the mind (the psyche). b. From the Greek word somatikos meaning body.
Somnambulism,"Somnambulism: Sleepwalking. Purposeful moving, usually but not always including walking, while in a deep stage of sleep. Sleepwalking occurs most frequently in children, particularly boys. Sedatives tend to exacerbate rather than cure sleepwalking. The best measures are preventative: ensure that the sleepwalker is in a safe room for walking, and cannot accidentally fall through an open window or down stairs. Some types of sleepwalking are related to seizure disorders, bipolar disorders, or other neurological conditions, but most cases are transitory and due to unknown causes."
Somnolence,"Somnolence: Sleepiness, the state of feeling drowsy, ready to fall asleep. A person experiencing somnolence is somnolent and is acting somnolently. Somnolence, somnolent, and somnolently go back to the Latin ""somnus"" meaning (please don't yawn) ""sleep."""
Somnolent,"Somnolent: Sleepy or tending to cause sleep. From the Latin work somnus, meaning 'sleep.'"
Sore,"Sore: 1. (adjective) A popular term for painful, such as a sore throat. 2. (noun) A nondescript term for nearly any lesion of the skin or mucous membranes. He has a number of sores in his mouth. The word sore traces its origin to the Anglo-Saxon term sar which meant distressing, grievous, painful."
Sore throat,"Sore throat: Pain in the throat. Sore throat may be caused by many different causes, including inflammation of the larynx, pharynx, or tonsils. First and foremost in frequency are viruses. Many viruses, and even those that cause mononucleosis (mono) and influenza (the flu), cause a sore throat. Some viruses can also produce painful blisters in the mouth and throat (aphthous stomatitis). A sore throat can also be caused by bacteria. The two most common bacteria that cause sore throat are Streptococcus (strep throat) and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (which causes sore throats mainly in young adults and is sometimes associated with a fine red rash). The causes of sore throat range from trivial to grave. Breathing through the mouth dries the throat and makes it feel sore.. A sore throat that lasts for more than 2 weeks can be a sign of a serious illness, such as throat cancer or AIDS. Throat soreness is typically associated with painful swallowing. Inflammation of the pharynx (pharyngitis) is the most common form of sore throat. Salt water gargles, hard candies, sprays (for example, Chloraseptic) and lozenges can provide temporary pain relief. A humidifier may help relieve sore throats caused by mouth breathing and dry air. Acetaminophen such as Tylenol or ibuprofen such as Advil may help control the pain. For adults, nasal sprays, such as Afrin, may be used for 2-3 days to prevent mouth breathing. Other decongestant products, such as Sudafed, may be also helpful. Strep throat is a major concern. 5%-10% of sore throats in adults and 15%-40% of sore throats in children are caused by strep. A ""rapid strep"" test is often done and may be followed by a strep culture. If either is positive, the sore throat needs to be treated with penicillin or another antibiotic. The major objective is to prevent the development of rheumatic fever, a serious illness that can cause joint pain and heart valve damage."
Spasm,"Spasm: A brief, automatic jerking movement. A muscle spasm can be quite painful, with the muscle clenching tightly. A spasm of the coronary artery can cause the pain of angina. Spasms in various types of tissue may be caused by stress, medication, and overexercise."
Spastic colitis,"Spastic colitis: A common gastrointestinal disorder involving an abnormal condition of gut contractions (motility) characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel habits with alternating diarrhea and constipation, symptoms that tend to be chronic and to wax and wane over the years. Although the disorder can cause chronic recurrent discomfort, it does not lead to any serious organ problems. Making the diagnosis usually involves excluding other illnesses. Treatment is directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating high fiber and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners), exercise, relaxation techniques, and medications. Alternative names include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nervous colon syndrome, and mucus colitis."
Spasticity,"Spasticity: A state of increased tone of a muscle (and an increase in the deep tendon reflexes). For example, with spasticity of the legs (spastic paraplegia) there is an increase in tone of the leg muscles so they feel tight and rigid and the knee jerk reflex is exaggerated."
"Speculum, ear","Speculum, ear: A funnel shaped piece of plastic on a light source that is inserted into the auditory canal of the ear, allowing the examiner to look at the ear canal and ear drum. The auditory canal begins at the circular opening of the ear and continues a distance of about one inch [about 2 1/2 cm] to the eardrum, or tympanic membrane. Using this viewing instrument, a clinician can see through the speculum to look for diseases of the ear canal (swimmer's ear), wax buildup, eardrum perforation, foreign objects, and other problems."
Speech-language  pathologist,"Speech-language pathologist: A specialist who evaluates and treats patients with speech, language, cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders in individuals of all ages, from infants to the elderly. Speech pathologists have a master's degree or doctorate in their specialty, as well as a Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) earned by working under supervision. Some states in the US also require a state license. Abbreviated SLP. See also: Speech therapy."
Speed,"Speed: Common street name for a stimulant drug, especially for an amphetamine. Amphetamines have been used to treat hyperactivity in children, the symptoms of narcolepsy, and as an appetite suppressant and they are also frequently abused as a stimulant of the central nervous system."
Sperm,"Sperm: A sperm is the male ""gamete"" or sex cell. It combines with the female ""gamete,"" called an ovum, to form a zygote. The formation process is called ""fertilization."" (see ovum, zygote)."
Spermatogenesis,"Spermatogenesis: The process of sperm formation. The term was created from the prefix ""spermato-"" (Greek sperma, the seed or germ) + ""genesis"" (the coming into being of something) = the coming into being of sperm. Spermatogenesis is in contrast to oogenesis, the process of egg (ovum) formation."
Sphygmomanometer,"Sphygmomanometer: An instrument for measuring blood pressure, particularly in arteries. The two types of sphygmomanometers are a mercury column and a gauge with a dial face. The sphygmomanometer in most frequent use today consists of a gauge attached to a rubber cuff which is wrapped around the upper arm and is inflated to constrict the arteries. A blood pressure reading consists of two numbers: systolic and diastolic. Systolic refers to systole, the phase when the heart pumps blood out into the aorta. Diastolic refers to diastole, the resting period when the heart refills with blood. At each heartbeat, blood pressure is raised to the systolic level, and, between beats, it drops to the diastolic level. With the cuff inflated with air, a stethoscope is placed over an artery (the brachial artery) in the crook of the arm. As the air in the cuff is released, the first sound heard through the stethoscope marks the systolic pressure. As the release of air from the cuff continues, a point is reached when the sound diminishes and then is no longer heard. The point where the sound disappears marks the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure reading might show the systolic and diastolic pressures to be, for example, 120 and 78mm of mercury (Hg) respectively -- written 120/78 and said to be ""120 over 78."" A typical blood pressure reading for an adult might, in fact, be 120/78. Readings vary depending on age and many other factors. Children and adults with smaller or larger than average-sized arms may need special-sized pressure cuffs. The sphygmomanometer was introduced in 1896 by the Italian physician Scipione Riva-Rocci (1863-1937). The American physiologist Joseph Erlanger (1874-1965) studied the principles of sphygmomanometry and devised a recording sphygmomanometer. The word ""sphygmomanometer"" (pronounced sfig?mo?ma?nom?e?ter) was put together from the Greek sphygmos, the beating of the heart or the pulse + manometer, a device for measuring pressure or tension."
Spinal cord,"Spinal cord: The major column of nerve tissue that is connected to the brain and lies within the vertebral canal and from which the spinal nerves emerge. Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves originate in the spinal cord: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. The spinal cord and the brain constitute the central nervous system. The spinal cord consists of nerve fibers that transmit impulses to and from the brain. Like the brain, the spinal cord is covered by three connective-tissue envelopes called the meninges. The space between the outer and middle envelopes is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear colorless fluid that cushions the spinal cord against jarring shock. Also known simply as the cord."
Spinal Tap,"Spinal tap: Also known as a lumbar puncture or ""LP"", a spinal tap is a procedure whereby spinal fluid is removed from the spinal canal for the purpose of diagnostic testing. It is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, especially infections, such as meningitis. It can also provide clues to the diagnosis of stroke, spinal cord tumor and cancer in the central nervous system. A lumbar puncture is so-called because the needle goes into the lumbar portion (the ""small"") of the back. Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis. An LP is most commonly done for diagnostic purposes, namely to obtain a sample of the fluid in the spinal canal (the cerebrospinal fluid) for examination. An LP can also be done for therapeutic purposes, namely as a way of administering antibiotics, cancer drugs, or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, for examples, normal-pressure hydrocephalus and benign intracranial hypertension). The patient is typically lying down sideways for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up. LPs in infants are often done upright. After local anesthesia is injected into the small of the back (the lumbar area), a needle is inserted in between the nearby bony building blocks (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is usually placed between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae). Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing. The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury. The normal CSF contains various chemicals such as protein and sugar (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed. A Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows: These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory. Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from hydrocephalus; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (encephalitis, meningitis); tumors of brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as multiple sclerosis. When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include headache, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of headache, which can appear from hours to up to a day after LP. Headaches occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat 1-3 hours after the procedure. The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation but an LP can provide lifesaving information."
Spine,"Spine: 1) The column of bone known as the vertebral column, which surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The spine can be categorized according to level of the body: i.e., cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (upper and middle back), and lumbar spine (lower back). See also vertebral column. 2) Any short prominence of bone. The spines of the vertebrae protrude at the base of the back of the neck and in the middle of the back. These spines protect the spinal cord from injury from behind."
Spirometry,Spirometry: A test of the air capacity of the lung. The test utilizes a machine called a spirometer to measure the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs.
Spit,"1. As a noun: Popular term for sputum.
2. As a verb: To eject sputum; to expectorate."
Spleen,"Spleen: An organ that is located in the upper-left part of the abdomen, not far from the stomach, that produces lymphocytes, which are important elements in the immune system. The spleen is the largest lymphatic organ in the body. The spleen also filters blood, serves as a major reservoir for blood, and destroys blood cells that are aged (or abnormal, as in the case of sickle cells)."
Splenomegaly,"Splenomegaly: Abnormal enlargement of the spleen. Splenomegaly is a sign of an underlying condition, such as severe liver disease, leukemia, or mononucleosis. Patients with splenomegaly should avoid activities that risk trauma to the abdomen, including contact sports, because of risk of bleeding from the injured spleen."
Split personality,"Split personality: Multiple personality disorder, a neurosis in which the personality becomes dissociated into two or more distinct parts each of which becomes dominant and controls behavior from time to time to the exclusion of the other parts. A modern name for this condition is dissociative identity disorder."
Spondylitis,"Spondylitis: Inflammation of one or more of the vertebrae of the spine. Diffuse inflammation of the spine is seen, for example, in the disease ankylosing spondylitis. Localized spondylitis is seen with infections of a certain area of the spine, such as in Pott's disease (tuberculosis of the spine)."
Spontaneous abortion,"Spontaneous abortion: A miscarriage, that is, any pregnancy that is not viable (the fetus cannot survive) or in which the fetus is born before the 20th week of pregnancy. Spontaneous abortion occurs in at least 15-20% of all recognized pregnancies and usually takes place before the 13th week of pregnancy. A spontaneous abortion is as opposed to an induced abortion. In a spontaneous abortion, it is purely accidental, that is spontaneous."
Sporadic,"Sporadic: Occurring upon occasion or in a scattered, isolated, or seemingly random way."
Sporotrichosis,"Sporotrichosis: An infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii, typically involving the skin. Persons handling thorny plants, sphagnum moss, or baled hay are at increased risk of developing sporotrichosis. The first sign is usually a small painless bump resembling an insect bite. The bump can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm, where the fungus first entered through a break on the skin. This is followed by one or more additional bumps that open and may look like boils. Eventually, the bumps turn into open hollowed-out sores (ulcerations) that are very slow to heal. The infection can also spread to other areas of the body. Treatment is with antibiotics."
the eyes,"Spots in front of the eyes: Also known as ""floaters"", blurry spots that drift in front of the eyes but do not block vision. The blur is the result of debris from the vitreous casting a shadow on the retina. The spot is the image formed by a deposit of protein drifting about in the vitreous, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the middle of the eye. Floaters are often described by patients as spots, strands, or little flies. Some patients even want to use a fly-swatter to eliminate these pesky floaters. Floaters are usually benign (not serious). They can result from a separation of the vitreous gel from the retina. This condition is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Although a PVD occurs commonly, there are no retinal tears associated with the condition most of the time. No treatments are available for floaters although they tend to become less annoying over time. Remember also that floaters are usually not associated with serious eye problems. Permanent or recurring white or black spots in the same area of your field of vision may, however, be an early warning sign of cataracts or another serious eye problem. If you experience a shadow or curtain that affects any part of your vision, this can indicate that a retinal tear has occurred and has progressed to a detached retina. In this situation, you should immediately consult an ophthalmologist since time is of the essence."
"Sprue, nontropical","Sprue, nontropical: This condition results from an immune (allergic) reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat and related grains and present in many foods that we eat. Sprue causes impaired absorption and digestion of nutrients through the small intestine. Symptoms include frequent diarrhea and weight loss. A skin condition called dermatitis herpetiformis can be associated with celiac sprue. The most accurate diagnostic test for sprue is a biopsy of the involved small bowel. Treatment is to avoid gluten in the diet. Medications are used for refractory (stubborn) sprue. Known under a number of other names, including celiac sprue."
Squamous cells,"Squamous cells: Flat cells that look like fish scales that line many body organs. The word ""squamous"" came from the Latin squama meaning ""the scale of a fish or serpent."" Squamous cells make up most of the cells in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis), the passages of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and the linings of the hollow organs of the body."
SSRI,"SSRI: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, one of a family of antidepressant medications (brand names: Celexa, Luvox, Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft) that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin."
St. Anthony's fire,"St. Anthony's fire: One of several conditions characterized by intense inflammation of the skin, such as from erysipelas or ergotism. Erysipelas is a type of spreading hot, bright-red strep skin infection. Ergotism is an intensely painful burning sensation in the limbs and extremities caused by ergotamines from a fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that can contaminate rye and wheat. The fungus produces the ergotamines, which constrict blood vessels and cause the muscle of the uterus to contract. In excess, ergotamines are highly toxic and cause symptoms such as hallucinations, severe gastrointestinal upset, and a type of dry gangrene. Chronic ergot poisoning (ergotism) was rife during the Middle Ages due to the consumption of contaminated rye."
care,"Standard of care: 1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is ""a new standard of care, but not necessarily the only standard of care."" (New England Journal of Medicine, 2004) 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is how similarly qualified practitioners would have managed the patient's care under the same or similar circumstances. The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the appropriate standard of care and demonstrate that the standard of care has been breached."
Stapes,"Stapes: A stirrup-shaped bone in the middle ear. The stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus, another little bone in the middle ear, to the oval window adjacent to the inner ear. The stapes is the smallest bone in the body. Pronounced stay-peas. Stapes, a Late Latin word meaning stirrup, cannot have been a classical Latin term because the Romans rode without stirrups (or a saddle)."
Staphylococcal infection,"Staphylococcal infection: Infection with one of the Staphylococcal bacteria. Staph infection can cause pus-filled abscesses on the skin or internal organs, and can migrate through the blood to infect the heart, brain, and other areas. Treatment is with antibiotics and drainage of abscesses as needed. A particularly dangerous form of this infection is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly referred to as MRSA. See also Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), Staphylococcus."
Staphylococcus,"Staphylococcus: A group of bacteria that cause a multitude of diseases. Under a microscope, staphylococcus bacteria are round and bunched together. They can cause illness directly by infection or indirectly through products they make, such as the toxins responsible for food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. The best-known member of the staphylococcus family is Staphylococcus aureus. A drug resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus is called MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph. aureus). Staphylococci are the main culprits in hospital-acquired infections, and they cause thousands of deaths every year. Also known as staph."
Stasis,"Stasis: A stoppage or slowdown in the flow of blood or other body fluid, such as lymph. For example, a stasis ulcer is an ulcer that develops in an area in which the circulation is sluggish and the venous return (the return of venous blood toward the heart) is poor. A common location for stasis ulcers is the ankle."
Stasis ulcer,"Stasis ulcer: A stasis ulcer is an ulcer (a crater) that develops in an area in which the circulation is sluggish and the venous return (the return of venous blood toward the heart) is poor. A common location for stasis ulcers is on the ankle. Stasis refers to a stoppage or slowdown in the flow of blood (or other body fluid such as lymph). ""Stasis"" is a Greek word meaning ""the posture for standing"" and is derived from the Greek ""histemi"" meaning ""to make stand still."""
STAT,"STAT: A common medical abbreviation for urgent or rush. From the Latin word statim, meaning ""immediately."""
Statins,"Statins: A class of drugs that lower cholesterol. The statin drugs on the market in the US include: The statins lower LDL-cholesterol levels, and they lower LDL-cholesterol more than other types of drugs. Statins inhibit an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase that controls the rate of cholesterol production in the body. These drugs lower cholesterol by slowing down the production of cholesterol and by increasing the liver's ability to remove the LDL-cholesterol already in the blood. The large reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol produced by these drugs in research studies resulted in large reductions in heart attacks and heart disease deaths. Thanks to their track record in these studies and their ability to lower LDL-cholesterol, statins have become the drugs most often prescribed when a person with heart disease needs a cholesterol- lowering medicine. Studies using statins have reported 20 to 60% lower LDL-cholesterol levels in patients on these drugs. Statins also produce a modest increase in HDL- cholesterol and reduce elevated triglyceride levels. The statins are usually given in a single dose at the evening meal or at bedtime. It is important that these medications be given in the evening to take advantage of the fact that the body makes more cholesterol at night than during the day. Results from the statins start to be seen after several weeks, with a maximum effect in 4 to 6 weeks. The statins are generally well tolerated by most patients, and serious side effects are rare. A few patients will experience an upset stomach, gas, constipation, and abdominal pain or cramps. These symptoms usually are mild to moderate in severity and generally go away as your body adjusts. Rarely a patient will develop abnormalities in blood tests of the liver. Also rare is the side effect of muscle problems. The symptoms are muscle soreness, pain, and weakness. Statins may also strengthen bone tissue. Thus, people over 50 taking statins (to lower cholesterol) had fewer hip fractures, as was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2000."
Status epilepticus,"Status epilepticus: An epileptic seizure that lasts more than 30 minutes; a constant or near-constant state of having seizures. Status epilepticus is a health crisis, and requires immediate treatment. See also epilepsy, seizure disorders."
Stenosis,"Stenosis: A narrowing. For example, aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart."
Stenotic,"Stenotic: Narrowed, as in a stenotic artery. From the Greek ""stenos"" meaning narrow."
Stereotactic,"Stereotactic: Referring to precise positioning in three-dimensional space. For example, biopsies, surgery, or radiation therapy can be done stereotactically."
Sternum,"Sternum: The long flat bone in the upper middle of the front of the chest. The sternum articulates (comes together) with the cartilages of the first seven ribs and with the clavicle (collarbone) on either side. The sternum consists of three parts: the manubrium (the upper segment of the sternum, a flattened, roughly triangular bone), the corpus (body) of the sternum, and the xiphoid process (the little tail of the sternum than points down). These sections of the sternum arise as separate bones, and they may fuse partially or completely with one another. Also known as breastbone."
Sternutation,"Sternutation: Sneezing; the sound of sneezing. When we sneeze, air is expelled with force from the nose (and from the mouth, if it is open) due to a spasmodic contraction of the chest muscles and diaphragm. A sneeze is often triggered by irritation of the mucous membrane of the nose or less often by a bright light striking the eye. One of the earliest known uses of the word ""sternutation"" in English is in a 16th-century book on midwifery, in a passage about infants suffering from frequent ""sternutation and sneesynge."" To sneeze in France is to ""eternuer."" The word has the same roots as sternutation, from the Latin ""sternutare"" which in turn came from the Latin ""sterno"" meaning to stretch out, spread out, strew, or scatter. See also Achoo syndrome."
Steroid,"Steroid: One of a large group of chemical substances classified by a specific carbon structure. Steroids include drugs used to relieve swelling and inflammation, such as prednisone and cortisone; vitamin D; and some sex hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol."
Steroid abuse,"Steroid abuse: Use of substances containing steroids to increase muscle mass. Steroids can have many side effects when misused, including psychiatric problems, liver tumors, reduction in the size of male genitals, sterility, and heart damage."
Stethoscope,"Stethoscope: An instrument that is used to transmit low-volume sounds such as a heartbeat (or intestinal, venous, or fetal sounds) to the ear of the listener. A stethoscope may consist of two ear pieces connected by means of flexible tubing to a diaphragm that is placed against the skin of the patient. The stethoscope has become one of the symbols of the medical profession. The origins of the stethoscope can be traced back to the French physician La'nnec, who in 1819 invented a crude model that consisted of a wooden box that served to help physicians hear the sounds within the chest cavity. It has undergone many modifications since then."
Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome: A serious systemic (body-wide) allergic reaction with a characteristic rash involving the skin and mucous membranes, including the buccal mucosa (inside of the mouth), conjunctiva, and genital areas. Abbreviated SJS. The disease is due to a hypersensitive (allergic) reaction to one of a number of immunologic stimuli including drugs and infectious agents. Complications can include hepatitis, nephritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, arthritis, arthralgia, fever, and myalgia. The diagnosis of SJS is usually made when the characteristic rash appears 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to a known stimulus and it cannot be explained by another diagnosis. The treatment depends, in part, on the suspected precipitating cause. Also known as erythema multiforme major."
STI,STI: Abbreviation for: 1. Sexually transmitted infection. 2. Soft tissue infection. 3. Systolic time interval.
Stiff baby syndrome,"Stiff baby syndrome: A genetic disorder also known as hyperexplexia in which babies have an exaggerated startle reflex (reaction). This disorder was not recognized until 1962 when it was described by Drs. Kok and Bruyn as a disease with the onset at birth of hypertonia (stiffness), exaggerated startle response, strong brain-stem reflexes (especially head-retraction reflex) and, in some cases, epilepsy. The hypertonia (stiffness) was evident with flexion of limbs, disappeared during sleep and diminished over the first year of life. The startle reflex was sometimes accompanied by acute generalized hypertonia (sudden stiffness) causing the person to fall like a log to the ground. There were 29 affected males and females in 6 generations, indicating that the disorder is an autosomal (non-sex-linked) dominant trait. A number of other families have since been found with this disease. Additional findings include a tendency to umbilical and inguinal hernias (presumably due to increased intraabdominal pressure) and congenital dislocation of the hip. The exaggerated startle response persists throughout life; startles can be elicited by lightly touching the person's nose, clapping or making other noises, or suddenly jolting the person's chair. The gene responsible for this disease has been found on chromosome number 5. (It is in bands 5q33.2-q33.3 and is a mutation in the gene for the alpha-1 subunit of the glycine receptor). Treatment is with medications. The neurologic features can usually be controlled with clonazepam (KLONOPIN). In some cases, phenobarbital, diazepam (VALIUM), and valproic acid (DEPAKENE) have also been found useful. Hyperexplexia is also called Kok disease, startle disease, exaggerated startle reflex, and hyperekplexia."
Stomach,"Stomach: The digestive organ that is located in the upper abdomen, under the ribs. The upper part of the stomach connects to the esophagus, and the lower part leads into the small intestine. When food enters the stomach, muscles in the stomach wall create a rippling motion (peristalsis) that mixes and mashes the food. At the same time, juices made by glands in the lining of the stomach help digest the food. After about 3 hours, the food becomes a liquid and moves into the small intestine, where digestion continues."
Stomach cramps,"Stomach cramps: A nonmedical term most often used to describe pain in the mid- or upper abdominal area. Abdominal pain (pain in the belly) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs and does not necessarily arise from the stomach even though an individual may perceive that pain is originating in the stomach. Various organs can be the source of pain in the upper abdomen, including the small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas."
"Stomach fat (belly fat, abdominal fat)","Stomach fat (belly fat, abdominal fat): fat tissue deposited in the midsection of the body around the abdominal organs. Studies have shown that an increased amount of belly fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, and early death. Two measurements, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, have been used by researchers to identify those with increased belly fat."
Stomach paralysis,"Stomach paralysis: Formally called gastroparesis, this is a medical condition in which the muscle of the stomach is paralyzed by a disease of either the stomach muscle itself or the nerves controlling the muscle. As a consequence, food and secretions do not empty normally from the stomach, and there is nausea and vomiting. Gastroparesis may be associated with paralysis of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract (the small intestine and colon). The most common cause of gastroparesis is diabetes mellitus. (So often is gastroparesis due to diabetes that there is a term, gastroparesis diabeticorum, that refers exclusively to it). A nuclear medicine test designed to study gastric emptying is the most common means of diagnosis of gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is treated with medications to increase the contractions of the stomach's muscle, occasionally with surgery, and experimentally with electrical pacing. The word ""gastroparesis"" is compounded from ""gastro"", pertaining to the stomach + ""paresis"", a loss of strength = a loss of strength of the stomach = stomach paralysis."
Stool,Stool: The solid matter that is discharged in a bowel movement.
Stool occult blood test,Stool occult blood test: A test to see whether there is blood in the bowel movement. Also called a fecal occult blood test: A test to check for hidden blood in stool. (Fecal refers to stool. Occult means hidden.) Abbreviated stool OB.
Strain,Strain: 1. An injury to a tendon or muscle (stretch or tear) resulting from overuse or trauma. 2. A hereditary tendency that originated from a common ancestor. 3. To exert maximum effort. 4. To filter.
Streptococcus,"Streptococcus: A group of bacteria that causes a multitude of diseases. Under a microscope, streptococcus bacteria look like a twisted bunch of round berries. Illnesses caused by streptococcus include strep throat, strep pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever (and rheumatic heart valve damage), glomerulonephritis, the skin disorder erysipelas, and PANDAS. Familiarly known as strep."
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus),"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus): A type of bacterium that comes in pairs and is shaped like a lancet (a surgical knife with a short wide two-edged blade). Pneumococcus can cause bacterial pneumonia and otitis media (middle ear infections) as well as other infections such as bacterial meningitis. Vaccines are available against the pneumococcus. The formal name of the bacterium is currently Streptococcus pneumoniae. (The ""strepto-"" means twisted and ""-coccus"" comes from the Greek kokkos meaning berry.) Because of its coming in pairs, it has also been called Diplococcus pneumoniae. ""Pneumoniae"" refers to its propensity to settle in the lungs and cause pneumonia."
Streptococcus pyogenes,"Streptococcus pyogenes: A common bacteria that causes strep throat (streptococcal pharyngitis), impetigo, other skin infections, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, glomerulonephritis, and invasive fasciitis."
Stress,"Stress: In a medical or biological context stress is a physical, mental, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension. Stresses can be external (from the environment, psychological, or social situations) or internal (illness, or from a medical procedure). Stress can initiate the ""fight or flight"" response, a complex reaction of neurologic and endocrinologic systems. Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline or noradrenaline, facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action. These include the following: Acceleration of heart and lung action, paling or flushing, or alternating between both, inhibition of stomach and upper-intestinal action to the point where digestion slows down or stops, the general effect on the sphincters of the body, constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body, liberation of nutrients (particularly fat and glucose) for muscular action, dilation of blood vessels for muscles, inhibition of the lacrimal gland (responsible for tear production) and salivation, dilation of pupil (mydriasis), relaxation of bladder, inhibition of erection, auditory exclusion (loss of hearing), tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), disinhibition of spinal reflexes, and Shaking Stress can cause or influence the course of many medical conditions including psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety. Medical problems can include poor healing, irritable bowel syndrome, high blood pressure, poorly controlled diabetes and many other conditions. Stress management is recognized as an effective treatment modality to include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic components. "
Stricture,"Stricture: An abnormal narrowing of a body passage, especially a tube or a canal. The stricture may be due, for example, to scar tissue or to a tumor. Stricture refers to both the process of narrowing and the narrowed part itself."
Stroke,"Stroke: The sudden death of brain cells due to lack of oxygen, caused by blockage of blood flow or rupture of an artery to the brain. Sudden loss of speech, weakness, or paralysis of one side of the body can be symptoms. A suspected stroke may be confirmed by scanning the brain with special X-ray tests, such as CAT scans. The death rate and level of disability resulting from strokes can be dramatically reduced by immediate and appropriate medical care. Prevention involves minimizing risk factors, such as controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. Abbreviated CVA. Also known as cerebrovascular accident."
Stroke index,"Stroke index: A cardiodynamic measure. Stroke volume is the amount of blood the left ventricle ejects in one beat, measured in milliliters per beat (ml/beat). The stroke volume can be indexed to a patient's body size by dividing by the body surface area to yield the stroke index."
Stroke volume,"Stroke volume: The amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. The stroke volume is not all the blood contained in the left ventricle; normally, only about two-thirds of the blood in the ventricle is expelled with each beat. Together with the heart rate, the stroke volume determines the output of blood by the heart per minute (cardiac output)."
Stroma,"Stroma: The supportive framework of an organ (or gland or other structure), usually composed of connective tissue. The stroma is distinct from the parenchyma, which consists of the key functional elements of that organ. The stroma of the thyroid gland is the connective tissue that supports the lobules and follicles of the thyroid gland. The Greek word ""stroma"" means ""anything spread out for sitting or lying upon,"" essentially a mat. The stroma in anatomy is thus the supporting tissue."
STS,"STS: Commonly used abbreviation for ""sequence tagged site."" A short (200 to 500 base pair) DNA sequence that occurs but once in the genome and whose location and base sequence are known. STSs are detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are useful for localizing and orienting the mapping and sequence data, and serve as landmarks on the physical map of a genome. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are STSs derived from cDNAs (complementary DNAs)."
Study population,"Study population: The group of individuals in a study. In a clinical trial, the participants make up the study population. The study population might, for example, consist of all children under 2 years of age in a community."
Stuffy nose,"Stuffy nose: : The presence of increased secretions and mucus in the nasal passages, most commonly arising as a result of a common cold, allergic reaction, or inflammation or infection of the paranasal sinuses (sinus infection)."
Sub-,"Sub-: Prefix meaning meaning under, below, less than normal, secondary, less than fully. As in subacute, subaortic stenosis, subarachnoid, subclavian, subclinical disease, subcutaneous, subdural, subglottis, subjacent, sublingual, subluxation, and subtotal hysterectomy. From the Latin preposition sub meaning under. See also: Hypo-."
Subacute,"Subacute: Rather recent onset or somewhat rapid change. In contrast, acute indicates very sudden onset or rapid change, and chronic indicates indefinite duration or virtually no change."
Subaortic stenosis,"Subaortic stenosis: Narrowing of the left ventricle of the heart just below the aortic valve through which blood must pass on its way up into the aorta. The narrowing cuts the flow of blood. Subaortic stenosis may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired as part of a particular form of heart disease known as ""idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis"" (IHSS). Treatment options include drugs and surgery."
Subarachnoid,"Subarachnoid: Literally, beneath the arachnoid, the middle of three membranes that cover the central nervous system. In practice, subarachnoid usually refers to the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater, the innermost membrane surrounding the central nervous system. The subarachnoid space is a potential space. It normally contains cerebrospinal fluid. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a bleed into this space. The arachnoid is named for its delicate, spider-web-like filaments that extend from its undersurface through the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space to the pia mater. ""Arachnoid"" comes from the Greek ""arachne"" meaning spider or cobweb + ""eidos"" meaning resemblance = spider-web-like."
Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage: A bleeding into the subarachnoid, the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater, the innermost membrane surrounding the central nervous system. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically occurs when an artery breaks open in the brain, such as from a ruptured aneurysm. This can require emergency neurosurgical procedures."
Subclavian,"Subclavian: Under the clavicle (the collar bone), as the subclavian artery or the subclavian vein."
Subclinical disease,"Subclinical disease: An illness that is staying below the surface of clinical detection. A subclinical disease has no recognizable clinical findings. It is distinct from a clinical disease, which has signs and symptoms that can be recognized. Many diseases, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, are frequently subclinical before they surface as clinical diseases."
Subcu,"SubQ: Abbreviation for subcutaneous. Subcutaneous means under the skin. It implies just under the skin. With a subcutaneous injection, a needle is inserted just under the skin. A drug (for example, insulin) can then be delivered into the subcutaneous tissues. After the injection, the drug moves into small blood vessels and the bloodstream. The subcutaneous route is used with many protein and polypeptide drugs such as insulin which, if given by mouth, would be broken down and digested in the intestinal tract."
Subcutaneous,"Subcutaneous: Under the skin. For example, a subcutaneous injection is an injection in which a needle is inserted just under the skin. Also known as subcu. Abbreviated subq."
Subdural,"Subdural: Below the dura, the outermost, toughest, and most fibrous of the three membranes (meninges) covering the brain and the spinal cord. An subdural hematoma is a collection of blood beneath the dura."
Subdural hematoma,"Subdural hematoma: Bleeding into the space between the dura (the brain cover) and the brain itself. This space is called the subdural space. If the hematoma puts increased pressure on the brain, neurological abnormalities including slurred speech, impaired gait, and dizziness may result and progress to coma and even death. Subdural hematomas can be caused by minor accidents to the head, major trauma, or the spontaneous bursting of a blood vessel in the brain (aneurysm). Acute subdural hematomas are usually due to severe head trauma. Chronic subdural hematomas may be very insidious. They usually go unnoticed, sometimes for 2 to 4 weeks: When they do cause problems, the incident that caused the bleeding is often long past. Symptoms include increasing daily headache, fluctuating drowsiness or confusion, and mild weakness on one side of the body. Subdural hematomas are more common in alcoholics and patients over 50 years of age. In infants, subdural hematomas can cause the fontanel to bulge and the head circumference to enlarge. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI or CT scan. Treatment is by trepanation -- drilling through the skull to drain the excess blood. "
Subjacent,"Subjacent: Just beneath or underneath. The opposite of subjacent is superjacent. Other related terms include adjacent and circumjacent. From sub-, under + the Latin jacere, to lie = to lie under."
Sublingual,"Sublingual: Underneath the tongue. For example, a sublingual medication is a type of lozenge that is dissolved under the tongue."
Subluxation,Subluxation: Partial dislocation of a joint. A complete dislocation is a luxation.
Subq,"Subq: Abbreviation for subcutaneous. Subcutaneous means under the skin. It implies just under the skin. With a subcutaneous injection, a needle is inserted just under the skin. A drug (for example, insulin) can then be delivered into the subcutaneous tissues. After the injection, the drug moves into small blood vessels and the bloodstream. The subcutaneous route is used with many protein and polypeptide drugs such as insulin which, if given by mouth, would be broken down and digested in the intestinal tract."
Substance,"Substance: 1. Material with particular features.
2. The material that makes up an organ or structure. Also known in medicine as the substantia."
Substance abuse,"Substance abuse: The excessive use of a substance, especially alcohol or a drug. (There is no universally accepted definition of substance abuse.) A definition of substance abuse that is frequently cited is that in DSM-IV, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) issued by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM-IV definition is as follows:"
Subway diet,"Subway diet:: The Subway diet is a weight loss plan popularized in 2004 by Jared Fogle, who claims that he lost over 245 pounds in one year by eating sandwiches from the Subway chain. Fogle replaced his 10,000 calorie per day food consumption with one small turkey sub and one large veggie sub along with some baked potato chips and diet soda, a total of about 2000 calories. While the ""Subway Diet"" may result in weight loss due to an overall reduction in calories consumed, it severely restricts food choices. Most experts believe that a balanced diet containing a variety of different foods is the healthiest way to lose weight. The SUBWAY® chain does not endorse the diet Jared created and cautions anyone embarking on a weight-loss plan to consult their physician."
Succenturiate placenta,"Succenturiate placenta: An extra placenta separate from the main placenta. In anatomy ""succenturiate"" means substituting for or accessory to an organ. In this case, a succenturiate placenta is an accessory placenta."
Succumb,"Succumb: To lose the will to oppose something or to give up and accept something that you first opposed. In the context of illness, to succumb to an illness is to stop opposing it, to no longer battle it, but to die from it. Succumbing, like passing, has become a euphemism (an inoffensive substitute) for dying. As with many of our words, succumb came from Latin via France. In Latin ""succumbere"" means to fall down or yield. The French ""succomber"" crossed the Channel in the 1400s but the euphemistic sense of succumb as yielding to a disease dates only to about 1800."
Sulcus,"Sulcus: A groove, furrow, or trench. The plural is sulci. In anatomy, there are many sulci; an example is the superior pulmonary sulcus."
Sulfite sensitivity,"Sulfite sensitivity: Adverse reactions of an allergic nature to sulfites. Sulfites occur in fermentation and also occur naturally in a number of foods and beverages including wine. Sulfites are used for their preservative properties. Sulfite sensitivity occurs most often in asthmatic adults -- predominantly women. It is uncommon in preschool children. Adverse reactions to sulfites in nonasthmatics are rare. Sulfite sensitivity reactions range from mild to severe and may include skin, respiratory, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. Bronchoconstriction with wheezing is the most common sensitivity response in asthmatics."
Sulfonamides,"Sulfonamides: The sulfa-related group of antibiotics, which are used to treat bacterial infection and some fungal infections. Examples of sulfonamides includes sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole (brand name: Thiosulfil Forte), sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin), and various high-strength combinations of three sulfonamides. Sulfa drugs kill bacteria and fungi by interfering with cell metabolism. They were the wonder drugs before penicillin and are still used today. Because sulfa drugs concentrate in the urine before being excreted, treating urinary tract infections is one of their most common uses. Sulfa drugs can have a number of potentially dangerous interactions with prescription and over-the-counter drugs (including PABA sunscreens), and are not appropriate for patients with some health conditions. Many people are allergic to sulfa medications. Be sure your doctor knows about any other medications you take, your medication allergies and your full health history before taking sulfonamides."
Sulfonylurea,"Sulfonylurea: A class of oral hypoglycemic agents (medications that lower the level of blood glucose) taken by people with type 2 diabetes. The sulfonylureas increase the secretion of insulin by the pancreas. There are two generations of sulfonylureas. The main difference between the first- and second-generation sulfonylureas is in the way they are 'eliminated from the body. As a consequence, second-generation sulfonylureas are usually taken less 'frequently each day than first-generation sulfonylureas and generally are preferred when there is poor function of the kidneys. Examples of first-'generation sulfonylureas are chlorpropamide (Diabinese) and tolbutamide (Orinase). The second-generation sulfonylureas include glipizide (Glucotrol and Glucotrol XL), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, and Glynase PresTab), and glimepiride (Amaryl). These drugs are effective in rapidly 'lowering blood sugar but run the risk of causing hypoglycemia."
Sumatriptan,Sumatriptan: A triptan drug for the treatment of migraine.
Sundowning,"Sundowning: also known as Sundown Syndrome, a term used to refer to behavioral changes that often occur in the late afternoon or evening in people with Alzheimer's disease and similar conditions. The behavioral changes make take the form of aggression, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, increased disorientation, or wandering and pacing about. Experts are not sure why these changes occur at this time of day; possible explanations include hormonal factors, reduced vision due to lower light levels, tiredness, boredom and the absence of planned activities, or stress and anxiety of the caregiver that is communicated to the patient."
Sunflower Syndrome,"Sunflower syndrome: This rare form of epilepsy is also known as 
self-induced photosensitive epilepsy. This condition is characterized by 
seizures that occur under specific circumstances, such as looking at a bright 
light source and waving the hand in front of the eyes, opening and closing the 
eyes rapidly, playing video games, or changing television channels quickly when 
sitting close to the screen. People with the condition have been described as 
seeking out light sources and then creating movements to induce the seizure. The 
cause of sunflower syndrome is unknown; physicians most commonly diagnose 
sunflower syndrome in children between the ages of 3 and 10. It affects girls 
75% of the time."
Super-,"Super-: Prefix meaning meaning above, more than normal, or excessive. As in superaspirin, superbug, superjacent, supernumerary, supersize, supertaster. From the Latin preposition super meaning above. See also: Hyper-."
Superaspirin,"Superaspirin: This was a popular term for the next generation of analgesics. They were drugs that had the multiple positive effects of aspirin, but not have the negative effects such as intestinal bleeding. Aspirin binds and inhibits two isoforms of the enzyme Cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. Super aspirins bind and inhibit COX-2 only. Cox-2 inhibitors (refecoxib [Vioxx - withdrawn from the market in 2004] and celecoxib [Celebrex]) and antiplatelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists reduced inflammation and pain. They were reported as better than regular aspirin in relieving arthritic pain, with fewer side effects. However, they were found to be associated with a doubling of strokes and heart attacks. Many have been pulled from the market."
Superbug,"Superbug: : An informal term for a bacterium that has become resistant to antibiotics that usually are used to treat it, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or any multidrug-resistant bacterium. The following types of bacteria have all been described antibiotic-resistant threats to patients in healthcare settings or have been referred to in the media as ""superbugs"":"
Superficial,"Superficial: In anatomy, on the surface or shallow. As opposed to deep. The skin is superficial to the muscles. The cornea is on the superficial surface of the eye. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Superfoods,"Superfoods: A non-medical term popularized in the media to refer to foods that can have health-promoting properties such as reducing one's risk of disease or improving any aspect of physical or emotional health. So-called superfoods may have an unusually high content of antioxidants, vitamins, or other nutrients. Examples of health promoting foods that have been referred to as superfoods include: soy, blueberries, salmon, green tea, walnuts, broccoli, and spinach. It is important to note that there is no accepted medical definition of a superfood. Alternate spellings: super foods, super-foods"
Superior,"Superior: In antomy, above or over top of. As opposed to inferior. The heart is superior to the stomach. The superior surface of the tongue rests against the palate. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Supination,"Supination: Rotation of the arm or leg outward. In the case of supination of the arm, the palm of the hand faces forward."
Supine,"Supine: This refers to having the back or dorsal surface downward. A person who is in a supine position is lying face up as opposed to prone. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Supportive care,"Supportive care: Treatment given to prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and to improve the patient's comfort and quality of life."
Supraventricular tachycardia,"Supraventricular tachycardia: Abbreviated SVT. A regular, abnormally fast heart beat (tachycardia) caused by rapid firing of electrical impulses from a focus above the atrioventricular node (A-V node) in the heart. Called supraventricular because the tachycardia originates above the ventricles of the heart."
Surfactant,"Surfactant: A fluid secreted by the cells of the alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lungs) that serves to reduce the surface tension of pulmonary fluids; surfactant contributes to the elastic properties of pulmonary tissue, preventing the alveoli from collapsing."
Surgery,"Surgery: The branch of medicine that employs operations in the treatment of disease or injury. Surgery can involve cutting, abrading, suturing, or otherwise physically changing body tissues and organs."
Surrogacy,"Surrogacy: A method of reproduction in which a woman agrees to become pregnant, using her own eggs, and carry a child for another individual or couple. In some situations and locations a surrogate mother may be paid for her services. The term is sometimes used to refer to a woman who agrees to carry a biologically unrelated child for another couple that was conceived through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), but the term gestational surrogacy more accurately reflects this situation."
Suture,"1. A type of joint between the bones of the skull where the bones are held tightly together by fibrous tissue. 2. Thread-like material used to sew tissue together. 3. To stitch a wound closed.
The word suture came with little change from the Latin sutura, ""a sewn seam."" In Latin, the verb suere is ""to sew, stitch, or tack together."""
Swallowing syncope,"Swallowing syncope: The temporary loss of consciousness upon swallowing. Syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, fainting. The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating (micturition syncope) or defecating, coughing or swallowing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional stress of fear or pain. Under these conditions, people often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before they lose consciousness. Situational syncope is caused by a reflex of the involuntary nervous system called the vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction leads the heart to slow down (bradycardia) and, at the same time, it leads the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels to dilate (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is then deprived of oxygen, and the fainting episode occurs. The vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. And situational syncope is also called vasovagal syncope, vasodepressor syncope, and Gower syndrome after Sir William Richard Gower (1845-1915), a famous English neurologist whose name is also associated with a sign, a solution, another syndrome, and a tract in the central nervous system."
Sweat gland tumor,"Sweat gland tumor: A benign (harmless) skin tumor called a syringoma that derives from cells related to sweat glands. (These particular specialized cells are scientifically referred to as eccrine.) The skin lesions of syringomas usually appear during puberty or adult life and consist of small bumps 1-3 millimeters in diameter which form underneath the surface of the skin. The most frequent site is the eyelids and around the eyes, but other areas of the body can also be affected (arm pits, lower abdomen, vulva). There may be only one or a few lesions in a localized area or numerous lesions covering a wide area. Syringomas more frequently affect women and do have an hereditary basis in some, but not all, cases. They are also associated with the following genetic conditions: Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Treatment of syringomas can be a problem due to their number and location on the eyelids and face. One method that seems to be effective and creates minimal scarring is the use of a hair removal electric needle. The needle is inserted into the lesion and short bursts of low voltage electricity destroy the tumor. A technique using a CO2 laser has been reported to be quite promising (Kang WH. Dermatologic Surgery 1998 Dec;24(12):1370-4)."
Sweating,Sweating: The act of secreting fluid from the skin by the sweat (sudoriferous) glands. These are small tubular glands situated within and under the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue). They discharge by tiny openings in the surface of the skin. The sweat is a transparent colorless acidic fluid with a peculiar odor. It contains some fatty acids and mineral matter. It is also called perspiration.
"Sweating, gustatory","Sweating, gustatory: Sweating on the forehead, face, scalp, and neck occurring soon after ingesting food. Some gustatory sweating is normal after eating hot, spicy foods. Otherwise, gustatory sweating is most commonly a result of damage to a nerve that goes to the parotid gland, the large salivary gland in the cheek. In this setting, referred to as Frey syndrome, the sweating is usually on one side of the head. Gustatory sweating is also a rare complication of diabetes mellitus. In this case sweating may occur on both sides of the head, with mild or substantial severity. This distressing problem can be difficult to treat. Treatments used include prescription medication. See also Frey syndrome, diabetes."
Swollen tongue,"Swollen tongue: : swelling, or enlargement, of the tongue. A swollen tongue can be a symptom of glossitis, an inflammation of the tongue that can be caused by infections, local irritation or burns, and allergic reactions. Swelling of the tongue can also result from trauma or rare diseases, such as amyloidosis."
Sympathetic nervous system,"Sympathetic nervous system: A part of the nervous system that serves to accelerate the heart rate, constrict blood vessels, and raise blood pressure. The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system constitute the autonomic nervous system."
Symptom,"Symptom: Any subjective evidence of disease. In contrast, a sign is objective. Blood coming out a nostril is a sign; it is apparent to the patient, physician, and others. Anxiety, low back pain, and fatigue are all symptoms; only the patient can perceive them."
Symptomatic,"Symptomatic: 1 With symptoms, as a symptomatic infection. 2 Characteristic of an illness or other medical condition. 3 Directed at the symptoms as symptomatic treatment."
Symptomatic treatment,"Symptomatic treatment: Therapy that eases the symptoms without addressing the basic cause of the disease. For example, symptomatic treatment of advanced lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) beyond the lung is designed to decrease the pain and other symptoms but not to eradicate the disease. Symptomatic treatment is also called palliative treatment."
Synaptonemal complex,"Synaptonemal complex: A protein structure that forms between two homologous chromosomes during meiosis and that is thought to mediate chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination. The synaptonemal complex is a tripartite structure consisting of two parallel lateral regions and a central element. Three specific components of the synaptonemal complex have been characterized: SC protein-1 (SYCP1), SC protein-2 (SYCP2), and SC protein-3 (SYCP3). The SYCP1 gene is on chromosome 1p13; the SYCP2 gene is on chromosome 20q13.33; and the gene for SYCP3 is on chromosome 12q."
Syncope,"Syncope: Partial or complete loss of consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and one's surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in nonmedical quarters,?fainting. Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness or a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions that do not directly involve the heart."
"Syncope, coughing","Syncope, coughing: The temporary loss of consciousness upon coughing. Syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, fainting. The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating (micturition syncope) or defecating, coughing or swallowing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional stress of fear or pain. Under these conditions, people often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before they lose consciousness.

Syndemic,"Syndemic: A set of linked health problems involving two or more afflictions, interacting synergistically, and contributing to excess burden of disease in a population. Syndemics occur when health-related problems cluster by person, place, or time. For example, the SAVA syndemic is comprised of substance abuse, violence, and AIDS, three conditions that disproportionately afflict those living in poverty in US cities. To prevent a syndemic, one must prevent or control not only each affliction but also the forces that tie those afflictions together. From syn-, together + (epi)-demic."
Syndrome,Syndrome: A combination of symptoms and signs that together represent a disease process.
"Syndrome, nervous colon","Syndrome, nervous colon: A common gastrointestinal disorder involving an abnormal condition of gut contractions (motility) characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel habits with alternating diarrhea and constipation, symptoms that tend to be chronic and to wax and wane over the years. Although the disorder can cause chronic recurrent discomfort, it does not lead to any serious organ problems. Making the diagnosis usually involves excluding other illnesses. Treatment is directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating high fiber and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners), exercise, relaxation techniques, and medications. Alternative names include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), spastic colitis, and mucus colitis."
"Syndrome, post-polio (PPS)","Syndrome, post-polio (PPS): A constellation of symptoms and signs that appear from 20 to 40 years after the initial polio infection, and at least 10 years after what was thought to be recovery from polio It is estimated that 1.63 million Americans were struck by polio in the epidemics of the 1940's, 50's, and early 60's, and that 440,000 of the survivors suffer the effects of PPS. The typical features of PPS include unaccustomed weakness, muscle fatigue (and sometimes central fatigue), pain, breathing and/or swallowing difficulties, sleep disorders, muscle twitching (fasciculations), and gastrointestinal problems. The muscle problems in PPS can occur in previously-affected muscles, or in muscles that were thought not to be affected at the onset of polio. The onset of PPS is usually gradual, but it is sometimes abrupt, with major loss of function suffered over several months or a couple of years. This process often seems to start after a physical or emotional trauma, an illness, or accident. Complications of PPS may include neuropathies, nerve entrapments, arthritis, scoliosis, osteoporosis and, sometimes, post- polio muscular atrophy (PPMA). Diagnosis is made by history, by clinical findings, and by ruling out other diseases that may mimic PPS. There are no specific tests to provide unquestionable confirmation of the diagnosis of PPS. The general rule is that those who were most seriously affected by the virus at initial onset and made the best recovery come to suffer the worst PPS symptoms years later. No clearcut cause for PPS has been found. There is known to be a failure at the neuromuscular junction. One idea is that nerves and muscles that have had to overwork prematurely fail, but this is unproven. There is also known to be impairment in the production of certain hormones and neurotransmitters, but whether these changes are the cause of PPS or the effect of it is unknown. Polio survivors tend to be hard-driving, type-A personalities, as compared to nondisabled control subjects-and the more driven polio survivors tend to have more PPS symptoms. Treatment may include slowing down to conserve strength and energy. Musculoskeletal problems can sometimes be helped by antiinflammatory or pain medications, with or without surgical procedures."
"Syndrome, TAR","Syndrome, TAR: TAR stands for thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) and Aplasia (absence) of the Radius (the long bone on the thumb-side of the forearm), features characterizing this syndrome. There is phocomelia (flipper-limb) with the thumbs always present. The fibula (the smaller bone in the lower leg) is often absent. The risk of bleeding from too few platelets is high in early infancy but lessens with age. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait with one gene (on a non-sex chromosome) coming from each parent to the TAR child. Alternative names include thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, radial aplasia-thrombocytopenia syndrome, and tetraphocomelia-thrombocytopenia syndrome."
Synesthete,"Synesthete: A person with synesthesia, a condition in which the normally separate senses are not separate. Sight may mingle with sound, taste with touch, etc. The senses are cross-wired. For example, when a digit-color synesthete sees or just thinks of a number, the number appears with a color film over it. A given number's color never changes; it appears every time with the number. Synesthesia can take many forms. A synesthete may sense the taste of chicken as a pointed object. Other synesthetes hear colors. Still others may have several senses cross-wired. Estimates of the frequency of synesthesia range from 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 2,000. People with synesthesia are 6 times more likely to be female than male. Most synesthetes find their unusual sensory abilities enjoyable. People with synesthesia often report that one or more of their family members also have synesthesia, so it may in at least some cases be an inherited condition. It may be that synesthesia arises when particular senses fail to become fully independent of one another during normal development. According to this school of thought, all babies are synesthetes. Synesthesia can be induced by certain hallucinogenic drugs and can also occur in some types of seizure disorders."
Synthesis,"Synthesis: Putting together different entities to make a whole which is new and different. In biochemistry, synthesis refers specifically to the process of building compounds from more elementary substances by means of one or more chemical reactions. For example, the adipocyte is a cell that is specialized in the synthesis and storage of fat."
Syphilis,"Syphilis: Syphilis:?A sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum, a microscopic organism called a spirochete. This worm-like, spiral-shaped organism infects people by burrowing into the moist mucous membranes of the mouth or genitals. From there, the spirochete produces a non-painful ulcer known as a chancre. There are three stages of syphilis. The first (primary) stage:?This involves the formation of the chancre. At this stage, syphilis is highly contagious. The primary stage can last one to five weeks. The disease can be transmitted from any contact with one of the ulcers, which are teeming with spirochetes. If the ulcer is outside of the vagina or on the scrotum, the use of condoms may not help in preventing transmission. Likewise, if the ulcer is in the mouth, merely kissing the infected individual can spread syphilis. Even without treatment, the early infection resolves on its own in most women. The second (secondary) stage:?However, 25 percent of cases will proceed to the secondary stage of syphilis, which lasts four to six weeks. This phase can include?hair loss; a?sore throat; white patches in the nose, mouth, and vagina;?fever; headaches; and a skin?rash. There can be lesions on the genitals that look like genital?warts, but are caused by spirochetes rather than the wart virus. These wart-like lesions, as well as the skin rash, are highly contagious. The rash can occur on the palms of the hands, and the infection can be transmitted by casual contact. The third (tertiary) stage:?This final stage of the disease involves the brain and heart, and is usually no longer contagious. At this point, however, the infection can cause extensive damage to the internal organs and the brain, and can lead to death.Diagnosis is by blood test, either the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. Treatment is with antibiotics."
Syringe,"Syringe: A medical device that is used to inject fluid into, or withdraw fluid from, the body. A medical syringe consists of a needle attached to a hollow cylinder that is fitted with a sliding plunger. The downward movement of the plunger injects fluid; upward movement withdraws fluid. Medical syringes were once made of metal or glass, and required cleaning and sterilization before they could be used again. Now most syringes used in medicine are plastic and disposable."
Systemic,Systemic: Affecting the entire body. A systemic disease such as diabetes can affect the whole body. Systemic chemotherapy employs drugs that travel through the bloodstream and reach and affect cells all over the body.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease occurs when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus have unusual antibodies in their blood that are targeted against their own body tissues. Lupus can cause disease of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system. When only the skin is involved, the condition is called discoid lupus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Up to 10% of people with discoid lupus (lupus limited to the skin) eventually develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). SLE is eight times more common in women than men. The causes of SLE are unknown. However, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs may all play a role. Eleven criteria have been established for the diagnosis of SLE: The treatment of SLE is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity. People with SLE can help prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure and by not abruptly discontinuing medications."
Systemic mastocytosis,"Systemic mastocytosis: A form of mastocytosis characterized by infiltrates of mast cells in the skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, bones, and joints with a predisposition to peptic ulcer due to excess stomach acid (caused by the release of histamine from the mast cells). Treatment may include antihistamines, drugs to reduce stomach acid, migraine headache drugs for headache, and cromolyn for bowel symptoms."
Systole,"Systole: The time period when the heart is contracting. The period specifically during which the left ventricle of the heart contracts. The final letter in ""systole"" is pronounced as a long ""e"" as in ""lee."" The adjective for systole is systolic. The systolic pressure is specifically the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. In a blood pressure reading, the systolic pressure is typically the first number recorded. For example, with a blood pressure of 120/80 (""120 over 80""), the systolic pressure is 120. By ""120"" is meant 120 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). A systolic murmur is a heart murmur heard during systole, the time the heart contracts, between the normal first and second heart sounds. ""Systole"" came without change from the Greek systole meaning ""a drawing together or a contraction."" The term has been in use since the 16th century to denote the contraction of the heart muscle."
Systolic,"Systolic: The blood pressure when the heart is contracting. It is specifically the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. The time at which ventricular contraction occurs is called systole. In a blood pressure reading, the systolic pressure is typically the first number recorded. For example, with a blood pressure of 120/80 (""120 over 80""), the systolic pressure is 120. By ""120"" is meant 120 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). A systolic murmur is a heart murmur heard during systole, the time the heart contracts, between the normal first and second heart sounds. ""Systolic"" comes from the Greek systole meaning ""a drawing together or a contraction."" The term has been in use since the 16th century to denote the contraction of the heart muscle."
t.i.d. (on prescription),"t.i.d. (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, t.i.d. means three times a day. It is an abbreviation for ""ter in die"" which in Latin means three times a day. The abbreviation t.i.d. is sometimes written without a period either in lower-case letters as ""tid"" or in capital letters as ""TID"". However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
T1-T12 (thoracic vertebrae),T1-T12 (thoracic vertebrae): The symbols T1 through T12 represent the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae are situated between the cervical (neck) vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae provide attachment for the ribs and make up part of the back of the thorax (the chest).
Tablet,"Tablet: In pharmacy, a medication, usually mixed with a binder powder, molded and pressed into the form of a tablet, traditionally circular or disk-shaped, but more recently also oblong or differently shaped. From the French tablette, little table."
Tablet splitting,"Tablet splitting: The practice of cutting tablets in half. The reason is usually financial. To reduce costs, a physician may prescribe pills that have twice the dose a patient needs and then ask the patient to split the pills in half. To make sure the patient takes the correct dose, patients are given (or buy) a device called a tablet splitter to split the pills in half. Cutting pills into two equal halves can be tricky, even with a tablet splitter. The unequal halves of a pill mean that some pills have more medicine and some have less. This may be harmful to some patients. Tablets cannot be split if they are coated to protect the stomach, provide drug release throughout the day, crumble easily, irritate the mouth, taste extremely bitter, or contain dyes that could stain the teeth and mouth. Tablet splitting is not universally recommended."
Tache noire,"Tache noire: Black spot (in French), a small ulcer covered with a black crust at the site of a tick bite, characteristic of several tick-borne rickettsial diseases."
Tachycardia,"Tachycardia: A rapid heart rate, usually defined as greater than 100 beats per minute."
Tactile,"Tactile: Having to do with touch. For example, tactile signs of disease are signs that are perceptible by touch, such as roughness of the skin."
Taint,"Taint: To poison, infect, or spoil."
Talipes,"Talipes: Clubfoot. The Latin word talipes was compounded from talus (ankle) + pes (foot) since, with the common (""classic"") type of clubfoot (talipes equinovarus), the foot is turned in sharply and the person seems to be walking on their ankle. Talipes equinovalgus: Malformation of the foot evident at birth in which the heel is elevated like a horse's hoof (equino-) and the heel is turned outward (valgus)."
Talipes equinovarus,"Talipes equinovarus: The common (""classic"") form of clubfoot. Talipes is made up of the Latin talus (ankle) + pes (foot). Equino- indicates the heel is elevated (like a horse's) and -varus indicates it is turned inward. With this type of clubfoot, the foot is turned in sharply and the person seems to be walking on their ankle. A clubfoot, also known as club foot, congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), or talipes equinovarus (TEV) is a congenital deformity (present at birth) in which the affected foot appears rotated internally at the ankle - the foot points down and inwards and the soles of the feet face each other. Fifty percent of patients with club foot have bilateral club foot (both feet are affected). The tendons on the inside of the leg of people with club foot are shortened, the bones have an unusual shape and the Achilles tendon is tightened. If left untreated patients often appear to walk on their ankles or on the sides of their feet. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, approximately 1 in every 1,000 babies is born with club foot. Males are twice as likely to have the condition as females. According to the National Health Service (NHS), UK, if one child is born with club foot there is a 1 in 30 chance that his/her younger sibling will also be affected."
Tamoxifen (Nolvadex),"Tamoxifen (Nolvadex): An antiestrogen (a drug that blocks the effects of estrogen) which competes with estrogen for binding sites in target tissues such as breast. Tamoxifen has been widely publicized. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat breast cancer and help prevent it in women at high risk for the disease and, then in 2000, to treat women who have had surgery and radiation for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to lower the risk of invasive breast cancer arising from the intraductal carcinoma."
"Tap, joint (aspiration)","Tap, joint (aspiration): A procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain joint fluid from the joint. This is usually done as an office procedure or at the bedside in the hospital. The skin over the joint is sterilized with a liquid. Local anesthetic is applied to the area of the joint either by injection or topical liquid freezing, or both. A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint and fluid is sucked back (aspirated). For certain conditions medication is put into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed and a bandaid or dressing is applied over the entry point. Joint fluid is typically sent for examination to the lab to determine the cause of the joint swelling, such as infection, gout, and rheumatoid disease. Arthrocentesis can be helpful in relieving joint swelling and pain. Occasionally, cortisone medications are injected into the joint during the arthrocentesis in order to rapidly relieve joint inflammation and further reduce symptoms."
Taphephobia,"Taphephobia: Fear of being buried alive. A phobia is an unreasonable sort of fear that can cause avoidance and panic. Phobias are a relatively common type of anxiety disorder. Phobias can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure and fear reduction techniques. In many cases, anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication proves helpful, especially during the early stages of therapy. The word ""taphephobia"" comes from the Greek ""taphos"" meaning ""grave"" + ""phobia"" from the Greek ""phobos"" meaning ""fear"" = literally, fear of the grave, or fear of being put in the grave while still alive."
Tarantism,"Tarantism: A disease once thought to result from the bite of the tarantula spider. This extraordinary affliction was associated with melancholy, stupor, madness and an uncontrollable desire to dance. In fact, dancing off the tarantula venom was considered the only cure. The dancing was violent and energetic and went for 3 or4 days. In the 15th to 17th centuries, the city of Taranto in southern Italy was the center of tarantism which spread across most of southern Europe. The term ""tarantism"" (also called tarantismo or tarantolismo) comes from the town of Taranto. The large and very venomous tarantula is also named for the city of Taranto."
Tardive dyskinesia,"Tardive dyskinesia: A neurological syndrome characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements caused by the long-term use of certain drugs called neuroleptics used for psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders. Features may include grimacing; tongue protrusion; lip smacking, puckering, and pursing; and rapid eye blinking. Rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. The incidence of the syndrome rises with the dose and duration of drug treatment. The treatment of tardive dyskinesis is usually to stop or minimize the use of the offending drug if possible. Replacing the offending drug with substitute drugs may help. Drugs that most commonly cause tardive dyskinesia include chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin), perphenazine (Trilafon), prochlorperazine (Compro), thioridazine (Mellaril), and trifluoperazine (Stelazine). Others include metoclopramide (Reglan), levodopa (Sinemet), amitriptyline (Elavil), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), trazadone (Desyrel), and phenobarbital."
Targeted radiation therapy,"Targeted radiation therapy: A procedure that uses computers to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to target the tumor as accurately as possible and give it the highest possible dose of radiation while sparing normal tissue as much as possible. It is also known as 3-D conformal (or conformational) radiation therapy. Conventional radiation therapy directs x-rays not only at the tumor but also unavoidably at nearby healthy tissue. Targeted radiation is meant to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the cancer without causing so much damage to surrounding tissues. Targeted radiation therapy is in use to treat prostate cancer and is under study with other types of cancer including lung cancer, brain tumors and cancer of the head and neck."
Tartar,"Tartar: The hardened product of minerals from saliva and foods that accumulates in plaque around the teeth. Dental plaque and tartar cause periodontal disease, including inflammation of the bone surrounding the teeth. Tartar can become as hard as rock, becoming removable only by a dentist or dental hygienist with special tools."
Tassinari syndrome,"Tassinari syndrome: A form of epilepsy associated with language difficulties. The syndrome surfaces around the age of four with receptive or expressive dysphasia and slowed learning. There may be absence, myoclonic, or focal seizures. The cause of the syndrome is unknown. Treatment is with seizure medications. The condition usually improves by adulthood. Also called CSWS (Continuous Spike Waves of Slow Sleep)."
Taste,"Taste: A perception that results from stimulation of a gustatory nerve. Taste belongs to the chemical sensing system. Tasting begins when molecules stimulate special cells in the mouth or throat. These special cells transmit messages through nerves to the brain, where specific tastes are identified. Gustatory, or taste, cells react to food and beverages. The taste cells are clustered in the taste buds of the mouth and throat. Many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tongue contain taste buds. Smell contributes to the sense of taste, as does another chemosensory mechanism, called the common chemical sense. In this system, thousands of nerve endings'especially on the moist surfaces of the eyes, nose, mouth, and throat'give rise to sensations such as the sting of ammonia, the coolness of menthol, and the irritation of chili peppers. People can commonly identify four basic taste sensations: sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. In the mouth, these tastes, along with texture, temperature, and the sensations from the common chemical sense, combine with odors to produce the perception of flavor. Flavors are recognized mainly through the sense of smell. If a person holds his or her nose while eating chocolate, for example, the person will have trouble identifying the chocolate flavor'even though he or she can distinguish the food's sweetness or bitterness. That is because the familiar flavor of chocolate is sensed largely by odor."
Tattoos & permanent makeup,"Tattoos & permanent makeup: The intradermal application of inks for the purpose of tattooing or permanent makeup (also known as micropigmentation). The pigments in these inks raise concerns about tattoo removal, adverse reactions to tattoo colors, and infections that result from tattooing. Many pigments used in tattoo inks are not approved for skin contact at all. Some are industrial grade colors that are suitable for printers' ink or automobile paint. For some, tattoos are an aesthetic choice or an initiation rite. Some choose permanent makeup as a time saver or because they have physical difficulty applying regular, temporary makeup. For others, tattooing is an adjunct to reconstructive surgery, particularly of the face or breast, to simulate natural pigmentation. People who have lost their eyebrows due to alopecia (a form of hair loss) may choose to have ""eyebrows"" tattooed on, while people with vitiligo (a lack of pigmentation in areas of the skin) may try tattooing to help camouflage the condition. The primary complications that can result from tattooing include: The most common problem that develops with tattoos is the desire to remove them. Removing tattoos and permanent makeup can be very difficult. Skill levels vary widely among people who perform tattooing. The main complication with eyelid tattooing is improperly placed pigment. You may want to ask the person performing the procedure for references and ask yourself how willing you are to risk permanently wearing someone else's mistake. Although tattoos may be satisfactory at first, they sometimes fade. Also, if the tattooist injects the pigments too deeply into the skin, the pigments may migrate beyond the original sites, resulting in a blurred appearance. Another cause of dissatisfaction is that the human body changes over time, and styles change with the season. The permanent makeup that may have looked flattering when first injected may later clash with changing skin tones and facial or body contours. People who plan to have facial cosmetic surgery are advised that the appearance of their permanent makeup may become distorted. The tattoo that seemed stylish at first may become dated and embarrassing. And changing tattoos or permanent makeup is not as easy as changing your mind. Methods for removing tattoos include laser treatments, abrasion, scarification, and surgery. Some people attempt to camouflage an objectionable tattoo with a new one. Each approach has drawbacks: Temporary tattoos, such as those applied to the skin with a moistened wad of cotton, fade several days after application. However, some colors are not approved for temporary tattoos. Henna is approved only for use as a hair dye, not for direct application to the skin. Also, henna typically produces a reddish brown tint, raising questions about what ingredients are added to produce the varieties of colors labeled as ""henna,"" such as ""black henna"" and ""blue henna."""
TB Test,"TB test: This test determines if a person has been infected with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). There are two types of tests for TB infection, skin tests and blood tests. In TB skin tests, a small amount of fluid known as tuberculin is injected beneath the skin. In 48-72 hours, the patient returns to the health care provider to have the health care provider look for a reaction at the site of the injection. The skin test is also known as a tuberculin skin test or Mantoux test. A positive result means the person was infected with TB bacteria at some point. It does not tell if the infection is currently active. The TB blood test is known as an interferon-gamma release assay. Two TB blood tests are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) and the T-SPOT®.TB test (T-Spot). A positive test means the person has been infected with TB bacteria. It also does not prove whether or not the infection is currently active."
Td,Td: Adult diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. See Td immunization.
Td immunization,Td immunization: Td is the vaccine given to children over six and adults as a booster for immunity to diphtheria and tetanus.
Tear,Tear: A drop of the salty secretion of the lacrimal glands which serves to moisten the conjunctiva and cornea.
TEE,"TEE: Transesophageal echocardiography. A diagnostic test which employs ultrasound waves to make images of the heart chambers, valves and surrounding structures and which is done through the esophagus. TEE may be used, for example, in the treatment of children having heart surgery. TEE has unusually accurate imaging capabilities that permit the identification of previously unidentified anatomic features and postoperative surgical results that may necessitate a change in surgical plan or surgical revision before the child leaves the operating suite."
Temperature,Temperature: The temperature is the specific degree of hotness or coldness of the body. It is usually measured with a thermometer.
Temple,"Temple: The area just behind and to the side of the forehead and the eye, above the side of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) and in front of the ear."
Temporal,"Temporal: 1. Pertaining to time, limited in time, temporary, or transient.
2. Pertaining to the temple region of the head. The temporal lobe of the brain is located beneath the temple.
From the Latin tempus which means both time and the temple of the head."
Temporal arteritis,"Temporal arteritis: Also called giant cell arteritis or cranial arteritis, this is a serious disease characterized by inflammation of the walls of the blood vessels (vasculitis). The vessels affected by inflammation are the arteries (hence the name ""arteritis""). The age of affected patients is usually over 50 years of age. Giant cell arteritis can lead to blindness and/or stroke. It is detected by a biopsy of an artery. It is treated with high dose cortisone-related medications."
consciousness,"Temporary loss of consciousness: A partial or complete loss of consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in nonmedical quarters, fainting. Syncope accounts for nearly one in every 30 visits to an emergency room. Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness or a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions that do not directly involve the heart: Non-cardiac causes: Syncope is most commonly caused by conditions that do not directly involve the heart. These conditions include: Cardiac causes: Heart conditions that can cause syncope or fainting due to temporary loss of consciousness include: To be sure, many of the causes of temporary loss of consciousness can be detected by a careful history. Dizziness after standing up in an older person suggests postural hypotension. Temporary loss of consciousness after urinating, defecating, or coughing suggests situational syncope. Cardiac causes of temporary loss of consciousness such as aortic stenosis or cardiomyopathy are suggested by the occurrence of the event during exercise. Signs of weakness localized to certain areas of the body with temporary loss of consciousness suggest stroke. The blood pressure and pulse are tested in the lying, sitting, and standing positions. Unequal blood pressures in each arm is a sign of aortic dissection. The heart is examined with a stethoscope to listen for sounds that can indicate valve abnormalities. The nervous system is tested for sensation, reflexes, and motor function to detect conditions of the nerves and brain. An EKG is done to check for abnormal heart rhythms. Other tests may include echocardiograms, rhythm monitoring tests (heart event recorders), and electrophysiologic testing for abnormalities of the heart's electrical system. When heart conditions are not suspected, tilt-table testing can be used to detect causes of temporary loss of consciousness. Tilt-table testing involves placing the patient on a table with a foot-support. The table is tilted upward and blood pressure and pulse is measured while symptoms are recorded in various positions. No treatment is needed for many non-cardiac causes of syncope (such as postural hypotension, vasovagal reaction, and situational syncope). The person regains consciousness by simply sitting or lying down. The person is thereafter advised to avoid trigger situations, to not strain while eliminating, to sit when coughing, to lie down for blood drawing, etc. Older people should have their medications reviewed and caution is advised to slow the process of changing positions from lying to standing. This simple technique can allow the body to adjust to the new position (as the nerves to circulation of the legs adjust slower in older person)."
Tendinitis,"Tendinitis: Inflammation of a tendon (the tissue by which muscle attaches to bone). Tendinitis most commonly occurs as a result of injury, such as to the tendons around the shoulder or elbow. It can also occur as a result of an underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease, such as reactive arthritis or gout. Tendinitis is synonymous with tendonitis."
Tendon,"Tendon: The soft tissue by which muscle attaches to bone. Tendons are somewhat flexible, but tough. When a tendon becomes inflamed, the condition is referred to as tendonitis."
Tenesmus,Tenesmus: Straining to defecate or urinate. Tenesmus refers especially to ineffectual and painful straining for an extended time. Straining to defecate is called rectal tenesmus; straining to urinate is called vesical tenesmus.
Tenia,"Tenia: In medicine, tenia is a genus (group) of large tapeworms some of which are parasitic in humans. In anatomy, tenia refers to a band or a structural line and applies to several bands and lines of nervous matter in the brain. In Latin, tenia means a ribbon or tape. Tenia is also spelled taenia."
Tenormin,Tenormin: See: Atenolol.
Tension,"Tension: 1) The pressure within a vessel, such as blood pressure: the pressure within the blood vessels. For example, elevated blood pressure is referred to as hypertension. 2) Stress, especially stress that is translated into clenched scalp muscles and bottled-up emotions or anxiety. This is the type of tension blamed for tension headaches."
ter in die (on prescription),"ter in die (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, tid means three times a day. It is an abbreviation for ""ter in die"" which in Latin means three times a day. The abbreviation ""tid"" is sometimes written without a period either in lower-case letters as ""tid"" or in capital letters as ""TID"" or with periods as ""t.i.d."" However it is written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify the frequency with which medicines should be taken. Other examples include:"
Teratogen,"Teratogen: Any agent that can disturb the development of an embryo or fetus. Teratogens may cause a birth defect in the child. Or a teratogen may halt the pregnancy outright. The classes of teratogens include radiation, maternal infections, chemicals, and drugs. Drugs known to be capable of acting as teratogens include, but are by no means limited to, ACE inhibitors like benazepril (brand name: Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril sodium (Monopril), lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil), lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic, Prinzide), quinapril (Accupril), and ramipril (Altace); the acne medication isotretinoin (Accutane, Retin-A); alcohol, whether ingested chronically or in binges; androgens (male hormones); the antibiotics tetracycline (Achromycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), and streptomycin; blood-thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin); seizure medications, including phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote, Valprotate), trimethadione (Tridione), paramethadione (Paradione), and carbamazepine (Tegretol); the anti- depressant/anti-manic drug lithium (Eskalith, Lithotab); antimetabolite/anticancer drugs methotrexate (Rheumatrex) and aminopterin; the antirheumatic agent and chelator penicillamine (Ciprimene, Depen); antithyroid drugs, such as thiouracil/propylthiouracil and carbimazole/methimazole; cocaine; DES (diethylstilbestrol), a hormone; and thalidomide (Thalomid). Obviously, alcohol and illegal or unnecessary drugs should never be used by women who are pregnant, or who plan to get pregnant. However, sometimes a medication necessary for health is also a teratogen: thyroid medication, blood thinners, and lithium are just a few examples. In these cases, female patients should work carefully with their doctors to determine if an alternative treatment is possible before and during pregnancy. In some cases the danger of birth defects is limited to a certain part of the pregnancy, and medication can be started again after that period has passed. Other medications can be safely restarted with the baby's birth. Some medications also pass through breast milk, however, and if they cannot be avoided the mother may need to choose formula feeding instead."
Teratogenic,Teratogenic: Able to disturb the growth and development of an embryo or fetus. See also: Teratogen and Teratogenic drugs.
Teratogenic drugs,"Teratogenic drugs: A teratogen is an agent that can disturb the development of the embryo or fetus. Teratogens halt the pregnancy or produce a congenital malformation (a birth defect). Classes of teratogens include radiation, maternal infections, chemicals, and drugs. Drugs that are capable of acting as teratogens include:"
Teratophobia,"Teratophobia: Fear of bearing a malformed child. A phobia is an unreasonable sort of fear that can cause avoidance and panic. Phobias are a relatively common type of anxiety disorder. Phobias can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure and fear reduction techniques. In many cases, anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication proves helpful, especially during the early stages of therapy. The word ""teratophobia"" is made up of ""terato-"" and - ""phobia."" ""Terato-"" comes from the Greek ""teras"" meaning monster + ""- phobia"" from the Greek ""phobos"" meaning fear = literally, fear (of) monsters. Teratology is the study of malformations and a teratogen is anything that can cause a birth defect. The term dysmorphophobia also means fear of bearing a malformed child. Dysmorphology is another term for the study of congenital malformations (birth defects)."
Terminal ileitis,"Terminal ileitis: Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine involving only the end of the small intestine (the terminal ileum). Crohn's disease affects primarily the small and large intestines but which can occur anywhere in the digestive system between the mouth and the anus. Named after Burrill Crohn who described the disease in 1932. The disease often strikes persons in their teens or early twenties. It tends to be chronic, recurrent with periods of remission and exacerbation. In the early stages, It causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. With time, deeper and larger ulcers develop, causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel and the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed, leading to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss can be symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver. Diagnosis is by barium enema, barium x-ray of the small bowel, and colonoscopy. Treatment includes medications for inflammation, immune suppression, antibiotics, or surgery."
Testicles,"Testicles: The testicles (also called testes or gonads) are the male sex glands. They are located behind the penis in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. The testicles produce and store sperm, and they are also the body's main source of male hormones (testosterone). These hormones control the development of the reproductive organs and other male characteristics, such as body and facial hair, low voice, and wide shoulders."
Testicular feminization syndrome,"Testicular feminization syndrome: Now more appropriately called the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, this is a genetic disorder that makes XY fetuses insensitive (unresponsive) to androgens (male hormones). Instead, they are born looking externally like normal girls. Internally, there is a short blind-pouch vagina and no uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. There are testes in the abdomen or the inguinal canal. The complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is usually detected at puberty when a girl should but does not begin to menstruate. Many of the girls with the syndrome have no pubic or axillary (armpit) hair. They have luxuriant scalp hair without temporal (male-pattern) balding. They are sterile and cannot bear children. They are at high risk for osteoporosis and so should take estrogen replacement therapy. The gene for the syndrome is on the X chromosome in band Xq11-q12. The gene codes for the androgen receptor (also called the dihydrotestosterone receptor). This gene is mutant in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Because of the mutation, the cells cannot respond to androgen. If a woman has the mutation on one of her X chromosomes, the risk for each of her XY offspring to receive the gene and have the syndrome is one-half (50%). There are also partial androgen insensitivity syndromes. They usually result in micropenis with hypospadias and gynecomastia (male breast development). These conditions (which include a disorder called Reifenstein syndrome) are also due to mutations in the androgen receptor gene. The complete androgen insensitivity syndrome was once referred to as testicular feminization (TFM). The name ""complete androgen insensitivity syndrome"" is scientifically accurate and is more satisfactory to patients and their families."
Testosterone,"Testosterone: A ""male hormone"" -- a sex hormone produced by the testes that encourages the development of male sexual characteristics, stimulates the activity of the male secondary sex characteristics, and prevents changes in them following castration. Chemically, testosterone is 17-beta-hydroxy-4-androstene-3-one. Testosterone is the most potent of the naturally occurring androgens. The androgens cause the development of male sex characteristics, such as a deep voice and a beard; they also strengthen muscle tone and bone mass. High levels of testosterone appear to promote good health in men, for example, lowering the risks of high blood pressure and heart attack. High testosterone levels also correlate with risky behavior, however, including increased aggressiveness and smoking, which may cancel out these health benefits. Testosterone may be given to treat medical conditions, including female (but not male) breast cancer, hypogonadism (low gonadal function) in the male, cryptorchism (nondescent of the testis into the scrotum), and menorrhagia (irregular periods)."
Tetanus,"Tetanus: An often fatal infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which usually enters the body through a puncture, a cut, or an open wound. Tetanus leads to profound painful spasms of muscles, including 'locking' of the jaw so that the mouth cannot open, and death. The C. tetani bacteria releases a toxin that affects the motor nerves, which stimulate the muscles. Prevention involves immediately cleaning and covering any open wound and getting a tetanus vaccination. Regular boosters are necessary to ensure immunity. Unvaccinated people who get puncture wounds or cuts should get tetanus immunoglobulin and a series of tetanus shots immediately; those who have been immunized but are unsure of the date of their last tetanus shot should get boosters. Also known as lockjaw."
Tetany,"Tetany: A condition that is due usually to low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) and is characterized by spasms of the hands and feet, cramps, spasm of the voice box (larynx), and overactive neurological reflexes. Tetany is generally considered to result from very low calcium levels in the blood. However, tetany can also result from reduction in the ionized fraction of plasma calcium without marked hypocalcemia, as is the case in severe alkalosis (when the blood is highly alkaline)."
Tetracycline,"Tetracycline: A family of broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against a remarkably wide variety of organisms. Bacteria susceptible to tetracycline include H. flu (Haemophilus influenzae), strep (Streptococcus pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the cause of gonorrhea). Tetracycline is also used to treat nongonococcal urethritis (due to Ureaplasma), Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus, chancroid, cholera, brucellosis, anthrax, and syphilis. It is used in combination with other medications to treat Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria associated with ulcers of the stomach and duodenum. Tetracycline can have toxic effects on development of bone. Therefore, tetracyclines are generally not recommended during pregnancy or nursing. Tetracyclines may cause discoloration of teeth if used in children less than 8 years of age. Brand names include Achromycin and Sumycin."
Therapeutic,"Therapeutic: Relating to therapeutics, the branch of medicine that is concerned specifically with the treatment of disease. The therapeutic dose of a drug is the amount needed to treat a disease."
Therapeutic cloning,"Therapeutic cloning: Cloning designed as therapy for a disease. In therapeutic cloning, the nucleus of a cell, typically a skin cell, is inserted into a fertilized egg whose nucleus has been removed. The nucleated egg begins to divide repeatedly to form a blastocyst. Scientists then extract stem cells from the blastocyst and use them to grow cells that are a perfect genetic match for the patient. The cells created via therapeutic cloning can then be transplanted into the patient to treat a disease from which the patient suffers. In contrast to the goal of therapeutic cloning, the goal of reproductive cloning is to create a new individual, an idea that has stirred great controversy and met with almost uniform disapproval."
Therapeutics,"Therapeutics: In medicine, the branch that deals specifically with the treatment of disease and the art and science of healing. In pharmacology, therapeutics accordingly refers to the use of drugs and the method of their administration in the treatment of disease. The word comes from the Greek ""therapeia"" meaning ""a service, an attendance"" the related verb being ""therapeuo"" meaning ""I wait upon."""
Therapy,Therapy: The treatment of disease. Therapy is synonymous with treatment.
Thermometer,"Thermometer: A device used to measure the temperature of gaseous, liquid or solid matter or of a chemical reaction such as fire. Temperature measurement is important to a wide range of activities, including industry, scientific research, and health care. In health care, thermometers are used to measure the temperature of the human body. They include the following types: Oral and rectal thermometers: A conventional oral or rectal thermometer consists of a sealed glass tube containing a liquid such as mercury. Imprinted on the tube is a temperature scale. When the temperature rises or falls, the mercury expands or contracts, causing it to move up or down the scale inside a tiny passageway. A narrow point along the passageway allows the mercury to move up the scale, but prevents it from moving down until the thermometer is ""shaken down"" after use. The thermometer must maintain contact with the body for about four (4) minutes to yield an accurate reading. A rectal reading is usually slightly more accurate than an oral reading. Digital thermometers: Thermometers are also available with digital displays that facilitate easy reading of the temperature, beepers to signal when it is time to withdraw the thermometer, and flexible tubes to resist breakage. Ear thermometers: Ear or more precisely eardrum thermometers measure temperature by reading infra-red radiation emanating from eardrum tissue. They have three key advantages: Basal thermometers: Basal thermometers measure minor temperature changes in women to indicate whether ovulation (the release of an egg for fertilization by sperm) has taken place. The temperature of women normally rises slightly when ovulation occurs and does not return to normal until menstruation begins. Basal thermometers are sensitive enough to monitor the slight changes in temperature. Taking temperature: Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, although it may range between 97 and 99 degrees during the day. The temperature at the beginning of the day, when a person awakens, is called the basal temperature. A doctor should always be consulted if the temperature reaches 103 degrees Fahrenheit or more in a child and 104 to 105 degrees or more in an adult. Thermometers are also available with the Celsius scales. The Fahrenheit scale registers the freezing point of water at 32 degrees and the boiling point at 212 degrees. The Celsius scale (or centigrade scale) registers the freezing point of water at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees. Fahrenheit temperature can easily be converted to Celsius by subtracting 32 from the reading, then multiplying by 5/9. Example: 98.6-32 =66.6. Next, 66.6x5/9 = 37. Thus, a normal temperature of 98.6 F is 37 on the Celsius scale. The invention of the thermometer: This feat is conventionally credited to the renowned Italian astronomer and physicist, Galileo (1564-1642). Galileo's instrument, built about 1592, used an inverted glass vessel in which changes of temperature caused the expansion and contraction of the air within it thus changing the level of the liquid in the partially filled vessel's long, open-mouthed neck. The German physicist, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1886-1736), developed accurate mercury thermometers which he calibrated to the standard scale that now bears his name. The first centigrade was developed in 1742 by a Swedish astronomer, Anders Celsius (1701-1744). It was known simply as the centigrade scale until in 1948 when the name was changed to honor Celsius."
Thermophobia,"Thermophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of heat, including hot weather and hot objects. Sufferers from thermophobia experience anxiety even though they realize their fear is irrational. To avoid heat, they may live in a cold climate, wear light clothing, stay indoors on warm days, and avoid hot water and hot foods. ""Thermophobia"" is derived from the Greek ""therme"" (heat) and ""phobos"" (fear). This same Greek word has given us many English words, such as ""thermometer"" (a device for measuring temperature) and ""thermostat"" (a device for regulating temperature). The opposite of thermophobia is cryophobia, fear of the cold."
Thermostat,"Thermostat: A device that monitors temperature and automatically maintains it at certain levels. In a human, a tiny part of the brain called the hypothalamus, located behind the eyes, serves as the thermostat. It can warm the body by causing it to shiver and cool the body by causing it to perspire. The hypothalamus also regulates hunger, thirst, sex drive and other body activities. ""Thermostat"" is derived from the Greek ""therme"" (heat) and ""statos"" (standing, stationary). Other words formed from ""therme"" include ""thermometer"" (a device for measuring temperature) and ""thermotherapy"" (the use of heat to treat disease)."
ThinPrep Pap test,"ThinPrep Pap test: A modified Pap test technique designed to reduce some of the technical problems inherent in the traditional type of Pap smear. In the traditional Pap test, cell samples are obtained from the vagina, cervix, and cervical canal and spread on a glass slide. In the ThinPrep Pap test, cell samples are collected using a special brush that is immediately washed in a special fluid. The ThinPrep machine then filters out the cells from the solution and deposits them in a thin uniform monolayer (a single layer of cells) on a glass slide. The ThinPrep Pap method has some significant advantages. It removes contaminants such as blood and mucus which frequently obscure cells in the traditional Pap smear. The monolayer of cells is also easier to examine under the microscope. This results in an increased rate of detection of abnormal cells. The disadvantage is the increased cost incurred by the collection fluid and cost of continued operation of the machine."
Thoracic,"Thoracic: Pertaining to the chest. For example, the thoracic aorta is the part of the aorta that lies within the chest."
Thoracic cage,"Thoracic cage: The structure formed by the thoracic vertebrae and ribs, the sternum (breastbone), and the costal cartilages (that attach the ribs to the sternum). A cage is an enclosure made of ""open work"" that usually houses animals. The thoracic cage was thought to resemble an animal cage (although the largest ""animals"" it holds are the heart and lungs). The thoracic cage is also called the rib cage."
Thorax,"Thorax: The area of the body that is located between the abdomen and the neck. Within the thorax are the lungs, the heart, and the first section of the aorta. Also known as chest."
Throat,"Throat: The throat is the anterior (front) portion of the neck beginning at the back of the mouth, consisting anatomically of the pharynx and larynx. The throat contains the trachea and a portion of the esophagus."
Thrombocyte,"Thrombocyte: A platelet. Crucial to normal blood clotting. Although platelets are sometimes classed as blood cells, they are not. They are fragments of a large cell called a megakaryocyte (literally, a large cell)."
Thrombocytopenia,"Thrombocytopenia: : A low platelet count. Platelets are irregular, disc-shaped element in the blood that assists in blood clotting. thrombocytopenia can arise due to decreased production of platelets in the bone marrow or increased breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream, spleen, or liver. Thrombocytopenia is characterized by easy bruising and increased bleeding."
Thrombocytosis,Thrombocytosis: See thrombocythemia.
Thromboembolism,"Thromboembolism: Formation in a blood vessel of a clot (thrombus) that breaks loose and is carried by the blood stream to plug another vessel. The clot may plug a vessel in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), brain (stroke), gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, or leg. Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death), especially in adults. Treatment may involve anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, or vasodilators (drugs that relax and widen vessels)."
Thrombophilia,Thrombophilia: The tendency to form thromboses (blood clots in arteries and veins).
Thrombophlebitis,Thrombophlebitis: Inflammation of a vein that occurs when a blood clot forms.
Thrombosis,"Thrombosis: The formation or presence of a blood clot in a blood vessel. The vessel may be any vein or artery as, for example, in a deep vein thrombosis or a coronary (artery) thrombosis. The clot itself is termed a thrombus. If the clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream, it is a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, thrombus, and the prefix thrombo- all come from the Greek thrombos meaning a lump or clump, or a curd or clot of milk. See entries also to: Cavernous sinus thrombosis; Renal vein thrombosis. And see: Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism."
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): A life-threatening disease involving embolism and thrombosis (plugging) of the small blood vessels in the brain and kidneys and other organs. It is most commonly caused by inhibition of the enzymes ADAMTS13 which normally serves to break up a blood protein called Von Willebrand Factor into smaller pieces. TTP is characterized by platelet microthrombi (tiny traveling clots composed of platelets, the clotting cells in the blood), thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets), hemolytic anemia (from the breakup of red blood cells), fever, renal (kidney) abnormalities and neurologic changes such as neurological signs such as aphasia, blindness, and convulsions. TTP is fortunately rare. It occurs at a rate of 3.7 cases per year per million persons. Plasma exchange (running blood through a machine to which patient is connected to remove the plasma- or fluid portion of the blood and returning it mixed with fresh plasma from donors and other fluids) has greatly reduced the death rate in this disorder. The mortality (death) rate for promptly treated cases ranges from 10 to 20 percent as compared to 90% before plasma exchange was used. Many drugs have been associated with TTP. One is the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix)."
Thromboxane,Thromboxane: A substance made by platelets that causes blood clotting and constriction of blood vessels. It also encourages platelet aggregation. There are two thromboxanes. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is active but is very unstable and has a half-life of only 30 seconds before it undergoes hydrolysis to form thromboxane B2 (TXB2) which is inactive. The thromboxanes are derived from arachidonic acid and are related to prostaglandins. Aspirin acts by inhibiting the COX enzyme from synthesizing precursors of thromboxane in platelets thereby reducing platelet aggregation.
Thrush,"Thrush: Yeast infection of the mouth and throat, characterized by patches of white, caused by the fungus Candida albicans . Yeast are part of the normal flora in the mouth. They ordinarily do not cause symptoms. Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, can disturb the natural balance of microorganisms in the mouth and allow the overgrowth of Candida to cause thrush. Overgrowth of Candida albicans can also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and other areas of the body. Vaginal yeast infections, some forms of diaper rash and other skin rashes that emerge in moist, warm areas of skin are all forms of yeast infection. Thrush is usually a minor and easily addressed problem, but it can be more serious for those with immune system disorders, such as AIDS. Treatment is with antifungal medications."
Thymus,Thymus: An organ that is located in the upper chest behind the breastbone and in front of the lower neck in which the immune cells called T lymphocytes mature and multiply in early life. The thymus begins to shrink after puberty.
Thyrocalcitonin,"Thyrocalcitonin: A hormone, also called calcitonin, produced by the thyroid gland that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood and promotes the formation of bone. Bone is in a constant state of remodeling whereby old bone is removed by cells called osteoclast and new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts. Thyrocalcitonin inhibits bone removal by the osteoclasts and at the same time promotes bone formation by the osteoblasts. Thyrocalcitonin is given in hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) to lower the calcium level; in osteoporosis to increases bone density and decrease the risk of a fracture; and in Paget disease to decrease bone turnover and bone pain."
Thyroid,"Thyroid: 1. The thyroid gland. Also, pertaining to the thyroid gland. 2. A preparation of the thyroid gland used to treat hypothyroidism. 3. Shaped like a shield. (The thyroid gland was so-named by Thomas Wharton in 1656 because it was shaped like an ancient Greek shield.) "
Thyroid gland,"Thyroid gland: A gland that makes and stores hormones that help regulate the heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and the rate at which food is converted into energy. Thyroid hormones are essential for the function of every cell in the body. They help regulate growth and the rate of chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body. Thyroid hormones also help children grow and develop. The thyroid gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below the Adam's apple, wrapped around the trachea (windpipe). It has the shape of a butterfly: two wings (lobes) attached to one another by a middle part called the isthmus. The thyroid uses iodine, a mineral found in some foods and in iodized salt, to make its hormones. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland, acts to stimulate hormone production by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland also makes the hormone calcitonin, which is involved in calcium metabolism and stimulating bone cells to add calcium to bone. See also Calcitonin; Hyperthyroid; Hypothyroidism; Thyroid stimulating hormone; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine."
Thyroid hormone,Thyroid hormone: A chemical substance made by the thyroid gland for export into the bloodstream. The thyroid gland needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The thyroid gland is located in front of the neck just in front of the trachea.
Thyroid hormones,"Thyroid hormones: Chemical substances made by the thyroid gland, which is located in the front of the neck. This gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones, which are essential for the function of every cell in the body. They help regulate growth and the rate of chemical reactions (metabolism), and are involved in the circadian rhythms that govern sleep, among other essential functions. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland, acts to stimulate hormone production by the thyroid gland. The pituitary gland is stimulated to make TSH by the hypothalamus gland in the brain. The thyroid also makes the hormone calcitonin, which is involved in calcium metabolization and stimulating bone cells to add calcium to bone. See calcitonin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine."
Thyroid peroxidase test,"Thyroid peroxidase test: A blood test done to detect autoantibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme in the thyroid gland that is very important to the production of thyroid hormones. TPO is found in thyroid follicle cells where it catalyzes the iodination of T4 and T3 in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (abbreviated TPOAb) are produced by the body itself. TPOAb can attack the thyroid and damage thyroid function. These antibodies are present in a high proportion (70% to 90%) of people with chronic thyroiditis. These antibodies are also present in lesser numbers of people with other thyroid diseases. Other autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia are sometimes positive for TPOAb. Small numbers (around 3%) of people may have TPOAb show no evidence of disease. The chance of having TPOAb is greater in females and increases with age. This test goes by a confusing number of names, including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody (TPOAb) test, thyroid peroxidase autoantibody test, antimicrosomal antibody test and antithyroid microsomal antibody test."
Thyrotropin,"Thyrotropin: A hormone produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain in response to signals from the hypothalamus gland in the brain. The suffix -tropin indicates ""an affinity for"". Thyrotropin has an affinity for the thyroid. Thyrotropin is known also as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyrotropin (or, if you prefer, TSH) promotes the growth of the thyroid gland in the neck and stimulates it to produce more thyroid hormones. When there is an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland stops producing TSH, reducing thyroid hormone production. This mechanism maintains a relatively constant level of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood."
Thyroxine,"Thyroxine: A hormone that is made by the thyroid gland and is one of the most important thyroid hormones. Four iodine molecules are attached to the molecular structure of thyroxine. Along with the more powerful thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine affects almost every process in the body, including body temperature, growth, and heart rate. Also known as T4."
Tic,"Tic: A repetitive movement that is difficult, if not impossible to voluntarily control. Tics can affect any group of muscles. The most common are facial tics, such as eye- blinking, nose-twitching, or grimacing. Tics that affect the muscles used to produce speech are known as vocal tics, and can range from grunts or whistles to the repetition of complete words or phrases. Complex motor tics involve multiple, sequenced movements, and can include behaviors such as twirling in place, tapping a certain number of times, or stooping to touch the ground. Tics are believed to arise from differences in or damage to the basal ganglia, a structure deep within the brain that controls automatic movements and that also affects impulsivity."
Tick,"Tick: A small wingless bloodsucking insect that, along with the mite, belongs to the order Acarina. Ticks may be found in tall grass, where they may attach to a passing animal or person. Pulling a tick forcefully out from under the skin may leave the head behind. Ticks can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, equine encephalitis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and (in animals only) anaplasmosis."
Tick typhus,"Tick typhus: Also known as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, an acute febrile (feverish) disease initially recognized in the Rocky Mountain states, caused by Rickettsia rickettsii transmitted by hard-shelled (ixodid) ticks. Occurs only in the Western Hemisphere. Anyone frequenting tick-infested areas is at risk for RMSF. The onset of symptoms is abrupt with headache, high fever, chills, muscle pain. and then a rash. The rickettsiae grow within damaged cells lining blood vessels which may become blocked by clots. Blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis) is widespread. Early recognition of RMSF and prompt antibiotic treatment is important in reducing mortality. The first person to describe the disease was an ear, nose and throat specialist, Edward Ernest Maxey. Maxey reported the disease in 1899. Seven years later, a pathologist named Howard Taylor Ricketts showed that it was transmitted by a tick bite. The agent that causes the disease was named for him -- Rickettsia rickettsii. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is also called spotted fever and tick fever."
Tilted disc syndrome,"Tilted disc syndrome (Fuch's Coloboma): a congenital abnormality (birth defect) of the eye that causes the optic nerve to enter the retina (this area is called the optic disc) at an abnormal angle. In tilted disc syndrome, the abnormal entry of the optic nerve causes an abnormal position and angle of the optic disc. Tilted disc syndrome is a benign condition that is thought to affect 1% to 2% of people. It is associated with nearsightedness and with visual field defects in some affected people."
Tinea cruris,"Tinea cruris: A superficial fungus infection of the crotch and perineum known popularly as jock itch. Good general hygiene helps prevent it, as does keeping the area clean and dry . Laundering underwear and athletic supporters frequently also helps, as do an antifungal or drying powder after bathing."
Tinea unguium,"Tinea unguium: The most common fungus infection of the nails, also called onychomycosis. Onychomycosis makes the nails look white and opaque, thickened, and brittle. Those at increased risk for developing onychomycosis include: Artificial nails increase the risk for onychomycosis because, when an artificial nail is applied, the nail surface is usually abraded with an emery board damaging it, emery boards can carry infection, and water can collect under the artificial nail creating a moist, warm environment favorable for fungal growth. An alternative name is dermatophytic onychomycosis."
Tinnitus,"Tinnitus: Ringing in the ears. Tinnitus has many causes, including some medications (including aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs), diseases such as M'ni're's disease, aging, and ear trauma."
TIPS,"TIPS: TIPS stands for ""transjugular, intrahepatic, portosystemic shunt."" It is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from the intestines to the liver and the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the heart. It is used primarily (but not exclusively) in patients with cirrhosis in which the scar tissue within the liver has blocked the flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein leading to an increase in pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). As a result of the increase in pressure, blood flows around the liver via small, unimportant veins that connect the portal vein with other veins within the abdomen. These veins enlarge and are referred to as varices. Unfortunately, one of the places varices form is in the stomach and lower esophagus, and these varices have a tendency to bleed massively, frequently causing death from exsanguination. By providing an artificial path for blood traveling from the intestines, through the liver, and back to the heart, TIPS reduces the pressure in the varices and prevents them from rupturing and bleeding. There are several types of shunts that are placed surgically. TIPS is a non-surgical way of placing a portosystemic shunt. The shunt is passed down the jugular vein in the neck by a radiologist using x-ray guidance. The shunt then is inserted between the portal and hepatic veins within the liver."
Tired,"Tired: A feeling of a lessened capacity for work and reduced efficiency of accomplishment, usually accompanied by a sense of weariness and fatigue. Tiredness is not a singular symptom that defines any one particular disease. Rather, tiredness can be a symptom of many different diseases and conditions. The causes of tiredness range from lack of sleep or excessive exercise to significant medical and surgical problems. The lack of energy associated with tiredness can sometimes cause difficulty with normal daily activities, leading to problems with attentiveness and concentration."
Tiredness,Tiredness: See: Tired.
Tissue,"Tissue: A group or layer of cells that perform specific functions. For example, muscle tissue is a group of muscle cells."
Tissue plasminogen activator,Tissue plasminogen activator: (tPA) An enzyme that helps dissolve clots. tPA is made by the cells lining blood vessels and has also been made in the laboratory. It is systemic thrombolytic (clot-busting) agent and is used in the treatment of heart attack and stroke. Activase (alteplase) is a tissue plasminogen activator produced by recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant tPA is abbreviated r-tPA.
Titre,"Titre: Variant spelling of ""titer"" -- the degree of dilution of a substance such as an antibody, reflecting the strength of the solution. Americans spell it ""titer"" while the English spell it ""titre,"" French for ""title,"" derived from the Latin ""titulus,"" an inscription or label. The ""titre"" was evidence of the fineness of an alloy of gold or silver."
TMR,"TMR: Stands for transmyocardial laser revascularization, a procedure by which a physician uses a laser to make holes in the heart to relieve the pain of severe angina. TMR has been done from both the outside and inside of the heart. When done from the outside, a laser (carbon dioxide or holmium laser) is placed in proximity to the left ventricle of the heart and sufficient energy is applied to create small channels from the outside (epicardial) surface to the inside (endocardial) surface of the heart. Thus, a number (10-50) of tiny holes are created right through the heart muscle (the myocardium). More recently, this procedure has moved into the cardiac catheterization lab and the laser works from the inside outward. Angina is due to oxygen deprivation of the heart muscle. The channels made by the laser are intended to improve the perfusion of the oxygen-deprived heart muscle by giving it direct access to the oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle. This does not happen for long, because the channels quickly fill with blood clot. Further, the procedure does not noticeably improve the function of the heart. Nonetheless, TMR appears to lessen or abolish the pain in patients with severe angina, at least for a while. This procedure was originally done by heart surgery and carried an overall mortality rate of about 5 percent. The major hazards are arrhythmias (abnormal hear rhythms) and tamponade due to complete penetration of the heart. Tamponade is a life-threatening situation in which there is such a large amount of blood inside the pericardial sac around the heart that it interferes with the performance of the heart. One-year data from three major randomized trials reported late in 1999 showed that transmyocardial revascularization (TMR), either by the open chest method or percutaneously, was superior in terms of angina relief and improvement in exercise tolerance to maximal medical therapy."
Toc- (prefix),"Toc- (prefix): Stemming from the Greek word ""tokos"" meaning childbirth, we have toc-, toco-, tok-, and toko- as combining forms, all referring to labor or childbirth."
Toco-,"Toco-: Prefix meaning childbirth. For example, tocolysis is the slowing or halting of labor. Sometimes spelled tok-, toko-."
Toddler,Toddler: A young child who is learning to walk with short unsteady steps. The word toddle is of unknown origin.
Toenail,"Toenail: A toenail is produced by living skin cells in the toe. A toenail consists of several parts including the nail plate (the visible part of the nail), the nail bed (the skin beneath the nail plate), the cuticle (the tissue that overlaps the plate and rims the base of the nail), the nail folds (the skin folds that frame and support the nail on three sides), the lunula (the whitish half-moon at the base of the nail) and the matrix (the hidden part of the nail unit under the cuticle). Toenails grow from the matrix. The nails are composed largely of keratin, a hardened protein (that is also in skin and hair). As new cells grow in the matrix, the older cells are pushed out, compacted and take on the familiar flattened, hardened form of the toenail. The average growth rate for nails is 0.1 mm each day (or 1 centimeter in 100 days). The exact rate of nail growth depends on numerous factors including the age and sex of the individual and the time of year. Toenails generally grow faster in young people, in males, and in the summer. Toenails grow more slowly than fingernails. Ingrown toenails are common particularly on the big (great) toe. The corner of the nail curves down into the skin due to mistrimming of the nail or shoes that are too tight. An ingrown toenail can be painful and lead to infection."
Toilet,"Toilet: 1. In medicine, cleansing of a wound and the skin around it. 2. In obstetrics, cleansing of a woman just after childbirth. 3. In dentistry, the cleaning out of a cavity before a restoration. 4. A device for the disposal of urine and feces. Or the room containing such a device. The word toilet comes from the French toilette which originally designated a dressing table covered with cloth (toile) and lace and on which stood a mirror. Today, toilette in French refers to the ensemble of bathing, grooming the hair, and dressing."
Toko- (prefix),"Toko- (prefix): Stemming from the Greek word ""tokos"" meaning childbirth, we have toc-, toco-, tok-, and toko- as combining forms, all referring to labor or childbirth."
Tolerance,"Tolerance: A state in which a T cell can no longer respond to antigen. The T cell ""tolerates"" the antigen. Also called immune tolerance."
Tom-,"Tom-: Or tomo- before a consonant. A combining form meaning a cut, section, slice or layer, as might be achieved by cutting or slicing. Used in the formation of compound words such tomography. From the Greek tomos (a cutting)."
Tomo-,"Tomo-: Or tom- before a vowel. A combining form meaning a cut, section, or layer, as might be achieved by cutting or slicing. Used in the formation of compound words such tomography. From the Greek tomos (a cutting)."
Tomogram,"Tomogram: A radiograph (x-ray) of a selected layer of the body made by tomography. A tomogram is a two-dimensional image representing a slice or section through a three-dimensional object. The term tomogram may be made more specific, as in nephrotomogram (tomogram of the kidney)."
Tomography,"Tomography: The process for generating a tomogram, a two-dimensional image of a slice or section through a three-dimensional object. Tomography achieves this remarkable result by simply moving an X-ray source in one direction as the X-ray film is moved in the opposite direction during the exposure to sharpen structures in the focal plane, while structures in other planes appear blurred. The tomogram is the picture; the tomograph is the apparatus; and tomography is the process. See also: Computed tomography (CT); Computed tomography colography; Computerized axial tomography scan (CAT scan); Electron beam computerized tomography (EBCT); Positron emission tomography (PET scan)."
Tongue,"Tongue: A strong muscle that is anchored to the floor of the mouth. The tongue is covered by the lingual membrane, which has special areas to detect different types of tastes. The tongue muscles are attached to the lower jaw and to the hyoid bone, a small, U-shaped bone that lies deep in the muscles at the back of the tongue and above the larynx. On the top surface of the tongue are small nodules, called papillae, that give the tongue its rough texture. Between the papillae, at the sides and base of the tongue, are the taste buds, which are small bulb-like structures. The muscle fibers of the tongue are heavily supplied with nerves. Babies have more taste buds than adults, and they have them almost everywhere in the mouth, including the cheeks. The tongue aids in the formation of the sounds of speech and aids in swallowing."
Tonsillitis,"Tonsillitis: Inflammation of one or both tonsils, typically as a result of infection by a virus or 'bacteria."
Tophaceous gout,"Tophaceous gout: A chronic form of gout. Nodular masses of uric acid crystals (tophi) are deposited in different soft tissue areas of the body. Even though tophi are most commonly found as hard nodules around the fingers, at the tips of the elbows, and around the big toe, tophi nodules can appear anywhere in the body. They have been reported in unexpected areas such as in the ears, vocal cords, or even against the spinal cord!"
Topical,"Topical: Pertaining to a particular surface area. For example, a topical agent is applied to a certain area of the skin and is intended to affect only the area to which it is applied. Whether its effects are indeed limited to that area depends on whether the agent stays where it is put or is absorbed into the bloodstream. Cortisone creams are topical 'medications."
Topoisomerase,"Topoisomerase: A class of enzymes that alter the supercoiling of double-stranded DNA. (In supercoiling the DNA molecule coils up like a telephone cord, which shortens the molecule.) The topoisomerases act by transiently cutting one or both strands of the DNA. Topoisomerase type I cuts one strand whereas topoisomerase type II cuts both strands of the DNA to relax the coil and extend the DNA molecule. The regulation of DNA supercoiling is essential to DNA transcription and replication, when the DNA helix must unwind to permit the proper function of the enzymatic machinery involved in these processes. Topoisomerases serve to maintain both the transcription and replication of DNA. Aside from topoisomerases I and II, there are more discovered topoisomerases. Topoisomerase III may regulate recombination while topoisomerase IV regulates the process of segregating newly replicated chromosomes from one another."
Total knee replacement,"Total knee replacement: A surgical procedure in which damaged parts of the knee joint are replaced with artifical parts. The surgery is done by separating the muscles and ligaments around the knee to expose the inside of the joint. The ends of the thigh bone (femur) and the shin bone (tibia) are removed as is often the underside of the kneecap (patella). The artificial parts are then cemented into place. The new knee typically has a metal shell on the end of the femur, a metal and plastic trough on the tibia, and sometimes a plastic button in the kneecap. Total knee replacement may be done on people, usually over 55, whose knees have been damaged by arthritis, trauma, or other destructive diseases of the joint resulting in severe limiting knee pain and significant stiffness, instability (constant giving way) and deformity (lock-knees or bowlegs) of the knee."
Total parenteral nutrition,Total parenteral nutrition: Intravenous feeding that provides patients with all the fluid and the essential nutrients they need when they are unable to feed themselves by mouth. Abbreviated TPN.
Toxemia,"Toxemia: A condition in pregnancy, also known as pre-eclampsia (or preeclampsia) characterized by abrupt hypertension (a sharp rise in blood pressure), albuminuria (leakage of large amounts of the protein albumin into the urine) and edema (swelling) of the hands, feet, and face. Pre-eclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancy. It affects about 5% of pregnancies. It occurs in the third trimester (the last third) of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia occurs most frequently in first pregnancies. It is more common in women who have diabetes or who are carrying twins. Some women seem to have a strong tendency to develop the disease and suffer from pre-eclampsia with every pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is more common in daughters of women who have been affected; in many cases the disease tends to run in families. Pre-eclampsia can be a sign of serious problems. It may, for example, indicate that the placenta is detaching from the uterus. In some cases, untreated pre-eclampsia can progress to eclampsia, a life-threatening situation for both mother and fetus characterized by coma and seizures. Treatment is by bed rest and sometimes medication. If that treatment is ineffective, the induction of labor and delivery or a C-section may have to be considered. Pre-eclampsia usually resolves a short time after the baby is born."
Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN),"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening disorder that produces widespread blistering and peeling of the skin. TEN is most commonly induced by a drug (for example, an antibiotic or other medication), but other triggers occasionally cause TEN (triggers like an infection or a malignancy). With severe TEN, occasionally the barrier and containment properties of the skin are dangerously compromised and the patient's condition resembles that of a burn patient. Early treatment involves identifying the trigger or causative drug or agent and removing or keeping the compound away from the patient. Hospitalization is recommended; for severe TEN, a burn unit is suggested. Other treatments may include the following:"
Toxicity,"Toxicity: The degree to which a substance (a toxin or poison) can harm humans or animals. Acute toxicity involves harmful effects in an organism through a single or short-term exposure. Subchronic toxicity is the ability of a toxic substance to cause effects for more than one year but less than the lifetime of the exposed organism. Chronic toxicity is the ability of a substance or mixture of substances to cause harmful effects over an extended period, usually upon repeated or continuous exposure, sometimes lasting for the entire life of the exposed organism."
Toxin,"Toxin: A poison produced by certain animals, plants, or bacteria."
Toxoplasmosis (toxo),"Toxoplasmosis (toxo): An infection caused by a single-celled parasite named Toxoplasma gondii that may invade tissues and damage the brain, especially of the fetus and newborn. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is very common (more than 60 million people in the US carry it) but few are aware of it because the immune system often keeps the parasite from causing illness. The usual symptoms of toxo are similar to flu with fever, fatigue, headache, swollen lymph glands (lymphadenopathy), and muscle aches and pains (myalgia) that may last for a few days to several weeks. Toxo can be contracted by touching the hands to the mouth after gardening, cleaning a cat's litter box, or anything that came into contact with cat feces. Toxo can also be contracted by eating raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork or lamb, or touching the hands to the mouth after contact with raw or undercooked meat. Persons with a weakened immune system are at risk for developing a severe case of toxo. At high risk therefore for severe toxo are: Toxoplasma gondii is a well-known teratogen -- an agent that can cause birth defects. If a woman is pregnant when she is infected, the parasite can cross the placenta from her to the baby with sometimes catastrophic consequences. Children born with toxo (congenital toxoplasmosis) can have mental retardation, convulsions (epilepsy), spasticity, cerebral palsy, and partial or complete deafness and blindness."
TPN,TPN: Total parenteral nutrition.
Trachea,Trachea: A tube-like portion of the respiratory tract that connects the larynx with the bronchial parts of the lungs. Also known as windpipe.
Trachelectomy,"Trachelectomy: Surgical removal of the cervix, the lower portion of the uterus that protrudes into the vagina. Trachelectomy is done in younger women with early cancer of the cervix (with a tumor no larger than 2-3 centimeters). In this surgery, the cervix and the upper part of the vagina are removed but the rest of the uterus is left in place. The lymph nodes in the pelvis are also removed, usually by keyhole laparoscopic surgery, to see if the cancer has spread. After trachelectomy it is sometimes possible for the woman to have children. A stitch is made at the bottom of the uterus like a drawstring and this takes the place of the cervix during pregnancy. There is a higher chance of miscarriage for women who have had this procedure, and the baby needs to be delivered by Cesarean section. Trachelectomy is also called cervicectomy. The prefix ""trachel-"" comes from the Greek ""trachelos"" meaning neck. It refers to the cervix which is the neck of the uterus."
Trait,"Trait: In genetics, a trait refers to any genetically determined characteristic. In technical terms, a genetic trait is amenable to segregation analysis rather than quantitative analysis. A dominant lethal trait is a trait that is expressed if present in the genome and therefore precludes having descendants. All such cases must necessarily be sporadic and must represent new mutations, not inherited ones (because a potential parent with the trait would die before being able to pass it along). A mendelian trait is one that segregates in accordance with the laws of genetics set forth by Gregor Mendel. Sickle cell trait is a mendelian trait. It refers to the situation in which a person has one copy (and one copy only) of the gene for sickle cell but does not have sickle cell disease (which requires two copies of the sickle cell gene). If two people with sickle cell trait have children together, each of their children has a one in four chance (25%) of having sickle cell disease. A nonpenetrant trait is a genetic trait that is in the genome but does not manifest itself in the individual. By contrast, a penetrant trait is one that manifests itself. If, for example, if 100 people have a particular genetic trait but only 80 of them express it, the penetrance of that trait is 80%."
Trans- (prefix),"Trans- (prefix): From the Latin meaning ""across, over, or beyond."" Medical terms containing ""trans- "" as a prefix include transcription, transfusion, transplant, transsexual, transurethral, transvaginal, transvestism, etc."
"Transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic (SGPT)","Transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic (SGPT): An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells, and is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged. Blood SGPT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGPT levels. Interpretation of elevated SGPT levels depends on the context, and can necessitate additional clinical and laboratory information. Also known as alanine aminotransferase (ALT)."
Transcription,Transcription: Making an RNA copy from a sequence of DNA (a gene). Transcription is the first step in gene expression.
Transferrin,"Transferrin: A plasma protein that transports iron through the blood to the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The blood transferrin level is tested for diverse reasons: to determine the cause of anemia, to examine iron metabolism (for example, in iron deficiency anemia) and to determine the iron-carrying capacity of the blood. Low transferrin can impair hemoglobin production (since to make hemoglobin, you have to have iron) and so lead to anemia. Low transferrin can be due to poor production of transferrin by the liver (where it's made) or excessive loss of transferrin through the kidneys into the urine. Many conditions including infection and malignancy can depress transferrin levels. The transferrin is abnormally high in iron deficiency anemia. The gene for transferrin is in chromosome band 3q21. Hereditary absence of transferrin is called atransferrinemia. It is characterized by anemia and hemosiderosis (iron deposition) in the heart and liver. The iron damage to the heart can lead to heart failure. The anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic (the red blood cells are abnormally small and pale). The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is due to mutation of both of a person's transferrin genes. Atransferrinemia can be effectively treated by plasma infusions of transferrin."
Transfusion,"Transfusion: The transfer of blood or blood products from one person (the donor) into the bloodstream of another person (the recipient). In most situations, transfusion is done as a lifesaving maneuver to replace blood cells or blood products lost through severe bleeding. Transfusion of one's own blood (autologous transfusion) is the safest method, but it requires advanced planning, and not all patients are eligible. Directed donor blood allows the patient to receive blood from known donors. Volunteer donor blood is usually most readily available and, when properly tested, has a low incidence of adverse events."
"Transient ischemic attack (TIA, Mini-Stroke)","Transient ischemic attack (TIA, Mini-Stroke): A neurological event with the signs and symptoms of a stroke, but which go away within a short period of time. Also called a mini-stroke, a TIA is due to a temporary lack of adequate blood and oxygen (ischemia) to the brain. This is often caused by the narrowing (or, less often, ulceration) of the carotid arteries (the major arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain). TIAs typically last 2 to 30 minutes and can produce problems with vision, dizziness, weakness or trouble speaking. If not treated, there is a high risk of having a major stroke in the near future. People who have a TIA have a 25% greater risk of having a stroke or other serious complication within 90 days. In one study of people followed for 3 months after a TIA, about 10% had strokes, half of them in the 2 days after their TIA. This was more than 50 times the stroke rate expected in people of their age. One fifth of the strokes were fatal and nearly two-thirds were disabling. A TIA is a sign of an impending stroke particularly if If you suspect a TIA, you should seek medical attention right away. An operation to clean out the carotid artery and restore normal blood flow through the artery (a carotid endarterectomy) markedly reduces the incidence of a subsequent stroke. In other cases, when a person has a narrowed carotid artery, but no symptoms, the risk of having a stroke can be reduced with medications such as aspirin and other blood thinners, which act by partially blocking the function of the blood elements, called platelets, that assist in blood clotting."
Translation,Translation: The process by which the genetic code carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) directs the production of proteins from amino acids.
Transplant,"Transplant: The grafting of a tissue from one place to another, just as in botany a bud from one plant might be grafted onto the stem of another. The transplanting of tissue can be from one part of the patient to another (autologous transplantation), as in the case of a skin graft using the patient's own skin; or from one patient to another (allogenic transplantation), as in the case of transplanting a donor kidney into a recipient."
Transplantation genetics,"Transplantation genetics: The field of biology and medicine relating to the genes that govern the acceptance or rejection of a transplant. The most important genes deciding the fate of a transplanted cell, tissue, or organ belong to what is termed the MHC (the major histocompatibility complex). The MHC was first identified through tumor transplantation studies in mice by Peter Gorer in 1937. In 1980 George Snell, Jean Dausset and Baruj Benacerraf received the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contributions to the discovery and understanding of the MHC. The MHC is the most highly polymorphic genetic system expressed in people. By ""polymorphic"" is meant that there are multiple forms of the gene (polymorphisms) occurring at a given gene locus. The chance for unrelated people to be MHC-identical is low. The main function of the MHC antigens is peptide presentation to the immune system to help distinguish self from non-self. These antigens are called HLA (human leukocyte antigens). They consists of three regions: class I (HLA-A,B,Cw), class II (HLA-DR,DQ,DP) and class III (no HLA genes). The need for HLA matching depends on the type of transplant. In bone marrow transplantation, HLA matching is an absolute necessity, lest the cells be rejected. In corneal transplantation, HLA matching is less relevant because of the lack of blood vessels in the cornea and the ""immunological privilege"" of the cornea. HLA matching is not crucial but is beneficial to the success of most solid organ transplantation including kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and intestine."
Transudate,"Transudate: A fluid that passes through a membrane, which filters out all the cells and much of the protein, yielding a watery solution. A transudate is a filtrate of blood. It is due to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries that forces fluid through the vessel walls or to a low level of protein in blood serum. Transudate accumulates in tissues outside the blood vessels and causes edema (swelling)."
Transurethral resection,"Transurethral resection: Surgery to remove tissue using a special instrument inserted through the urethra. The procedure may be performed, for example, to remove an enlarged prostate that is obstructing the flow of urine. Abbreviated TUR."
Transvaginal ultrasound,"Transvaginal ultrasound: The creation of a picture called a sonogram by sending sound waves out through a probe inserted into the vagina. The waves bounce off the ovaries and other anatomical structures, and a computer uses the echoes to create a visual image. Abbreviated TVS."
Transverse,"Transverse: In anatomy, a horizontal plane passing through the standing body so that the transverse plane is parallel to the floor. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Trauma,Trauma: A physical or emotional injury.
Travel medicine,"Travel medicine: A branch of medicine that specializes in diseases and conditions that are acquired during travel. Travelers to different countries should be aware of the potential for acquiring diseases and injury which are not common in their own country. Immunizations, preventative medications, and general precautions should be considered prior to trips to different parts of the world. Immunizations against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, yellow fever, meningococcal meningitis, rabies, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and others may be recommended or required for travelers to certain countries. Preventative medications against traveler's diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases may be necessary. Precautions regarding foods, beverages, weather, insect bites, and personal hygiene are important while traveling. Patients with underlying medical diseases, such as kidney disease and diabetes, may need special arrangements in order to travel safely. International travel and health vaccination requirements and travel health advice are available through the World Health Organization (WHO) Headquarters, Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response (CSR), CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland. WHO has excellent information currently including: Guide on Safe Food for Travelers
International Certificates of Vaccination
International Health Regulations
International Medical Guide for Ships
International Travel and Health
Ports Designated in Application of the International Health Regulations
Yellow Fever Vaccinating Centres for International Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States also excellent information including current travel medical recommendations and requirements for different areas of the world. A convenient graphical map is provided. Additional information concerning disease outbreaks and general health advisories are also furnished. The field of travel medicine grew out of emporiac medicine, the subspecialty of tropical medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tropical diseases which travelers might encounter."
Traveler's diarrhea,Traveler's diarrhea: Diarrhea that results from infections acquired while traveling to another country. Among the causes of traveler's diarrhea are enterotoxigenic E. coli and a variety of other bacteria and viruses.
Treacle,"Treacle: A medicinal compound once in wide use as an antidote to poisons. Treacle was a kind of salve. It was reputed to be a remedy against venomous bites in particular and against poisons in general. It also came to be considered a ""cure"" for cancer. The word ""treacle"" descends from the Greek ""theriakos"" (of a wild animal) and ""therion"" (a wild animal). Because wild animals may bite, these words gave rise to ""theriake"" meaning ""antidote against a poisonous bite."" The Romans borrowed ""theriake"" as ""theriaca"" and the word eventually entered Middle French and, in time, Middle English as ""triacle."" Treacle today also refers to molasses or a blend thereof with sugar. By extension, treacle is figuratively something very sweet, too sentimental, cloying."
Tremor,"Tremor: An abnormal, repetitive shaking movement of the body. Tremors have many causes and can be inherited, related to illnesses (such as thyroid disease), or caused by fever, hypothermia, drugs, or fear."
Triage,"Triage: The process of sorting people based on their need for immediate medical treatment as compared to their chance of benefiting from such care. Triage is done in emergency rooms, disasters, and wars, when limited medical resources must be allocated to maximize the number of survivors. Triage in this sense originated in World War I. Wounded soldiers were classified into one of three groups: those who could be expected to live without medical care, those who would likely die even with care, and those who could survive if they received care."
Trich- (prefix),"Trich- (prefix): Pertaining to hair. As in trichinosis, a disease due to the parasite Trichinella spiralis which was thought to look like a little spiral hair. From the Greek thrix, trichos, meaning hair. See also: Tricho- (prefix)."
Tricho- (prefix),"Tricho- (prefix): Pertaining to hair. As in trichobezoar (a hair ball), trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), trichoepithelioma (a tumor from a hair follicle), etc. From the Greek thrix, trichos, meaning hair. See also: Trich- (prefix)."
Trichomonas,"Trichomonas: A single-celled protozoan parasite best known in medicine because one species causes vaginitis (vaginal inflammation). Infection with trichomonas (trichomoniasis) is the most common curable sexually transmitted disease (STD) in young sexually active women.) in young sexually active women. The species of trichomonas responsible for STD is Trichomonas vaginalis. The vagina is the most common site of infection in women, and the urethra (urine canal) is the most common site of infection in men. The parasite is sexually transmitted through penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva-to-vulva (the genital area outside the vagina) contact with an infected partner. Women can acquire the disease from infected men or women, but men usually contract it only from infected women. Men and women differ in their response to the infection. Most men with trichomoniasis have no signs or symptoms; however, some men may have an irritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or slight burning after urination or ejaculation. Many women have signs or symptoms of infection which include a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a strong odor. The infection also may cause discomfort during intercourse and urination, as well as irritation and itching of the female genital area. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear in women within 5 to 28 days of exposure. The genital inflammation caused by trichomoniasis increases a woman's susceptibility to HIV infection. Having trichomoniasis also increases the chances a woman can pass HIV to her sex partners. Trichomonas also affects pregnancy. Pregnant women with trichomoniasis may have babies who are born early or with low birth weight (less than five pounds). The parasite is harder to detect in men than in women. In women, a pelvic examination can reveal small red ulcerations (sores) on the vaginal wall or cervix. Treatment is usually with the drug metronidazole given by mouth in a single dose. The symptoms of trichomoniasis in infected men may disappear within a few weeks without treatment. However, an infected man, even a man who has never had symptoms or whose symptoms have stopped, can continue to infect a female partner until he has been treated. Therefore, both partners should be treated at the same time to eliminate the parasite. Persons being treated for trichomoniasis should avoid sex until they and their sex partners complete treatment and have no symptoms. Metronidazole can be used by pregnant women. Having trichomoniasis once does not protect a person from getting it again. Following successful treatment, people can still be susceptible to re-infection. Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of transmission of trichomoniasis."
Tricyclic antidepressants,"Tricyclic antidepressants: One of a class of medications used to treat depression. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are also used for some forms of anxiety, fibromyalgia, and the control of chronic pain. ""Tricyclic"" refers to the presence of three rings in the chemical structure of these drugs."
Trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia: Also called tic douloureux. Inflammation of the trigeminal nerve (the fifth cranial nerve) that most commonly causes paroxysms of very intense lightning pain in the areas of the face the nerve supplies -- the lips, eye, nose, scalp, forehead, gums, cheek, and chin -- on the involved side of the face. A less common ""atypical"" form of the disease causes a more constant, dull, burning, or aching pain. See also: Trigeminal nerve."
Trigger,"Trigger: Something that either sets off a disease in people who are genetically predisposed to developing the disease, or that causes a certain symptom to occur in a person who has a disease. For example, sunlight can trigger rashes in people with lupus.A predisposing event."
Triglycerides,"Triglycerides: The major form of fat stored by the body. A triglyceride consists of three molecules of fatty acid combined with a molecule of the alcohol glycerol. Triglycerides serve as the backbone of many types of lipids (fats). Triglycerides come from the food we eat as well as from being produced by the body. Triglyceride levels are influenced by recent fat and alcohol intake, and should be measured after fasting for at least 12 hours. A period of abstinence from alcohol is advised before testing for triglycerides. Elevated triglyceride levels are considered to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) because many of the triglyceride-containing lipoproteins that transport fat in the bloodstream also transport cholesterol, a known contributor to atherosclerosis. Markedly high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) can cause inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Therefore, these high levels should be treated aggressively with low fat diets and medications, if needed. The word ""triglyceride"" reflects the fact that a triglyceride consists of three (""tri-"") molecules of fatty acid combined with a molecule of the alcohol glycerol (""-glyceride"") that serves as the backbone in many types of lipids (fats)."
Trimester,"Trimester: In obstetrics, one of the three divisions of three months each during pregnancy, in which different phases of fetal development take place. The first trimester is a time of basic cell differentiation. The second trimester is a period of rapid growth and maturation of body systems. A second-trimester fetus that is born prematurely may be viable, given the best hospital care possible. The third trimester marks the final stage of fetal growth, in which systems are completed, fat accumulates under the soon-to-be-born baby's skin, and the fetus at last moves into position for birth. This trimester ends with birth."
Trimox,Trimox: See: Amoxicillin.
Trip,Trip: Street name for alpha-ethyltryptamine and for LSD.
Triptan,"Triptan: A class of drugs introduced in the 1990s for the treatment of migraine that act as agonists for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. The triptans are often very effective in relieving migraine but do not prevent future attacks or lessen their frequency. Migraine is believed to be due to dilatation of cranial blood vessels and the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides through nerve endings in the trigeminal nerve system. The antimigraine activity of the triptans likely lies in their agonist effects on the 5-HT receptors in the intracranial blood vessels and nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. The presence or absence of skin sensitivity (cutaneous allodynia) reportedly helps predict how a person with migraine will respond to a triptan. For most migraine patients without skin sensitivity, triptans work, regardless of when they take the drug. But in migraineurs with skin sensitivity, the triptans work best when taken early, within 20 minutes of the start of the migraine. The triptans include sumatriptan (Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt), naratriptan (Amerge), zolmitriptan (Zomig), eletriptan (Relpax), lmotriptan (Axert), and frovatriptan (Frova)."

Trochanter,"Trochanter: One of the bony prominences toward the near end of the thighbone (the femur). There are two trochanters: The trochanters are points at which hip and thigh muscles attach. The greater trochanter gives attachment to a number of muscles (including the gluteus medius and minimus, piriformis, obturator internus and externus, and gemelli muscles), and the lesser trochanter receives the insertion of several muscles (including the psoas major and iliacus muscles)."
Troche,"Troche: A small medicated lozenge designed to dissolve. For example, to soothe the throat as a cough drop. Strictly speaking, a troche should be circular since the word derives from the Greek ""trokhiskos"" meaning ""a little wheel."" Pronounced trOh-key"
Tropical oil,"Tropical oil: Coconut, palm kernel or palm oil. Like all fats and oils, these three oils contain various types of fatty acids but, unlike other plant oils, they contain a great deal of saturated fatty acids. Coconut oil is 92%, palm kernel oil 82% and palm oil 50% saturated fat. These oils are found in commercial cakes, cookies and ""snack foods."" The American Heart Association advises people to reduce the amount of saturated fat in their diet, because it tends to raise blood cholesterol levels. The AHA recommends limiting the consumption of foods that contain tropical oils."
Trp,Trp:. Tryptophan. See also: Amino acid symbols.
Truncation,"Truncation: The act of truncating, cutting short. See: Truncate."
Trypophobia,"Trypophobia: an irrational fear of small holes or clusters of small holes and bumps. It can manifest as feelings of unpleasantness, unease, disgust, or revulsion when looking at areas of clustered small holes. Examples of images that could provoke trypophobic reactions include a honeycomb, bubble bath, or lotus seed pod. Like other phobias, the exact cause of trypophobia is not well understood. It is not officially recognized as a mental or psychological disorder."
Tryptophan,"Tryptophan: An amino acid, one of the 20 building blocks of protein. A dietary essential amino acid, tryptophan is necessary for optimal growth of children. Bacteria in the intestine break tryptophan down to compounds that largely are responsible for the unpleasant odor of feces. Symbol: Trp."
TSD,"TSD: Abbreviation for Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic metabolic disorder. See: Tay-Sachs disease."
TSE,TSE: Abbreviation for Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),"TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura): A life-threatening disease involving embolism and thrombosis (plugging) of the small blood vessels in the brain. It is usually caused by inhibition of an enzyme called ADAMTS13 which normally serves to break up a blood protein called Von Willebrand Factor into smaller pieces. TTP is characterized by platelet microthrombi (tiny traveling clots composed of platelets, the clotting cells in the blood), thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets), hemolytic anemia (from the breakup of red blood cells), fever, renal (kidney) abnormalities and neurologic changes such as neurological signs such as aphasia, blindness, and convulsions. TTP is fortunately rare. It occurs at a rate of 3.7 cases per year per million persons. The use of plasma exchange (running blood through a machine to which the patient is connected which removes the plasma or fluid portion of the blood and returns the cells mixed with new plasma from donors and other fluids) has greatly reduced the death rate from TTP. The mortality (death) rate for promptly treated cases ranges from 10 to 20 percent, down from 90% before the use of plasma exchange technique. Many drugs have been associated with TTP. One is the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix)."
"Tubal occlusion procedure, selective (STOP)","Tubal occlusion procedure, selective (STOP): A nonsurgical form of permanent birth control in which a physician inserts a 4-centimeter (1.6 inch) long metal coil into each one of a woman's two fallopian tubes via a scope passed through the cervix into the uterus and thence into the openings of the fallopian tubes. Over the next few months, tissue grows over the coil to form a plug that prevents fertilized eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus. STOP takes 15 to 30 minutes, can be done in a doctor's office, and usually requires only a local anesthetic. During a 3-month period after the coils are inserted, women must use other forms of birth control until their physician verifies by X-ray that the fallopian tubes are completely blocked. STOP is permanent (not reversible) and is designed as an alternative to surgical sterilization which requires general anesthesia and an incision. About 6% of women who have had STOP have side effects, mainly due to improper placement of the coils. As of November, 2000, STOP was experimental and had not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
Tubal pregnancy,"Tubal pregnancy: A pregnancy that is not in the usual place within the uterus but is located in the Fallopian tube. Tubal pregnancies are due to the inability of the fertilized egg to make its way through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. Most tubal pregnancies occur in women 35 to 44 years of age. Tubal pregnancies are the most common type of extrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, accounting for the large majority (95%) of all extrauterine pregnancies. Risk factors predisposing to tubal pregnancies include: A major concern with a tubal pregnancy, as with any ectopic pregnancy, is internal bleeding. If there is any doubt, seek medical attention promptly. Pain is usually the first symptom of a tubal pregnancy. The pain, often one-sided, may be in the pelvis, abdomen or even in the shoulder or neck (due to blood from a ruptured tubal pregnancy building up under the diaphragm and the pain being ""referred"" up to the shoulder or neck). The pain is usually sharp and stabbing. Weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness, and a sense of passing out upon standing can represent serious internal bleeding, requiring immediate medical attention. Diagnosis of a tubal pregnancy includes a pelvic exam to test for pain, tenderness or a mass in the abdomen. The most useful laboratory test is the measurement of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). In a normal pregnancy, the level of hCG doubles about every two days during the first 10 weeks whereas in a tubal pregnancy, the hCG rise is usually slower and lower than normal. Ultrasound can also help determine if a pregnancy is ectopic, as may sometimes culdocentesis, the insertion of a needle through the vagina into the space behind the uterus to see if there is blood there from a ruptured Fallopian tube. Treatment of a tubal pregnancy is surgery, often by laparoscopy today, to remove the ill-fated pregnancy. A ruptured tube usually has to be removed. If the tube has yet not burst, it may be possible to repair it. The prognosis (outlook) for future pregnancies depends on the extent of the surgery. If the Fallopian tube has been spared, the chance of a successful pregnancy is usually better than 50%. If a Fallopian tube has been removed, an egg can be fertilized in the other tube, and the chance of a successful pregnancy drops somewhat below 50%. "
Tube,"Tube: A long hollow cylinder. There are many tube-like structures in the human body, such as the auditory tube (Eustachian tube) in the ear."
Tuber,"Tuber: A lump or bump. For example, the backward protrusion of the heel is called the tuber calcanei or, alternatively, the tuberosity of the calcaneus. Small tubers are a characteristic finding in tuberculosis, and tubers in the brain are seen in tuberous sclerosis."
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis: A highly contagious infection caused by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Abbreviated TB. Tubercles (tiny lumps) are a characteristic finding in TB. Diagnosis may be made by skin test, which if positive should will be followed by a chest X-ray to determine the status (active or dormant) of the infection. Tuberculosis is more common in people with immune system problems, such as AIDS, than in the general population. Treatment of active tuberculosis is mandatory by law in the US, and should be available at no cost to the patient through the public health system. It involves a course of antibiotics and vitamins that lasts about six months. It is important to finish the entire treatment, both to prevent reoccurrence and to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis. Most patients with tuberculosis do not need to be quarantined, but it is sometimes necessary. Although there are millions of new cases of TB each year, not everyone exposed to the bacterium becomes infected nor does everybody infected with it develop clinical symptoms of TB. A genetic region has been discovered to be associated with clinical TB. People with at least one high-risk copy of this genetic region are ten times more likely to develop TB than normal. The genetic region contains a gene, NRAMP1, that is known to be involved in the susceptibility to leprosy, which is caused by a bacterium related to TB."
"Tuberculosis, MDR","Tuberculosis, MDR: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. An infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, most often involving the lungs. See: Tuberculosis, antibiotic-resistant."
Tubes,"Tubes: The ""tubes"" are medically known as the Fallopian tubes. There are two Fallopian tubes, one on each side, which transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus (the womb). The Fallopian tubes have small hair-like projections called cilia on the cells of the lining. These tubal cilia are essential to the movement of the egg through the tube into the uterus. If the tubal cilia are damaged by infection, the egg may not get 'pushed along' normally but may stay in the tube. Infection can also cause partial or complete blockage of the tube with scar tissue, physically preventing the egg from getting to the uterus. Any process (such as infection, endometriosis, tumors, or scar tissue in the pelvis (pelvic adhesions) that cause twisting or chinking of the tube) that damages the Fallopian tube or narrows its diameter increases the chance of an ectopic pregnancy: a pregnancy developing in the Fallopian tube or another abnormal location outside the uterus. These tubes bear the name of Gabriele Falloppio (also spelled Falloppia), a 16th-century (c. 1523-62) Italian physician and surgeon who was expert in anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. He was an early expert on syphilis and one of the great surgeons of the age. Of the various works by Falloppio only the ""Observationes anatomicae"", a work of great originality, was published during his lifetime. In it he made a number of contributions to the knowledge of centers of ossification, to the detailed account of muscles, and to the understanding of the vascular system and the kidneys. His description of the uterine tubes was sufficiently accurate that they bear his name. With Vesalius and Eustachi, Fallopio is often seen as one of the three heroes of anatomy. (Historical information based on the Catalog of the Scientific Community of the 16th and 17th Centuries by Richard S Westfall for the Galileo Project.)"
Tumor,"Tumor: An abnormal mass of tissue. Tumors can be benign or malignant (cancerous). There are hundreds of different types of tumors. Their names usually reflect the kind of tissue they arise in, and may also tell you something about their shape or how they grow. Diagnosis depends on the type and location of the tumor. Tumor marker tests and imaging may be used; some tumors can be seen (for example, tumors on the exterior of the skin) or felt (palpated with the hands). Treatment is also specific to the location and type of the tumor."
"Tumor marker, CEA","Tumor marker, CEA: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein found in many types of cells but associated with tumors and the developing fetus. CEA is tested in blood. The normal range is <2.5 ng/ml in an adult non-smoker and <5.0 ng/ml in a smoker. Benign conditions that can increase CEA include smoking, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and some benign tumors (in the same organs which have cancers with increased CEA). Benign disease does not usually cause a CEA increase over 10 ng/ml. The main use of CEA is as a tumor marker, especially with intestinal cancer. The most common cancers that elevate CEA are in the colon and rectum. Others: cancer of the pancreas, stomach, breast, lung, and certain types of thyroid and ovarian cancer. Levels over 20 ng/ml before therapy are associated with cancer which has already metastasized (spread). CEA is useful in monitoring the treatment of CEA-rich tumors. If the CEA is high before treatment, it should fall to normal after successful therapy. A rising CEA level indicates progression or recurrence of the cancer. (Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can themselves cause a rise in CEA due to death of tumor cells and release of CEA into the blood stream but that rise is typically temporary). ""Carcinoembryonic"" reflects the fact that CEA is made by some cancers (""carcino-"") and by the developing fetus (""-embryonic"")."
"Tumor marker, NSE","Tumor marker, NSE: Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a substance that has been detected in patients with certain tumors, namely: neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, carcinoid tumors, endocrine tumors of the pancreas, and melanoma. Studies of NSE as a tumor marker have concentrated primarily on patients with neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer. Measurement of NSE levels in patients with these two diseases can provide information about the extent of the disease and the patient's prognosis (outlook), as well as about the patient's response to treatment."
Tumor necrosis factor,"Tumor necrosis factor: One of multiple proteins capable of inducing necrosis (death) of tumor cells that possess a wide range of proinflammatory actions. Abbreviated TNF. TNF is a multifunctional cytokine with effects on lipid metabolism, coagulation, insulin resistance, and the function of endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Drugs that block the action of TNF have been shown to be beneficial in reducing the inflammation in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis."
Tunnel vision,"Tunnel vision: Loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular tunnel-like field of vision. And, by extension, any very narrow point of view. Also called tubular vision."
Turgor,"Turgor: The degree of elasticity of skin, sometimes referred to as skin turgor. The assessment of skin turgor is used clinically to determine the extent of dehydration, or fluid loss, in the body. The measurement is done by pinching up a portion of skin (often on the back of the hand) between two fingers so that it is raised for a few seconds. The skin is then released to observe how fast it returns to its normal (flat) position. If no dehydration is present, the skin returns quickly to the normal position. With moderate to severe dehydration, decreased skin turgor causes the pinched-up skin to remain elevated and only slowly return to its flat position."
Turmeric,"Turmeric: A spice with anti-inflammatory effects. The active ingredient is curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Turmeric is a common ingredient in curry powder. Alternate spellings tumeric."
TVS,TVS: Transvaginal ultrasound.
Twilight sleep,"Twilight sleep: A term applied to the combination of analgesia (pain relief) and amnesia (loss of memory) produced by a mixture of morphine and scopolamine (""scope"") given by a hypodermic injection (an injection under the skin). The mixture of the two drugs created a state in which the woman, while responding somewhat to pain, did not remember it after delivering her baby. Twilight sleep was once in vogue in obstetrics. Morphine and scopolamine are both venerable drugs that are naturally occurring members of a large chemical class of compounds called alkaloids: Scopolamine + morphine provided childbirth without pain (or without the memory of pain), once a much sought-after objective. However, there were serious problems with twilight sleep. It completely removed the mother from the birth experience and it gravely depressed the baby's central nervous system. This sometimes made for a drowsy depressed baby with poor breathing capacity. Twilight sleep therefore has fallen entirely out of favor and is now a chapter in the history of obstetrics."
Twin,Twin: One of two children produced in the same pregnancy. Twins can develop from one ovum (egg) or from two ova (eggs). Twins who develop from a single ovum are called monozygotic or identical twins. They have identical genomes. Twins who develop from two ova that are fertilized at the same time are called dizygotic or fraternal twins. They are nonidentical and have different genomes.
Twitch,"Twitch: : an involuntary contraction of a group of muscles, also known as a fasciculation."
Twitching,"Twitching: : Involuntary contractions of groups of muscle fibers. Also known as fasciculations. Fasciculations can occur in normal individuals without an associated disease or condition and can also occur as a result of illness, such as muscle cramps, nerve diseases, and metabolism imbalances."
Tylenol,Tylenol: See: Acetaminophen.
Tympanic,"Tympanic: 1. Pertaining to the tympanum (the eardrum).
2. Pertaining to the tympanic cavity.
3. Bell-like or resonant."
Tympanites,Tympanites: a distension of the abdomen caused by accumulation of gas in the intestinal tract or peritoneal cavity.
Tympano-,"Tympano-: Prefix indicating a relationship to the eardrum (tympanic membrane), as in tympanometry (a test that measures the function of the middle ear)."
Tympany,Tympany: A hollow drum-like sound that is produced when a gas-containing cavity is tapped sharply. Tympany is heard if the chest contains free air (pneumothorax) or the abdomen is distended with gas. Also known as tympanites.
Type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes: See Diabetes, type 2."
Type 3b diabetes,"Type 3b diabetes: a term used to describe a type of secondary diabetes. Type 3b diabetes refers to diabetes that occurs as a result of diseases of the exocrine pancreas (the part of the pancreas that produces digestive enzymes, not the part that produces insulin). Examples of these conditions include pancreatitis, surgical removal of the pancreas, trauma to the pancreas, pancreatic tumors, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, and other forms of damage to the pancreas. Type 3c diabetes is estimated to be responsible for about 5%-10% of all cases of diabetes in Western populations."
Ubidecarenone,Ubidecarenone: See: Coenzyme Q10.
Ubiquinone,Ubiquinone: See: Coenzyme Q10.
Ubiquitination,"Ubiquitination: The ""kiss of death"" process for a protein. In ubiquitination, a protein is inactivated by attaching ubiquitin to it. Ubiquitin is a small molecule. It acts as a tag that signals the protein-transport machinery to ferry the protein to the proteasome for degradation. For more information, see: Ubiquitin."
Ubiquitous,Ubiquitous: Present everywhere. The small protein called ubiquitin was so-named because it is present in all types of cells and its amino acid sequence is identical in all creatures from insects to humans.
UBT,UBT: Urea breath test.
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase: A liver enzyme essential to the disposal of bilirubin (the chemical that results from the normal breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells). An abnormality of this enzyme (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) results in a condition called Gilbert's disease in which there are mild elevations of bilirubin pigment in the blood. The elevated bilirubin pigment can sometimes cause mild yellowing (jaundice) of the eyes. People with Gilbert's disease are otherwise entirely normal with no other signs or symptoms and their liver enzymes in blood serum are also entirely normal. There is no need for treatment, and the prognosis (outlook) is excellent. The gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase has been mapped a non-sex chromosome (chromosome 2). A single dose of the Gilbert version of the gene is enough to produce Gilbert's disease. (The condition is said therefore to be an autosomal dominant trait). If someone has Gilbert's disease, the chance of their transmitting the Gilbert gene to each of their children is one-half (50%) and each child who gets the gene gets Gilbert's disease. Gilbert's disease is a frequent finding in people in the U.S. and Europe. The condition is usually detected serendipitously (purely by accident) in the course of routine blood screening. Gilbert's disease is thus an accidentally-encountered enzyme abnormality of no health consequence."
UL,UL: 1. Upper lid (of the eye). 2. Upper limit. No evidence was found for chronic excess intakes of potassium in apparently health individuals and therefore no UL was established for potassium.
Ulcer,"Ulcer: A lesion that is eroding away the skin or mucous membrane. Ulcers can have various causes, depending on their location. Ulcers on the skin are usually due to irritation, as in the case of bedsores, and may become inflamed and/or infected as they grow. Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract were once attributed to stress, but most are now believed to be due to infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. GI ulcers, however, are often made worse by stress, smoking, and other noninfectious factors."
Ulceration,"Ulceration: The process or fact of being eroded away, as by an ulcer."
Ulcerative colitis,"Ulcerative colitis: A bowel disease that is characterized by inflammation with ulcer formation in the lining of colon (large intestine). Its cause is unknown. The end of the colon (the rectum) is generally involved. When limited to the rectum, the disease is called ulcerative proctitis. The inflammation may extend to varying degrees into the upper parts of the colon. When the entire colon is involved, it is referred to as pancolitis or universal colitis. Symptoms include intermittent rectal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Many patients experience long remissions, even without medication. Ulcerative colitis may mysteriously resolve after a long history of symptoms. Direct visualization (via sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) and biopsy of the lining of the bowel is the most accurate diagnostic test. Treatment of ulcerative colitis involves medications and/or surgery; changes in diet can sometimes help."
Umbilical cord,"Umbilical cord: The cord that connects the developing fetus with the placenta while the fetus
is in the uterus. The umbilical arteries and vein
run within this cord. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut at birth, and its residual tip forms the
bellybutton."
Umbilicus,Umbilicus: The vestige left behind on a newborn's belly when the umbilical cord is cut. Also called the navel or belly button.
Unconscious,"Unconscious: 1. Interruption of awareness of oneself and one's surroundings, lack of the ability to notice or respond to stimuli in the environment. A person may become unconscious due to oxygen deprivation, shock, central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and drugs, or injury.
2. In psychology, that part of thought and emotion that happens outside everyday awareness."
"Unconsciousness, temporary","Unconsciousness, temporary: A partial or complete loss of consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in nonmedical quarters, fainting. Syncope accounts for nearly one in every 30 visits to an emergency room. Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness or a ""black out"" episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions that do not directly involve the heart: Non-cardiac causes: Syncope is most commonly caused by conditions that do not directly involve the heart. These conditions include: Cardiac causes: Heart conditions that can cause syncope or fainting due to temporary loss of consciousness include: To be sure, many of the causes of temporary loss of consciousness can be detected by a careful history. Dizziness after standing up in an older person suggests postural hypotension. Temporary loss of consciousness after urinating, defecating, or coughing suggests situational syncope. Cardiac causes of temporary loss of consciousness such as aortic stenosis or cardiomyopathy are suggested by the occurrence of the event during exercise. Signs of weakness localized to certain areas of the body with temporary loss of consciousness suggest stroke. The blood pressure and pulse are tested in the lying, sitting, and standing positions. Unequal blood pressures in each arm is a sign of aortic dissection. The heart is examined with a stethoscope to listen for sounds that can indicate valve abnormalities. The nervous system is tested for sensation, reflexes, and motor function to detect conditions of the nerves and brain. An EKG is done to check for abnormal heart rhythms. Other tests may include echocardiograms, rhythm monitoring tests (heart event recorders), and electrophysiologic testing for abnormalities of the heart's electrical system. When heart conditions are not suspected, tilt-table testing can be used to detect causes of temporary loss of consciousness. Tilt-table testing involves placing the patient on a table with a foot-support. The table is tilted upward and blood pressure and pulse is measured while symptoms are recorded in various positions. No treatment is needed for many non-cardiac causes of syncope (such as postural hypotension, vasovagal reaction, and situational syncope). The person regains consciousness by simply sitting or lying down. The person is thereafter advised to avoid trigger situations, to not strain while eliminating, to sit when coughing, to lie down for blood drawing, etc. Older people should have their medications reviewed and caution is advised to slow the process of changing positions from lying to standing. This simple technique can allow the body to adjust to the new position (as the nerves to circulation of the legs adjust slower in older person)."
Underventilation,Underventilation: See: Hypoventilation.
Undifferentiated cancer,"Undifferentiated cancer: A cancer in which the cells are very immature and ""primitive"" and do not look like cells in the tissue from it arose. As a rule, an undifferentiated cancer is more malignant than a cancer of that type which is well differentiated. Undifferentiated cells are said to be anaplastic."
Undulant fever,"Undulant fever: An infectious disease due to the bacteria Brucella that characteristically causes rising and falling fevers, sweats, malaise, weakness, anorexia, headache, myalgia (muscle pain) and back pain. The disease is called undulant fever because the fever is typically undulant, rising and falling like a wave. It is also called brucellosis after its bacterial cause. The disease is transmitted through contaminated and untreated milk and milk products and by direct contact with infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, buffaloes, wild ruminants and, very recently, seals), and animal carcasses. Transmission can be through abrasions of the skin from handling infected animals. In the US, infection occurs more frequently by ingesting contaminated milk and dairy products. Groups at elevated risk include abattoir (slaughterhouse) workers, meat inspectors, animal handlers, veterinarians, and laboratory workers. The incubation period of brucellosis is usually one to three weeks, but sometimes may be several months after exposure. The symptoms are like those with many other febrile diseases, but with a marked effect on the musculoskeletal system evidenced by generalized aches and pains and associated with fatigue, prostration and mental depression. Urogenital symptoms may dominate the clinical presentation in some patients. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months. Undulant fever (brucellosis) is an extremely variable disease. In the acute form (less than 8 weeks from the onset of illness), the features are nonspecific and ""flu-like."" In the undulant form (8 weeks to a year after onset), the symptoms include undulant fevers, arthritis, and orchiepididymitis (inflammation of the testis and epididymis) in young males. In the chronic form (more than a year after onset), symptoms may include chronic fatigue syndrome-like, depressive episodes. The sequelae (long-term consequences) of undulant fever (brucellosis) are also very variable. They may include granulomatous hepatitis, arthritis, spondylitis, anemia, leukopenia (low white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), meningitis, uveitis (inflammation of the uvea of the eye), optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerve to the retina of the eye), and endocarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart, heart valves and great blood vessels). Millions of people worldwide are at risk for the disease, especially in developing countries where the infection in animals has not been brought under control, heat treatment procedures of milk (e.g. pasteurization) are not routinely applied, and food habits such as consumption of raw milk and poor hygienic conditions favor human infection. In the US, there are fewer than 0.5 cases per 100,000 population. Most cases are reported from California, Florida, Texas, and Virginia. Antibiotics (such as doxycycline and rifampin) are effective against Brucella. However, Brucella is localized intracellularly (within cells) and requires the use of more than one antibiotic for several weeks. Undulant fever can be prevented in people by controlling, or better, eliminating the disease in animals and avoiding consumption of raw milk and raw milk products. Proper heat treatment of milk or milk products is important for effective prevention of brucellosis in humans. Bioterrorism -- There has been concern about brucellosis as a possible weapon for bioterrorism. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, in a 1999 report, however, considered brucellosis ""not likely"" to be a biologic threat for terrorism, because of the difficulty acquiring the seed stock of the agent (Brucella), the moderate difficulty in processing it, the long incubation period, and the ""very low"" lethal effects of the agent."
Undulate,"Undulate: To have a wavy border or form. Also, to rise and fall like a wave. For example, the border of a wound may undulate, as may the edge of a rash. And sound waves may undulate. The word ""undulate"" comes from the Latin ""undula"" which is the diminutive of ""unda"" meaning wave. So ""undula"" is a little wave. The adjective is ""undulant."" Undulant fever, also called brucellosis, is an infectious disease characterized by a rising and falling (undulant) fever. It is caused by a bacterium called Brucella that can be transmitted in unpasteurized milk or cheese of cattle, sheep, and goats or by contact with diseased animals."
Unilateral,"Unilateral: Having, or relating to, one side. For example, a unilateral rash is one that is only on one side of the body."
United States Pharmacopeia,"United States Pharmacopeia: Abbreviated USP. A publication, established in 1820, that contains legally recognized standards of identity, strength, quality, purity, packaging, and labeling for drug substances, dosage forms, and other therapeutic products, including nutritionals and dietary supplements. See also: National Formulary."
Unsteadiness,"Unsteadiness: Loss of one's equilibrium in regard to the environment, often with a feeling of almost falling, or the result of bumping into things. There are many causes for unsteadiness, including problems in the cerebral or cerebellar portions of the brain, the spinal cord, vestibular system, or inner ear. Unsteadiness is medically distinct from dizziness, lightheadedness, and vertigo. See also dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo."
Unwell,"Unwell: Not well or not in good health. Ailing, sick, or indisposed. For example, ""I am well-nigh choked with the sulfurous heat of the weather -- or I am unwell."" (1826, Journal of Sir Walter Scott)"
Upper leg,"Upper leg: More properly called the thigh, the upper leg is the area between the knee and the hip. It has only one bone, the femur, which spans the distance from the hip to the knee."
Upper motor neuron,Upper motor neuron: A neuron that starts in the motor cortex of the brain and terminates within the medulla (another part of the brain) or within the spinal cord. Damage to upper motor neurons can result in spasticity and exaggerated reflexes. There is no standard laboratory test for upper motor neuron disease.
Upper respiratory infection,"Upper respiratory infection: An infection of the upper part of the respiratory system which is above the lungs. An upper respiratory infection can be due to any number of viral or bacterial infections. These infections may affect the throat (pharyngitis), nasopharynx (nasopharyngitis), sinuses (sinusitis), larynx (laryngitis), trachea (tracheitis) or bronchi (bronchitis). Upper respiratory infection is commonly abbreviated URI."
Upregulation,"Upregulation: An increase in the number of receptors on the surface of target cells, making the cells more sensitive to a hormone or another agent. For example, there is an increase in uterine oxytocin receptors in the third trimester of pregnancy, promoting the contraction of the smooth muscle of the uterus."
Urate,"Urate: A salt derived from uric acid. When the body cannot metabolize uric acid properly, urates can build up in body tissues or crystallize within the joints. See also gout, uric acid."
Urea,"Urea: A nitrogen-containing substance normally cleared from the blood by the kidney into the urine. Diseases that compromise the function of the kidney often lead to increased blood levels of urea, as measured by the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test. Urea is of major historical significance. It was the first organic chemical compound ever synthesized. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler in 1828 attempted to make ammonium cyanate from silver cyanide and ammonium chloride and, in the process, accidentally made urea. Wohler wrote his mentor Jons Berzelius, ""I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea."" This pioneering experiment disproved the theory of vitalism, the concept that organic chemicals could only be modified chemically, but that living plants or animals were needed to produce them. Wohler had also discovered that urea and ammonium cyanate had the same chemical formula but very different chemical properties. This was due to isomerism, the phenomenon in which two or more chemical compounds have the same number and type of atoms but, because those atoms are arranged differently, each compound has different chemical properties."
Urea breath test (UBT),"Urea breath test (UBT): The urea breath test (UBT) is a procedure for diagnosing the presence of a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) that causes inflammation, ulcers, and atrophy of the stomach. The test also may be used to demonstrate that H. pylori has been eliminated by treatment with antibiotics. The urea breath test is based on the ability of H. pylori to break down urea, a chemical made of nitrogen and carbon, that normally is produced by the body from excess (""waste"") nitrogen and then eliminated in the urine. For the test, patients swallow a capsule containing urea made from an isotope of carbon. (Isotopes of carbon occur in minuscule amounts in nature, and can be measured with special testing machines.) If H. pylori is present in the stomach, the urea is broken up into nitrogen and carbon (as carbon dioxide). The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then is excreted from the lungs in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured. If the isotope is detected in the breath, it means that H. pylori is present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found, H. pylori is not present. When the H. pylori is effectively treated (eradicated) by antibiotics, the test changes from positive (isotope present) to negative (isotope absent)."
Uremia,"Uremia: The presence of excessive amounts of urea in the blood, which may be a sign of kidney disease or failure. It is also referred to as azotemia. See also urea."
Ureter,"Ureter: One of the two tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Each ureter arises from a kidney, descends, and ends in the bladder."
Urethra,"Urethra: The tube that leads from the bladder and transports and discharges urine outside the body. In males, the urethra travels through the penis and carries semen as well as urine. In females, the urethra is shorter than in the male, and it emerges above the vaginal opening."
"Urethral meatus, female","Urethral meatus, female: The urethra is the transport tube leading from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body. In females the urethra is shorter than in the male. The meatus (opening) of the female urethra is above the vaginal opening, as indicated here:"
Urethritis,"Urethritis: Inflammation of the urethra, the tube that leads from the bladder to the outside of the body. Urethritis can have a number of causes, including irritation and sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia. Urethritis is closely associated with bacterial infection of the bladder (cystitis)."
URG,URG: Urogastrone. See: EGF.
URI,"URI: Upper respiratory infection. Infection of the air passages of the nose, the throat, and/or bronchial tubes."
Uric acid,"Uric acid: A breakdown product of purines that are part of many foods. In gout, there are frequently, but not always, elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). However, only a small portion of those with hyperuricemia will develop gout."
Urinalysis,"Urinalysis: A test that is done in order to analyze urine. Because toxins and excess fluid are removed from the body in urine, analysis of urine can provide important health clues. Urinalysis can be used to detect certain diseases, such as diabetes, gout, and other metabolic disorders, as well as kidney disease. It can also be used to uncover evidence of drug abuse. Accurate urinalysis may require a 'clean catch' of urine. Before a person gives a urine sample, he or she should drink plenty of fluids and wait until 1 or 2 seconds into the flow of urine before catching the urine in the receptacle. For some tests it is important to get the first urine of the day, which contains the highest concentration of toxins and other substances to be analyzed. For other tests, a 24-hour collection of urine may be needed."
Urinary,"Urinary: Having to do with the function or anatomy of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. For example, the urinary tract is the collection of organs of the body that produce, store, and discharge urine."
Urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence: The unintentional loss of urine. Inability to hold urine in the bladder due to loss of voluntary control over the urinary sphincters resulting in the involuntary passage of urine. One cause of urinary incontinence is an overactive bladder. There is a sudden involuntary contraction of the muscular wall of the bladder resulting in urinary urgency, an immediate unstoppable need to urinate."
Urinary tract,"Urinary tract: The organs of the body that produce, store, and discharge urine. These organs include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra."
Urinary tract infection,"Urinary tract infection: An infection of the kidney, ureter, bladder, or urethra. Abbreviated UTI. Not everyone with a UTI has symptoms, but common symptoms include a frequent urge to urinate and pain or burning when urinating. More females than males have UTIs. Underlying conditions that physically obstruct and impair the normal urinary flow, such as the formation of cysts within the urinary tract, can lead to complicated UTIs. Treatment usually involves increased fluid intake and use of antibiotics. In cases where physical obstruction is present, special medications or surgery may be necessary."
Urinary urgency,"Urinary urgency: An immediate unstoppable urge to urinate, due to a sudden involuntary contraction of the muscular wall of the bladder."
"Urination, difficulty","Urination, difficulty: See: Dysuria."
Urine,"Urine: Liquid waste produced by the kidneys. Urine is a clear, transparent fluid that normally has an amber color. The average amount of urine excreted in 24 hours is between 5 to 8 cups or 40 and 60 ounces. Chemically, urine is mainly a watery solution of salt and substances called urea and uric acid. Normally, it contains about 960 parts water to 40 parts solid matter. Abnormally, it may contain sugar (in diabetes), albumin (a protein, as in some forms of kidney disease), bile pigments (as in jaundice), or abnormal quantities of one or another of its normal components."
Urine hemoglobin,"Urine hemoglobin: The presence of free hemoglobin in the urine, an abnormal finding, that may make the urine look dark. Hemoglobin in the urine is termed hemoglobinuria. Hemoglobin is the protein in the red blood cells which carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The iron contained in hemoglobin gives red blood cells their characteristic color. Red blood cells are normally taken out of circulation after approximately 4 months; they are trapped and disassembled in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If, however, red cells hemolyze (break down) within the vascular system, the components are set free in the blood stream. Free hemoglobin is bound by haptoglobin (another protein) and reprocessed. But if the level of hemoglobin in the blood rises above the ability of haptoglobin to reclaim it, hemoglobin begins to appear in the urine -- there is hemoglobinuria. Normally, there is no hemoglobin in the urine. Hemoglobinuria is a sign of a number of conditions including:"
Urine pH,"Urine pH: A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of urine. Checking urine pH is part of the routine urinalysis. Factors that affect urine pH include vomiting, diarrhea, lung disease, hormones, kidney function, and urinary tract infection."
Urogenital,Urogenital: Relating to both the urinary system and the genital system (the interior and exterior genitalia).
Urolithiasis,"Urolithiasis: The process of forming stones in the kidney, bladder, and/or urethra (urinary tract). Kidney stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones occur in 1 in 20 people at some time in their life. The development of the stones is related to decreased urine volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine collecting area (the pelvis) of the kidney and may range in size from tiny to staghorn stones the size of the renal pelvis itself. The cystine stones (below) compared in size to a quarter (a U.S. $0.25 coin) were obtained from the kidney of a young woman by percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL), a procedure for crushing and removing the dense stubborn stones characteristic of cystinuria.  The pain with kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and colicky (intermittent), not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Factors predisposing to kidney stones include recent reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause hyperuricemia (high uric acid) and a history of gout. Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones may not. There are several factors which influence the ability to pass a stone. These include the size of the person, prior stone passage, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, and the size of the stone. A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. If a stone does not pass, certain procedures (usually by a urology specialist doctor) may be needed. The process of stone formation, urolithiasis, is also called nephrolithiasis. ""Nephrolithiasis"" is derived from the Greek nephros- (kidney) lithos (stone) = kidney stone ""Urolithiasis"" is from the French word ""urine"" which, in turn, stems from the Latin ""urina"" and the Greek ""ouron"" meaning urine = urine stone. The stones themselves are also called renal caluli. The word ""calculus"" (plural: calculi) is the Latin word for pebble."
Urticaria,"Urticaria: Another name for hives. Raised, itchy areas of skin that are usually a sign of an allergic reaction. Hives can be rounded or flat-topped but are always elevated above the surrounding skin. They reflect circumscribed dermal edema (local swelling of the skin). The hives are usually well circumscribed but may be coalescent and will blanch with pressure. The hives typically last less than 4 hours but an individual lesion may last for up to 24 hours and the whole process may stay for days or weeks. Approximately 20% of the population has experienced a bout of urticaria."
USFDA,"USFDA: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It consists of the Office of the Commissioner and four directorates overseeing the core functions of the agency: Medical Products and Tobacco, Foods and Veterinary Medicine, Global Regulatory Operations and Policy, and Operations. FDA is responsible for: Protecting the public health by assuring that foods (except for meat from livestock, poultry and some egg products which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture) are safe, wholesome, sanitary and properly labeled; ensuring that human and veterinary drugs, and vaccines and other biological products and medical devices intended for human use are safe and effective; Protecting the public from electronic product radiation; Assuring cosmetics and dietary supplements are safe and properly labeled; Regulating tobacco products; Advancing the public health by helping to speed product innovations. FDA's responsibilities extend to the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and other U.S. territories and possessions."
ut dict.,"ut dict.: Abbreviation meaning ""as directed"" (from the Latin ""ut dictum"", as directed). One of a number of hallowed abbreviations of Latin terms that have traditionally been used in prescriptions. Some others:"
Uterine bleeding,Uterine bleeding: See: Menstruation. See also Menometrorrhagia; Menorrhagia; Metrorrhagia.
Uterine contraction,"Uterine contraction: The tightening and shortening of the uterine muscles. During labor, contractions accomplish two things: (1) they cause the cervix to thin and dilate (open); and (2) they help the baby to descend into the birth canal. Uterine contractions also occur during the monthly menstrual cycle and are recognized as menstrual cramps."
Uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids: Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus (the womb). They are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. Uterine fibroids can be present, but be inapparent. However, they are clinically apparent in up to 25% of all women and cause significant morbidity (disease), including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Both the economic cost and the effect of fibroids on the quality of life are substantial. Fibroids are not cancerous. Drugs that manipulate the levels of steroid hormones are effective in treating fibroids, but side-effects limit their long-term use. Fibroids may be removed if they cause appreciable discomfort or if they are associated with uterine bleeding. Surgery is the mainstay of fibroid treatment. In addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy, various minimally invasive procedures have been developed to remove fibroids from the uterus. A uterine fibroid is also medically known as a leiomyoma (or simply a myoma) of the uterus. "
Uterine fornix,"Uterine fornix: The fornix of the uterus (known in medical Latin as the ""fornix uteri"") refers to the anterior (front) and posterior (back) recesses into which the upper vagina is divided. These vault like recesses are formed by protrusion of the cervix into the vagina. The fornix uteri is also known as the fornix vaginae (the vaginal fornix). In anatomy, a vault like or arched structure. ""Fornix"" is the Latin word for ""vault or arch."" A fornix may be anywhere in the body. The fornix in the brain is a fibrous, arching band connecting the two lobes of the cerebrum. The fornix conjunctivae refers to loose, arching folds connecting the conjunctival membrane lining the inside of the eyelid with the conjunctival membrane covering the eyeball. (""Fornix"" is closely related to ""fornication."" It seems that prostitutes in ancient Rome used to hang out under the arches of certain public buildings. The act of carrying on an illicit sexual relationship consequently came to be called ""going under the arches,"" fornication.)"
Uterine rupture,"Uterine rupture: A tear in the uterus. A uterine rupture is a very serious situation. Causes include trauma, labor with an unusually big baby, multiple gestation, and vaginal delivery after a prior C-section (in which the old C-section scar ruptures). Uterine rupture can lead to hysterectomy, urologic injury, the need for blood transfusion, and even the death of the mother and baby."
Uterus,"Uterus: A hollow, pear-shaped organ that is located in a woman's lower abdomen, between the bladder and the rectum. The narrow lower portion of the uterus is the cervix (the neck of the uterus). The broader upper part is the corpus, which is made up of three layers of tissue. In women of childbearing age, the inner layer (endometrium) of the uterus goes through a series of monthly changes known as the menstrual cycle. Each month, endometrial tissue grows and thickens in preparation to receive a fertilized egg. Menstruation occurs when this tissue is not used, disintegrates, and passes out through the vagina. The middle layer (myometrium) of the uterus is muscular tissue that expands during pregnancy to hold the growing fetus and contracts during labor to deliver the child. The outer layer (parametrium) also expands during pregnancy and contracts thereafter."
UTI,UTI: Urinary tract infection.
Vaccines,Vaccines: Microbial preparations of killed or modified microorganisms that can stimulate an immune response in the body to prevent future infection with similar microorganisms. These preparations are usually delivered by injection.
VACTERL association,"VACTERL association: A nonrandom association of birth defects. VACTERL is a mnemonic in which the letters each stand for one or more type of malformation: The VACTERL association has been recurrently observed in newborn babies. It is more common in the children of diabetic mothers than in the general population. For some years that was all that was known about the cause of the VACTERL association. The VACTERL association has been linked to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and down-regulation (the damping down) of a biochemical pathway in the shaping of the embryo that requires cholesterol. Treatment involves surgery to correct the physical defects, as possible."
Vagina,"Vagina: The muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the outside of the body. It is usually 6 to 7 inches in length, and its walls are lined with mucous membrane. It includes two vaultlike structures: the anterior (front) vaginal fornix and the posterior (rear) vaginal fornix. The cervix protrudes slightly into the vagina, and through a tiny hole in the cervix (the os), sperm make their way toward the internal reproductive organs. The vagina also includes numerous tiny glands that make vaginal secretions."
Vaginal discharge,"Vaginal discharge: Vaginal discharge is a fluid produced by glands in the vaginal wall and cervix that drains from the opening of the vagina. The amount and appearance of normal vaginal discharge varies throughout the menstrual cycle. An increase in the amount of vaginal discharge, an abnormal odor or consistency of the fluid, or pain that accompanies vaginal discharge can all be signs of infection or other disorders. Such disorders include (this is not an all inclusive list) bacterial vaginosis, yeast vaginitis, and vaginitis."
Vaginal fornix,"Vaginal fornix: The anterior (front) and posterior (back) recesses into which the upper vagina is divided. These vaultlike recesses are formed by protrusion of the cervix into the vagina. The fornix uteri is also known as the fornix vaginae (or the vaginal fornices) and the uterine fornices. The fornix of the vagina in medical Latin is the fornix vaginae. The fornix vaginae is also known as the fornix uteri (the uterine fornix). In anatomy, a fornix is a vaultlike or arched structure. Fornix is the Latin word for vault or arch."
Vaginal hysterectomy,"Vaginal hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus through a surgical incision made within the vagina. With a vaginal hysterectomy, the scar is not outwardly visible. A vaginal hysterectomy is as opposed to an abdominal hysterectomy in which the incision is made in the abdominal wall."
Vaginal introitus,"Vaginal introitus: The vaginal opening is called the introitus of the vagina. The Latin word ""introitus"" comes from ""intro"", into, within + ""ire"", to go = to go into. In anatomy, an introitus is thus an entrance, one that goes into a canal or hollow organ such as the vagina. The vagina is a muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of the body. The word ""vagina"" is a Latin word meaning ""a sheath or scabbard"", a scabbard into which one might slide and sheath a sword. The ""sword"" in the case of the anatomic vagina was the penis. Love and war, it would seem, have been connected in the minds of people for millennia."
Vaginal membrane,"Vaginal membrane: A thin membrane which completely or partially occludes the vaginal opening. This fold of mucous membrane is usually present at birth at the orifice of the vagina. It is also called the hymen, a Greek word meaning ""skin"" or ""membrane."" The ancient Greeks applied the word ""hymen"" to all kinds of membranes including, for example, the membrane that surrounds the heart (the pericardium). Starting in the 1500s the word was restricted to refer only to the vaginal membrane."
Vaginal opening,"Vaginal opening: The exterior opening to the vagina, the muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the outside of the female body. Also called vaginal introitus and vaginal vestibule."
Vaginal vestibule,"Vaginal vestibule: The vaginal opening is called the vestibule of the vagina. In medicine, a vestibule is a space or cavity at the entrance to a canal, channel, tube, vessel. In ancient Rome, the ""vestibulum"" was an entrance or enclosed porch leading into the house. The vagina is a muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of the body. The word ""vagina"" is a Latin word meaning ""a sheath or scabbard"", a scabbard into which one might slide and sheath a sword. The ""sword"" in the case of the anatomic vagina was the penis. Love and war, it would seem, have been connected in the minds of people for millennia."
Vaginal yeast infection,"Vaginal yeast infection: Infection of the vagina caused by a fungus known as Candida. A vaginal yeast infection is characterized by itching, burning, soreness, pain during intercourse and/or urination, and vaginal discharge that is typically cheesy white in color. The diagnosis is confirmed through identification of the yeast under a microscope from a specimen scraped from the vaginal area. A vaginal yeast infection is treated with topical medications applied in and around the vagina; vaginal tablets, and oral medications. During pregnancy, only the topical creams are used."
Vaginitis,"Vaginitis: Inflammation of the vagina. The vagina is the muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of the body. Vaginitis is often caused by a fungus. A woman with this condition may have itching or burning and may notice a discharge. Vaginitis is a common condition. There are factors that predispose a woman to develop vaginitis. For example, women who have diabetes have vaginitis more often than women who do not."
Vagus nerve,"Vagus nerve: A nerve that supplies nerve fibers to the pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), lungs, heart, esophagus, and intestinal tract, as far as the transverse portion of the colon. The vagus nerve also brings sensory information back to the brain from the ear, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve. It originates in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain stem, and extends all the way down from the brain stem to the colon. Complete interruption of the vagus nerve causes a characteristic syndrome in which the soft palate droops on the side where damage occurred, and the gag reflex is also lost on that side. The voice is hoarse and nasal, and the vocal cord on the affected side is immobile. The result is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and speaking (dysphonia). The vagus nerve has several important branches, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve."
Valsalva,"Valsalva: 1. The Valsalva maneuver in which a person tries to exhale forcibly with a closed glottis (windpipe) so that no air goes out through the mouth or nose.
2. The renowned Italian anatomist, pathologist, physician, and surgeon Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723) who first described the maneuver."
Vampire children,"Vampire children: Perjorative term for children with xeroderma pigmentosum, a genetic disease with such extraordinary sensitivity to sunlight that ordinary sun exposure results in the development of skin cancer at a very early age. Children with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) can only play outdoors safely after nightfall."
Vasa previa,"Vasa previa: A condition in which blood vessels within the placenta or the umbilical cord are trapped between the fetus and the opening to the birth canal, a situation that carries a high risk the fetus may die from hemorrhage due to a blood vessel tearing at the time the fetal membranes rupture or during labor and delivery. Another danger is lack of oxygen to the fetus. Vasa previa often occurs with a low-lying placenta (due to scarring of the uterus by a previous miscarriage or a D&C), an unusually formed placenta (a bilobed placenta or succenturiate-lobed placenta), an in-vitro fertilization pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc). Vasa previa also may accompany velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord. Vasa previa may not be suspected until the fetal vessel rupture occurs. Reduction in fetal mortality depends on prenatal diagnosis. When vasa previa is found before labor, the baby has a much greater chance of surviving. Vasa previa can be detected during pregnancy as early as the 16th week of pregnancy with use of transvaginal sonography in combination with color Doppler. When vasa previa is diagnosed, C-section before labor begins can save the baby's life. The C-section should be done early enough to avoid an emergency, but late enough to avoid problems associated with prematurity."
Vascular,"Vascular: Relating to blood vessels. For example, the vascular system in the body includes all of the veins and arteries. And, a vascular surgeon is an expert at evaluating and treating problems of the veins and arteries."
Vascular bed,"Vascular bed: The vascular system, or a part thereof. For example, the pulmonary vascular bed describes the blood vessels of the lungs."
Vasculitis,"Vasculitis: A general term for a group of uncommon diseases that feature inflammation of the blood vessels. Each of the vasculitis diseases is defined by characteristic distributions of blood vessel involvement, patterns of organ involvement, and laboratory test abnormalities. The actual causes of these vasculitis diseases are usually not known, but immune system abnormality is a common feature. Examples of vasculitis include Kawasaki disease, Behcet's disease, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Takayasu's arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Vasculitis can also accompany infections, such as hepatitis B; exposure to chemicals, such as amphetamines and cocaine; cancers, such as lymphomas and multiple myeloma; and rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Laboratory testing in a patient with active vasculitis generally indicates inflammation in the body, and depending on the degree of organ involvement, a variety of organ function tests can be abnormal. The ultimate diagnosis for vasculitis is typically established after a biopsy of involved tissue demonstrates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation. Treatment depends on the type and severity of the illness and the organs involved. Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, cortisone-related medications, such as prednisone, are used, as are other immune-
suppression drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (brand name: Cytoxan). Also known as angiitis and vasculitides (the plural form of vasculitis)."
Vasectomy,"Vasectomy: A surgical procedure designed to make a man sterile by cutting or blocking both the right and left vas deferens, the tubes through which sperm pass into the ejaculate."
Vasoconstriction,Vasoconstriction: Narrowing of the blood vessels that results from contraction of the muscular walls of the vessels. The opposite of vasoconstriction is vasodilation.
Vasodepressor syncope,"Vasodepressor syncope: The temporary loss of consciousness in a particular kind of situation. (Syncope is temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, fainting). The situations that trigger this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating or defecating or coughing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional stress of fear or pain. In these situations, people subject to vasodepressor syncope often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and weak just before they lose consciousness. Vasodepressor syncope is caused a reflex of the involuntary nervous system called the vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction leads the heart to slow down (bradycardia) and, at the same time, it leads the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels to dilate (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is deprived of oxygen and the fainting episode occurs. A vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. And vasodepressor syncope is also called situational syncope, vasovagal syncope, and Gower syndrome."
Vasodilation,"Vasodilation: Widening of blood vessels that results from relaxation of the muscular walls of the vessels. What widens in vasodilation is actually
the diameter of the interior (lumen) of the vessel. The opposite of vasodilation is vasoconstriction."
Vasodilators,"Vasodilators: Agents that act as blood vessel dilators (vasodilators) and open vessels by relaxing their muscular walls. For example, nitroglycerin is a vasodilator. So are the ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors."
Vasomotor,Vasomotor: Relating to the nerves and muscles that cause blood vessels to constrict or dilate.
Vasovagal attack,Vasovagal attack: See: Vasovagal reaction.
Vasovagal reaction,"Vasovagal reaction: A reflex of the involuntary nervous system that causes the heart to slow down (bradycardia) and that, at the same time, affects the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs permitting those vessels to dilate (widen). As a result the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is deprived of oxygen and the fainting episode occurs. The vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. The resultant fainting is synonymous with situational syncope, vasovagal syncope, vasodepressor syncope, and Gower syndrome which is named for Sir William Richard Gower (1845-1915), a famous English neurologist. See also: Syncope."
VDRL test,"VDRL test: A blood test for syphilis (VDRL stands for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) that detects an antibody that is present in the bloodstream when a patient has syphilis. A negative (nonreactive) VDRL is compatible with a person not having syphilis, but in the early stages of the disease, the VDRL often gives false negative results. Conversely, a false positive VDRL can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy. See also syphilis; syphilis test, RPR."
Vector,"Vector: In medicine, a carrier of disease or of medication. For example, in malaria a mosquito is the vector that carries and transfers the infectious agent. In molecular biology, a vector may be a virus or a plasmid that carries a piece of foreign DNA to a host cell."
Vein,"Vein: A blood vessel that carries blood that is low in oxygen content from the body back to the heart. The deoxygenated form of hemoglobin (deoxy-hemoglobin) in venous blood makes it appear dark. Veins are part of the afferent wing of the circulatory system, which returns blood to the heart. In contrast, an artery is a vessel that carries blood that is high in oxygen away from the heart to the body."
Veisalgia,Veisalgia: Medical term for a hangover. From the Norwegian kveis (uneasiness following debauchery) + the Greek algia (pain).
Vena cava,"Vena cava: The superior vena cava is the large vein which returns blood to the heart from the head, neck and both upper limbs. The inferior vena cava returns blood to the heart from the lower part of the body. The return of blood via the vena cava can be compromised and cause disease. For example, in the superior vena cava syndrome, the symptoms that result from compression of the large vein that carries blood down to the heart. The superior vena cava is located in the middle of the chest and is surrounded by rigid structures and lymph nodes. The structure bordering the superior vena cava include the trachea, aorta, thymus, right bronchus of the lung and pulmonary artery. Compression of the superior vena cava by disease of any of the structures or lymph nodes surrounding the superior vena cava can cause the superior vena cava syndrome. The superior vena cava syndrome is characterized by swelling of the face, neck and/or arms with visible widening (dilation) of the veins of the neck. Patients often have a persistent cough and shortness of breath. Others symptoms can be present including hoarseness, swelling around the eyes, fatigue, chest pain, headaches, and dizziness. The causes of the superior vena cava syndrome include cancer (malignancies) and non-cancer (benign) conditions. The common forms of cancer that can cause the superior vena cava syndrome are lung cancer, lymphoma (cancer of the lymph nodes), and cancer that has spread (metastasis) to the chest, more commonly breast and testicular cancer. Non-cancer causes of the superior vena cava syndrome include infections (such as tuberculosis, fungus, and syphilis), benign tumors (such as teratomas, thymoma, dermoid cyst), aortic aneurysm, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, irradiation treatment to the chest, air in the chest (pneumothorax), and complication of central line catheters and congenital heart surgery. Diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome is supported by identifying a cause for the superior vena cava syndrome, typically requiring X- ray imaging or CAT or MRI scanning. Treatment of superior vena cava syndrome is directed toward the exact underlying cause. Therefore, treatment might include radiation treatment, antibiotics, chemotherapy, clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs, blood thinners (anticoagulation), and balloon angioplasty, and even surgery. The outlook for patients with the superior vena cava syndrome clearly depends on the underlying cause of the syndrome."
Venereal,"Venereal: Having to do with sexual contact. For example, a venereal disease is a sexually transmitted disease."
Venereal disease,"Venereal disease: A disease that is contracted and transmitted by sexual contact, caused by microorganisms that survive on the skin or mucus membranes, or that are transmitted via semen, vaginal secretions, or blood during intercourse. The genital areas provide a moist, warm environment that is especially conducive to the proliferation of bacteria, viruses, and yeasts, so a great many diseases can be transmitted this way, including AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, syphilis, yeast infections, and some forms of hepatitis. Also known as a morbus venereus or sexually transmitted disease (STD). See: sexually transmitted diseases in men, sexually transmitted diseases in women"
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test,"Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test: A blood test for syphilis. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory is commonly abbreviated VDRL. A negative (""nonreactive"") VDRL is compatible with a person not having syphilis. However, a person may a negative VDRL and still have syphilis since, in the early stages of the disease, the VDRL often gives negative results. This is called a false negative VDRL. The VDRL test is sometimes positive in the absence of syphilis. For example, a false positive VDRL can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy. The RPR (rapid plasma reagin) test is similar to the VDRL test. It is also designed to detect an antibody substance in the bloodstream when syphilis is present but, as with the VDRL, early syphilis infections may give a false negative RPR result. The RPR, like the VDRL, can also give false positive results."
Venin,Venin: Snake venom (poison).
Venipuncture,"Venipuncture: The puncture of a vein with a needle to withdraw blood. Also called phlebotomy or, more often, a blood draw."
Venom,"Venom: A poison, particularly one secreted by an animal. Examples are bee venom, snake venom, scorpion venom, and spider venom. Snake venom is also called venin."
Venomous,"Venomous: 1. Full of venom. 2. Having venom, like some snakes and insects. 3. By extension, noxious, as a venomous tongue."
Venous aneurysm,"Venous aneurysm: A localized widening and bulging of a vein. At the area of a venous aneurysm, the vein wall is weakened and may rupture."
Ventilation,Ventilation: The exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere so that oxygen can be exchanged for carbon dioxide in the alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lungs).
Ventilator,"Ventilator: A machine that mechanically assists a patient in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, a process sometimes referred to as artificial respiration."
Ventral,"Ventral: Pertaining to the front or anterior of any structure. The ventral surfaces of the body include the chest, abdomen, shins, palms, and soles. Ventral is as opposed to dorsal. From the Latin ""venter"" meaning belly. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Ventricular,"Ventricular: Pertaining to the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart, as in ventricular fibrillation and ventricular septal defect."
Ventricular arrhythmias,Ventricular arrhythmias: Abnormal rapid heart rhythms (arrhythmias) that originate in the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles). Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Both are life threatening arrhythmias most commonly associated with heart attacks or scarring of the heart muscle from previous heart attack.
Ventricular fibrillation,Ventricular fibrillation: An abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which there are rapid uncoordinated fluttering contractions of the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. Ventricular fibrillation disrupts the synchrony between the heartbeat and the pulse beat. Ventricular fibrillation is commonly associated with heart attacks and scarring of the heart muscle from previous heart attacks. Ventricular fibrillation is life threatening.
Ventricular tachycardia,Ventricular tachycardia: An abnormal heart rhythm that is rapid and regular and that originates from an area of the lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart. Ventricular tachycardias can be life-threatening arrhythmias that are commonly associated with damage to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease.
Verruca,"Verruca: A wart by another name, a local growth of the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) caused by a virus. The virus of warts (a human papillomavirus) is transmitted by contact. The contact can be with a wart on someone else or one on oneself (autoinoculation). Warts that occur on the hands or feet are called common warts. A wart on the sole of the foot is a plantar wart. Genital (venereal) warts are located on the genitals and may be transmitted by sexual contact. The word ""wart"" is from Old English and far back as the 8th century referred to a wart. The name ""verruca"" is Latin for wart. A common wart is a ""verruca vulgaris"". A wart in medicine is also sometimes called by its Spanish name, ""verruga""."
Version,"Version: 1. In obstetrics, the process of turning the fetus. A cephalic version brings the fetal head into the birth canal. 2. In gynecology, the tilting of the uterus. Uterine retroversion indicates the uterus is tilted backwards. 3. In ophthalmology, the conjugate rotation (turning) of both eyes in the same direction."
Vertebra,"Vertebra: A vertebra is one of 33 bony segments that form the spinal column of humans. There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral (fused into one sacrum bone) and 4 coccygeal (fused into one coccyx bone)."
Vertebrae,Vertebrae: The preferred plural of vertebra. (The alternate plural is vertebras.) See also: Cervical vertebrae; Coccygeal vertebrae; Lumbar vertebrae; Sacral vertebrae; and Thoracic vertebrae.
Vertebral column,"Vertebral column: The 33 vertebrae that fit together to form a flexible, yet extraordinarily tough, column that serves to support the back through a full range of motion. The vertebral column also protects the spinal cord, which runs from the brain through the hollow space in the middle of the vertebral column. There are 7 cervical (C1'C7), 12 thoracic (T1'T12), 5 lumbar (L1'L5), 5 sacral (S1'S5), and 3 to 5 coccygeal vertebrae in the vertebral column, each separated by intervertebral disks. The first cervical vertebra, known as the atlas, supports the head. It pivots on the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra, the axis. The cervical vertebrae end at their juncture with the thoracic vertebrae. The seventh cervical vertebra (the prominent vertebra, so named because of its long spiny projection) adjoins the first thoracic vertebra. The thoracic vertebrae provide an attachment site for the true ribs and make up part of the back of the chest (thorax). This part of the spine is very flexible, to permit bending and twisting. The thoracic vertebrae join the lumbar vertebrae, which are particularly sturdy and large because they support the entire structure. The lumbar vertebrae are nonetheless quite flexible. At the top of the pelvis, the lumbar vertebrae join the sacral vertebrae. By adulthood, the five sacral vertebrae have usually fused to form a triangular bone called the sacrum. At the tip of the sacrum, the final part of the vertebral column projects slightly outward. This is the coccyx, better known as the tailbone. It is made up of 3 to 5 coccygeal vertebrae: small, rudimentary vertebrae that fuse together. Also known as the spinal column."
Vertical,"Vertical: In anatomy, upright. As opposed to horizontal. For a more complete listing of terms used in medicine for spatial orientation, please see the entry to ""Anatomic Orientation Terms""."
Vertical transmission,"Vertical transmission: Passage of a disease-causing agent (pathogen) from mother to baby during the period immediately before and after birth. Transmission might occur across the placenta, in the breast milk, or through direct contact during or after birth. For example, HIV can be a vertically transmitted pathogen. Also known as perinatal transmission."
Vertigo,Vertigo: A feeling that you are dizzily turning around or that things are dizzily turning about you. Vertigo is usually due to a problem with the inner ear. Vertigo can also be caused by vision problems.
Vesicant,Vesicant: A substance that causes tissue blistering. Also known as vesicatory.
Vesicle,"Vesicle: In dermatology, a vesicle is a small blister, as on the skin. Vesicles also occur on the mucous membranes, such as the buccal mucosa (the lining of the mouth). Vesicles are less than 0.5 centimeters in diameter. In anatomy, a vesicle is any small pouch. For example, the seminal vesicles are a pair of pouch-like structures about five cm (2 inches) long located behind the bladder and above the prostate gland that contribute fluid to the ejaculate. The word vesicle comes from the Latin diminutive vesiculum meaning a small bag or bladder."
Vesicular,"Vesicular: Referring to the presence of one or more vesicles. For example, a vesicular rash features small blisters on the skin."
Vessel,Vessel: A tube in the body that carries fluids. Examples of vessels are blood vessels and lymph vessels.
Vestibular,"Vestibular: 1) Having to do with a structure that is a vestibule (entrance), such as the vestibule of the ear. 2) Having to do with the body's system for maintaining equilibrium."
Vestibule,"Vestibule: In medicine and dentistry, a space or cavity at the entrance to a canal, channel, tube, or vessel. For instance, the front of the mouth is a vestibule."
"Vestibule, vaginal","Vestibule, vaginal: The vaginal opening is called the vestibule of the vagina. In medicine, a vestibule is a space or cavity at the entrance to a canal, channel, tube, vessel. In ancient Rome, the ""vestibulum"" was an entrance or enclosed porch leading into the house. The vagina is a muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of the body. The word ""vagina"" is a Latin word meaning ""a sheath or scabbard"", a scabbard into which one might slide and sheath a sword. The ""sword"" in the case of the anatomic vagina was the penis. Love and war, it would seem, have been connected in the minds of people for millennia."
Viable,"Viable: Capable of life. For example, a viable premature baby is one who is able to survive outside the womb."
Vincent angina,"Vincent angina: This is trench mouth, a progressive painful infection with ulceration, swelling and sloughing off of dead tissue from the mouth and throat due to the spread of infection from the gums. Certain germs (including fusiform bacteria and spirochetes) are thought to be involved. Vincent's angina is best treated with the antibiotic penicillin. This condition is also called Vincent (or Vincent's) angina after the French physician Henri Vincent (1862-1950). The word ""angina"" comes from the Latin ""angere"" meaning ""to choke or throttle."" As with most poorly understood diseases, Vincent angina goes by many other names including acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), acute membranous gingivitis, fusospirillary gingivitis, fusospirillosis, fusospirochetal gingivitis, necrotizing gingivitis, phagedenic gingivitis, ulcerative gingivitis, Vincent stomatitis, Vincent gingivitis, and Vincent infection."
Vincent infection,"Vincent infection: This is trench mouth, a progressive painful infection with ulceration, swelling and sloughing off of dead tissue from the mouth and throat due to the spread of infection from the gums. Certain germs (including fusiform bacteria and spirochetes) have been thought to be involved, but the full story behind this long- known disease is still not clear. This condition is also called Vincent's angina after the French physician Henri Vincent (1862-1950). The word ""angina"" comes from the Latin ""angere"" meaning ""to choke or throttle."" As with most poorly understood diseases, Vincent infection goes by many other names including acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), acute membranous gingivitis, fusospirillary gingivitis, fusospirillosis, fusospirochetal gingivitis, necrotizing gingivitis, phagedenic gingivitis, ulcerative gingivitis, Vincent angina, Vincent gingivitis, and Vincent stomatitis."
Vincent stomatitis,"Vincent stomatitis: This is trench mouth, a progressive painful infection with ulceration, swelling and sloughing off of dead tissue from the mouth and throat due to the spread of infection from the gums. Certain germs (including fusiform bacteria and spirochetes) have been thought to be involved, but the full story behind this long- known disease is still not clear.

Viral,"Viral: Of or pertaining to a virus. For example, if a person has a viral rash, the rash was caused by a virus."
Viral infection,"Viral infection: Infection caused by the presence of a virus in the body. Depending on the virus and the person's state of health, various viruses can infect almost any type of body tissue, from the brain to the skin. Viral infections cannot be treated with typical antibiotics (antibacterial antibiotics); in fact, in some cases the use of antibacterial antibiotics may cause side-effects that complicate the viral infection. The vast majority of human viral infections can be effectively fought by the body's own immune system, with a little help in the form of proper diet, hydration, and rest. As for the rest, treatment depends on the type and location of the virus, and may include anti-viral antibiotics or other drugs."
Virginal membrane,"Virginal membrane: A thin membrane which completely or partially occludes the vaginal opening. This fold of mucous membrane is usually present at birth at the orifice of the vagina. In medicine, it is called the vaginal membrane or the hymen. Hymen is a Greek word meaning ""skin"" or ""membrane."" The ancient Greeks applied the word ""hymen"" to all kinds of membranes including, for example, the membrane that surrounds the heart (the pericardium). Starting in the 1500s the word was restricted to refer only to the vaginal membrane."
Virilize,"Virilize: To cause a female to develop male characteristics such as a deepened voice, an increase in body and facial hair, a decrease in breast size, an enlargement of the clitoris, and ""male-pattern"" baldness. Background Males produce hormones called androgens that cause them to develop typically male characteristics such as hair on the face and chest, muscular arms and legs, and a voice of low or medium pitch. Females produce hormones called estrogens that cause them to develop typically female characteristics such as a smooth face and chest, less muscular arms and legs, and a voice of higher pitch. Both males and females also produce small amounts of hormones of the opposite sex--that is, males produce some estrogens, and females produce some androgens. Cause The cause of virilization in most cases is an excess of male hormones in a female. This excess of male hormones is associated with the following: (1) the use of anabolic steroids (which contain androgens) to build strength and muscle mass; (2) congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of inherited disorders characterized by an enzyme defect that results in enlarged adrenal glands and increased production of androgens; and (3) tumors of the ovaries, adrenal glands and testes that produce androgens. However, isolated symptoms of virilization can sometimes occur independently of increases in hormone production. For example, in a condition known as idiopathic hirsutism, excessive hair growth occurs in women even though hormone levels remain normal. ""Idiopathic"" means ""of unknown origin or cause."" ""Hirsutism"" means ""hairiness."" Thus, in idiopathic hirsutism, excessive hair growth develops from an unidentified cause. On the other hand, in a condition of women known as the polycystic ovary syndrome (also called the Stein-Leventhal syndrome), the hormone level of androgens increases, causing excessive hair growth and possibly other signs of virilization. Meanwhile, cysts and tumors may develop in an ovary. This illness may have the following additional symptoms: (1) failure of the ovaries to produce, develop or release eggs (ova); (2) ovary enlargement; (3) failure to menstruate; (4) irregular menstruation; (5) obesity; and (6) infertility. It must be noted that failure to menstruate is normal before puberty, during pregnancy, during early lactation and after menopause. It is probably abnormal at other times and should receive a physician's attention. Derivation The noun form of ""virilize"" is ""virilization."" ""Virilize"" and ""virilization"" are not to be confused with ""masculinize"" and ""masculinization"" which refer to the development of male characteristics in a male on a normal schedule during or on a precocious schedule in a younger boy. ""Virilize"" and ""virilization"" are derived from the Latin word ""virilis"" (masculine). Other words derived from ""virilis"" include ""virile"" (manly) and ""virility"" (manliness)."
Virulence,Virulence: The ability of an agent of infection to produce disease. The virulence of a microorganism is a measure of the severity of the disease it causes.
Virus,"Virus: A microorganism that is smaller than a bacterium that cannot grow or reproduce apart from a living cell. A virus invades living cells and uses their chemical machinery to keep itself alive and to replicate itself. It may reproduce with fidelity or with errors (mutations); this ability to mutate is responsible for the ability of some viruses to change slightly in each infected person, making treatment difficult. Viruses cause many common human infections and are also responsible for a number of rare diseases. Examples of viral illnesses range from the common cold, which can be caused by one of the rhinoviruses, to AIDS, which is caused by HIV. Viruses may contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material. Herpes simplex virus and the hepatitis B virus are DNA viruses. RNA viruses have an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that permits the usual sequence of DNA-to-RNA to be reversed so that the virus can make a DNA version of itself.
RNA viruses include HIV and hepatitis C virus. Researchers have grouped viruses together into several major families, based on their shape, behavior, and other characteristics. These include the herpes-viruses, adenoviruses, papovaviruses (including
the papillomaviruses), hepadnaviruses, poxviruses, and parvoviruses, among the DNA viruses. On the RNA virus side, major families include the picorna-viruses (including the rhinoviruses), calciviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, filoviruses, and retroviruses. There are dozens
of smaller virus families within these major classifications. Many viruses are host specific, capable of infecting and causing disease in humans or specific animals only."
Viruses,Viruses: Small living particles that can infect cells and change how the cells function. Infection with a virus can cause a person to develop symptoms. The disease and symptoms that are caused depend on the type of virus and the type of cells that are infected.
Viscera,"Viscera: The internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). The singular of ""viscera"" is ""viscus"" meaning in Latin ""an organ of the body."""
Visceral,"Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something ""visceral"" is felt ""deep down."" It is a ""gut feeling."""
Viscus,"Viscus: An internal organ of the body, specifically one within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). ""Viscus"" is the Latin word for ""an organ of the body."" The plural of ""viscus"" is ""viscera."""
Visual acuity,"Visual acuity: The clarity or clearness of vision, a measure of how well a person sees."
Visual field,"Visual field: The entire area that can be seen when the eye is directed forward, including that which is seen with peripheral vision. The visual field can be tested to measure the extent and distribution of the field of vision. The test may be done by a number of methods including what are termed confrontation, tangent screen exam and automated perimetry. Many diseases can adversely affect the visual field including glaucoma, strokes, high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, multiple sclerosis, overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). Medications can also affect the visual field, some of which include the antimalarial medicines chloroquine (ATABRINE) and hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL)."
Vital,"Vital: Necessary to maintain life. For example, breathing is a vital function."
Vitamin A,"Vitamin A: Vitamin A is retinol. Carotene compounds (found, for example, in egg yolk, butter and cream) are gradually converted by the body to vitamin A (retinol). A form of vitamin A called retinal is responsible for transmitting light sensation in the retina of the eye. Deficiency of vitamin A leads to night blindness. The word ""vitamin"" was coined in 1911 by the Warsaw-born biochemist Casimir Funk (1884-1967). At the Lister Institute in London, Funk isolated a substance that prevented nerve inflammation (neuritis) in chickens raised on a diet deficient in that substance. He named the substance ""vitamine"" because he believed it was necessary to life and it was a chemical amine. The ""e"" at the end was later removed when it was recognized that vitamins need not be amines. The letters (A, B, C and so on) were assigned to the vitamins in the order of their discovery. The one exception was vitamin K which was assigned its ""K"" from ""Koagulation"" by the Danish researcher Henrik Dam. The vitamins include:"
Vitamin B1,"Vitamin B1: Thiamine. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of the body. Deficiency of thiamine leads to the disease beriberi, a disease affecting the heart and nervous system. The word ""vitamin"" was coined in 1911 by the Warsaw-born biochemist Casimir Funk (1884-1967). At the Lister Institute in London, Funk isolated a substance that prevented nerve inflammation (neuritis) in chickens raised on a diet deficient in that substance. He named the substance ""vitamine"" because he believed it was necessary to life and it was a chemical amine. The ""e"" at the end was later removed when it was recognized that vitamins need not be amines. The letters (A, B, C and so on) were assigned to the vitamins in the order of their discovery. The one exception was vitamin K which was assigned its ""K"" from ""Koagulation"" by the Danish researcher Henrik Dam. The vitamins include:"
Vitamin B12,Vitamin B12: A vitamin important for the normal formation of red blood cells and the health of the nerve tissues. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia and permanent nerve and brain damage. Pernicious anemia is a blood disorder caused by inadequate vitamin B12 in the blood. Patients who have this disorder do not produce the protein substance in the stomach that allows the body to absorb vitamin B12. This substance is called intrinsic factor (IF). Patients with Crohn's disease involving the small intestine (Crohn's ileitis) or who have undergone small intestine resection may not be able to absorb vitamin B12. Strict vegetarians who consume no animal products can develop B12 deficiency since there is a lack of B12 in vegetables. Also called cobalamin.
Vitamin B2,"Vitamin B2: An essential nutrient found in meat, dairy foods, plant foods and grain products. The body requires vitamin B2 to break down food components, maintain tissue, and absorb other nutrients. Like other vitamins, vitamin B2 is an organic compound. An organic compound is a substance that (1) occurs in living things, or organisms (hence, the word ""organic"") and (2) contains the elements carbon and oxygen (hence, the word ""compound,"" meaning combination of elements). An alternate name for vitamin B2 is riboflavin. Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble vitamin, one that cannot be stored by the body except in insignificant amounts. It must be replenished daily. Purposes and Benefits of Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 helps break down carbohydrates, fats and protein for use by the body. Its role in maintaining an energy supply for the body is crucial, for it helps convert carbohydrates into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a compound needed to store energy in muscles. Vitamin B2 also promotes the following: 1. Skin, muscle, nerve, heart and eye health, including inhibiting the development of cataracts. 2. Production of red blood cells and antibodies. 2. Absorption or activation of iron, folic acid and Vitamins B1, B3 and B6. 3. Conversion of tryptophan, an amino acid, into niacin. 4. Production of hormones by the adrenal glands. 5. Maintenance of the mucous membranes in the digestive system with the help of vitamin A. 6. Healthy development of the fetus. (Vitamin B2 may or may not be essential for normal fetal development but it is clearly the better part of wisdom to supply it via the mother's diet.) Food Sources of Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 is found mainly in meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, dairy foods and grain products. Types of food containing vitamin B2 include the following: 1. Liver, beef kidneys, chicken, turkey, fish. 2. Eggs, cheese, milk, yogurt. 3. Leafy green vegetables, asparagus, artichokes, avocados, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, dandelion greens, watercress, currants, spinach, kelp, peas, navy beans, lima beans, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, cayenne, parsley, sage, rose hips. 4.Whole-grain breads, enriched breads, fortified cereals. 5. Mushrooms, nuts, molasses. Deficiency of Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 deficiency is quite uncommon. Those most vulnerable to deficiency of vitamin B2 include alcoholics, elderly persons with a poor diet, persons who suffer adverse reactions to dairy products (lactose intolerance) and women who use oral contraceptives. The signs and symptoms of vitamin B2 deficiency include visual problems, such as cataracts and excessive sensitivity of the eyes to light (photosensitivity). There may also include reddening of the lips with cracking at the corners (cheilosis), tongue inflammation (glossitis), skin inflammation (dermatitis), swelling (edema), dizziness, hair loss, insomnia, trembling and delayed mental response. Preservation of Vitamin B2 Foods lose Vitamin B2 when exposed to light. Therefore, they should not be stored in transparent glass containers. Recommended Daily Intake of Vitamin B2 in Milligrams Infants from birth to 1 year: 0.4 to 0.5 mg Babies 1 to 3 years: 0.8 mg Children 4 to 10: 1.1 to 1.2 mg Pregnant women: 1.6 mg Lactating women: 1.7 to 1.8 mg Other adult females: 1.3 mg Adult males: 1.7 mg (Intakes may be adjusted according to a physician's instructions.) A milligram equals 1/1000 of a gram. A gram equals .0353 of an ounce. Side Effects From Overdose of Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 is not known to cause overdose side effects because excessive amounts are not retained by the body. Interactions of Vitamin B2 Vitamin B2 may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients taking drugs should always read warning labels and advisories on containers and printed pharmacy instructions. If in doubt about a possible reaction, patients should consult a pharmacist or physician. Vitamin B2 Supplements Vitamin B2 is usually sold as part of B-complex or multivitamin products in the form of tablets, powders and liquids. Derivation The ""vita"" in ""vitamin"" is derived from the Latin word ""vita"" (life). A vitamin, thus, is a nutrient required to sustain life."
Vitamin B6,"Vitamin B6: A group of closely related chemical compounds with related names -- pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine -- that are transformed within the body to yet another form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate, that acts as a coenzyme. (A number of vitamins serve as coenzymes, substances that enhance the action of enzymes and thereby aid in catalyzing biochemical reactions.) The vitamin B6 group is especially important to the function of the central nervous system, skin, and blood. Vitamin B6 is involved in the formation of red blood cells since pyridoxal phosphate is the rate-limiting substance in making heme, a component of hemoglobin, the key oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells. The diet rarely lacks vitamin B6. Most foods contain it. However, deficiency of vitamin B6 within the body may occur due to poor absorption of it from the intestine or inactivation of it by some drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, estrogens, isoniazid, and penicillamine). Other causes of vitamin B6 include alcoholism and conditions such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes that increase the metabolic demand, creating a relative shortage of vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 deficiency causes convulsions in infants and anemia in adults. An outbreak of convulsions in infants followed the inadvertent destruction of vitamin B6 in infant formulas. Several genetic syndromes also involve problems with vitamin B6."
Vitamin C,"Vitamin C: An essential nutrient found mainly in fruits and vegetables. The body requires vitamin C to form and maintain bones, blood vessels, and skin. Vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, one that cannot be stored by the body except in insignificant amounts. It must be replenished daily. Vitamin C helps produce collagen, a protein needed to develop and maintain healthy teeth, bones, gums, cartilage, vertebrae discs, joint linings, skin and blood vessels."
Vitamin D,"Vitamin D: A steroid vitamin which promotes the intestinal absorption and metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. Under normal conditions of sunlight exposure, no dietary supplementation is necessary because sunlight promotes adequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Deficiency can lead to bone deformity (rickets) in children and bone weakness (osteomalacia) in adults. Vitamin D comes from the diet (eggs, fish, and dairy products) and is produced in the skin. Skin production of the active form of vitamin D depends on exposure to sunlight. Active people living in sunny regions produce most of the vitamin D they need from their skin. In less sunny climes the skin production of vitamin D is markedly diminished in the winter months, especially among the elderly and the housebound. In that population, vitamin D supplements become important. Vitamin D deficiency among the elderly is quite common in the US. In a study of hospitalized patients in a general medical ward, vitamin D deficiency was detected in 57% of the patients. An estimated 50% of elderly women consume far less vitamin D in their diet than recommended. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has recommended the following as an adequate vitamin D intake: 200 IU daily for people 19-50 years old; 400 International Units (IU) daily for those 51-70 years old; and 600 IU daily for those 71 years and older. An average multivitamin tablet contains 400 IU of vitamin D. Therefore, taking a multivitamin a day should help provide the recommended amount of vitamin D. The new recommended daily allowance (RDA), as set in 2010, is based on age, as follows: for those 1-70 years of age, 600 IU daily; for those 71 years and older, 800 IU daily; and for pregnant and lactating women, 600 IU daily. The IOM further recommended that serum 25(OH)D levels of 20ng/mL (= 50 nmol/L) is adequate, and levels > 50ng/mL (= 125 nmol/L) could have potential adverse effects As to children, the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that all infants, including those who are exclusively breastfed, have a minimum intake of 200 International Units (IU) of vitamin D per day beginning during the first 2 months of life. In addition, it is recommended that an intake of 200 IU of vitamin D per day be continued throughout childhood and adolescence, because adequate sunlight exposure is not easily determined for a given individual."
Vitamin D3,"Vitamin D3: A vitamin produced by the body when exposed to ultraviolet light or obtained from dietary sources. Vitamin D3 is a hormone that has an important role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Technically, vitamin D3 is not a vitamin because the body can produce it. Also known as cholecalciferol."
Vitamin K,"Vitamin K: One of two naturally occurring fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin K1 and vitamin K2) needed for the clotting of blood because of an essential role in the production of prothrombin (a clotting factor). The term vitamin A may also refer to a synthetic compound that is closely related chemically to the natural vitamins K1 and K2 and has similar biological activity. Vitamin K is required (as a cofactor) for the body to make four of the blood's coagulation (clotting) factors: particularly prothrombin and also factors VII, IX, and X. Vitamin K1 is made by plants, whereas vitamin K2 is of bacterial origin and is the important form for people. All other forms of vitamin K are converted to vitamin K2 in the body. There are a number of closely related compounds of the vitamin K2 series. Vitamin K deficiency only rarely occurs because an adequate supply of the vitamin is usually present in the diet and the vitamin is synthesized by bacteria in the intestine. Deficiency of vitamin K may occur following the administration of certain drugs that inhibit the growth of the vitamin-synthesizing bacteria or as a result of disorders affecting the production or flow of bile which is necessary for the intestinal absorption of vitamin K. In newborn babies, the absence of large intestinal bacteria coupled with the absence of body stores of vitamin K may result in hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. This is a dangerous condition because there can be bleeding into critical organs such as the brain. This disorder can be prevented by the administration of vitamin K to the baby shortly after birth or to the mother during labor. A fat-soluble substance present in green leafy vegetables was found in 1929 to be needed for coagulation of the blood to take place. The substance came to be named vitamin K. The K was for Koagulation (Danish for coagulation). A pure form of the vitamin was isolated and analyzed in 1939. Several related compounds with vitamin K activity have also been synthesized. The 1943 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was shared by the Danish researcher Henrik Carl Peter Dam (1895-1976) for his (original) discovery of vitamin K and the American worker Edward Adelbert Doisy (1893-1986) for his discovery of the chemical nature of vitamin K."
Vitamins,"Vitamins: The word ""vitamin"" was coined in 1911 by the Warsaw-born biochemist Casimir Funk (1884-1967). At the Lister Institute in London, Funk isolated a substance that prevented nerve inflammation (neuritis) in chickens raised on a diet deficient in that substance. He named the substance ""vitamine"" because he believed it was necessary to life and it was a chemical amine. The ""e"" at the end was later removed when it was recognized that vitamins need not be amines. The letters (A, B, C and so on) were assigned to the vitamins in the order of their discovery. The one exception was vitamin K which was assigned its ""K"" from ""Koagulation"" by the Danish researcher Henrik Dam."
Vitreous,"Vitreous: A clear, jelly-like substance that fills the middle of the eye. Also called the vitreous humor, ""humor"" in medicine referring to a fluid (or semifluid) substance."
Voice box,"Voice box: The voice box, or larynx, is the portion of the respiratory (breathing) tract containing the vocal cords which produce sound. It is located between the pharynx and the trachea. The larynx, also called the voice box, is a 2-inch-long, tube-shaped organ in the neck. We use the larynx when we breathe, talk, or swallow. Its outer wall of cartilage forms the area of the front of the neck referred to as the ""Adams apple."" The vocal cords are two bands of muscle that form a ""V"" inside the larynx. Each time we inhale (breathe in), air goes into our nose or mouth, then through the larynx, down the trachea, and into our lungs. When we exhale (breathe out), the air goes the other way. When we breathe, the vocal cords relax and air moves through the space between them without making a sound. When we talk, the vocal cords tighten up and move closer together. Air from the lungs is forced between them and makes them vibrate, producing the sound of our voice. The tongue, lips, and teeth form this sound into words. The esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, is just behind the trachea and the larynx. The openings of the esophagus and the larynx are very close together in the throat. When we swallow, a flap called the epiglottis moves down over the larynx to keep food out of the windpipe."
Void,"Void: To urinate. The term void is also sometimes used to indicate the elimination of solid waste
(defecation)."
Volar,"Volar: Pertaining to the palm or the sole. For example, the volar surface of the forearm is the portion of the forearm that is on the same side as the palm of the hand."
Voluntary,"Voluntary: Done in accordance with the conscious will of the individual. The opposite of involuntary. The terms ""voluntary"" and ""involuntary"" apply to the human nervous system and its control over muscles. The nervous system is divided into two parts -- somatic and autonomic. The somatic nervous system operates muscles that are under voluntary control. The autonomic (automatic or visceral) nervous system regulates individual organ function and is involuntary. Opening the mouth is voluntary while blushing is involuntary."
Volvulus,"Volvulus: Abnormal twisting of a portion of the gastrointestinal tract, usually the intestine, which can impair blood flow. Volvulus can lead to gangrene and death of the involved segment of the
gastrointestinal tract, intestinal obstruction, perforation of the intestine, and peritonitis. The stomach, small intestine, cecum, and sigmoid colon are all subject to volvulus. Malrotation of the bowel during fetal development can predispose one to a volvulus, which often has a sudden onset. The symptoms and signs of a volvulus may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and blood in the stool. The treatment is surgery to free the obstruction and ensure normal blood flow to the bowel. Volvulus is a surgical emergency."
Vomit,"Vomit: Matter from the stomach that has come up into and may be ejected beyond the mouth, due to the act of vomiting. When vomit is reddish or the color of coffee grounds, it may mean there is serious internal bleeding. The reddish color may herald fresh blood and dark blood may betoken blood that has been digested. Vomit and vomitus are synonymous as nouns although only vomit is used as a verb.. The act of vomiting is also called emesis. From the Indo-European root wem- (to vomit), the source of the words such as emetic and wamble (to feel nauseated)."
Vomitus,"Vomitus: Matter from the stomach that has come up into and may be ejected beyond the mouth, due to the act of vomiting.

The reddish color may herald fresh blood and dark blood may betoken blood that has been digested. Vomitus and vomit are synonymous as nouns although only vomit is used as a verb. The act of vomiting is also called emesis. From the Indo-European root wem- (to vomit), the source of the words such as emetic and wamble (to feel nauseated)."
Von Willebrand disease,"Von Willebrand disease: The most common inherited bleeding disorder, in which a clotting protein called von Willebrand factor is deficient or defective. Von Willebrand factor is made by cells lining the wall of blood vessels. Several types of von Willebrand disease have been described. All types affect both males and females. Symptoms can include easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums after a dental procedure, heavy menstrual bleeding in women, blood in the stool and urine, and excessive bleeding after a cut or other accident or after surgery. Von Willebrand disease is usually mild and often does not require treatment. Treatment may be needed only after surgery, a tooth extraction, or an accident. For those who need treatment, medications such as desamino-8-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) can be given to raise the levels of von Willebrand factor, which reduces the tendency toward bleeding. Antihemophilic factor (Alphanate) may be given to decrease bleeding in patients with the disease who must have surgery or other invasive procedures. Blood plasma or certain factor VIII preparations may also be used to decrease bleeding."
Voyeurism,"Voyeurism: Voyeurism is a disorder that involves achieving sexual arousal by observing an unsuspecting and non-consenting person who is undressing or unclothed, and/or engaged in sexual activity. This behavior may conclude with masturbation by the voyeur. The voyeur does not seek sexual contact with the person he is observing. Other names for this behavior are ""peeping"" or ""peeping Tom."""
Vulvar,"Vulvar: Pertaining to the vulva, the female external genitalia including the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, the tiny glands called Bartolin's glands, and the entrance to the vagina (the vestibule of the vagina)."
Walleyed,"Walleyed: 1. Having exotropia -- divergent strabismus -- in which the eyes turn outward away from the nose. The Japanese term is ron-pari, as one eye is looking at Rondon (London) and the other is looking at Pari (Paris). 2. Having a dense white opacity (leukoma) of the cornea. 3. Having large staring eyes, like those of certain fish such as the pike. All of these meanings relate to the walleyed pike, a freshwater perch. When the walleyed pike is dead, its large divergent eyes quickly become opaquely white. From the Old Norse ""vagl-eygr,"" from ""vagl"" (beam) and ""eygr"" (eyed)."
Warfarin,"Warfarin: An anticoagulant drug (brand names: Coumarin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) taken to prevent the blood from clotting and to treat blood clots and overly thick blood. Warfarin is also used to reduce the risk of clots causing strokes or heart attacks. Warfarin works by suppressing the production of some clotting factors (interfering with prothrombin activation) and thereby inhibiting the clotting of blood. Warfarin interacts with many other drugs, including some vitamins. These interactions can be dangerous, even life-threatening. If you are taking Warfarin, talk to your doctor before taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications. University of Wisconsin biochemistry professor Karl Paul Link and his co-workers first isolated dicoumarin, a molecule in spoiled sweet clover that causes cattle to hemorrhage and die. The discovery led to the synthesis of Dicumarol, the first anticoagulant drug that could be taken orally. The successor to Dicumarol was Warfarin. Warfarin is named after WARF, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, to which Professor Link assigned the patent. Warfarin was originally marketed as a rodenticide (the rats bleed to death). Its effectiveness in controlling pestilent rats and mice led to great commercial success. Warfarin has, in addition, become the most widely prescribed anticoagulant drug for people and saved countless lives."
Wart,"Wart: A local growth of the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) caused by a virus. The virus of warts (a papillomavirus) is transmitted by contact. The contact can be with a wart on someone else or one on oneself (autoinoculation). Warts that occur on the hands or top of the feet are called ""common warts."" A wart on the sole (the plantar surface) of the foot is a plantar wart (and can be quite painful). Genital (venereal) warts are located on the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact; they are a form of STD (sexually transmitted disease). Warts are nothing new. The word ""wart"" is from Old English. As far back as the 8th century, a ""wart"" was, well, a wart. The medical name for a wart is ""verruca"", the Latin for wart. A common wart is a ""verruca vulgaris"". A wart in medicine is also sometimes called by its Spanish name, ""verruga""."
Wasting,"Wasting: 1. Gradual loss (for example, of weight), deterioration, emaciation. As in a wasting disease. 2. Excessive depletion. As in salt wasting, the excessive loss of salt."
Water,"Water: 1. A tasteless odorless colorless liquid with the chemical formula H2O.
2. The liquid which forms rain, rivers, and the sea and makes up a large part of the bodies of most organisms, including humans.
3. The amniotic fluid, as in the bag of waters.
4. The cerebrospinal fluid, especially under increased pressure, as in water on the brain."
Water blister,"Water blister: A blister with clear watery contents that is not purulent (does not contain pus) and is not sanguineous (does not contain blood). A blister is medically termed a vesicle. One that is more than 5 mm in diameter with thin walls and is full of watery fluid is called a bulla. The word ""blister"" entered English in the 14th century. It came from the Middle Dutch ""bluyster"", blister and was a modification of the Old French ""blostre"" which meant a leprous nodule -- a rise in the skin due to leprosy."
Water intoxication,"Water intoxication: A lowered blood concentration of sodium (see hyponatremia). The term ""water intoxication"" is generally used to refer to hyponatremia that occurs due to the consumption of excess water without adequate replacement of sodium, as may happen during strenuous exercise."
Water on the brain,"Water on the brain: Known medically as ""hydrocephalus"", this is an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. The fluid is often under increased pressure and can compress and damage the brain. Hydrocephalus can arise before birth or any time afterward. It may be due to many causes including a birth defect, hemorrhage into the brain, infection, meningitis, tumor, or head injury. Most forms of hydrocephalus are the result of obstructed CSF flow in the ventricular system. With birth defects, physical obstruction of CSF flow in the ventricular system is usually the cause of the hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common companion of spina bifida (meningomyelocele). What is termed ""hydrocephalus ex-vacuo"" occurs when there is damage to the brain caused by stroke or injury, and there may be an actual shrinkage of brain substance. ""Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo"" is essentially only hydrocephalus by default; the CSF pressure itself is normal. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can also occur due to a gradual blockage of the CSF drainage pathways in the brain. Although the ventricles enlarge, the pressure of the CSF remains within normal range. NPH is characterized by memory loss (dementia), gait disorder of balance, urinary incontinence and a general slowing of activity. In old age or persons with Alzheimer's disease, the entire brain may shrink and the CSF fills up the space created by the shrinkage. This is not due to hydrocephalus. The diagnostic signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus depend upon the age of the person: Treatment of hydrocephalus involves the insertion of a shunt to let the excess fluid exit and relieve the pressure on the brain. The shunt is a flexible, plastic tube with a oneway valve. The shunt is inserted into the ventricular system of the brain to divert the flow of CSF into another area of the body, where the CSF can drain and be absorbed into the bloodstream. The prognosis (outlook) with hydrocephalus depends the cause and the timing of the diagnosis and treatment. Many children treated for hydrocephalus are able to lead normal lives with few, if any, limitations. In some cases, cognitive impairments in language and non-language functions may occur. Problems with shunts such as infection or malfunction require revision of the shunt. The word ""hydrocephalus"" in Greek literally means ""watery head."""
Water retention,"Water retention: A nonspecific term meaning the accumulation of excess fluids in body tissues, medically known as edema. Edema can result from many different disease processes, including but not limited to diseases of the heart and circulation and kidney disease. Water retention is also used to describe the symptoms of feeling bloated or experiencing a small weight gain due to physiologic shifts in body fluid balance brought on by dietary changes, hormonal factors, or dehydration. In this sense water retention is described as a common symptom of the premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. See also edema."
Waterborne bacterial disease,"Waterborne bacterial disease: An illness due to infection with bacteria contaminating the water supply. Waterborne bacterial diseases cause a wide range of syndromes including: acute dehydrating diarrhea (cholera), prolonged febrile illness with abdominal symptoms (typhoid fever), acute bloody diarrhea (dysentery), and chronic diarrhea (Brainerd diarrhea). Common agents causing waterborne diseases include the following bacteria: Waterborne bacterial infections account for 2-3 billion episodes of diarrhea resulting in 1-2 million deaths a year. The deaths tend to be of infants and young children from dehydration, malnutrition, and other complications of waterborne bacterial infections. At high risk are the two billion people living in poverty in the developing world. Some people in the US (in periurban ""colonias"" and remote rural areas with poor water treatment and delivery systems) are also at risk. Contaminated surface water sources and large poorly functioning municipal water distribution systems contribute to transmission of waterborne bacterial diseases. Chlorination and safe water handling can eliminate the risk of waterborne bacterial diseases. But centralized water treatment and distribution systems are expensive and take years to complete. To provide people with potable (safe drinkable) water in the short term requires innovative practical solutions such as point-of-use disinfection and safe water storage vessels. Electrolytic generators that produce sodium hypochlorite from salt water are now affordable and available for use in the developing world. Villages that produce and use sodium hypochlorite and store treated water in vessels to protect it from recontamination have had nearly 50% reductions in diarrheal disease incidence for pennies per family."
WBS,WBS: Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. See: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
WDWN,"WDWN: Abbreviation for 'well-developed, well-nourished,' shorthand used by physicians when jotting down the results of a physical examination. For example, a WDWNWF would be a well-developed, well-nourished white female."
Weaver's bottom,Weaver's bottom: Inflammation of the bursa that separates the gluteus maximus muscle of the buttocks from the underlying bony prominence of the bone that a person sits on (ischial tuberosity). Weaver's bottom is a form of bursitis that is usually caused by prolonged sitting on hard surfaces that press against the bones of the bottom or midbuttocks. Also known as ischial bursitis.
Weight loss,"Weight loss: Weight loss is a decrease in body weight resulting from either voluntary (diet, exercise) or involuntary (illness) circumstances. Most instances of weight loss arise due to the loss of body fat, but in cases of extreme or severe weight loss, protein and other substances in the body can also be depleted. Examples of involuntary weight loss include the weight loss associated with cancer, malabsorption (such as from chronic diarrheal illnesses ), and chronic inflammation (such as with rheumatoid arthritis)."
Weight Watchers,"Weight Watchers: Weight Watchers is a diet plan first developed in the 1960s that encourages weight loss by making healthy food and lifestyle choices. The Weight Watchers plan is based upon the idea that dieting is only one part of a healthy lifestyle. The program stresses the importance of overall mental and physical health and well-being. Weight Watchers does not forbid specific foods or tell people what to eat. There are also no pre-prepared meals or foods to purchase. Instead, people are encouraged to make healthier eating choices and to increase physical activity. Weight Watchers sponsors group meetings in locations throughout the world where members can offer each other encouragement, support, and tips for making healthier lifestyle choices. Weight Watchers offers two diet plans:"
Wellcovorin,Wellcovorin: See: Leucovorin.
Welt,"Welt: A red bump, ridge or swelling of unbroken skin raised by a stinging blow or by an allergic reaction to foods, drugs or insect bites, as in hives (urticaria). The word ""welt"" has a number of nonmedical but related meanings including: in sewing, an edge of cloth folded on itself, often over a cord, and sewed down; and in shoemaking, a narrow strip of leather around the shoe between the upper leather and sole."
WF,WF: Medical shorthand for white female.
Wharton's jelly,"Wharton's jelly: A gelatinous substance that provides insulation and protection within the umbilical cord. Stem cells are present in Wharton's jelly, as well as in umbilical cord blood."
Wheal,"Wheal: A raised, itchy (pruritic) area of skin that is sometimes an overt sign of allergy. Not all wheals are alike. They may be redder or paler than the skin around them. They may vary in configuration and may be rounded or flat-topped. Wheals typically have a reddish hue. They characteristically change in size and shape and they come and go. But they are consistent at being smooth and elevated above the surrounding skin. As anyone who has had wheals knows, they can be intensely, infuriatingly itchy. Wheals reflect circumscribed dermal edema (fluid collection in the layer of skin below the surface). A wheal is also sometimes called a welt and often a hive."
Wheezing,Wheezing: A whistling noise in the chest during breathing. Wheezing occurs when the airways are narrowed or compressed.
Whipworm,"Whipworm: A nematode (roundworm), also called Trichuris trichiura, that is the third most common roundworm in humans. The whipworm is found worldwide, and whipworm infections are most frequent among children and in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices. Infection with whipworm most often occurs without symptoms. Heavy infections, especially in small children, can cause gastrointestinal problems (such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal prolapse) and possibly growth retardation. Treatment involves use of the drugs albendazole or mebendazole."
White blood cell,"White blood cell: One of the cells the body makes to help fight infections. There are several types of white blood cells (leukocytes). The two most common types are the lymphocytes and neutrophils (also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs, or ""polys""). Lymphocytes are made in lymphoid tissue in the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus gland. There are different kinds of lymphocytes. Lymphocytes identify foreign substances from germs (bacteria or viruses) in the body and produce antibodies and cells that specifically target them. It takes from several days to weeks for lymphocytes to recognize and attack a new foreign substance. Neutrophils are also major players in the body's defense against bacterial infections. Neutrophils are made in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream. Neutrophils move out of the blood vessels into the infected tissue to attack the bacteria. The pus in a boil (an abscess) is made up largely of neutrophils. Normally a serious bacterial infection causes the body to produce an increased number of neutrophils, resulting in a higher than normal white blood cell count (WBC). When the WBC is low, there may not be enough neutrophils to defend against bacterial infections. The white blood cell count is done by counting the number of white blood cells in a sample of blood. A normal WBC is in the range of 4,000 to 11,000 cells per microliter. A low WBC is called leukopenia. A high WBC is termed leukocytosis. A normal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is in the range of 1,500 to 8,000 cells per microliter. If the ANC is below 500 for an extended period of time, the risk of serious bacterial infection may increase significantly. A low neutrophil count is called neutropenia."
White blood cell count,"White blood cell count (leukocyte count): The number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the blood. The WBC is usually measured as part of the CBC (complete blood count). White blood cells are the infection-fighting cells in the blood and are distinct from the red (oxygen-carrying) blood cells known as erythrocytes. There are different types of white blood cells, including neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes; PMNs), band cells (slightly immature neutrophils), T-type lymphocytes (T cells), B-type lymphocytes (B cells), monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. All the types of white blood cells are reflected in the white blood cell count. The normal range for the white blood cell count varies between laboratories but is usually between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 - 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. A low white blood cell count is called leukopenia. A high white blood cell count is termed leukocytosis."
White matter,"White matter: The part of the brain that contains myelinated nerve fibers. The white matter is white because it is the color of myelin, the insulation that covers nerve fibers."
World Health Organization,World Health Organization: The subagency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international health. Abbreviated WHO. Also known as Organisation Mondiale de la Sant' (OMS).
Wing bone,"Wing bone: Popular and familiar term for the scapula, the flat triangular bone at the back of the shoulder. The word ""scapula"" (with the accent on the first syllable) is a steal straight from the Latin. The Romans always employed the plural ""scapulae"", the shoulder blades. Because the shoulder blade resembles the blade of a trowel (a small shovel), the word ""scapula"" is thought to have come from the Greek ""skaptein"" meaning ""to dig."" The wing bone (aka scapula) also is sometimes called the shoulder blade or the blade bone."
Witch's milk,"Witch's milk: A folk term for the milk that often comes from the breast of a newborn baby. This temporary phenomenon is due to stimulation of the baby's breasts by the mother's hormones that cross the placenta during pregnancy. The ability of the baby's breasts to respond in this fashion is a mark of baby born at (or near) full-term. The breast of a baby born prematurely cannot enlarge or produce witch's milk (in German, Hexenmilch). The term ""witch's milk"" is sometimes applied broadly to milk from the nipple at any time other than during nursing. See also Galactorrhea."
Withdrawal symptoms,"Withdrawal symptoms: Abnormal physical or psychological features that follow the abrupt discontinuation of a drug that has the capability of producing physical dependence. In example, common opiates withdrawal symptoms include sweating, goosebumps, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia, and muscle pain."
WM,WM: Medical shorthand for white male.
WNL,"WNL: Medical shorthand for within normal limits. For example, a laboratory test result may be WNL."
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: A condition that is caused by an abnormality in the electrical system of the heart, which normally tells the heart muscle when to contract. Abbreviated WPW syndrome. In WPW syndrome there is an extra electrical connection inside the heart that acts as a short circuit, causing the heart to beat too rapidly and sometimes in an irregular manner. WPW syndrome can be life threatening, although that is unusual. WPW syndrome can be treated via destruction of the short circuit, using a technique termed radiofrequency catheter ablation, in which the short circuit is destroyed using radiofrequency energy."
Womb,"Womb: The womb (uterus) is a hollow, pear-shaped organ located in a woman's lower abdomen between the bladder and the rectum. The narrow, lower portion of the uterus is the cervix; the broader, upper part is the corpus. The corpus is made up of two layers of tissue. In women of childbearing age, the inner layer of the uterus (endometrium) goes through a series of monthly changes known as the menstrual cycle. Each month, endometrial tissue grows and thickens in preparation to receive a fertilized egg. Menstruation occurs when this tissue is not used, disintegrates, and passes out through the vagina. The outer layer of the corpus (myometrium) is muscular tissue that expands during pregnancy to hold the growing fetus and contracts during labor to deliver the child."
Women's hospital,"Women's hospital: A hospital for the exclusive use of women. The first hospital called by that name was the Woman's Hospital of New York City. It opened in 1855. The hospital was founded by the Woman's Hospital Assn., a group of 30 women who held that there women needed a hospital to care exclusively for them. In 1832, the Boston Lying-in Hospital (where ""everyday is labor day"") was founded specifically for labor and delivery. It and the Free Hospital for Women, founded in 1875, merged to form the Boston Hospital for Women. The movement toward women's hospitals has declined. The tendency is now to integrate women's hospital into larger, more general hospitals. For example, the Boston Hospital for Women is now part of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, a nonprofit teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. And the Women's Hospital in Baltimore and many other women's hospitals no longer exist as independent hospitals."
Word blindness,"Word blindness: A neurological disorder characterized by loss of the ability to read or understand the written word. Word blindness is a complex visual disturbance resulting from disease in the visual-association areas at the back of the brain. Someone who has had a stroke may be left with pure (total) or partial word blindness. Partial word blindness permits the individual to recognize letters but only read only certain types of words such as the concrete noun ""inn"" but not the more abstract preposition ""in"". Word blindness is also called alexia [from the Greek prefix ""a-"" (without or not) + ""lexis"" (word) = without word]."
World Health Organization,World Health Organization: The subagency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international health. Abbreviated WHO. Also known as Organisation Mondiale de la Sant' (OMS).
X-ray,X-ray: High-energy radiation with waves shorter than those of visible light. X-ray is used in low doses to make images that help to diagnose diseases and in high doses to treat cancer.
Xanax,Xanax: See: Alprazolam.
Xanth- (prefix),"Xanth- (prefix): A colorful prefix relating to a yellow color. ""Xanth-"" is related to the word ""xanthic"" which has its roots in the Greek word ""xanthos"" which means yellow. A number of medical terms trace to ""xanthos"" including, for example: ""Xanth"" is more than a prefix. It is a combining term and can be at the front, in the middle, or at the end of a word. For example, in ""pseudoxanthoma."""
Xanthine,"Xanthine: A substance found in caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline and encountered in tea, coffee, and the colas. Chemically, xanthine is a purine. There is a genetic disease of xanthine metabolism, xanthinuria, due to deficiency of an enzyme, xanthine dehydrogenase, needed to process xanthine in the body. Unchecked, xanthinuria can lead to kidney stone formation and urinary tract disease (due to xanthine stones) and to muscle disease (due to deposits of xanthine in the muscle). Treatment is by avoiding foods and drinks containing xanthine derivatives, such as coffee, tea, and colas. The name ""xanthine"" was taken from the Greek ""xanqos"" meaning yellow + quinine since it forms yellow salts and its solution forms a blue fluorescence as does quinine."
Xanthopsia,"Xanthopsia: A form of chromatopsia, a visual abnormality in which objects look as though they have been overpainted with an unnatural color. In xanthopsia, that color is yellow."
Xanthosis,Xanthosis: Yellowing of the skin without yellowing of the eyes. In jaundice there is yellowing of both the skin and the whites of the eyes. Xanthosis is associated sometimes with malignancies.
Xen- (prefix),"Xen- (prefix): Foreign or other. As in: The origin of ""xen-"" is from the Late Latin, from Greek, from ""xenos"" meaning stranger, guest, or host. Xen- and xeno- are variant forms of the same prefix."
Xeno- (prefix),"Xeno- (prefix): Foreign or other. As in: The origin of ""xeno-"" is from the Late Latin, from Greek, from ""xenos"" meaning stranger, guest, or host. Xeno- and xen- are variant forms of the same prefix."
Xenograft,"Xenograft: A surgical graft of tissue from one species to an unlike species (or genus or family). A graft from a baboon to a human is a xenograft. The prefix ""xeno-"" means foreign. It comes from the Greek word ""xenos"" meaning stranger, guest, or host. (Xeno- and xen- are variant forms of the same prefix.)"
Xero-,"Xero-: Prefix indicating dryness, as in xeroderma (dry skin)."
Xeroderma Pigmentosum,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is a genetic disease characterized by such extraordinary sensitivity to sunlight that it results in the development of skin cancer at a very early age. It is abbreviated as XP. Children with XP disease can only play outdoors safely after nightfall. XP is due to defective repair of damage done to DNA by ultraviolet (UV) light. Whereas normal people can repair UV-induced damage by inserting new bases into the DNA, people with XP cannot. A person with XP develops severe sunburn and eye irritation within minutes of exposure to sunlight. Other features of XP include very dry skin (xeroderma), blisters on the skin, heavy freckling, and dark spots on the skin. XP is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Defects in multiple genes have been identified that lead to XP. Avoiding UV light and using the highest level of sunscreen possible when exposure cannot be avoided helps prevent complications."
Xerosis,"Xerosis: Abnormal dryness of the skin, mucous membranes, or conjunctiva (xerophthalmia). There are many causes of xerosis, and treatment depends on the particular cause."
Xerostomia,"Xerostomia: Dry mouth. Xerostomia can be associated with systemic diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis; and it can be a side effect of medication and poor dental hygiene. Xerostomia results from inadequate function of the salivary glands, such as the parotid glands. Treatment involves adequate intake of water, use of artificial saliva, and good dental care. Untreated, severe dry mouth can lead to increased levels of tooth decay and thrush."
XRT,XRT: Medical abbreviation for radiotherapy.
XX,XX: The sex chromosome complement of a normal human female. See also X chromosome.
XX male syndrome,"XX male syndrome: A syndrome characterized by the presence of an XX sex chromosome complement in an individual with male genitalia including both testes but no sperm production (azoospermia). Babies with the XX male syndrome may come to medical attention at birth because of hypospadias (urethral opening not at its normal position at the end of the penis) or because of cryptorchidism (undescended testes). However, most individuals with the syndrome have a normal penis and their testes in the scrotum and do not come to medical attention until after puberty and only then perhaps because of the small size of their testes, gynecomastia (breast development in an apparent male), or sterility resulting from the azoospermia. Some but not all individuals with the syndrome have SRY, the gene normally found on the Y chromosome that makes for malesness. This is often due to an abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in presence of the SRY gene on the X chromosome and infertility. It may also be due to translocation of SRY to an autosome (a non-sex chromosome). The X/autosome translocation can occur de novo (be new) or be inherited from a parent. The XX male syndrome is also called de la Chapelle syndrome after the Finnish physician Albert de la Chapelle who first described it."
XXX syndrome,"XXX syndrome: A chromosome condition present in 1 in 1000 females, due to the presence of three X chromosomes rather than the usual two. The condition is associated with increased height but no malformations. Intelligence ranges from above normal to mild retardation. The average IQ is 85 to 90. Learning problems may be helped by early special education. Also known as triple X; triplo-X."
Y-linked inheritance,"Y-linked inheritance: Inheritance of genes on the Y chromosome. Since only males normally have a Y chromosome, Y-linked genes can only be transmitted from father to son. Y-linked inheritance is also called holandric inheritance. A number of genes were are known to be Y-linked including:"
YAG laser surgery,"YAG laser surgery: The use of a YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser to do surgery. One use for a YAG laser in surgery is to punch a hole in the iris to relieve increased pressure within the eye from acute angle-closure glaucoma. In this type of glaucoma, there is a sudden (acute) increase in pressure in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye due to abrupt blockage of the normal circulation of fluid within the eye. There are other kinds of YAG laser surgery for the eye (e.g., for cataracts) and other areas of the body including the skin (e.g., to remove birth marks). YAG laser surgery is an office procedure. It is also used in some hospital procedures including laparoscopy for endometriosis."
Yawn,"Yawn: Involuntary opening of the mouth, accompanied by slowly breathing inward and then outward. Repeated yawning can be a sign of drowsiness, boredom, or depression. The yawn helps to open tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs that can collapse during shallow breathing."
Yawning,"Yawning: Involuntary opening of the mouth with respiration, breathing first inward, then outward. Yawning is often caused by the power of suggestion. Repeated yawning may be a sign of drowsiness. It can also sometimes be a sign of depression."
yd.,Yd.: Yard.
Yeast,"Yeast: A group of single-celled fungi that reproduce by budding. Most yeast are harmless (some are used in baking and brewing). Yeast is commonly present on normal human skin and in areas of moisture, such as the mouth and vagina, usually without causing any problems. However, yeast can produce disease in people. For example, the yeast Candida (once called Monilia) causes thrush (oral infection) and diaper rash in infants, fingernail infections, vaginal area infections in women after puberty, and a host of problems in patients with immune deficiency."
Yeast infection,"Yeast infection: Overgrowth of yeast can affect the skin (yeast rash), mouth (thrush), digestive tract, esophagus, vagina (vaginitis), and other parts of the body. Yeast infections occur most frequently in moist areas of the body. Although Candida albicans and other Candida yeasts are the most frequent offenders, other yeast groups are known to cause illness, primarily in immunocompromised patients. These include Torulopsis, Cryptococcus, Malassezia, and Trichosporon yeasts. Diagnosis is by observation, and can be confirmed by culturing a stool or mucosa sample, or a scraping from the affected area. Treatment is by topical or oral antifungal medications. Acidophilous, a helpful bacteria that normally helps to keep yeast in check, can also be tried in supplement form or in yogurt with live cultures. See also Candida albicans, candidiasis, thrush, yeast vaginitis, yeast rash."
Yellow fever,"Yellow fever: An acute systemic (bodywide) illness caused by a virus called a Flavivirus. In severe cases, the viral infection causes a high fever, bleeding into the skin, and necrosis (death) of cells in the kidney and liver. The damage done to the liver from the virus results in severe jaundice which yellows the skin. Hence, the ""yellow"" in ""yellow fever."" Yellow fever once ravaged port cities in the United States. (A viewer writes in: ""This disease was prevalent in the deep south, not just in the seaports. My grandparents lived through an epidemic of yellow jack in central Mississippi around 1900, and they were a long way from the seacoast."") Today yellow fever is most common in tropical areas of Africa and the Americas. The virus of yellow fever is transmitted in most cases by a bite of a mosquito. In urban settings, yellow fever may be transmitted from person to person by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In the jungle, yellow fever is transmitted from monkeys to people by mosquitoes that breed in tree-holes in the rainforests. The diagnosis of yellow fever is made by observation or, if need be, by culturing the virus from a blood sample. There is no cure for yellow fever, although antiviral medications may be tried. Non-aspirin pain relievers, rest, and rehydration with fluids decrease discomfort. The disease usually passes within a few weeks. Yellow fever can be prevented by vaccination. The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated (weakened) viral vaccine. It is recommended for people traveling to or living in tropical areas in the Americas and Africa where yellow fever occurs. Because it is a live vaccine, it should not be given to infants or people with immune-system impairment. The vaccine is based upon classic medical research done under Dr. Walter Reed. When yellow fever broke out among U.S. troops in Cuba in 1900, Dr. Reed, a member of the Army Medical Corps, headed a commission of physicians on yellow fever. They discovered that the fever was transmitted by the A?des aegypti mosquito which breeds near houses (and also transmit dengue). Reed's team later showed that the mosquito injected a virus that caused the dread disease. Sanitary engineers eradicated the mosquito and freed Cuba of yellow fever in 1902 (the year of Reed's death from appendicitis). The vaccine against yellow fever is also based on the work of Max Theiler. Dr. Theiler, from South Africa, worked at the Rockefeller Foundation (now the Rockefeller University) in New York. In 1929 Theiler contracted yellow fever (not an uncommon experience among those studying the disease) but recovered and became immune to it. The following year Theiler discovered that yellow fever can be transmitted to white mice, which are easy to handle and are available by the thousand at small cost. This was a critical finding for the production of the vaccine. In 1951, Max Theiler (1899-1972) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it."""
Zebra,"Zebra: In medicine, a very unlikely diagnostic possibility. It comes from an old saying used in teaching medical students about how to think logically in regard to the differential diagnosis: 'When you hear hoof beats, think of horses, not zebras.' For example, when someone develops a mild transient cough, a virus infection is the most logical and likely cause, and tuberculosis is a zebra."
Zeitgeber,"Zeitgeber: An environmental agent or event that provides the cue for setting or resetting a biological clock. To be synchronized with our environment, we need the input of Zeitgebers. The most important Zeitgeber in nature is light. Social factors, chemical factors and activity can also serve as Zeitgebers. Light is a so-called photic type Zeitgeber, whereas activity, for example, is called a non-photic Zeitgeber for the biological clock. Zeitgeber comes from the German Zeit, time + Geber, giver = time-giver. The term Zeitgeber was introduced into science about 1954 by Jurgen Aschoff, then the Director of the Max-Planck-Institute in Erling-Andechs, near Munich."
ZIFT,"ZIFT: Stands for zygote intrafallopian transfer, a method used to treat infertility in which an egg fertilized in vitro (outside the body) is placed into a woman's fallopian tube. This technique is one used to overcome infertility, the inability of couples to produce offspring on their own. The egg and the male sperm needed to fertilize it are harvested. Then the egg and the sperm are united in a petri dish, a multi- purpose glass or plastic container with a lid. If all goes well, the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the physicians then implant it in a fallopian tube. From there, nature takes its course, and the egg eventually is deposited by the fallopian tube into the uterus (womb) for development. A zygote is the combined cell resulting from the union of sperm and egg. A zygote develops into an embryo. An embryo, a mass of cells with no recognizable human features, begins formation of a human body. After about seven or eight weeks, the embryo exhibits recognizable features such as a mouth and ears. At this stage, the developing human becomes known as a fetus. The word ""zygote"" is derived from the Greek word ""zygon"" (yoke). The term ""intrafallopian"" means ""inside the fallopian tubes."" (""Intra,"" a Latin word, means ""within"" or ""inside."") Thus, the term ""zygote intrafallopian transfer"" refers to the transfer of a zygote into a fallopian tube."
Zinc,"Zinc: A mineral that is essential to the body and is a constituent of many enzymes that permit chemical reactions to proceed at normal rates. Zinc is involved in the manufacture of protein (protein synthesis) and in cell division. Zinc is also a constituent of insulin, and it is involved with the sense of smell. Food sources of zinc include meat, particularly liver and seafood; eggs; nuts; and cereal grains."
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: A rare disorder caused by a tumor called a gastrinoma, most often occurring in the pancreas. The tumor secretes the hormone gastrin, which causes increased production of gastric acid leading to severe recurrent ulcers of the esophagus, stomach, and the upper portions of the small intestine (the duodenum and jejunum). Gastrinomas resulting in the Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome are not limited to the pancreas but may also occur in the stomach, duodenum, spleen and lymph nodes. The treatment of the Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome includes the use of H2 antagonists (for example cimetidine [brand name: Tagamet] and ranitidine [Zantac]) and the proton pump inhibitors (for example, lansoprazole [Prevacid] and omeprazole [Prilosec]). The H2 antagonists block the action of histamine on stomach cells, thus reducing stomach acid production. The proton pump inhibitors also block the production of acid by the stomach cells. Proton pump inhibitors are more effective than H2 antagonists in suppressing acid and have to be used in very high doses. Surgical removal of the tumor is curative in about 25% of cases. The syndrome is named for two American surgeons Robert M. Zollinger (1903-1992) and Edwin H. Ellison (1918-1970)."
Zolmitriptan,Zolmitriptan: A triptan drug for the treatment of migraine. Marketed under the brand name Zomig.
Zomig,"Zomig: Brand name for zolmitriptan, a triptan drug for the treatment of migraine."
Zona,"Zona: 1. A synonym for shingles. 2. Any zone or encircling area. 3. Any area with a specific boundary. Zona, Latin for a girdle, is a synonym for shingles because it can appear to girdle part of the body."
Zona pellucida,"Zona pellucida: The strong membrane that forms around an ovum as it develops in the ovary. The membrane remains in place during the egg's travel through the fallopian tube. To fertilize the egg, a sperm must penetrate the thinning zona pellucida. If fertilization takes place, the zona pellucida disappears, to permit implantation in the uterus."
Zoonotic,"Zoonotic: Pertaining to a zoonosis: a disease that can be transmitted from animals to people or, more specifically, a disease that normally exists in animals but that can infect humans. There are multitudes of zoonotic diseases. Some examples include: Zoonoses may appear suddenly and be relatively virulent, as illustrated by HIV which ignited the AIDS epidemic and the coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of SARS."
Zoophilia,Zoophilia: A sexual disorder involving an erotic attraction to animals or an abnormal desire to have sexual contact with animals. Zoophilia is one form of paraphilia (deviant sexual behavior).
Zovirax,Zovirax: Brand name of Acyclovir.
Zygoma,"Zygoma: The bone that forms the prominence of the cheek. Also known as zygomatic bone, zygomatic arch, malar bone, and yoke bone."
Zygomatic bone,"Zygomatic bone: The part of the temporal bone of the skull that forms the prominence of the cheek. The zygomatic bone is also known as the zygomatic arch, the zygoma, the malar bone, the cheek bone and the yoke bone. The word ""zygomatic"" comes from the Greek ""zygon"" meaning a yoke or crossbar by which two draft animals such as oxen could be hitched to a plow or wagon."
Zygote,"Zygote: The cell formed by the union of a male sex cell (a sperm) and a female sex cell (an ovum). The zygote develops into the embryo following the instruction encoded in its genetic material, the DNA. The unification of a sperm and an ovum to form a zygote constitutes fertilization."
Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT),"Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT): A technique in which a woman's egg is fertilized outside the body, then implanted in one of her fallopian tubes.
