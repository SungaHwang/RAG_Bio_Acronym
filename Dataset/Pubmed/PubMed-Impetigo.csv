37843341,"Single-center, prospective, and observational study on the management and treatment of impetigo in a pediatric population.","OBJECTIVE: Ozenoxacin is a new antibiotic used to treat non-bullous impetigo. The aim of this study is to evaluate the microbiological and clinical efficacy of topical ozenoxacin 1% cream after 5-day twice-daily treatment, in pediatric patients with impetigo.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational and prospective study included patients aged 6 months to 18 years, with non-bullous impetigo. Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) and microbiological culture at the first visit (T0), at the second visit after 72 hours (T1) and after 5 days (T2). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients was enrolled. A reduction of SIRS score >10% after 72 hours of treatment was noticed in all patients, while a complete reduction was assessed after 5 days in all the population. Microbiologic success rates for ozenoxacin at T1 was 92% (four patients had original pathogens in the specimen culture from the skin area), whereas at T2, it was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical ozenoxacin has strong efficacy in treating impetigo in pediatric patients. Ozenoxacin's clinical and microbiological rapid onset of response led to consider this antibiotic a novel efficacy option for the treatment of impetigo.","['Gatto A', 'Capossela L', 'Ferretti S', 'Di Sarno L', 'Oliveti A', 'Talamonti D', 'Curatola A', 'Chiaretti A', 'Fiori B']",2023,27,19,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Gatto A, et al.

37755904,Impetiginous Cutaneous Leishmaniasis after COVID-19 Infection in a Patient with Poor Cardiac Profile: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence has been rising in the past couple of decades. Standard therapy often includes antileishmanial drugs; however, due to their low safety and toxicity threshold, alternative treatments are being investigated. The association between COVID-19 and cutaneous leishmaniasis remains unclear and exploring this connection may offer crucial insights into the pathophysiology of and treatment strategies for infected patients. In this article, we describe a case of a male patient with a history of cardiac and other comorbidities who presented with cutaneous leishmaniasis in the form of impetigo-like skin lesions after being infected with COVID-19. Due to the patient's poor cardiac profile, sodium stibogluconate was not used and an alternative therapeutic approach was employed. The patient was treated with oral terbinafine, cryotherapy on specific lesions, and a course of cephalexin. Following the course of treatment and subsequent follow-up, the patient exhibited complete resolution and healing of the lesions with scarring, and no active lesions or recurrence were observed. This case highlights the potential for alternative treatment strategies for cutaneous leishmaniasis in patients with comorbidities and emphasizes the importance of further research to better understand the link between COVID-19 and cutaneous leishmaniasis.","['Alotaibi H', 'Aldossari A', 'Alnasser S']",2023,8,9,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Alotaibi H, et al.

37599641,Managing the deteriorating child with suspected group A Streptococcus infection.,"Group A Streptococcus bacteria can cause various pyogenic infections such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis and pneumonia. Most group A Streptococcus infections in children are mild and respond positively to treatment with antibiotics. However, some children develop severe infection accompanied by complications such as sepsis and will require urgent treatment, which may include non-invasive or invasive ventilation and the administration of fluids and vasoactive agents. In some instances, for example if there are no beds available in the paediatric intensive care unit, these interventions may be undertaken in a ward setting. This article gives an overview of group A Streptococcus infection, including two rare but severe complications, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotising fasciitis. It uses a fictionalised case study to examine the management of the deteriorating child with suspected group A Streptococcus infection, including respiratory support, haemodynamic support and symptom management.","['Kempsell-Smith M', 'Fitzsimons C']",2023,,,Nurs Child Young People,Kempsell-Smith M and Fitzsimons C.

37424680,"Culturally supported health promotion to See, Treat, Prevent (SToP) skin infections in Aboriginal children living in the Kimberley region of Western Australia: a qualitative analysis.","BACKGROUND: While there are many skin infections, reducing the burden of scabies and impetigo for remote living Aboriginal people, particularly children remains challenging. Aboriginal children living in remote communities have experienced the highest reported rate of impetigo in the world and are 15 times more likely to be admitted to hospital with a skin infection compared to non-Aboriginal children. Untreated impetigo can develop into serious disease and may contribute to the development of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). As the largest organ protecting the body and visible to everyone, skin infections are often unsightly and very painful, therefore maintaining healthy skin and reducing the burden of skin infections is important for overall physical and cultural health and well-being. Biomedical treatments alone will not address these factors; therefore, a holistic, strengths-based approach that aligns with the Aboriginal world view of wellness is required to help reduce the prevalence of skin infections and their downstream consequences.
METHODS: Culturally appropriate yarning sessions with community members were conducted between May 2019 and November 2020. Yarning sessions have been identified as a valid method for story sharing and collecting information. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and focus groups with school and clinic staff were conducted. When consent was provided, interviews were audio-recorded and saved as a digital recording in a de-identified format; for those yarning sessions not recorded, handwritten notes were scribed. Audio recordings and handwritten notes were uploaded into NVivo software prior to a thematic analysis being conducted.
FINDINGS: Overall, there was a strong knowledge of recognition, treatment, and prevention of skin infections. However, this did not extend to the role skin infections play in causing ARF, RHD or kidney failure. Our study has confirmed three main findings: 1. The biomedical model of treatment of skin infections remained strong in interviews with staff living in the communities; 2. Community members have a reliance and belief in traditional remedies for skin infections; and 3. Ongoing education for skin infections using culturally appropriate health promotion resources.
INTERPRETATION: While this study revealed ongoing challenges with service practices and protocols associated with treating and preventing skin infections in a remote setting, it also provides unique insights requiring further investigation. Bush medicines are not currently practiced in a clinic setting, however, using traditional medicines alongside biomedical treatment procedures facilitates cultural security for Aboriginal people. Further investigation, and advocacy to establish these into practice, procedures and protocols is warranted. Establishing protocols and practice procedures focused on improving collaborations between service providers and community members in remote communities is also recommended.

37358399,Persistence of the Staphylococcus aureus epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC) in Belgium.,"OBJECTIVES: In August 2018, a public health alert was issued in Belgium regarding clusters of impetigo cases caused by the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC) of Staphylococcus aureus. As a result, the Belgian national reference centre (NRC) was commissioned to update the epidemiology of S. aureus causing community-onset skin and soft tissues infection (CO-SSTI) to assess the proportion of EEFIC among them.
METHODS: For 1 year, Belgian clinical laboratories were asked to send their first three S. aureus isolated from CO-SSTI each month. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to oxacillin, mupirocin and fusidic acid. Resistant isolates were also spa typed and tested for the presence of the genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, the toxic shock syndrome toxin and the exfoliatins A and B. MLST clonal complexes were deduced from the spa types.
RESULTS: Among the 518 S. aureus strains analysed, 487 (94.0%) were susceptible to oxacillin. Of these, 79 (16.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid, of which 38 (48.1%) belonged to the EEFIC. EEFIC isolates were mostly isolated from young patients with impetigo and showed a seasonal late summer peak.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the persistence of EEFIC in Belgium. Furthermore, its prevalence may lead to reconsideration of the treatment guidelines for impetigo.","['Deplano A', 'Hallin M', 'Bustos Sierra N', 'Michel C', 'Prevost B', 'Martiny D', 'Yin N']",2023,78,8,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Deplano A, et al.

37317717,Pustular psoriasis: A distinct aetiopathogenic and clinical entity.,"Pustular psoriasis is a distinct subset of psoriasis that presents with involvement of the skin in the form of sterile pustules along with systemic manifestations. Though it has been conventionally grouped under the umbrella of psoriasis, recent research has shed light on its pathogenetic mechanisms associated with the IL-36 pathway, which is distinct from conventional psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis in itself is a heterogeneous entity consisting of various subtypes, including generalized, localized, acute, and chronic forms. There is confusion regarding its current classification as entities like deficiency of IL-36 antagonist (DITRA) which are closely related to pustular psoriasis both in their pathogenetic mechanism and its clinical manifestations, are not included under pustular psoriasis. Entities like palmoplantar pustulosis, which presents with similar clinical features but is pathogenetically distinct from other forms of pustular psoriasis, are included under this condition. Management of pustular psoriasis depends upon its severity; while some of the localized variants can be managed with topical therapy alone, the generalized variants like Von Zumbusch disease and impetigo herpetiformis may need intensive care unit admission and tailor-made treatment protocols. The advent of newer biologics and better insight into the pathogenesis of pustular psoriasis has opened the way for newer therapies, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, interleukin-17 inhibitors, and granulocyte monocyte apheresis. It continues to be an enigma whether pustular psoriasis is actually a variant of psoriasis or an entirely different disease entity, though we feel that it is an entirely different disease process.","['Vasudevan B', 'Das P', 'Bhatt S']",2023,,,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"Vasudevan B, et al.

We used the model to analyse six strategic scenarios. Based on Strep A vaccine introduction between 2022 and 2034 for the primary scenario, we estimated vaccination at birth for 30 vaccinated cohorts could avert 2.5 billion episodes of pharyngitis, 354 million episodes of impetigo, 1.4 million episodes of invasive disease, 24 million episodes of cellulitis, and 6 million cases of rheumatic heart disease globally. Vaccination impact in terms of burden averted per fully vaccinated individual is highest in North America for cellulitis and in Sub-Saharan Africa for rheumatic heart disease.","['Giannini F', 'Cannon JW', 'Cadarette D', 'Bloom DE', 'Moore HC', 'Carapetis J', 'Abbas K']",2023,8,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Giannini F, et al.

37298007,Burden of Disease and Unmet Needs in the Diagnosis and Management of Atopic Dermatitis in Diverse Skin Types in Australia.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting Australians of all ages, races, ethnicities, and social classes. Significant physical, psychosocial, and financial burdens to both individuals and Australian communities have been demonstrated. This narrative review highlights knowledge gaps for AD in Australian skin of colour. We searched PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Library databases for review articles, systematic reviews, and cross-sectional and observational studies relating to AD in Australia for skin of colour and for different ethnicities. Statistical data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Statistics was collected. In recent years, there has been substantially increased awareness of and research into skin infections, such as scabies and impetigo, among various Australian subpopulations. Many such infections disproportionately affect First Nations Peoples. However, data for AD itself in these groups are limited. There is also little written regarding AD in recent, racially diverse immigrants with skin of colour. Areas for future research include AD epidemiology and AD phenotypes for First Nations Peoples and AD trajectories for non-Caucasian immigrants. We also note the evident disparity in both the level of understanding and the management standards of AD between urban and remote communities in Australia. This discrepancy relates to a relative lack of healthcare resources in marginalised communities. First Nations Peoples in particular experience socioeconomic disadvantage, have worse health outcomes, and experience healthcare inequality in Australia. Barriers to effective AD management must be identified and responsibly addressed for socioeconomically disadvantaged and remote-living communities to achieve healthcare equity.","['Courtney A', 'Lopez DJ', 'Lowe AJ', 'Holmes Z', 'Su JC']",2023,12,11,J Clin Med,"Courtney A, et al.

37288267,The rise and fall of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: a mini review.,"INTRODUCTION: The incidences of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which were leading causes of death in children in the 1920s, have decreased substantially. Considering the recent resurgence of scarlet fever and increased incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis in children, an investigation of the current status of ARF and RHD may be worthwhile.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the prevalence trends, pathogenic factors, and prevention strategies for ARF and RHD in children.
METHODS: A selective search of literature published between January 1920 and February 2023 was done in PubMed, using the terms ""acute rheumatic fever"", ""rheumatic heart disease"", ""group A 
RESULTS: Overcrowded homes and inadequate sanitation led to recurrent group A streptococcal infection, and the causal relationship between group A streptococcal infection and ARF/RHD was well established. Streptococcal infectious diseases, such as group A streptococcal pharyngeal tonsillitis, SF, impetigo, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, were associated with the occurrence of ARF and RHD. ARF and RHD were still prevalent in young people of developing countries and economically poor populations of high-income countries. Universal disease registration systems were critical to locating disease outbreaks, tracking disease transmission, and identifying high-risk populations. Four-level prevention strategies were effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of ARF and RHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Registry and preventive measures for ARF and RHD should be strengthened in areas of dense population; poor sanitation; resurgence of SF; and high incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis, impetigo, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.","['Liang Y', 'Yu D', 'Lu Q', 'Zheng Y', 'Yang Y']",2023,10,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Liang Y, et al.

37258964,Methods to Analyze the Contribution of Complement Evasion Factor (CEF) to Streptococcus pyogenes Virulence.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is an exclusively human pathogen that causes a range of diseases, including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, impetigo, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome. Post-streptococcal sequelae include acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. The bacterium produces a large arsenal of virulence factors that contribute to host tissue adhesion/colonization, bacterial spread, and host immune evasion. Immune evasion factors include proteins that interfere with complement, a system of plasma proteins that are activated by pathogens resulting in a variety of reactions on the surface of the pathogen. This leads to the activation of active components with a variety of effector functions, such as cell lysis, opsonization, and chemotaxis of phagocytes to the site of infection. We have recently identified a novel ""complement evasion factor"" (CEF) in S. pyogenes. CEF directly interacts with complement proteins C1r, C1s, C3, and C5, interrupts all three complement pathways, and prevents opsonization of the bacterial surface with C3b. We here present methods used to analyze the complement interference of CEF.","['Aghababa H', 'Loh JMS', 'Proft T']",2023,2674,,Methods Mol Biol,"Aghababa H, et al.

37248678,A Case Report of Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis: Diagnostic Approach and Treatment.,"BACKGROUND Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small-vessel vasculitis associated with infections, autoimmune disorders, and certain drugs, but it may also be idiopathic. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 37-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented with a chief concern of a full-body rash. Before the rash appeared, she had been treated for group A Streptococcus with amoxicillin and prednisone. An outpatient skin biopsy revealed findings concerning for early leukocytoclastic vasculitis. On admission, she had a diffuse palpable rash on the trunk and upper and lower extremities. Laboratory test results were notable for neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift, reticulocytosis with normal hemoglobin, thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR and CRP. An infectious diseases workup was negative, serum levels of complement C3 and C4 were normal, and no evidence of hemolysis was found on blood smear. Results of schistocytes review, LDH, and haptoglobin were not consistent with hemolysis, and IgG, IgA, and IgM were all within normal limits. The patient was initially started on antibiotics due to concern for bullous impetigo, but the treatment regimen was changed to steroids because IgA vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were suspected. Biopsy results were received 1 week later and did not reveal definitive findings of acute leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Staining with antibodies to human IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, fibrinogen, and albumin was negative. CONCLUSIONS Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be triggered by penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, and allopurinol acting as haptens and stimulating an immune response, resulting in development of vasculitis.","['Strubchevska K', 'Kozyk M', 'Balanescu DV']",2023,24,,Am J Case Rep,"Strubchevska K, et al.

37211022,"Evaluating the role of asymptomatic throat carriage of Streptococcus pyogenes in impetigo transmission in remote Aboriginal communities in Northern Territory, Australia: a retrospective genomic analysis.","BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), infections contribute to a high burden of disease in Aboriginal Australians, causing skin infections and immune sequelae such as rheumatic heart disease. Controlling skin infections in these populations has proven difficult, with transmission dynamics being poorly understood. We aimed to identify the relative contributions of impetigo and asymptomatic throat carriage to GAS transmission.
METHODS: In this genomic analysis, we retrospectively applied whole genome sequencing to GAS isolates that were collected as part of an impetigo surveillance longitudinal household survey conducted in three remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory of Australia between Aug 6, 2003, and June 22, 2005. We included GAS isolates from all throats and impetigo lesions of people living in two of the previously studied communities. We classified isolates into genomic lineages based on pairwise shared core genomes of more than 99% with five or fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms. We used a household network analysis of epidemiologically and genomically linked lineages to quantify the transmission of GAS within and between households.
FINDINGS: We included 320 GAS isolates in our analysis: 203 (63%) from asymptomatic throat swabs and 117 (37%) from impetigo lesions. Among 64 genomic lineages (encompassing 39 emm types) we identified 264 transmission links (involving 93% of isolates), for which the probable source was asymptomatic throat carriage in 166 (63%) and impetigo lesions in 98 (37%). Links originating from impetigo cases were more frequent between households than within households. Households were infected with GAS for a mean of 57 days (SD 39 days), and once cleared, reinfected 62 days (SD 40 days) later. Increased household size and community presence of GAS and scabies were associated with slower clearance of GAS.
INTERPRETATION: In communities with high prevalence of endemic GAS-associated skin infection, asymptomatic throat carriage is a GAS reservoir. Public health interventions such as vaccination or community infection control programmes aimed at interrupting transmission of GAS might need to include consideration of asymptomatic throat carriage.

37202027,"The impact of ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine citrate, and albendazole mass drug administration on the prevalence of scabies and soil-transmitted helminths in school-aged children in three municipalities in Timor-Leste: a before-after assessment.","BACKGROUND: Integrated programmes that use combination mass drug administration (MDA) might improve control of multiple neglected tropical diseases simultaneously. We investigated the impact of Timor-Leste's national ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine citrate, and albendazole MDA, for lymphatic filariasis elimination and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) control, on scabies, impetigo, and STH infections.
METHODS: We did a before-after study in six primary schools across three municipalities in Timor-Leste (urban [Dili], semi-urban [Ermera], and rural [Manufahi]) before (April 23 to May 11, 2019) and 18 months after (Nov 9 to Nov 27, 2020) MDA delivery between May 17 and June 1, 2019. Study participants included schoolchildren, as well as infants, children, and adolescents who were incidentally present at school on study days. All schoolchildren whose parents provided consent were eligible to participate in the study. Infants, children, and adolescents younger than 19 years who were not enrolled in the school but were incidentally present at schools on study days were also eligible to participate if their parents consented. Ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine citrate, and albendazole MDA was implemented nationally, with single doses of oral ivermectin (200 μg/kg), diethylcarbamazine citrate (6 mg/kg), and albendazole (400 mg) administered by the Ministry of Health. Scabies and impetigo were assessed by clinical skin examinations, and STHs using quantitative PCR. The primary (cluster-level) analysis adjusted for clustering while the secondary (individual-level) analysis adjusted for sex, age, and clustering. The primary outcomes of the study were prevalence ratios for scabies, impetigo, and STHs (Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, and moderate-to-heavy A lumbricoides infections) between baseline and 18 months from the cluster-level analysis.
FINDINGS: At baseline, 1043 (87·7%) of 1190 children registered for the study underwent clinical assessment for scabies and impetigo. The mean age of those who completed skin examinations was 9·4 years (SD 2·4) and 514 (53·8%) of 956 were female (87 participants with missing sex data were excluded from this percentage calculation). Stool samples were received for 541 (45·5%) of 1190 children. The mean age of those for whom stool samples were received was 9·8 years (SD 2·2) and 300 (55·5%) were female. At baseline, 348 (33·4%) of 1043 participants had scabies, and 18 months after MDA, 133 (11·1%) of 1196 participants had scabies (prevalence ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·18-0·88; p=0·020) in the cluster-level analysis. At baseline, 130 (12·5%) of 1043 participants had impetigo, compared with 27 (2·3%) of 1196 participants at follow-up (prevalence ratio 0·14, 95% CI 0·07-0·27; p<0·0001). There was a significant reduction in T trichiura prevalence from baseline (26 [4·8%] of 541 participants) to 18-month follow-up (four [0·6%] of 623 participants; prevalence ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·04-0·66; p<0·0001). In the individual-level analysis, moderate-to-heavy A lumbricoides infections reduced from 54 (10·0%; 95% CI 0·7-19·6) of 541 participants to 28 (4·5%, 1·2-8·4) of 623 participants (relative reduction 53·6%; 95% CI 9·1-98·1; p=0·018).
INTERPRETATION: Ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine citrate, and albendazole MDA was associated with substantial reductions in prevalence of scabies, impetigo, and T trichiura, and of moderate-to-heavy intensity A lumbricoides infections. Combination MDA could be used to support integrated control programmes to target multiple NTDs.

37188693,Global economic burden per episode for multiple diseases caused by group A Streptococcus.,"Considering the lack of existing evidence on economic burden for diseases caused by group A Streptococcus, we estimated the economic burden per episode for selected diseases. Each cost component of direct medical costs (DMCs), direct non-medical costs (DNMCs), and indirect costs (ICs) was separately extrapolated and aggregated to estimate the economic burden per episode by income group as classified by the World Bank. Adjustment factors for DMC and DNMC were generated to overcome related data insufficiencies. To address uncertainty surrounding input parameters, a probabilistic multivariate sensitivity was carried out. The average economic burden per episode ranged from $22 to $392 for pharyngitis, $25 to $2,903 for impetigo, $47 to $2,725 for cellulitis, $662 to $34,330 for invasive and toxin-mediated infections, $231 to $6,332 for acute rheumatic fever (ARF), $449 to $11,717 for rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and $949 to $39,560 for severe RHD across income groups.

37182563,Phenotypic and Endotypic Determinants of Atopic Dermatitis Severity From the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a highly variable clinical phenotype.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify historical and clinical features and biomarkers associated with AD severity.
METHODS: A US registry of extensively phenotyped AD participants (aged 0.73-80 years) were enrolled at 9 academic centers. Information on family and personal medical history, examination, skin swabs (culture), and serum biomarkers was collected to evaluate their association with AD severity.
RESULTS: Participants with AD (N = 2862) whose disease was categorized as mild (11.6%), moderate (58.0%), or severe (30.4%) based on Rajka-Langeland scoring were enrolled. The trend test, when adjusting for gender, race, and age, demonstrated that severity was strongly (P ≤ .04) associated with a personal/family history of allergic disorders, history of alopecia, exposure to passive smoke, ocular herpes infection, skin bacterial and viral infections, and history of arrhythmia. Features observed more frequently (P ≤ .002), as a function of severity, included skin infections (impetigo, human papillomavirus, and molluscum contagiosum virus), Staphylococcus aureus colonization, excoriations, hyperlinear palms, ichthyosis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, ectropion, and wheezing. Serum IgE, allergen and food (≤6 years) Phadiatop, and eosinophilia were strongly linked to severity (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse US AD population, severity was associated with a history of atopic disorders, skin and extracutaneous bacterial and viral infections (by history and physical examination), higher IgE, eosinophilia and allergen sensitization, atopic skin manifestations (ie, excoriation, hyperlinear palms, and ichthyosis), and atopic ocular features (ie, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and ectropion) as well as asthma findings (ie, wheezing).

OBJECTIVES: To compare pediatric department admission rates from the pediatric emergency department (PED) of refugees and Israelis.
METHODS: We compared data from refugee and Israeli children admitted to the pediatric department at Wolfson Medical Center in Israel between 2013-2017.
RESULTS: A total of 104,244 patients (aged 0-18 years) came to the PED. Admission rate to the pediatric department for refugees was 695/2541 (27%) compared to 11,858/101,703 (11.7%) Israeli patients (P < 0.001). Hospital stay for patients 0-2-years of age was 3.22 ± 4.80 days for refugees vs. 2.78 ± 3.17 for Israelis (P < 0.03). Re-admission rate within 7 days was 1.3% for refugees and 2.6% for Israelis (P < 0.05). Dermatological diseases (e.g., impetigo and cellulitis) were more frequent in refugees (23.30% vs. 13.15%, P < 0.01); however, acute gastroenteritis and respiratory diagnoses were more common in Israelis (18.52% vs. 11.72%, P < 0.05 and 14.84% vs. 6.26%, P < 0.01, respectively). Neurological diseases (e.g., febrile convulsions) were also more frequent in Israelis (7.7% vs. 3%, P < 0.05). Very significantly, 23% of refugees had no healthcare coverage, while only 0.2% of the Israelis had none (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found significant morbidity in refugees compared to the local Israeli pediatric population, highlighting the need for different approaches for each population.","['Oziri A', 'Schnapper M', 'Ovadia A', 'Abiri S', 'Meirson G', 'Brantz I', 'Blass Oziri O', 'Tasher D', 'Mandelberg A', 'Dalal I']",2023,25,4,Isr Med Assoc J,"Oziri A, et al.

This review examines the recent literature on the management of Staphylococcal infections that involve neonatal skin, discussing the most appropriate clinical approach to four cases of neonatal blistering diseases with Staphylococcal infections: a case of Staphylococcal bullous impetigo, a case of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), a case of epidermolysis bullosa with overlapping Staphylococcal infection, and a case of burns with overlapping Staphylococcal infection. In treating Staphylococcal infections involving skin in neonates, the presence or absence of systemic symptoms should be considered. In the lack of evidence-based guidelines in this age category, treatment should be individualized according to several factors including the extension of the disease or further skin comorbidities (such as skin fragility), with a multidisciplinary approach.","['De Rose DU', 'Pugnaloni F', 'Martini L', 'Bersani I', 'Ronchetti MP', 'Diociaiuti A', 'El Hachem M', 'Dotta A', 'Auriti C']",2023,12,4,Antibiotics (Basel),"De Rose DU, et al.

37100956,Topical Nanotherapeutics for Treating MRSA-Associated Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTIs).,"The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) imposes a major challenge for the treatment of infectious diseases with existing antibiotics. MRSA associated with superficial skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) is one of them, affecting the skin's superficial layers, and it includes impetigo, folliculitis, cellulitis, furuncles, abscesses, surgical site infections, etc. The efficient care of superficial SSTIs caused by MRSA necessitates local administration of antibiotics, because oral antibiotics does not produce the required concentration at the local site. The topical administration of nanocarriers has been emerging in the area of drug delivery due to its advantages over conventional topical formulation. It enhances the solubility and permeation of the antibiotics into deeper layer of the skin. Apart from this, antibiotic resistance is something that needs to be combated on multiple fronts, and antibiotics encapsulated in nanocarriers help to do so by increasing the therapeutic efficacy in a number of different ways. The current review provides an overview of the resistance mechanism in S. aureus as well as various nanocarriers reported for the effective management of MRSA-associated superficial SSTIs.","['Karnam S', 'Jindal AB', 'Agnihotri C', 'Singh BP', 'Paul AT']",2023,24,5,AAPS PharmSciTech,"Karnam S, et al.

In this article, we outline the recommended strategies for Strep A treatment and prevention and review the literature for economic evaluations of competing treatment and prevention strategies. We find that most economic evaluations focus on reducing the duration of illness or risk of rheumatic fever among people presenting with sore throat through diagnostic and/or treatment strategies. Few studies have evaluated strategies to reduce the burden of Strep A infection among the general population, nor have they considered the local capacity to finance and implement strategies. Evaluation of validated costs and consequences for a more diverse range of Strep A interventions are needed to ensure policies maximise patient outcomes under budget constraints. This should include attention to basic public health strategies and emerging strategies such as vaccination.","['Cannon JW', 'Wyber R']",2023,8,1,NPJ Vaccines,Cannon JW and Wyber R.

In about 8% of the cases, a systemic antibiotic was prescribed after the topical antimicrobial, usually after 4-14 days. In this study, ozenoxacin was used in 8% of the cases. Treatment duration was significantly shorter for patients prescribed ozenoxacin compared to the whole study population (median of six vs. seven days, respectively).

36935916,A pilot study to develop assessment tools for Group A Streptococcus surveillance studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Group A 
METHODS: Yarning circle conversations and semi-structured interviews were performed with Aboriginal caregivers and used to develop the language and composition of a sore throat checklist. The sore throat story checklist was combined with established methods of GAS pharyngitis and impetigo surveillance (examination, bacteriological culture, rapid antigen detection and serological tests) and new technologies (photography) and used for a pilot cross-sectional surveillance study of Aboriginal children attending their health clinic for a routine appointment. Feasibility, acceptability, and study costs were compiled.
RESULTS: Ten Aboriginal caregivers participated in the sore-throat yarning circles; a checklist was derived from predominant symptoms and their common descriptors. Over two days, 21 Aboriginal children were approached for the pilot surveillance study, of whom 17 were recruited; median age was 9 years [IQR 5.5-13.5], 65% were female. One child declined throat swabbing and three declined finger pricks; all other surveillance elements were completed by each child indicating high acceptability of surveillance assessments. Mean time for screening assessment was 19 minutes per child. Transport of clinical specimens enabled gold standard microbiological and serological testing for GAS. Retrospective examination of sore throat photography concorded with assessments performed on the day.
CONCLUSION: Yarning circle conversations were effective in deriving culturally appropriate sore throat questionnaires for GAS pharyngitis surveillance. New and established tools were feasible, practical and acceptable to participants and enable surveillance to determine the burden of superficial GAS infections in communities at high risk of RF. Surveillance of GAS pharyngitis and impetgio in remote Australia informs primary RF prevention with potential global translation.","['Pickering J', 'Sampson C', 'Mullane M', 'Sheel M', 'Barth DD', 'Lane M', 'Walker R', 'Atkinson D', 'Carapetis JR', 'Bowen AC']",2023,11,,PeerJ,"Pickering J, et al.

36930667,One versus two doses of ivermectin-based mass drug administration for the control of scabies: A cluster randomised non-inferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA) based on two doses of ivermectin, one week apart, substantially reduces prevalence of both scabies and impetigo. The Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial assessed whether one-dose ivermectin-based MDA would be as effective.
METHODS: RISE was a cluster-randomised trial in Solomon Islands. We assigned 20 villages in a 1:1 ratio to one- or two-dose ivermectin-based MDA. We planned to test whether the impact of one dose on scabies prevalence at 12 and 24 months was non-inferior to two, at a 5% non-inferiority margin.
RESULTS: We deferred endpoint assessment to 21 months due to COVID-19. We enrolled 5239 participants in 20 villages at baseline and 3369 at 21 months from an estimated population of 5500. At baseline scabies prevalence was similar in the two arms (one-dose 17·2%; two-dose 13·2%). At 21 months, there was no reduction in scabies prevalence (one-dose 18·7%; two-dose 13·4%), and the confidence interval around the difference included values substantially greater than 5%. There was however a reduction in prevalence among those who had been present at the baseline assessment (one-dose 15·9%; two-dose 10·8%). Additionally, we found a reduction in both scabies severity and impetigo prevalence in both arms, to a similar degree.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no indication of an overall decline in scabies prevalence in either arm. The reduction in scabies prevalence in those present at baseline suggests that the unexpectedly high influx of people into the trial villages, likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have compromised the effectiveness of the MDA. Despite the lack of effect there are important lessons to be learnt from this trial about conducting MDA for scabies in high prevalence settings.

The profile of patients seeking non-COVID medical care has changed significantly because of the pandemic; this includes dermatological emergencies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate and compare adult dermatological emergency consultations during the COVID-19 period with the pre-pandemic period.
METHODS: Consulted patients from ED to dermatology between March 11, 2019, and March 11, 2021 were included (Pre-pandemic and pandemic). Age, gender, zone of triage, consultation hour, consultation date, consultation response time, ICD-10 codes were recorded.
RESULTS: The total number of consultations was 639. The mean age of the patients was 44.4 in the pre-pandemic period and 46.1 in the pandemic period. The mean consultation response time was 44.4 minutes in the pre-pandemic period and 60.3 minutes in the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic period, the most common consulted diseases were herpes zoster, urticaria, and allergic contact dermatitis. During the pandemic, the most common consulted diseases were herpes zoster, other dermatitis, and urticaria. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of other dermatitis, impetigo/folliculitis, cutaneous vasculitis, and pruritus (p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Emergency departments are the busiest and fastest areas of the hospital.

36883876,Effect of Disease Severity on Comorbid Conditions in Atopic Dermatitis: Nationwide Registry-Based Investigation in Finnish Adults.,"The majority of registry studies on atopic dermatitis include only patients and diagnoses from specialized healthcare. The aim of this retrospective, real-world cohort study was to evaluate the effect of atopic dermatitis severity on comorbidities and total morbidity, with comprehensive data from both primary and specialty healthcare registries covering the entire Finnish adult population. In total, 124,038 patients were identified (median age 46 years; 68% female) and stratified by disease severity. All regression analyses (median follow-up 7.0 years) were adjusted at a minimum for age, sex, obesity, and educational level. Compared with mild atopic dermatitis, severe atopic dermatitis was significantly associated with multiple morbidities, including neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, abscesses, erysipelas/cellulitis, impetigo, herpes zoster, extragenital herpes, bacterial conjunctivitis, septicaemia, lymphomas, alopecia areata, urticaria, other dermatitis, contact allergy, osteoporosis, and intervertebral disc disorders (p < 0.001). In addition, there were significant associations with alcohol dependence, depression, condylomas, rosacea, migraine, sleep apnoea, hypertension, enthesopathies, atherosclerosis, and drug-induced cataract (p < 0.05). Odds ratios were modest and mostly were between 1.10 and 2.75. Furthermore, patients with severe atopic dermatitis had lower incidences of prostate cancer, cystitis, and anogenital herpes than patients with mild atopic dermatitis (p < 0.05). These results suggest that severe atopic dermatitis results in significant overall morbidity.","['Kiiski V', 'Ukkola-Vuoti L', 'Vikkula J', 'Ranta M', 'Lassenius MI', 'Kopra J']",2023,103,,Acta Derm Venereol,"Kiiski V, et al.

36830098,Topical Antibiotic Treatment in Dermatology.,"Many indications in dermatology can be effectively managed with topical antibiotics, including acne vulgaris, wound infections, secondarily infected dermatitis, and impetigo. Dermatologists must be familiar with the wide spectrum of topical antibiotics available, including indications, mechanisms of action, adverse events, and spectra of activity. Dermatologists must also keep antibiotic resistance in mind when utilizing these medications. Due to the widespread use of topical antibiotics and their importance in dermatology, a literature review was performed using a systematic search of PubMed and Google Scholar with the terms topical antibiotics, skin infections, dermatology, antimicrobials, and inflammatory dermatoses to identify English-language articles published between 1965-2022 from any country. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional content.

36794751,A Boy with Reset Osmostat Who Developed Chronic Hyponatremia due to Hypothalamic Injury Caused by a Giant Arachnoid Cyst.,"Reset osmostat (RO) is classified as type C among the four subtypes of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone based on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. It is characterized by a lower plasma osmolality threshold for ADH excretion when plasma sodium concentration is reduced. We report the case of a boy with RO and a giant arachnoid cyst (AC). The patient had been suspected of having AC since the fetal period, and a giant AC in the prepontine cistern was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging 7 days after birth. During the neonatal period, there were no abnormalities in the general condition or blood tests, and he was discharged from the NICU at the 27 after birth. He was born with a -2 standard deviation short stature and mild mental retardation. When he was 6 years old, he was diagnosed with infectious impetigo and had hyponatremia of 121 mmol/L. Investigations revealed normal adrenal and thyroid functions, plasma hyposmolality, high urinary sodium, and high urinary osmolality. The 5% hypertonic saline and water load tests confirmed that ADH was secreted under low sodium and osmolality conditions, and the ability to concentrate urine and excrete a standard water load; therefore, RO was diagnosed. In addition, an anterior pituitary hormone secretion stimulation test was performed, which confirmed growth hormone secretion deficiency and gonadotropin hyperreactivity. Hyponatremia was untreated, but fluid restriction and salt loading were started at age 12 because of the risk of growth obstacles. The diagnosis of RO is important from the viewpoint of clinical hyponatremia treatment options.","['Naganuma J', 'Koyama S', 'Watabe Y', 'Yoshihara S']",2023,,,J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol,"Naganuma J, et al.

36782167,"Epidemiological analysis of Group A streptococcus infection diseases among children in Beijing, China under COVID-19 pandemic.","BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus is human-restricted gram-positive pathogen, responsible for various clinical presentations from mild epidermis infections to life threatened invasive diseases. Under COVID-19 pandemic,. the characteristics of the epidemic strains of GAS could be different.
PURPOSE: To investigate epidemiological and molecular features of isolates from GAS infections among children in Beijing, China between January 2020 and December 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiling was performed based on Cinical Laboratory Sandards Institute. Distribution of macrolide-resistance genes, emm types, and superantigens was examined by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: 114 GAS isolates were collected which were frequent resistance against erythromycin (94.74%), followed by clindamycin (92.98%), tetracycline (87.72%). Emm12 (46.49%), emm1 (25.44%) were dominant emm types. Distribution of ermB, ermA, and mefA gene was 93.85%, 2.63%, and 14.04%, respectively. Frequent superantigenes identified were smeZ (97.39%), speG (95.65%), and speC (92.17%). Emm1 strains possessed smeZ, ssa, and speC, while emm12 possessed smeZ, ssa, speG, and speC. Erythromycin resistance was predominantly mediated by ermB. Scarlet fever strains harbored smeZ (98.81%), speC (94.05%). Impetigo strains harbored smeZ (88.98%), ssa (88.89%), and speC (88.89%). Psoriasis strains harbored smeZ (100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Under COVID-19 pandemic, our collections of GAS infection cutaneous diseases decreased dramatically. Epidemiological analysis of GAS infections among children during COVID-19 pandemic was not significantly different from our previous study. There was a correlation among emm, superantigen gene and disease manifestations. Long-term surveillance and investigation of emm types and superantigens of GAS prevalence are imperative.","['Li H', 'Zhou L', 'Zhao Y', 'Ma L', 'Zhang H', 'Liu Y', 'Liu X', 'Hu J']",2023,23,1,BMC Pediatr,"Li H, et al.

Computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) models trained using non-standardized conventional photo images exhibit lower performance rates than CAD models that detect lesions in a localized small area, such as dermoscopic images.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for skin image segmentation to generate a skin disease image dataset suitable for CAD of multiple skin disease classification.
METHODS: We trained a DeepLabv3 + -based CNN segmentation model to detect skin and lesion areas and segmented out areas that satisfy the following conditions: more than 80% of the image will be the skin area, and more than 10% of the image will be the lesion area.
RESULTS: The generated CNN-segmented image database was examined using CAD of skin disease classification and achieved approximately 90% sensitivity and specificity to differentiate atopic dermatitis from malignant diseases and complications, such as mycosis fungoides, impetigo, and herpesvirus infection. The accuracy of skin disease classification in the CNN-segmented image dataset was almost equal to that of the manually cropped image dataset and higher than that of the original image dataset.
CONCLUSION: Our CNN segmentation model, which automatically extracts lesions and segmented images of the skin area regardless of image fields, will reduce the burden of physician annotation and improve CAD performance.","['Yanagisawa Y', 'Shido K', 'Kojima K', 'Yamasaki K']",2023,109,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Yanagisawa Y, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Dermatology outpatient of a tertiary care hospital in Punjab province of Pakistan, from September 2020 to August 2021.
METHODOLOGY: Patients of all age groups and both genders reporting during the study period with community-associated uncomplicated bacterial skin and soft tissue infections were enrolled in the study. Samples were collected from skin lesions and cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar plates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were included in the study. Impetigo was most common infection (n=80, 51%), followed by Furunculosis (n=47, 29.9%). The frequency of MRSA isolates was 54.1% (n=85). MRSA was significantly more frequently isolated from patients with furunculous, carbuncle and cutaneous abscesses as compared to impetigo. All MRSA isolates were sensitive to linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. 97.6%, 84.7%, and 72.9% of MRSA isolates were sensitive to rifampicin, minocycline, and fusidic acid respectively. 89.4% of MRSA were sensitive to amikacin and clindamycin. 63.5% were sensitive to doxycycline and 58.8% were sensitive to co-trimoxazole. Only 20% of MRSA were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSION: The antibiotics active against CA-MRSA including rifampicin, minocycline, amikacin, and clindamycin may be used empirically in patients with furunculosis, cutaneous abscess, and carbuncles. Linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin should be reserved for severe infections.

36268416,Treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancy with systemic corticosteroid: A rare case report.,"INTRODUCTION: and importance: Generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (GPPP) is a rare dermatosis that causes maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP) is a challenging dermatological Condition, which can have impact on the life pregnant woman's and her unborn child's life.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a 26-year-old woman with a history of persistent plaque psoriasis presented with generalized pustular lesions. Ultrasonography revealed normal fetal development despite high serum ESR and CRP levels. Pustular psoriasis was confirmed by histopathology. The patients were given systemic prednisolone 32 mg once daily, which was raised to 60 mg once daily on the tenth day of treatment to manage fresh outbreaks, and the patient's rash continued to gradually improve. When the lesions faded after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose was reduced to 16 mg/day. At 31 weeks' gestation, the patient was discharged and she was kept on prednisolone at a low dose of 4 mg once daily for the duration of the pregnancy.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (GPPP), herpetiformis, is a less common form dermatosis that can be fatal for both mother and the fetus. Response to treatment is good when initiated early in the course of the disease. This present case shows young pregnant mother with GPPP successfully treated with systemic corticosteroid.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to the majority of other common pregnant dermatosis, pustular psoriasis is an uncommon condition that can have harmful effects on the fetus. Our patient's PPP symptoms included systemic ones as well as body and palm involvement. Close monitoring and administration of systemic corticosteroids ensured secure outcomes.","['Isse Ali A', 'Mohamed Abdulkadir M', 'Ali Mumin H', 'Ibrahim Aden A', 'Sheikh Hassan M']",2022,82,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Isse Ali A, et al.

This study aimed to conduct a recent epidemiological analysis of patients with pustular psoriasis who were enrolled in the JSPR from 2017 to 2020. A total of 291 patients from 131 medical institutions were enrolled, of which 47.4% (138 cases) were males and 52.6% (153 cases) were females. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the patients was 57.4 ± 20.3 years (males, 61.2 ± 17.3 years; females, 54.1 ± 22.1 years). The mean ± SD age of the patients at disease onset was 48.5 ± 22.5 years (males, 50.8 ± 20.6 years; females, 46.4 ± 24.0 years). The types of pustular psoriasis observed included the von Zumbusch type (59.8%), annular pustular psoriasis (8.2%), impetigo herpetiformis (6.5%), and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (4.8%), of which, the majority of the patients with impetigo herpetiformis were female. Among the patients, 58.4% were treated with oral medications and 44.0% were treated with biologics. The most common oral medication prescribed was etretinate (52.4%), followed by corticosteroids (24.7%) and cyclosporin (22.9%). The most common biologics used were IL-17 inhibitors (ixekizumab [28.1%] and secukinumab [22.7%]), followed by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (infliximab [15.6%]) and IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab [14.8%] and risankizumab [10.2%]).

However, the prevalence of childhood skin diseases in Japan has not been reported extensively. In this study, dermatologists conducted face-to-face examinations of primary school children over a 10-year period to determine the prevalence of each skin disease. Atopic dermatitis (AD, 12.3%) was the most common disease among first graders, followed by eczema other than AD (9.7%), molluscum contagiosum (1.9%), and verruca vulgaris (1.1%). Among sixth graders, acne vulgaris was most common (9.6%), followed by AD (8.9%), eczema other than AD (6.7%), and verruca vulgaris (3.1%). The prevalence of AD remained stable among first graders after 2010, at approximately 10%-15%, but it increased slightly among sixth graders. Of the 87 children who had AD in first grade, 51 (58.6%) were in remission in sixth grade. On the other hand, AD was diagnosed in 30 (4.5%) sixth graders who had been among the 665 children who did not have it in first grade. The more severe the symptoms were in first grade, the more likely a child was to still have AD in sixth grade, and the more severe the later symptoms tended to be. This study investigated recent trends in skin diseases in Japanese primary school children and found that the prevalence of some skin diseases differed between first and sixth graders. It was also found that children with moderate AD in first grade were more likely to be moderate in sixth grade than those with mild AD.","['Tanaka A', 'Niimi N', 'Takahashi M', 'Takahashi H', 'Nagata K', 'Nishiyama N', 'Noda H', 'Hara T', 'Maeda M', 'Mizuiri Y', 'Morikawa H', 'Yanase T', 'Yano T', 'Yamura M', 'Okano S']",2022,49,12,J Dermatol,"Tanaka A, et al.

36090737,The impact of comorbidities on the severity of atopic dermatitis in children.,"INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease. It is associated with atopy, impaired skin barrier, skin infections and several other comorbidities.
AIM: To identify comorbidities and risk factors that influence the severity of AD in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving 52 children newly diagnosed with AD. The severity of AD was assessed with the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) clinical tool. Levels of serum tryptase, zinc, selenium, and immunoglobulins A, G, M and E (IgA, IgG, IgM, and total IgE, respectively) were determined as well as allergen-specific E antibodies (IgE) to the most common allergens. DNA samples from venous blood were screened for the most common mutations in the filaggrin gene.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 30 months. The median SCORAD index in patients with atopy was 47.8, compared to 27.2 in non-atopic patients (
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD and sensitisation to common allergens, low levels of IgM or a history of impetigo are at risk for more severe disease and, therefore, need more attention, meticulous skin care, proactive management and treatment of comorbidities, when possible.","['Berce V', 'Marhold T', 'Delopst V']",2022,39,4,Postepy Dermatol Alergol,"Berce V, et al.

36073197,Optimizing Antibiotic Treatment of Skin Infections in Pediatric Emergency and Urgent Care Centers.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective was to optimize antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated skin/soft tissue infections (SSTIs) discharged from pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and urgent cares (UCs).
METHODS: Pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years discharged from 3 pediatric EDs and 8 UCs with a diagnosis of uncomplicated SSTIs were included. Optimal treatment was defined as 5 days of cephalexin for nonpurulent SSTIs and 7 days of clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for purulent SSTIs. Exclusion criteria included erysipelas, folliculitis, felon, impetigo, lymphangitis, paronychia, perianal abscess, phlegmon, preseptal or orbital cellulitis, and cephalosporin allergy. Baseline data were collected from January 2018 to June 2019. Quality improvement (QI) interventions began July 2019 with a revised SSTI guideline, discharge order set, and maintenance of certification (MOC) QI project. MOC participants received 3 education sessions, monthly group feedback, and individual scorecards. Balancing measures included return visits within 10 days requiring escalation of care. Data were monitored through March 2021.
RESULTS: In total, 9306 SSTIs were included. The MOC QI project included 50 ED and UC physicians (27% of eligible physicians). For purulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice, plus duration, increased from a baseline median of 28% to 64%. For nonpurulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice, plus duration, increased from a median of 2% to 43%. MOC participants had greater improvement than non-MOC providers (P < .010). Return visits did not significantly change pre- to postintervention, remaining <2%.
CONCLUSIONS: We improved optimal choice and reduced duration of antibiotic treatment of outpatient SSTIs. MOC participation was associated with greater improvement and was sustained after the intervention period.","['Wiltrakis SM', 'Jaggi P', 'Lu L', 'Jain S']",2022,150,4,Pediatrics,"Wiltrakis SM, et al.

36051090,Atypical Forms of Pyoderma Gangrenosum in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Report of Four Cases and Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous involvement is the second-most frequent extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) a particularly relevant form because of its frequency, morbidity, and recurrence. The limited number of clinical trials involving PG increases the challenge to gastroenterologists in the management of this condition.
CASE PRESENTATION: Four cases of atypical presentations of PG are reported. A 25-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis presented an extensive chronic ulcerative lesion on her left leg that was associated with significant bleeding; the intestinal disease was in remission under the use of azathioprine. The patient was on long-term use of 60 mg corticosteroid with no improvement in the skin disease; however, initiation of cyclosporine induced remission. In the second case, a 52-year-old woman was a carrier of Crohn's disease, with a history of partial colectomy. The patient's skin condition had evolved with a cutaneous lesion localized in the perineal region, buttocks, and colostomy pouch, simulating a case of impetigo, and this had been treated with antibiotic cycles without improvement. Lesion biopsy suggested a diagnosis of PG. Consequently, the patient was started on biological therapy with infliximab, and the PG regressed. In the third case, a 38-year-old woman with a history of pancolitis presented a picture of PG with an extensive and deep ulcerative lesion in the right breast. The lesion regressed after treatment with oral corticosteroid. The final case was a 44-year-old woman with Crohn's disease suffering from Crohn's disease pancolitis. The patient's condition evolved with a mixed pattern with pustules, bullae, and ulcerative lesions in the vulva, oral cavity, gluteus, right auricular region, scalp, and left flank, and was resolved by administration of adalimumab.
CONCLUSION: PG is an important and frequent manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, with a spectrum of clinical variants, significant morbidity, and requiring a variety of therapeutic approaches.","['Martinelli VF', 'Martinelli Barbosa P', 'Dantas de Oliveira LS', 'de Melo LALV', 'Casa Nova JM', 'de Brito CAA']",2022,15,,Int Med Case Rep J,"Martinelli VF, et al.

35945624,"The burden of bacterial skin infection, scabies and atopic dermatitis among urban-living Indigenous children in high-income countries: a protocol for a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Bacterial skin infections and scabies disproportionately affect children in resource-poor countries as well as underprivileged children in high-income countries. Atopic dermatitis is a common childhood dermatosis that predisposes to bacterial skin infection. In Australia, at any one time, almost half of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children living remotely will have impetigo, and up to one-third will also have scabies. Yet, there is a gap in knowledge of the skin infection burden for urban-living Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, as well as atopic dermatitis which may be a contributing factor. The objective of this study is to provide a global background on the burden of these disorders in Indigenous urban-living children in high-income countries. These countries share a similar history of colonisation, dispossession and subsequent ongoing negative impacts on Indigenous people.
METHODS: This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. Observational studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence data on bacterial skin infection, scabies and/or atopic dermatitis in urban-living Indigenous children in high-income countries will be included. Literature searches will be conducted in several international electronic databases (from 1990 onwards), including MEDLINE, Embase, EmCare, Web of Science and PubMed. Reference lists and citation records of all included articles will be scanned for additional relevant manuscripts. Two investigators will independently perform eligibility assessment of titles, abstract and full-text manuscripts, following which both investigators will independently extract data. Where there is disagreement, the senior author will determine eligibility. The methodological quality of selected studies will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Data will be tabulated and narratively synthesised. We expect there will be insufficient data to perform meta-analysis.
DISCUSSION: This study will identify and evaluate epidemiological data on bacterial skin infection, scabies and atopic dermatitis in urban-living Indigenous children in high-income countries. Where available, the clinical features, risk factors, comorbidities and complications of these common childhood skin disorders will be described. The evidence will highlight the burden of disease in this population, to contribute to global burden of disease estimates and identify gaps in the current literature to provide direction for future research.

RESULTS: Approximately 55% of the children were male. The mean (SD) age of children was 9.1 (2.7) years. The ULN of ASO titre for 5-15 years aged children was 217.4 IU/mL.
CONCLUSION: Our reference value of ASO titre at the 80th percentile will be an essential guide for clinicians to diagnose acute RF.","['Saha SK', 'Choudhury KN', 'Zareen S', 'Mousum S', 'Mamun MAA', 'Haque MA']",2022,10,,SAGE Open Med,"Saha SK, et al.

35767188,"Spectrum of skin diseases in Maroon villages of the Maroni area, French Guiana.","BACKGROUND: Due to their genetic characteristics and their high exposure to infectious diseases, Maroons are likely to suffer from a specific spectrum of skin diseases. However, skin disorders have never been explored in this population. We aimed to describe all skin diseases in Maroon villages of the Maroni region in French Guiana.
METHODS: This retrospective study concerned all patients who consulted in the remote health centers of Apatou, Grand-Santi, Papaichton, and Maripasoula between October 5, 2017, and June 30, 2020. We included all patients registered with a skin disorder (International Classification of Diseases) in the medical database. We excluded patients whose diagnosis was invalidated after cross-checking by a dermatologist.
RESULTS: A total of 4741 patients presented at least one skin disease, for 6058 different disorders. Nonsexually transmitted infections represented 71.6% of all diagnoses, followed by inflammatory diseases (9.8%) and bites/envenomations (4.6%). The three most frequent conditions were scabies, abscesses, and impetigo. Besides scabies, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) were still prevalent as we reported 13 cases of leprosy and 63 cutaneous leishmaniasis. Atopic dermatitis (AD) represented only 2.5% of our diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of AD, which was less frequent among Maroons, these results are similar to those previously reported in Amerindians. Therefore, a common exposure to rainforest pathogens seems to induce a common spectrum of skin diseases dominated by infections. The high prevalence of NTDs requires specific public health actions.","['Valentin J', 'Niemetzky F', 'Gaillet M', 'Michaud C', 'Carbunar A', 'Demar M', 'Couppie P', 'Blaizot R']",2022,61,9,Int J Dermatol,"Valentin J, et al.

35743492,Evaluation of Atopic Dermatitis and Cutaneous Infectious Disorders Using Sequential Pattern Mining: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.,"According to previous studies, the increased risk of cutaneous infectious disorders in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is related to impaired epidermal function, abnormal systemic immune function, and lower antimicrobial peptides. In this study, we analyzed the association between AD and cutaneous infectious disorders in the real world using sequential pattern mining (SPM). We analyzed National Health Insurance data from 2010-2013 using SPM to identify comorbid cutaneous infectious diseases and the onset durations of comorbidities. Patients with AD were at greater risk for molluscum contagiosum (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 5.273), impetigo (aOR, 2.852), chickenpox (aOR, 2.251), otitis media (aOR, 1.748), eczema herpeticum (aOR, 1.292), and viral warts (aOR, 1.105). In SPM analysis, comorbidity of 1.06% shown in molluscum contagiosum was the highest value, and the duration of 77.42 days documented for molluscum contagiosum was the shortest onset duration among all the association rules. This study suggests that AD is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous infectious disorders. In particular, care should be taken regarding its high relevance with impetigo, molluscum contagiosum, and otitis media, which may help in preventing AD from worsening through appropriately preventing and managing the condition.","['Han JH', 'Yoon JW', 'Yook HJ', 'Bang CH', 'Chun JH', 'Lee JY', 'Park YM', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee JH']",2022,11,12,J Clin Med,"Han JH, et al.

35704168,Generalized Pustular Psoriasis in Pregnancy: Current and Future Treatments.,"Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, severe neutrophilic skin disease characterized by sudden widespread eruption of sterile pustules with or without systemic symptoms. GPP may be life threatening in cases with severe complications such as cardiovascular failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and serious infections. Impetigo herpetiformis (IH) is a GPP that is induced and exacerbated by pregnancy and occurs most frequently during the last trimester. IH may result in poor or fatal neonatal outcomes, including placental insufficiency, fetal abnormalities, stillbirth, and early neonatal death. Most patients have prompt remission in the postpartum period; however, earlier appearance and more severe symptoms are observed during subsequent pregnancies. Appropriate treatment and close monitoring of the mother and fetus are vital for the management of patients with IH. Particular attention is required for the management of patients with IH to avoid an influence on the fetus. However, data regarding treatments for GPP in pregnant women are sparse. Over the last decade, many patients with IH have been treated with cyclosporine, corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-12/23 inhibitors, and granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis (GMA). GMA may be an important option for patients with IH as it is presently one of the safest available therapeutic options, but there have been no reports to fully confirm its safety in pregnant patients with GPP. Alternatively, based on recent advances in the understanding of the role of the IL-36 axis in the pathogenesis of GPP, biologic agents that target the IL-36 pathway may demonstrate promising efficacy in IH.","['Seishima M', 'Fujii K', 'Mizutani Y']",2022,23,5,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Seishima M, et al.

35499740,First-Trimester Impetigo Herpetiformis Leads to Stillbirth: A Case Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP), also known as impetigo herpetiformis (IH), is a rare variant of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) in pregnancy. It typically occurs in the third trimester and is a life-threatening condition for both the pregnant mother and the fetus if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Drug-induced PPP has been reported in sporadic case reports. Here we present a case of first-trimester PPP occurring after applying drugs including chloroquine, which we consider a possible culprit triggering the disease.
CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female was admitted to our department at 45 days gestation with sudden onset of fever and widespread erythematous pustules for 9 days. She had been on medications including hydroxychloroquine before onset. The eruptions and systemic symptoms were controlled with high-dose systemic steroids; however, she was detected to have a stillbirth, and underwent dilation and curettage of the uterine. At the latest follow-up about 2 years after her admission, she reported to have delivered a healthy baby about 1 month previously.
CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine has potential to lead to PPP in the first trimester of pregnancy. Further studies are warranted to investigate the etiology and treatment of PPP to facilitate early recognition and optimal management of this relatively rare dermatosis in pregnancy.","['Liu J', 'Ali K', 'Lou H', 'Wang L', 'Wu L']",2022,12,5,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Liu J, et al.

35433549,"Non-bullous Impetigo: Incidence, Prevalence, and Treatment in the Pediatric Primary Care Setting in Italy.","UNLABELLED: Impetigo is a common skin infection in children. The worldwide prevalence in children is estimated to be 12%, but this may be lower since high-income countries are under-represented. This research aims to evaluate the incidence, prevalence, and management of children with non-bullous impetigo (NBI) residing in Italy. This retrospective cohort study included children up to 14 years of age enrolled in the Pedianet database from January 2004 to June 2018. Events were identified searching ICD9-CM codes (684 and 694.3) and free text fields for a diagnosis of NBI reported during a primary care visit. Diagnoses were manually validated, and events registered within 30-days after the index date were considered follow-ups. Incidence (IR) and prevalence (PR) rates of NBI were stratified by sex, age group, and calendar year. Topical and systemic antibiotic treatments were grouped based on ATC codes. 15,136 NBI episodes occurred in a total cohort of 225,979 children. The overall IR of NBI was 9.5 per 1,000 person-years, and children aged 1-4 years had the highest IR (13.2 per 1,000 person-years). A significant decrease in NBI IR from 13 per 1,000 person-years in 2004 to 7.46 per 1,000 person-years in 2018 (
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NBI in children in Italy is less than one third than the global estimate and the trend in time is decreasing.

35387825,Missing Piece Study protocol: prospective surveillance to determine the epidemiology of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and impetigo in remote Western Australia.,"INTRODUCTION: Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), a Gram-positive bacterium, causes skin, mucosal and systemic infections. Repeated GAS infections can lead to autoimmune diseases acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia have the highest rates of ARF and RHD in the world. Despite this, the contemporaneous prevalence and incidence of GAS pharyngitis and impetigo in remote Australia remains unknown. To address this, we have designed a prospective surveillance study of GAS pharyngitis and impetigo to collect coincident contemporary evidence to inform and enhance primary prevention strategies for ARF.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Missing Piece Study aims to document the epidemiology of GAS pharyngitis and impetigo through collection of clinical, serological, microbiological and bacterial genomic data among remote-living Australian children. The study comprises two components: (1) screening of all children at school for GAS pharyngitis and impetigo up to three times a year and (2) weekly active surveillance visits to detect new cases of pharyngitis and impetigo. Environmental swabbing in remote schools will be included, to inform environmental health interventions. In addition, the application of new diagnostic technologies, microbiome analysis and bacterial genomic evaluations will enhance primary prevention strategies, having direct bearing on clinical care, vaccine development and surveillance for vaccine clinical trials.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (Ref: 892) and Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Western Australia (Ref: RA/4/20/5101). Study findings will be shared with community members, teachers and children at participating schools, together with academic and medical services. Sharing findings in an appropriate manner is important and will be done in a suitable way which includes plain language summaries and presentations. Finally, findings and updates will also be disseminated to collaborators, researchers and health planners through peer-reviewed journal publications.","['Barth DD', 'Mullane MJ', 'Sampson C', 'Chou C', 'Pickering J', 'Nicol MP', 'Davies MR', 'Carapetis J', 'Bowen AC']",2022,12,4,BMJ Open,"Barth DD, et al.

Ivermectin-based mass drug administration can substantially reduce scabies and impetigo prevalence in endemic settings, but the impact on serious bacterial complications is not known.
METHODS: We conducted a before-after trial in the Northern Division of Fiji (population: 131,914) of mass drug administration for scabies control. Prospective surveillance was conducted from 2018 to 2020. Mass drug administration took place in 2019, involving two doses of oral ivermectin or topical permethrin, delivered alongside diethylcarbamazine and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis. The primary outcomes were incidence of hospitalisations with skin and soft tissue infections, and childhood invasive infections and post-streptococcal sequelae. Secondary outcomes included presentations to primary healthcare with skin infections and community prevalence of scabies and impetigo.
FINDINGS: The incidence of hospitalisations with skin and soft tissue infections was 17% lower after the intervention compared to baseline (388 vs 467 per 100,000 person-years; incidence rate ratio 0.83, 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94;

About 11 million individuals in the US suffer from pharyngitis every year. Unfortunately, no vaccine against S. pyogenes is available yet. The purpose of this study is to create a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MEBSV) targeting S. pyogenes top four highly antigenic proteins by using a combination of immunological techniques and molecular docking to tackle term group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. T-cell (HTL & CTL), B-cell, and IFN-γ of target proteins were forecasted and epitopes having high antigenic properties being selected for subsequent research. For designing of final vaccine, 5LBL, 9CTL, and 4HTL epitopes were joined by the KK, AAY, and GPGPG linkers. To enhance the immune response, the N-end of the vaccine was linked by adjuvant (Cholera enterotoxin subunit B) with a linker named EAAAK. With the addition of adjuvants and linkers, the construct size was 421 amino acids. IFN-γ and B-cell epitopes illustrate that the modeled construct is optimized for cell-mediated immune or humoral responses. The developed MEBSV structure was assessed to be highly antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic. Moreover, disulphide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final vaccine protein. Molecular docking of the MEBSV with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was conducted to check the vaccine's compatibility with the receptor. Besides, in-silico cloning has been carried out for credibility validation and proper expression of vaccine construct. These findings suggested that the multi-epitope vaccine produced might be a potential immunogenic against Group A streptococcus infections but further experimental testing is required to validate this study.","['Aslam S', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Zia T', 'Aslam N', 'Alrumaihi F', 'Shahid F', 'Noor F', 'Qasim M']",2022,100,,Infect Genet Evol,"Aslam S, et al.

35111884,Prevalence of Infectious Diseases Among 6078 Individuals With Down Syndrome in the United States.,"A recent disease prevalence study of the largest documented Down syndrome (DS) cohort in the United States strongly suggested significant disparity in general infectious disease conditions among individuals with DS versus those without DS. In this follow-up retrospective analysis, we explored these differences in greater detail by calculating prevalence of 52 infectious diseases, across 28 years of data among 6078 individuals with DS and 30,326 age- and sex-matched controls, abstracted from electronic medical records within a large Midwestern health system. We found that the DS cohort had higher prevalence of pneumonias (including aspiration, viral, bacterial, pneumococcal, and unspecified/atypical); otitis externa; and the skin infections impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis. To the contrary, the DS cohort had lower prevalence of many respiratory infections other than pneumonia (including influenza, strep pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, scarlet fever, and otitis media); sexually transmitted infections (including bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus, pelvic inflammatory disease, and trichomoniasis); mononucleosis; shingles; unspecified hepatitis; intestinal infections; and enteritis. These findings highlight that individuals with DS could be more or less prone to different infectious diseases than their non-DS matched counterparts. Additional research to understand why these differences exist and how they might affect the clinical approach to patients with DS is warranted.","['Fitzpatrick V', 'Rivelli A', 'Chaudhari S', 'Chicoine L', 'Jia G', 'Rzhetsky A', 'Chicoine B']",2022,9,1,J Patient Cent Res Rev,"Fitzpatrick V, et al.

35109906,Treatment of Impetigo with Antiseptics-Replacing Antibiotics (TIARA) trial: a single blind randomised controlled trial in school health clinics within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in New Zealand.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common and contagious bacterial skin infection, affecting children worldwide, but it is particularly prevalent in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. In New Zealand, widespread prescribing of the topical antibiotic fusidic acid had led to an increase in antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus. Alternative treatments are urgently being sought, and as impetigo is a superficial infection, it has been suggested that topical antiseptics such as hydrogen peroxide or simple wound care alone may treat impetigo while avoiding the risk of increased antimicrobial resistance.
METHODS: This protocol for a non-inferiority, single-blind randomised controlled trial compares topical fusidic acid with topical hydrogen peroxide and with simple wound care in the treatment of childhood impetigo. Participants are randomised to one of the three treatments for 5 days. The primary outcome is clinical improvement assessed through paired photographs analysed by graders blinded to treatment arm. The trial is based in school health clinics in an urban centre in New Zealand. Comparison of antimicrobial resistance patterns pre- and post-treatment is also performed.
DISCUSSION: Special note is made of the need to involve the communities most affected by impetigo in the design and implementation of the clinical trial to recruit the children most in need of safe and effective treatments.

35088849,Mass Drug Administration for the Control of Scabies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is a neglected tropical disease of the skin that can lead to impetigo, serious secondary bacterial infections and immune-mediated diseases. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been reported in several studies to reduce the prevalence of scabies and impetigo. We aimed to assess the efficacy of MDA for scabies on scabies and impetigo.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports on the impact of MDA on scabies and impetigo. We included randomized control trials and observational evaluations reported from January 1970 to April 2021 and involving human participants. We searched PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. We considered MDA as treatment intended for the whole population, regardless of individual infection status or symptoms. The main outcome assessed was the change in scabies and impetigo prevalence following MDA. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020169839).
RESULTS: We identified 1110 records, of which 11 met inclusion criteria for the review and 9 were deemed suitable for meta-analysis for scabies and 4 for impetigo. Most studies were in small populations. There was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies (I2 value 96.19%). The overall relative reduction of the impact of MDA on scabies prevalence was 79%. The effect size was comparable for MDA based on ivermectin and permethrin. MDA for scabies also led to a reduction in impetigo prevalence with a relative reduction of 66%.
CONCLUSIONS: MDA for scabies is highly effective in reducing the prevalence of scabies and impetigo. Further research is needed to determine the durability of impact, and the effectiveness of MDA regimens in larger populations.","['Lake SJ', 'Kaldor JM', 'Hardy M', 'Engelman D', 'Steer AC', 'Romani L']",2022,75,6,Clin Infect Dis,"Lake SJ, et al.

35084691,Comprehensive Assessment of Skin Disorders in Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).,"BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an inborn error of immunity (IEI) characterized by various clinical manifestations such as hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and autoimmune diseases. Among different clinical manifestations, skin manifestations have been less reported in these patients.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the prevalence of dermatologic features in 387 CVID patients. Demographic information, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and genetic findings were collected from medical records. All data were analyzed based on the presence or absence of skin disorders in CVID patients.
RESULTS: We observed at least one skin manifestation in about 40% of these patients. Among these complications, skin infection (n = 64, 42.1%) was the most frequent presentation, followed by non-infectious skin lesions (n = 54, 35.6%). Among skin infections, abscesses (n = 34, 22.4%) were the most common complication. Skin infections such as cellulitis, impetigo, measles, and warts were also documented. Eczema (n = 34, 22.4%) was the most common complication in atopic lesions, and vitiligo (n = 13, 8.5%) was prevalent in autoimmune/pigmentation disorders. Among all the patients with genetic mutations, one-quarter had a deleterious mutation in the LRBA gene, relating to the autoimmune and atopic skin lesions.
CONCLUSION: This rate of skin disorders in our cohort demonstrating these manifestations could be significant in CVID patients, and they are not rare. Low data of skin complications in CVID patients could be attributed to insufficient attention of physicians and also might alert dermatologists to perform immunological investigations in children with certain skin manifestations.","['Zarezadeh Mehrabadi A', 'Aghamohamadi N', 'Abolhassani H', 'Aghamohammadi A', 'Rezaei N', 'Yazdani R']",2022,42,3,J Clin Immunol,"Zarezadeh Mehrabadi A, et al.

35034516,More Than Skin Deep: Dermatologic Conditions in Athletes.,"CONTEXT: Athletes are a unique group of patients whose activities, particularly in high-contact sports such as wrestling and football, place them at high risk of developing skin conditions. The correct diagnosis of sports dermatoses requires familiarity with their clinical characteristics. It is critical that primary care physicians recognize the most common skin disorders to provide prompt treatment and prevent transmission.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Mayo Clinic library obtained articles from 2012 onward related to dermatologic conditions in athletes.
STUDY DESIGN: Review article.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
RESULTS: Dermatologic diseases in athletes are often infectious and contagious due to close-contact sports environments. Sports-related dermatoses include bacterial infections, such as impetigo, ecthyma, folliculitis, abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, erysipelas, and cellulitis; fungal infections, such as tinea and intertrigo; viral infections, such as herpes, verrucae, and molluscum contagiosum; and noninfectious conditions, such as acne, blisters, and contact dermatitis.
CONCLUSION: This article aims to address the manifestations of the most common cutaneous diseases in athletes on the first primary care visit. It discusses the appropriate tests and most recent evidence-based treatments for each ailment. It also addresses return-to-play recommendations related to the guidelines and regulations of selected sports organizations in the United States.

35004032,A Comprehensive Review Study on Glomerulonephritis Associated With Post-streptococcal Infection.,"Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is an immune-complex mediated inflammation that used to be considered one of the commonest causes of acute nephritis amongst children. PSGN is characterized by the proliferation of cellular elements called nephritogenic M type as a result of an immunologic mechanism following an infection of the skin (impetigo) or throat (pharyngitis) caused by nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gram-positive bacteria that enters the body across pores in the skin or mucus epithelia and is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths annually due to multiple subsequence diseases such as rheumatic heart disease, rheumatic fever, PSGN, and other invasive infections. After the infection, the formation of an immune complex of antigen-antibody and complement system will take place and will deposit in the glomeruli where the injury occurs and leads to inflammation. The manifestations of PSGN can be explained by nephritic syndrome manifestation. PSGN is diagnosed by laboratory tests like microscopy and urinalysis. The imaging studies in PSGN could be used to assess the possible complications of PSGN such as pulmonary congestion and chronic kidney disease. The management of PSGN is symptomatic. If PSGN is not treated, the patient may develop chronic kidney disease. The main way to prevent PSGN is to treat group A streptococcal (GAS) infections by giving good coverage of antibiotic therapy to a patient who has primary GAS infections to prevent the development of the complication.","['Alhamoud MA', 'Salloot IZ', 'Mohiuddin SS', 'AlHarbi TM', 'Batouq F', 'Alfrayyan NY', 'Alhashem AI', 'Alaskar M']",2021,13,12,Cureus,"Alhamoud MA, et al.

34990346,A Case Report of an Infant with Autosomal Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa: COL7A1 Gene Mutations at C2005T and G7922A.,"A male infant was born by spontaneous delivery on February 7, 2020, with a gestational age of 40 weeks and a birth weight of 4.1 kg. After birth, the infant presented with appearance of skin loss on the bilateral lower limbs, feet, left wrist, face, and lips. Large areas of skin defects, erosion, and exudation were noted on the extensor side of the bilateral lower limbs and feet, and some skin loss with a small amount of exudation was observed on the left wrist, face, and lips, which was accompanied by dorsal hyperextension of the right foot and oral mucosal ulceration (Figure 1). Because the parents refused invasive examinations (skin biopsy, i.e., transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence examination (1)) and the child was hospitalized in a period during which the strictest prevention and control measures for novel coronavirus pneumonia were enacted, the hospital canceled the invasive examinations; therefore, skin biopsy was not performed. The infant's parents were healthy and nonconsanguineous. They reported that neither of them had skin defects at birth. They also denied nail dystrophy or complete absence of the nail and a history of recurrent oral herpes or ulcers, and no other family members had such symptoms. The mother had multiple scheduled prenatal examinations during the pregnancy, and the sick infant delivered via natural birth was her first child. She did not have a history of previous miscarriage and underwent a thyroid function test and ultrasound B-mode examinations, which did not show obvious abnormalities. Ultrasound B-mode examination in the second trimester suggested bilateral renal sinus separation and excessive dorsiflexion of both feet of the fetus. A nuchal translucency (NT) scan, a noninvasive prenatal DNA test, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed no significant abnormalities. Ultrasound B-mode findings indicated that the infant had congenital dysplasia, suggesting that he may have a genetic disease. In a subsequent genetic test, compound heterozygous variations of c.C2005T (the nucleotide at position 2005 in the coding region was mutated from C to T) and c.G7922A (the nucleotide at position 7922 in the coding region was mutated from G to A) were detected in the child's collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) gene, and the mutations were from the child's parents' genes (Table 1). The COL7A1 gene is a well-established causative gene for autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Based on these results, COL7A1 gene mutations may have been the cause of the disease in the child; thus, the child was definitively diagnosed with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. CASE REPORT After admission, the child received aggressive nutritional support. For treatment, cefmetazole was given for anti-infection, aseptic dressings were applied on the body surface with skin defects, iodophor disinfection was carried out, recombinant human epidermal growth factor gel and chlortetracycline eye ointment were applied externally, petrolatum was used to cover the skin defects, sterile gauze was used to wrap the lesions, and the dressings were changed daily or every other day. The wounds were kept dry, prolonged compression was avoided, and secondary bacterial infection was actively prevented and treated symptomatically as necessary. At discharge, the child's vital signs were stable, some epidermal defects were visible on the extensor side of the bilateral lower limbs, feet, and left wrist as well as on the face and lips with reduced exudation, and fresh epidermal coverage was observed (Figure 2). DISCUSSION Congenital epidermolysis bullosa must be differentiated from other diseases such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), neonatal impetigo, congenital bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma, congenital syphilis, and neonatal herpes simplex. Among these diseases, SSSS is a severe acute generalized exfoliative pustulosis that occurs in neonates and is characterized by the development of flaccid scalded bullae and large areas of skin exfoliation due to generalized erythema throughout the body (2). SSSS mostly occurs with sudden onset 1-5 weeks after birth. Initially, erythema occurs around the mouth or eyelids and then rapidly spreads to the trunk and proximal extremities or even to the entire body, which usually heals after 7-14 days. SSSS is a blistering and desquamative skin disease caused by the exfoliative toxins of staphylococcus aureus. It is a toxin-mediated condition (3), so the blisters and erosions are usually sterile. In this case, the child had three consecutive negative common bacterial culture test results during hospitalization, enabling exclusion of SSSS. Neonatal impetigo, congenital bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma, congenital syphilis, and neonatal herpes simplex all have associated specific pathogenic infections or are accompanied by other typical clinical manifestations, but in this case the child had no obvious infection manifestations except for specific skin lesions, allowing exclusion of the above diseases. Autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa was first reported in 1966 by Bart et al. (4) and was confirmed to be caused by mutations in COL7A1 by Chrlstiano et al. in 1996 (5,6). The disease takes the form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (7), and patients have congenital local skin defects, mucocutaneous blisters, and nail abnormalities (8). This disease is mostly sporadic, but familial predisposition has also been reported. In this case, the defective skin had begun to heal without complications at discharge. Based on our experience, nutritional support and infection prevention should be prioritized. The child was isolated from other patients during hospitalization, his blankets and clothes were autoclaved, and strict aseptic practices were carried out (9). Dressings were changed as needed by a designated person, and secretions were managed in a timely manner. The wounds were protected, and the child was carefully monitored and supported to improve his immunity and protect the function of his organs. This case once again demonstrates the crucial importance of prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling, and genetic testing, which are effective measures to prevent the birth of children with genetic diseases, and early intervention can minimize the pain of the family.","['Liu J', 'Wang L']",2021,29,3,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,Liu J and Wang L.

34944562,Pustular Psoriasis: From Pathophysiology to Treatment.,"Pustular psoriasis (PP) is a clinicopathological entity encompassing different variants, i.e., acute generalized PP (GPP), PP of pregnancy (impetigo herpetiformis), annular (and circinate) PP, infantile/juvenile PP, palmoplantar PP/palmoplantar pustulosis, and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH), which have in common an eruption of superficial sterile pustules on an erythematous base. Unlike psoriasis vulgaris, in which a key role is played by the adaptive immune system and interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 axis, PP seems to be characterized by an intense inflammatory response resulting from innate immunity hyperactivation, with prominent involvement of the IL-36 axis. Some nosological aspects of PP are still controversial and debated. Moreover, owing to the rarity and heterogeneity of PP forms, data on prognosis and therapeutic management are limited. Recent progresses in the identification of genetic mutations and immunological mechanisms have promoted a better understanding of PP pathogenesis and might have important consequences on diagnostic refinement and treatment. In this narrative review, current findings in the pathogenesis, classification, clinical features, and therapeutic management of PP are briefly discussed.","['Genovese G', 'Moltrasio C', 'Cassano N', 'Maronese CA', 'Vena GA', 'Marzano AV']",2021,9,12,Biomedicines,"Genovese G, et al.

34895206,Indirect costs associated with skin infectious disease in children: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data in the literature on the indirect costs associated with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the pediatric population. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the indirect costs associated with SSTIs in children.
METHODS: The search was conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science up to January 2020. Thirteen search strategies were designed combining MeSH terms and free terms. SSTIs were defined as bacterial or viral infections, dermatomycoses, and parasitic infestations. Only primary studies were included. All analyzed costs were converted to 2020 Euros.
RESULTS: Thirteen of the identified publications presented indirect costs of SSTIs in children and were conducted in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Hungary, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Taiwan, and the USA. Nine studies described indirect costs associated with infection of Varicella-zoster virus: lost workdays by outpatient caregivers ranged from 0.27 to 7.8, and up to 6.14 if caring for inpatients; total productivity losses ranged from €1.16 to €257.46 per patient. Three studies reported indirect costs associated with acute bacterial SSTIs (community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in children: total productivity losses ranged from €1,814.39 to €8,224.06 per patient, based on impetigo, cellulitis, and folliculitis. One study of parasitic infestations (Pediculus humanus capitis) reported total indirect costs per patient of €68.57 (formal care) plus €21.41 due to time lost by parents in purchasing treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of SSTIs is highly relevant but underestimated due to the lack of studies reporting indirect costs. Further cost studies will allow a better understanding of the magnitude of the financial burden of the disease.","['Lizano-Díez I', 'Naharro J', 'Zsolt I']",2021,21,1,BMC Health Serv Res,"Lizano-Díez I, et al.

METHODS: We queried the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to compare comorbidities in adult patients with AD versus age- and sex-matched controls.
RESULTS: A total of 39,779 patients with AD and 353,743 controls were identified. Increased odds of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 1.44) and mood disorders (OR 1.31), were observed in patients with AD. Patients with AD had higher likelihoods of autoimmune diseases, including vitiligo (OR 4.44) and alopecia areata (OR 6.01). Adult AD was also associated with infections, including impetigo (OR 9.72), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR 3.92), and cellulitis (OR 2.52). Patients with AD were more likely to have systemic conditions, including lymphoid/hematopoietic malignancy (OR 1.91), atherosclerosis (OR 1.69), and metabolic syndrome (OR 1.47). For all the above, P < .001.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective analysis of health care claims data.
CONCLUSION: Adult AD is associated with various psychiatric and systemic comorbidities, emphasizing the systemic nature of AD and the need for the collaborative management of these patients.","['Roh YS', 'Huang AH', 'Sutaria N', 'Choi U', 'Wongvibulsin S', 'Choi J', 'Bordeaux ZA', 'Parthasarathy V', 'Deng J', 'Patel DP', 'Canner JK', 'Grossberg AL', 'Kwatra SG']",2022,86,4,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Roh YS, et al.

34758017,Community control strategies for scabies: A cluster randomised noninferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is a neglected tropical disease hyperendemic to many low- and middle-income countries. Scabies can be successfully controlled using mass drug administration (MDA) using 2 doses of ivermectin-based treatment. If effective, a strategy of 1-dose ivermectin-based MDA would have substantial advantages for implementing MDA for scabies at large scale.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We did a cluster randomised, noninferiority, open-label, 3-group unblinded study comparing the effectiveness of control strategies on community prevalence of scabies at 12 months. All residents from 35 villages on 2 Fijian islands were eligible to participate. Villages were randomised 1:1:1 to 2-dose ivermectin-based MDA (IVM-2), 1-dose ivermectin-based MDA (IVM-1), or screen and treat with topical permethrin 5% for individuals with scabies and their household contacts (SAT). All groups also received diethylcarbamazine and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis control. For IVM-2 and IVM-1, oral ivermectin was dosed at 200 μg/kg and when contraindicated substituted with permethrin. We designated a noninferiority margin of 5%. We enrolled 3,812 participants at baseline (July to November 2017) from the 35 villages with median village size of 108 (range 18 to 298). Age and sex of participants were representative of the population with 51.6% male and median age of 25 years (interquartile range 10 to 47). We enrolled 3,898 at 12 months (July to November 2018). At baseline, scabies prevalence was similar in all groups: IVM-2: 11.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.5 to 16.0); IVM-1: 15.2% (95% CI 9.4 to 23.8); SAT: 13.6% (95% CI 7.9 to 22.4). At 12 months, scabies decreased substantially in all groups: IVM-2: 1.3% (95% CI 0.6 to 2.5); IVM-1: 2.7% (95% CI 1.1 to 6.5); SAT: 1.1% (95% CI 0.6 to 2.0). The risk difference in scabies prevalence at 12 months between the IVM-1 and IVM-2 groups was 1.2% (95% CI -0.2 to 2.7, p = 0.10). Limitations of the study included the method of scabies diagnosis by nonexperts, a lower baseline prevalence than anticipated, and the addition of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole to scabies treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: All 3 strategies substantially reduced prevalence. One-dose was noninferior to 2-dose ivermectin-based MDA, as was a screen and treat approach, for community control of scabies. Further trials comparing these approaches in varied settings are warranted to inform global scabies control strategies.

34591843,Scabies in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in Australia: A narrative review.,"Scabies has recently gained international attention, with the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizing it as a neglected tropical disease. The International Alliance for the Control of Scabies recently formed as a partnership of more than 15 different countries, with an aim to lead a consistent and collaborative approach to preventing and controlling scabies globally. Scabies is most prevalent in low-resource and low socioeconomic areas that experience overcrowding and has a particularly high prevalence in children, with an estimated 5% to 10% in endemic countries. Scabies is widespread in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia with the prevalence of scabies in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote communities estimated to be as high as 33%, making it the region with the third highest prevalence in the world. This population group also have very high rates of secondary complications of scabies such as impetigo, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). This article is a narrative review of scabies in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in Australia, including clinical manifestations of disease and current treatment options and guidelines. We discuss traditional approaches to prevention and control as well as suggestions for future interventions including revising Australian treatment guidelines to widen the use of oral ivermectin in high-risk groups or as a first-line treatment.","['Gramp P', 'Gramp D']",2021,15,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,Gramp P and Gramp D.

34581598,Streptococcus pyogenes Forms Serotype- and Local Environment-Dependent Interspecies Protein Complexes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is known to cause both mucosal and systemic infections in humans. In this study, we used a combination of quantitative and structural mass spectrometry techniques to determine the composition and structure of the interaction network formed between human plasma proteins and the surfaces of different S. pyogenes serotypes. Quantitative network analysis revealed that S. pyogenes forms serotype-specific interaction networks that are highly dependent on the domain arrangement of the surface-attached M protein. Subsequent structural mass spectrometry analysis and computational modeling of one of the M proteins, M28, revealed that the network structure changes across different host microenvironments. We report that M28 binds secretory IgA via two separate binding sites with high affinity in saliva. During vascular leakage mimicked by increasing plasma concentrations in saliva, the binding of secretory IgA was replaced by the binding of monomeric IgA and C4b-binding protein (C4BP). This indicates that an upsurge of C4BP in the local microenvironment due to damage to the mucosal membrane drives the binding of C4BP and monomeric IgA to M28. These results suggest that S. pyogenes has evolved to form microenvironment-dependent host-pathogen protein complexes to combat human immune surveillance during both mucosal and systemic infections.

34545646,Effects of an emollient application on newborn skin from birth for prevention of atopic dermatitis: a randomized controlled study in Thai neonates.,"BACKGROUND: Enhancing the skin barrier in high-risk neonates by daily use of emollients during infancy might prevent atopic dermatitis (AD); however, there have been no studies on this topic in a country with a tropical climate. Climate may affect the results of the use of emollients in neonates for AD prevention and possible adverse cutaneous eruptions.
OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that emollients used during infancy can prevent AD in high-risk neonates in a country with a tropical climate and to evaluate other possible adverse cutaneous eruptions in this population.
METHODS: This was a randomized controlled study in a tertiary care hospital with a 6 months' duration. Eligible neonates were randomly assigned to receive either emollient and skincare advice (emollient group) or skincare advice only (control group). The intervention was started within 3 weeks of birth.
RESULTS: The emollient group showed a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of AD at 6 months (relative risk, 0.39; 95% CI 0.24-0.64; P < 0.001). The emollient group started to develop AD later and had a lower severity of AD than the control group (P < 0.001). Compared to moderate adherence, low adherence to emollient application was associated with a lower number of patients with AD (P = 0.008). Potentially emollient-related cutaneous eruptions, such as miliaria, and suspected cutaneous infections, such as impetigo, were more frequent in the emollient group. Exposure to passive smoking showed a significant difference in the development of AD compared to non-smoking exposure, both during pregnancy and after the child's birth (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, in a tropical climate, emollient applied to the skin of at-risk neonates on an 'as needed' basis (depending on environmental factors, level of skin dryness), rather than on a 'daily basis', can provide a substantial benefit for AD prevention.","['Techasatian L', 'Kiatchoosakun P']",2022,36,1,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Techasatian L and Kiatchoosakun P.

We aimed to determine whether genetically determined CRP was associated with hundreds of human phenotypes to guide anti-inflammatory interventions.
METHODS: We used individual data from the UK Biobank to perform a phenome-wide two-stage least squares (2SLS) Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis for CRP with 879 diseases. Summary-level data from the FinnGen consortium were utilized to perform phenome-wide two-sample MR analysis on 821 phenotypes. Systematic two-sample MR methods included MR-IVW, MR-WME, MR-Mod, and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses combined with multivariable MR to identify robust associations. Genetic correlation analysis was applied to identify shared genetic risks.
RESULTS: We found genetically determined CRP was robustly associated with 15 diseases in the UK Biobank and 11 diseases in the FinnGen population (
CONCLUSIONS: Genetically determined CRP was robustly associated with several diseases in the UK Biobank and the FinnGen population, but could not be replicated, suggesting heterogeneous and non-repeatable effects of CRP across populations. This implies that interventions at CRP are unlikely to result in decreased risk for most human diseases in the general population but may benefit specific high-risk populations. The limited causal evidence and potential double-sided effects remind us to be cautious about CRP interventions.","['Si S', 'Li J', 'Tewara MA', 'Xue F']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Si S, et al.

34346097,Interleukin 36 expression in psoriasis variants and other dermatologic diseases with psoriasis-like histopathologic features.,"BACKGROUND: Elevated epidermal interleukin (IL)-36 expression distinguishes psoriasis from eczematous dermatitis, but other psoriasiform dermatitides (PDs) have not been thoroughly investigated for IL-36 expression. In this study, we assess the IL-36 staining pattern (IL36-SP) in psoriasis variants and other PDs including lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), prurigo nodularis (PN), lichen planus (LP), tinea, pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP), mycosis fungoides (MF), pemphigus foliaceus (PF), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), impetigo (IMP), and syphilis (SY).
METHODS: IL-36 immunostaining was performed on 307 cases of psoriasis and various PDs. IL36-SP in the upper epidermis was graded on a scale of 0-4.
RESULTS: High IL36-SP occurred in all variants of psoriasis, as well as in AGEP, PRP, PN, tinea, IMP, and LP (P > 0.05). SY, PF, LSC, and MF showed a lower IL36-SP (P ≤ 0.05) compared with psoriasis.
CONCLUSION: All variants of psoriasis exhibit high IL36-SP. IL-36 staining can assist in differentiating MF, PF, SY, and LSC from psoriasis, particularly MF and LSC, which have consistent low IL-36 expression.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to generate national estimates of ED utilization and to identify sociodemographic predictors of impetigo-related ED visits.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of children ages 1-17 presenting to EDs with a primary diagnosis of impetigo using years 2013-2015 of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample.
RESULTS: Impetigo accounted for 163 909 of the 71 488, 511 pediatric ED visits and was the fourth most common presenting skin diagnosis. Controlling for sociodemographic factors, patients presenting to the ED with impetigo were most likely to be 6-11 years old, male, and from lower-income quartiles. Patients were most likely to be uninsured and most likely to present on weekends in the summer.
CONCLUSION: This study provided national-level estimates of ED use for impetigo among US children.

Efforts to address these infections through mass drug administrations have recently been shown as efficacious and safe. In Samoa, a Pacific Island nation, there is a marked lack of epidemiological data for these neglected tropical diseases, or appreciation of their drivers in this setting.
METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional survey of children aged between 4 and 15 years attending primary schools in rural areas of Upolu Island, Samoa was carried out to assess the prevalence of impetigo and scabies in schoolchildren residing in rural Samoa, integrated with descriptive epidemiological and microbial genomic data. A phylogenetic assessment of local 
FINDINGS: In this survey, the prevalence of impetigo observed in Samoan schoolchildren was one of the highest described globally (57•1%, 95% CI [53•8-60•5%], 476/833). Associations between active impetigo and age and gender were noted, with younger children and males more commonly affected (aOR2•8 [1•8-4•7]and aOR1•8 [1•3-2•5], respectively). The prevalence of scabies was similar to that seen in other South Pacific island countries (14•4%, 95% CI [12•2-17•0%], 120/833). Transmission of

34263086,Mass drug administration campaigns for scabies and impetigo: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Scabies is recognised as a neglected tropical disease, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations around the world. Impetigo often occurs secondarily to scabies. Several studies have explored mass drug administration (MDA) programmes, with some showing positive outcomes-but a systematic evaluation of such studies is yet to be reported. The main aim of this systematic review is to generate comprehensive evidence on the effect and feasibility of MDA programmes in reducing the burden of scabies and impetigo.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Electronic databases to be searched will include CINAHL EBSCOhost, Medline Ovid, ProQuest, Science Direct, PubMed and SCOPUS. In addition, grey literature will be explored via the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Informit, OaIster database and WHO. No language restrictions will be applied. All treatment studies following an MDA protocol, including randomised/quasi-controlled trials, and prospective before-after interventional studies, will be considered. The main outcome is the change in prevalence of scabies and impetigo The Cochrane collaboration risk of bias assessment tool will be used for assessing the methodological quality of studies. A random-effect restricted maximum likelihood meta-analysis will be performed to generate pooled effect (OR) using STATA V.16. Appropriate statistical tests will be carried out to quantify heterogeneity between studies and publication bias.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required since data will be extracted from published works. The findings will be communicated to the scientific community through a peer-reviewed journal publication. This systematic review will present an evidence on the effect of MDA interventions on scabies and impetigo, which is instrumental to obtain a clear understanding of the treatments widely used in these programmes.

34188265,Topical Antibacterials in Dermatology.,"Topical antibacterials are commonly used for superficial pyodermas such as impetigo and treatment or prevention of infections following minor cuts, abrasions, burns, and surgical wounds. Several antibiotics and antiseptics are available for use in different indications. One of the major uses of topical antibacterials is acne in which benzoyl peroxide is the drug of the first choice either singly or in combination with antibiotics or retinoids. Mupirocin and fusidic acid are the two most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of superficial pyodermas and eradication of staphylococcal carrier state. Bacterial resistance to topical antibiotics is a growing concern and topical antiseptics such as gentian violet are getting renewed interest as alternatives. Incidence of contact dermatitis is a limiting factor for the use of several topical antibacterials.

34184743,International comparison of guidelines for management of impetigo: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common superficial skin infection that affects people worldwide and is usually treated with antibiotics; therefore, its management has implications for global antibiotic stewardship.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and narrative synthesis compares and contrasts international impetigo management guidelines.
METHODS: Guidelines for treatment of impetigo that were produced by a national authority; available to primary care physicians; and published since 2008 were included. Following a comprehensive search strategy, data extraction from eligible studies was performed independently in duplicate. Details of antiseptic and antibiotic treatment; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment; and conservative management and preventative measures were tabulated and analysed descriptively.
RESULTS: Fifty-one guidelines were included from 42 different countries. All guidelines recommended systemic antibiotics, 78% of these only for widespread lesions or failure of topical antibiotic treatment. The first-line systemic antibiotic treatment was restricted to narrow-spectrum options in 21 (41%) whilst 7 (14%) recommended only broad-spectrum antibiotics first-line. Thirty-four (67%) guidelines included recommendations for topical antibiotic use. Twenty guidelines (39%) did not mention antiseptic treatment for impetigo. Guidelines did not always provide clear indications for different treatment options.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite potentially equal efficacy to systemic antibiotics, only two-thirds of guidelines include topical antibiotic options. Many fail to include recommendations for non-antibiotic treatments such as antiseptics, preventative measures and conservative management, despite potential for antibiotic-sparing. Provision of clear definitions of disease severity and indications for treatment would enhance the ability of clinicians to adhere to recommendations.

34077411,Children hospitalized for myiasis in a reference center in Uruguay.,"BACKGROUND: Myiasis is an emerging disease caused by tissue invasion of dipteran larvae. In Uruguay, Cochliomyia hominivorax and Dermatobia hominis are the most frequent species. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and the follow-up of children < 15 years hospitalized for myiasis in a reference center in Uruguay between 2010 and 2019.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive and retrospective study by reviewing medical records. We analyzed the following variables: age, sex, comorbidities, origin, the month at admission, clinical manifestations, other parasitoses, treatments, complications, and larva species identified.
RESULTS: We found 63 hospitalized children: median age of 7 years (1 month-14 years), 68% of females. We detected risk comorbidities for myiasis (33%), of which chronic malnutrition was the most frequent (n = 6); 84% were from the south of the country; 76% were hospitalized during the summer. Superficial and multiple cutaneous involvements were found in 86%: of the scalp 50, furunculoid type 51, secondary to C. hominivorax 98.4%, and to D. hominis in 1.6%. As treatments, larval extraction was detected in all of them, surgical in 22%. Asphaltic products for parasites were applied in 94%, ether in 49. Antimicrobials were prescribed in 95%; cephradine and ivermectin were the most frequent. About 51% presented infectious complications, impetigo was found in 29, cellulitis in 2, and abscess in 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Myiasis predominantly affected healthy schoolchildren during the summer months and was frequently associated with ectoparasites. Superficial infestation of the furuncle-like scalp by C. hominivorax was the most frequent form. Infectious complications motivated hospitalizations.","['Notejane M', 'Zabala C', 'Ibarra L', 'Sosa L', 'Giachetto G']",2021,78,4,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,"Notejane M, et al.

34061851,A facility and community-based assessment of scabies in rural Malawi.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is a neglected tropical disease of the skin, causing severe itching, stigmatizing skin lesions and systemic complications. Since 2015, the DerMalawi project provide an integrated skin diseases clinics and Tele-dermatology care in Malawi. Clinic based data suggested a progressive increase in scabies cases observed. To better identify and treat individuals with scabies in the region, we shifted from a clinic-based model to a community based outreach programme.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From May 2015, DerMalawi project provide integrated skin diseases and Tele-dermatological care in the Nkhotakota and Salima health districts in Malawi. Demographic and clinical data of all patients personally attended are recorded. Due to a progressive increase in the number of cases of scabies the project shifted to a community-based outreach programme. For the community outreach activities, we conducted three visits between 2018 to 2019 and undertook screening in schools and villages of Alinafe Hospital catchment area. Treatment was offered for all the cases and school or household contacts. Scabies increased from 2.9% to 39.2% of all cases seen by the DerMalawi project at clinics between 2015 to 2018. During the community-based activities approximately 50% of the population was assessed in each of three visits. The prevalence of scabies was similar in the first two rounds, 15.4% (2392) at the first visit and 17.2% at the second visit. The prevalence of scabies appeared to be lower (2.4%) at the third visit. The prevalence of impetigo appeared unchanged and was 6.7% at the first visit and 5.2% at the final visit.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Prevalence of scabies in our setting was very high suggesting that scabies is a major public health problem in parts of Malawi. Further work is required to more accurately assess the burden of disease and develop appropriate public health strategies for its control.","['Galván-Casas C', 'Mitjá O', 'Esteban S', 'Kafulafula J', 'Phiri T', 'Navarro-Fernández Í', 'Román-Curto C', 'Mtenje H', 'Thauzeni G', 'Harawa E', 'Kaluzi S', 'Diere M', 'Mkandawire M', 'Malizani S', 'Chifundo A', 'Utrera-Busquets M', 'Mónica Roncero-Riesco', 'López Martín-Prieto S', 'Vilanova-Urdániz I', 'Petiti GH', 'de Gálvez Aranda MV', 'No Pérez N', 'Rueda Gómez-Calcerrada M', 'Iranzo P', 'Escalonilla García-Patos P', 'de Troya-Martín M', 'Romero Gomez J', 'Cardeñoso-Alvarez E', 'Lucas Truyols S', 'Aspe Unanue L', 'Bajo Del Pozo C', 'Comunión Artieda A', 'Martínez González MI', 'López-López OF', 'Moreno-Artero E', 'Cubiró X', 'Meilán-Sánchez I', 'Tomás-Velázquez A', 'López-Sánchez C', 'Sánchez-Martínez EM', 'Edwards HA', 'Herrera Morueco M', 'Zehe Rubiera J', 'Salguero Caldera L', 'Blanes-Moreno U', 'Uribarren-Movilla M', 'Marks M']",2021,15,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Galván-Casas C, et al.

34053699,Emerging Treatment Strategies for Impetigo in Endemic and Nonendemic Settings: A Systematic Review.,"PURPOSE: Impetigo affects approximately 162 million children worldwide at any given time. Lack of consensus on the most effective treatment strategy for impetigo and increasing antibiotic resistance continue to drive research into newer and alternative treatment options. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase via Scopus for studies that explored treatments for bullous, nonbullous, primary, and secondary impetigo published between August 1, 2011, and February 29, 2020. We also searched online trial registries and hand-searched the reference lists of the included studies. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias (version 2.0) tool for randomized trials and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for nonrandomized uncontrolled studies to assess the risk of bias.
FINDINGS: We included 10 studies that involved 6651 participants and reported on 9 treatments in the final analysis. Most clinical trials targeted nonbullous impetigo or did not specify this. The risk of bias varied among the studies. In nonendemic settings, ozenoxacin 1% cream appeared to have the strongest evidence base compared with retapamulin and a new minocycline formulation. In endemic settings, oral co-trimoxazole and benzathine benzylpenicillin G injection were equally effective in the treatment of severe impetigo. Mass drug administration intervention emerged as a promising public health strategy to reduce the prevalence of impetigo in endemic settings.
IMPLICATIONS: This review highlights the limited research into new drugs used for the treatment of impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings. Limited recent evidence supports the use of topical ozenoxacin or retapamulin for impetigo treatment in nonendemic settings, whereas systemic antibiotics and the mass drug administration strategy have evidence for use in endemic settings. Given the troubling increase in resistance to existing treatments, there is a clear need to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics and to develop new treatments and alternative strategies; this is particularly important in endemic settings.

34029210,"Prospective Surveillance of Primary Healthcare Presentations for Scabies and Bacterial Skin Infections in Fiji, 2018-2019.","Scabies, impetigo, and other skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are highly prevalent in many tropical, low-middle income settings, but information regarding their burden of disease is scarce. We conducted surveillance of presentations of scabies and SSTIs, including impetigo, abscesses, cellulitis, and severe SSTI, to primary health facilities in Fiji. We established a monthly reporting system over the course of 50 weeks (July 2018-June 2019) for scabies and SSTIs at all 42 public primary health facilities in the Northern Division of Fiji (population, ≈131,914). For each case, information was collected regarding demographics, diagnosis, and treatment. There were 13,736 individual primary healthcare presentations with scabies, SSTI, or both (108.3 presentations per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 106.6-110 presentations). The incidence was higher for males than for females (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.19). Children younger than 5 years had the highest incidence among all age groups (339.1 per 1000 person-years). The incidence was higher among the iTaukei (indigenous) population (159.9 per 1000 person-years) compared with Fijians of Indian descent (30.1 per 1000 person-years; IRR, 5.32; 95% CI, 5.03-5.61). Abscess was the condition with the highest incidence (63.5 per 1,000 person-years), followed by scabies (28.7 per 1,000 person-years) and impetigo (21.6 per 1,000 person-years). Scabies and SSTIs impose a substantial burden in Fiji and represent a high incidence of primary health presentations in this population. The incidence in low-middle income settings is up to 10-times higher than that in high-income settings. New public health strategies and further research are needed to address these conditions.","['Thean LJ', 'Romani L', 'Engelman D', 'Jenney A', 'Wand H', 'Mani J', 'Paka J', 'Devi R', 'Sahukhan A', 'Kama M', 'Tuicakau M', 'Kado J', 'Carvalho N', 'Whitfeld M', 'Kaldor J', 'Steer AC']",2021,105,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Thean LJ, et al.

34022330,Prospective surveillance for invasive Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus infections in a setting with high community burden of scabies and impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive Staphylococcus aureus (iSA) and group A Streptococcus (iGAS) impose significant health burdens globally. Both bacteria commonly cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), which can result in invasive disease. Understanding of the incidence of iSA and iGAS remains limited in settings with a high SSTI burden.
METHODS: Prospective surveillance for admissions with iSA or iGAS was conducted at the referral hospital in Fiji's Northern Division over 48 weeks between July 2018 and June 2019.
RESULTS: There were 55 admissions for iSA and 15 admissions for iGAS (incidence 45.2 and 12.3 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). The highest incidence was found in patients aged ≥65 years (59.6 per 100,000 person-years for iSA and iGAS). The incidence of iSA was higher in indigenous Fijians (iTaukei) (71.1 per 100,000 person-years) compared with other ethnicities (incidence rate ratio 9.7, 95% confidence interval 3.5-36.9). SSTIs were found in the majority of cases of iSA (75%) and iGAS (53.3%). Thirteen of the 14 iGAS strains isolated belonged to emm cluster D (n = 5) or E (n = 8). The case fatality rate was high for both iSA (10.9%) and iGAS (33.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of iSA and iGAS in Fiji is very high. SSTIs are common clinical foci for both iSA and iGAS. Both iSA and iGAS carry a substantial risk of death.

34021955,Retrospective study on the safety and tolerability of clinical treatments with a novel Thermomechanical Ablation device on 150 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: There are currently not many publications on the safety of thermomechanical ablation (TMA) devices, and those that are published only have small numbers of subjects. This treatment is gaining popularity in Europe and Asia, and thus there is a need to look at the safety of this treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety of the clinical use of the novel TMA system (Tixel, Novoxel, Israel) for facial rejuvenation and treatment of acne scars.
METHODS: We did a retrospective review of our first 150 patients who were treated with the TMA device.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients aged 20 years to 82 years with Fitzpatrick skin types I to V treated with the TMA device were included in this study. The total number of treatment sessions was 327 (average 2.18 treatment per patient). The total number of pulses delivered to these patients was 1 48 856 (average 455 pulses per session). The indications for the treatment were photodamaged skin (n=145) and acne scarring (n=5). All patients were able to use makeup immediately after the treatment at lower settings, thus needing no real recovery time. Patients treated at higher settings were able to use makeup after 2 days. There were four reported complications: post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (n=2), impetigo (n=1), and dermatitis (n=1).
CONCLUSIONS: Using the TMA device in the treatment of photodamage and acne scarring is safe in skin types I to V and has a low incidence of temporary side effects with no permanent side effects.","['Judodihardjo H', 'Rajpar S']",2022,21,4,J Cosmet Dermatol,Judodihardjo H and Rajpar S.

33994265,Dermatological opinions are imperative in ambulatory and acute care settings for pediatric skin disorders - HL-SkinPed.,"BACKGROUND: Children with skin disorders usually receive care from a pediatrician, despite their limited training in this discipline. The advice of a dermatologist is frequently requested.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the degree of concordance in the diagnosis, treatment, advice, and recommended follow-up of skin disorders between pediatricians (in private practice or a pediatric emergency department [PED]) and a dermatologist.
METHODS: This prospective study was carried out between June 25 and September 13, 2018. All patients younger than 18 years consulting at the PED of the University Children's Hospital or a pediatric private practice in Nancy, France, for a dermatological disorder (primary complaint) were included. Photographs, medical data, diagnosis, treatment, advice and follow-up recommended by the pediatricians were recorded in a dedicated anonymous medical file. Clinical data and photographs were subsequently reviewed by a dermatologist who provided a diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were included and 99 were analyzed: 53 from the PED and 46 from private practice (three patients were excluded because of unclear photographs and one was referred for maxillofacial advice). The median age was 4 years and there was a slight predominance of females (53.5%). The seven main diagnoses were: atopic dermatitis, insect bites, nonspecific viral rash, viral urticaria, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, impetigo, and contact dermatitis. The rate of agreement between the pediatricians and the dermatologist was 55% for diagnosis (73% for atopic dermatitis, 53% for insect bites, 33% for nonspecific viral rash), 40% for treatment, 54% for advice, and 58% for recommended follow-up. Reinterpretation by the dermatologist changed patient management in 15% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant discordance between the pediatricians and the dermatologist suggests the need for a greater emphasis on dermatological disorders in medical training programs and for closer collaboration between disciplines for the benefit of younger patients.","['Moiny-Fouquet M', 'Guillaume C', 'Berlengi N', 'Lapp L', 'Watelet C', 'Borsa-Dorion A', 'Bernard Y', 'Baumann C', 'Luc A', 'Schweitzer C', 'Leheup B', 'Bursztejn AC']",2021,28,5,Arch Pediatr,"Moiny-Fouquet M, et al.

An additional 4,250 cases occurred in theaters of operations (251.0 per 10,000 p-yrs). Of the total incident SSTI diagnoses, 64.5% were classified as cellulitis/abscess, 30.0% were ""other SSTIs"" (e.g., folliculitis, impetigo), 5.3% were carbuncles/furuncles, and 0.2% were erysipelas. Crude annual incidence rates declined by 21.9% over the surveillance period. In general, higher rates of SSTIs were associated with younger age, recruit/trainee status, and junior enlisted rank. A total of 174,893 service members were treated for SSTIs, which accounted for 307,160 medical encounters and 14,819 hospital bed days. SSTIs in the military are associated with significant operational and health care burden. Strategies for the prevention, early diagnosis, and definitive treatment of SSTIs are warranted, particularly in initial military training and operational settings associated with increased risk of infection.","['Stahlman S', 'Williams VF', 'Oh GT', 'Tribble DR', 'Millar EV']",2021,28,4,MSMR,"Stahlman S, et al.

We assessed the efficacy of a community-based intervention using mass screening and treatment with oral ivermectin in controlling scabies.
METHODS/ FINDINGS: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, 12 villages were randomly selected from a cluster of 42 tribal villages in Gadchiroli district. In these villages, trained community health workers (CHWs) conducted mass screening for scabies. The diagnosis was confirmed by a physician. Six villages each were randomly allocated to the intervention and usual care arm (control arm). In the intervention arm (population 1184) CHWs provided directly observed oral ivermectin to scabies cases and their household contacts. In the usual care arm (population 1567) scabies cases were referred to the nearest clinic for topical treatment as per the standard practice. The primary outcome was prevalence of scabies two months after the treatment. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of scabies after twelve months of treatment and prevalence of impetigo after two and twelve months of treatment. Outcomes were measured by the team in a similar way as the baseline. The trial was registered with the clinical trial registry of India, number CTRI/2017/01/007704. In the baseline, 2 months and 12 months assessments 92.4%, 96% and 94% of the eligible individuals were screened in intervention villages and 91.4%, 91.3% and 95% in the usual care villages. The prevalence of scabies in the intervention and usual care arm was 8.4% vs 8.1% at the baseline, 2.8% vs 8.8% at two months [adjusted relative risk (ARR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11-0.38] and 7.3% vs 14.1% (ARR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.98) at twelve months The prevalence of impetigo in the intervention and usual care arm was 1.7% vs 0.6% at baseline, 0.6% vs 1% at two months (ARR 0.55, 95% CI 0.22-1.37) and 0.3% vs 0.7% at 12 months (ARR 0.42, 95% CI 0.06-2.74). Adverse effects due to ivermectin occurred in 12.1% of patients and were mild.
CONCLUSIONS: Mass screening and treatment in the community with oral ivermectin delivered by the CHWs is superior to mass screening followed by usual care involving referral to clinic for topical treatment in controlling scabies in this tribal community in Gadchiroli.","['Behera P', 'Munshi H', 'Kalkonde Y', 'Deshmukh M', 'Bang A']",2021,15,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Behera P, et al.

33852242,Treatment of Impetigo and Antimicrobial Resistance.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a contagious bacterial infection that affects the superficial skin layers. Increasing worldwide antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to existing topical agents commonly prescribed to treat impetigo is central to treatment failure. The Worldwide Health Organization developed a global action plan on AMR, but omitted information about AMR stewardship programs for topical antibiotics.
OBJECTIVES: The review aims to provide information to clinicians and stakeholders regarding AMR and antimicrobial stewardship on topical antimicrobial drugs for impetigo treatment.
METHODS: The literature searches reviewed the status of AMR to current topical antibiotics in impetigo, current therapeutic behavior, and concordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Two international panels convened to discuss the output of the searches, and the results of the panel discussions were used in the development of the manuscript.
RESULTS: The literature search included clinical trials, research studies, clinical guidelines, consensus papers, and reviews (if they provided original data), published between January 2008 and May 2019. The articles were selected based on clinical relevancy of impetigo management, clinical efficacy, and safety of the treatment and antimicrobial resistance. The searches resulted in one-hundred and ninety-eight articles. After applying the eligibility criteria, nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were considered in the present review.
CONCLUSIONS: While published antimicrobial stewardship guidelines have focused on systemic antibiotics, few studies have attempted to evaluate topical antibiotic prescribing practices for impetigo treatment. Many of the topical impetigo treatments currently in use have developed resistance. The appropriate use of topical ozenoxacin can help eradicate impetigo while minimizing AMR.J Drugs Dermatol. 20(4):366-372. doi:10.36849/JDD.5795.","['Schachner LA', 'Lynde CW', 'Kircik LH', 'Torrelo A', 'Hohl D', 'Kwong P', 'Oza V', 'Andriessen A', 'Hebert AA']",2021,20,4,J Drugs Dermatol,"Schachner LA, et al.

33787610,Disseminated gonococcal infection in a Japanese man with complement 7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Complement deficiency are known to be predisposed to disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). We herein present a case of DGI involving a Japanese man who latently had a complement 7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A previously healthy 51-year-old Japanese man complained of sudden-onset high fever. Physical examination revealed various skin lesions including red papules on his trunk and extremities, an impetigo-like pustule on left forearm, and tendinitis of his right forefinger.
DIAGNOSIS: Blood culture testing detected gram-negative cocci, which was confirmed to be Neisseria gonorrhoeae based on mass spectrometry and a pathogen-specific PCR test.
INTERVENTIONS: Screening tests for underlying immunocompromised factors uncovered that complement activities (CH50) was undetectable. With a suspicion of a congenital complement deficiency, genetic analysis revealed rare single nucleotide variants in complement 7 (C7), including c.281-1G>T and a novel variant c.1454C>T (p.A485V). CH50 was normally recovered by adding purified human C7 to the patient's serum, supporting that the patient has C7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants.
OUTCOMES: Under a diagnosis of DGI, the patient underwent an antibiotic treatment with cefotaxime for a week and was discharged without any sequela.
LESSONS: DGI is a rare sexually-transmitted infection that potentially induces systemic complications. Complement immunity usually defeats N. gonorrhoeae and prevents the organism from causing DGI. This case highlighted the importance of suspecting a complement deficiency when a person develops DGI.","['Kageyama M', 'Hagiya H', 'Ueda Y', 'Ohtani K', 'Fukumori Y', 'Inoue N', 'Wakamiya N', 'Yoneda N', 'Kimura K', 'Nagasawa M', 'Nakagami F', 'Nishi I', 'Sugimoto K', 'Rakugi H']",2021,100,13,Medicine (Baltimore),"Kageyama M, et al.

33726585,A comparative review of current topical antibiotics for impetigo.,"INTRODUCTION: Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection largely affecting the pediatric population. The objective of this review is to provide a comparison of mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of the available topical antibiotics for impetigo.
AREAS COVERED: Randomized clinical trials that evaluated the use of topical antibiotics for treatment of impetigo were included. Two thousand eighty-nine studies were initially identified, and five randomized clinical trials met the criteria for further analysis.
EXPERT OPINION: Topical antibiotics had greater resolution of impetigo in comparison to vehicle in these pivotal clinical trials. Adverse events were minimal, with the most common being pruritus at the application site. Cost or insurance coverage may be a limiting factor in choosing the best therapeutic agent, with mupirocin ointment having the lowest cost. Mupirocin has shown clinical efficacy against MRSA but a bacterial culture is recommended to rule out resistance. Ozenoxacin and retapamulin are effective alternatives but may entail higher cost. Retapamulin is indicated for lesions of impetigo that are colonized by MSSA and streptococcus S. pyogenes but not MRSA based on clinical efficacy of phase III trials. Fusidic acid, available in other countries, is a non-FDA approved medication although rising resistance rates represent a growing concern.","['Galindo E', 'Hebert AA']",2021,20,6,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Galindo E and Hebert AA.

33722285,Prevalence of scabies and impetigo in school-age children in Timor-Leste.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies and impetigo are endemic in many tropical, low- and middle-income countries. Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin has emerged as a control strategy for these conditions. In 2019, Timor-Leste Ministry of Health planned to implement MDA including ivermectin for the control of lymphatic filariasis, so we undertook a baseline assessment of scabies and impetigo to better understand local epidemiology and contribute to future surveys assessing the impact of MDA.
METHODS: A cross-sectional school survey was conducted in April-May 2019 at six primary schools in a semi-urban (Dili) and two rural (Ermera and Manufahi) settings. Children under 19 years of age present at school on survey days were eligible to participate, of whom we enrolled 1183. Trained health workers interviewed and examined 1043 participants to clinically diagnose scabies using the 2020 International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) diagnostic criteria, as well as impetigo. Prevalence was adjusted for age and sex. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to analyse odds of scabies and impetigo infection. All models accounted for clustering at the school level through the use of random effect terms. Population attributable risk of scabies as a cause of impetigo was also estimated.
RESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence of scabies was 30.6%. Children in rural Manufahi were more likely to have scabies than those in semi-urban Dili (53.6% vs 28.2%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.5). Most cases of scabies were mild (3 to 10 lesions), and lesions were usually distributed on more than one body region. Scabies prevalence was lower among 10 to 14 year olds compared to 5 to 9 year olds. Overall weighted prevalence of impetigo was 11.3%. Relative to Dili, children in rural Ermera and Manufahi were twice as likely to have impetigo. Impetigo was twice as common in children with scabies than in those without, corresponding to an attributable risk of scabies as a cause of impetigo of 22.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Scabies and impetigo prevalence in Timor-Leste is among the highest reported globally, particularly in rural areas. Scabies infestation was strongly associated with impetigo. Comprehensive control strategies are urgently needed in Timor-Leste.","['Matthews A', 'Le B', 'Amaral S', 'Arkell P', 'Monteiro M', 'Clarke N', 'Barros T', 'de Jesus Mendonça J', 'Gusmão SME', 'Dos Reis Seixas LM', 'da Piedade JHA', 'Engelman D', 'Steer AC', 'Fancourt NSS', 'Yan J', 'Kaldor J', 'Francis JR', 'Nery SV']",2021,14,1,Parasit Vectors,"Matthews A, et al.

37575641,Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist: New Genetic Autoinflammatory Disease as a Diagnostic Challenge for Pediatricians.,"Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is a rare autoinflammatory disease that affects infants early in life. It often presents with systemic inflammation, skin and bone involvement. We present a 5-month-old boy who was hospitalized due to generalized erythematous pustular eruption with secondary impetigo, cellulitis, bronchiolitis, and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient was unresponsive to multiple courses of intravenous antibiotics, systemic, and topical steroid medications. The patient was evaluated by dermatology and rheumatology services among other subspecialities. Skin biopsy showed changes consistent with psoriasiform dermatitis, while bone scans showed multifocal osteomyelitis. The patient was started empirically on anakinra with improvement at 72 hours upon administration. This is one of the youngest reported case in the literature to be started on anakinra empirically prior to genetic confirmation of the mutation. A comprehensive literature review revealed that approximately 20 genetically confirmed patients, including our patient, have been reported with this genetic disease. It is imperative to recognize this disease early to achieve adequate response and remission. Therefore, clinical symptoms and the associated differential diagnosis for this disease should be constantly reassessed and reviewed by pediatricians and subspecialists to detect the disease as early as possible and reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment.","['Rivera-Sepulveda A', 'Colón-Fontánez F', 'López M', 'Puig-Ramos G']",2023,12,3,J Pediatr Genet,"Rivera-Sepulveda A, et al.

33617544,Defining the need for public health control of scabies in Solomon Islands.,"Pacific Island countries have a high burden of scabies and impetigo. Understanding of the epidemiology of these diseases is needed to target public health interventions such as mass drug administration (MDA). The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in Solomon Islands as well as the relationship between them and their distribution. We conducted a prevalence study in 20 villages in Western Province in Solomon Islands. All residents of the village were eligible to participate. Nurses conducted clinical assessments including history features and skin examination. Diagnosis of scabies was made using the 2020 International Alliance for the Control of Scabies diagnostic criteria. Assessments were completed on 5239 participants across 20 villages. Overall scabies prevalence was 15.0% (95%CI 11.8-19.1). There was considerable variation by village with a range of 3.3% to 42.6%. There was a higher prevalence of scabies in males (16.7%) than females (13.5%, adjusted relative risk 1.2, 95%CI 1.1-1.4). Children aged under two years had the highest prevalence (27%). Overall impetigo prevalence was 5.6% (95%CI 4.2-7.3), ranging from 1.4% to 19% by village. The population attributable risk of impetigo associated with scabies was 16.1% (95% CI 9.8-22.4). The prevalence of scabies in our study is comparable to previous studies in Solomon Islands, highlighting a persistent high burden of disease in the country, and the need for public health strategies for disease control.","['Lake SJ', 'Engelman D', 'Sokana O', 'Nasi T', 'Boara D', 'Grobler AC', 'Osti MH', 'Andrews R', 'Marks M', 'Whitfeld MJ', 'Romani L', 'Kaldor JM', 'Steer AC']",2021,15,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lake SJ, et al.

33599999,Significance of IL36RN mutation analyses in the management of impetigo herpetiformis: A case report and review of published cases.,"Impetigo herpetiformis (IH) is a rare variant of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), which develops during pregnancy. GPP is associated with mutations of IL36RN, but it is still unclear whether the same is true of IH. A 20-year-old Japanese woman developed erythema and pustules on her trunk during the 27th week of her first pregnancy. Within 1 month, the skin lesions spread over her whole body, accompanied by fever. Skin biopsy revealed Kogoj's spongiform pustules in the epidermis and she was diagnosed with IH. Systemic administration of prednisolone failed to resolve the skin eruption, but it was partially improved by the addition of cyclosporin. The patient gave birth to a healthy female infant. After delivery, her erythema relapsed and the effect of granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis was limited. Thus, secukinumab was administrated, and since then, she has maintained complete remission. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous c.28C>T (p.Arg10X) mutation in IL36RN. Twelve cases of IH, including that presented here, have been reported together with the results of IL36RN genetic analyses, and 10 of the 12 cases occurred in East Asia (Japan and China) despite the fact that IL36RN mutations in GPP have been reported worldwide. Among 10 IH patients of East Asian descent, seven had IL36RN mutations, all of which were founder mutations causing GPP in East Asia: c.28C>T (p.Arg10X) or c.115+6T>C (p.Arg10ArgfsX1). Thus, East Asian founder mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IH. IH patients with IL36RN mutations have a tendency to require biologics to resolve postpartum flare-ups or sustained psoriatic skin lesions. Because IL36RN mutation status may help predict postpartum flare-ups in IH patients, mutation analysis should be considered to enable preparation for biologic therapy of intractable flare-ups.","['Yoshikawa M', 'Rokunohe D', 'Kimura A', 'Takahashi M', 'Korekawa A', 'Nakajima K', 'Nakano H', 'Yokoyama M', 'Tanaka K', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Sawamura D']",2021,48,5,J Dermatol,"Yoshikawa M, et al.

A precise and detailed history is essential to establish a diagnosis, followed by clinical examination and specific examination methods. Cutaneous infection should always be excluded, as they occur very frequently. Impetigo, punctate keratolysis, blistering distal dactylitis, tinea manuum and pedum, hand-foot-mouth disease, herpes simplex digitalis and verrucae vulgaris as well as scabies are often found in the palmoplantar area and typically affect children and adolescents. In case of allergic contact dermatitis and dyshidrotic eczema, atopic diathesis in the medical history is of importance. However, we must not miss rare causes. Palmoplantar keratoses, for example, can be due to inflammatory dermatoses like pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) or may, as well as blistering diseases, result from hereditary disorders.

METHOD: The authors searched PubMed up to January 2020, as well as reference lists of articles identified in the search. Eligible studies involved participants with impetigo in either the placebo group of randomised trials, or in single-group prognostic studies that did not use antibiotics and measured time to resolution or improvement. A modified version of a risk of bias assessment for prognostic studies was used. Outcomes were percentage of participants who had either symptom resolution, symptom improvement, or failed to improve at any timepoint. Adverse event data were also extracted.
RESULTS: Seven randomised trials (557 placebo group participants) were identified. At about 7 days, the percentage of participants classified as resolved ranged from 13% to 74% across the studies, whereas the percentage classified as 'failure to improve' ranged from 16% to 41%. The rate of adverse effects was low. Incomplete reporting of some details limited assessment of risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: Although some uncertainty around the natural history of non-bullous impetigo remains, symptoms resolve in some patients by about 7 days without using antibiotics, with about one-quarter of patients not improving. Immediate antibiotic use may not be mandatory, and discussions with patients should include the expected course of untreated impetigo and careful consideration of the benefits and harms of antibiotic use.","['Hoffmann TC', 'Peiris R', 'Glasziou P', 'Cleo G', 'Mar CD']",2021,71,704,Br J Gen Pract,"Hoffmann TC, et al.

33538559,Do Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns Matter? An Algorithm for the Treatment of Patients With Impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly occurring in young children, but adults may also be affected. The superficial skin infection is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and less frequently by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide concern and needs to be addressed when selecting treatment for impetigo patients. An evidence-based impetigo treatment algorithm was developed to address the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.
METHODS: An international panel of pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists employed a modified Delphi technique to develop the impetigo treatment algorithm. Treatment recommendations were evidence-based, taking into account antimicrobial stewardship and the increasing resistance to oral and topical antibiotics.
RESULTS: The algorithm includes education and prevention of impetigo, diagnosis and classification, treatment measures, and follow-up and distinguishes between localized and widespread or epidemic outbreaks of impetigo. The panel adopted the definition of localized impetigo of fewer than ten lesions and smaller than 36 cm2 area affected in patients of two months and up with no compromised immune status. Resistance to oral and topical antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of impetigo such as mupirocin, retapamulin, fusidic acid, have been widely reported.
CONCLUSIONS: When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to know the local trends in antibiotic resistance. Ozenoxacin cream 1% is highly effective against S. pyogenes and S. aureus, including methycyllin-susceptible and resistant strains (MRSA), and may be a suitable option for localized impetigo.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(2):134-142. doi:10.36849/JDD.5475 THIS ARTICLE HAD BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE.

Although facial dermatoses due to masks increase in both healthcare workers and general population, a pathogenetic hypothesis remains still elusive. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dermatological consultations due to Koebner triggered dermatoses In this prospective, multicenter, real life study carried out in Italy from March 11th to December 11th 2020 during COVID-19 pandemics, dermatological consultations (in-person and telemedicine) to study the prevalence of Koebner (KB) phenomenon due to masks were evaluated. Boyd and Nelder classification was adopted for Koebner phenomenon and Bizzozero's for KB intensity. A total of 229/873 (26.2%) dermatological consultations were KB triggered dermatoses and lesions were located in mask-covered ear area (76 [33.2%]), malar area (73 [31.8%]), perioral area (53 [23.1%]), and nose (27 [11.8%]). The first KB category grouped 142 patients (psoriasis, vitiligo, maskne, and mask rosacea), the second one 24 (warts, molluscum contagiosum, and impetigo), the third one 46 (atopic dermatitis), and the fourth one 17 (eczema). Among previously KB negative psoriatic patients that became KB positive, 9/13 (69.2%) had discontinued or modified the prescribed antipsoriatic treatment.

33351803,A scabies outbreak in the North East Region of Ghana: The necessity for prompt intervention.,"BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of data on scabies from Ghana. In September 2019, local health authorities in the East Mamprusi district of northern Ghana received reports of scabies from many parts of the district. Due to on-going reports of more cases, an assessment team visited the communities to assess the effect of the earlier individual treatment on the outbreak. The assessment team furthermore aimed to contribute to the data on scabies burden in Ghana and to demonstrate the use of the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) diagnostic tool in a field survey in a resource limited setting.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a cross sectional study. Demographic information and medical history was collected on all participants using a REDCap questionnaire. A standardised skin examination of exposed regions of the body was performed on all participants. Scabies was diagnosed based on the criteria of the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS). Participants were mostly female (61.5%) and had a median age of 18.8 years (IQR 13-25). Two hundred out of 283 (71%) of participants had scabies with most (47%) presenting with moderate disease. Impetigo was found in 22% of participants with scabies and 10.8% of those without scabies [RR 2.27 (95% CI 1.21-4.27)]. 119 participants who received scabies treatment in the past months still had clinical evidence of the disease. 97% of participants reported a recent scabies contact. Scabies was commoner in participants ≤16 years compared to those >16 years [RR 3.06 (95% CI 1.73-5.45)].
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of scabies was extremely high. The lack of a systematic approach to scabies treatment led to recurrence and ongoing community spread. The IACS criteria was useful in this outbreak assessment in Ghana. Alternative strategies such as Mass drug administration may be required to contain outbreaks early in such settings.","['Amoako YA', 'Phillips RO', 'Arthur J', 'Abugri MA', 'Akowuah E', 'Amoako KO', 'Marfo BA', 'Frimpong M', 'van der Werf T', 'Ravensbergen SJ', 'Stienstra Y']",2020,14,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Amoako YA, et al.

33333955,Intolerable Burden of Impetigo in Endemic Settings: A Review of the Current State of Play and Future Directions for Alternative Treatments.,"Impetigo (school sores) is a common superficial bacterial skin infection affecting around 162 million children worldwide, with the highest burden in Australian Aboriginal children. While impetigo itself is treatable, if left untreated, it can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as chronic heart and kidney diseases. Topical antibiotics are often considered the treatment of choice for impetigo, but the clinical efficacy of these treatments is declining at an alarming rate due to the rapid emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In remote settings in Australia, topical antibiotics are no longer used for impetigo due to the troubling rise of antimicrobial resistance, demanding the use of oral and injectable antibiotic therapies. However, widespread use of these agents not only contributes to existing resistance, but also associated with adverse consequences for individuals and communities. These underscore the urgent need to reinvigorate the antibiotic discovery and alternative impetigo therapies in these settings. This review discusses the current impetigo treatment challenges in endemic settings in Australia and explores potential alternative antimicrobial therapies. The goals are to promote intensified research programs to facilitate effective use of currently available treatments, as well as developing new alternatives for impetigo.","['Abrha S', 'Tesfaye W', 'Thomas J']",2020,9,12,Antibiotics (Basel),"Abrha S, et al.

Many disease-causing S aureus strains are methicillin resistant; thus, empiric therapy should be given to cover methicillin-resistant S aureus. Bacterial wound cultures are important for characterizing local susceptibility patterns. Definitive antibiotic therapy is warranted, although there are no compelling data demonstrating superiority of any one antibiotic over another. Antibiotic choice is predicated by the infection severity, local susceptibility patterns, and drug-related safety, tolerability, and cost.

A three-year-old girl with a previous history of mild atopic dermatitis presented in our Pediatric Dermatology Clinic in poor general condition, with a skin rash predominantly consisting of generalized large blisters with hypopyon sign and erosions. On a closer look, scattered erythematous papules and vesicles were also visible. A positive Tzanck smear from an intact pinhead-sized vesicle and VZV PCR confirmed the clinical diagnosis of chickenpox. Cultures from hypopyon material revealed Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. We report an exceptional, not-yet described complication of chickenpox with hypopyon-forming superinfection in an atopic child. In addition, our case nicely underscores the necessity of early VZV vaccination, which has been available and recommended now for more than 10 years in pediatric vaccination programs to avoid severe complications.","['Gorris A', 'Weiss D', 'Kogler H', 'Szépfalusi Z', 'Karlhofer F', 'Handisurya A', 'Weninger W', 'Kinaciyan T']",2021,171,3-4,Wien Med Wochenschr,"Gorris A, et al.

Information is limited on incidence of SSTIs in the presence of endemic scabies. We conducted a prospective study of hospital admissions for SSTIs in the Northern Division of Fiji (population: 131,914). Prospective surveillance for admissions with impetigo, abscess, cellulitis, wound infection, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, infected scabies, and crusted scabies was conducted at the Division's referral hospital between 2018 to 2019. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, clinical features, microbiology, treatment and outcomes. Over the study period, 788 SSTI admissions were recorded corresponding to a population incidence 647 per 100,000 person-years (95%CI 571-660). Incidence was highest at the extremes of age with peak incidence in children aged <5 years (908 per 100,000) and those aged ≥65 years (1127 per 100,000). Incidence was 1.7 times higher among the Indigenous Fijian population (753 per 100,000) compared to other ethnicities (442 per 100,000). Overall case fatality rate was 3.3%, and 10.8% for those aged ≥65 years. Scabies was diagnosed concurrently in 7.6% of all patients and in 24.6% of admitted children <5 years. There is a very high burden of hospital admissions for SSTIs in Fiji compared to high-income settings especially among the youngest, oldest and indigenous population which is concordant with scabies and impetigo distribution in this population.

There is a need for high quality data from sub-Saharan Africa and peri-urban settings to inform scale up of scabies control efforts. There have been anecdotal reports of scabies being a public health problem in Liberia but robust data are lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional cluster-randomised prevalence survey for scabies in a peri-urban community in Monrovia, Liberia in February-March 2020. Participants underwent a standardised examination conducted by trained local health care workers. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using age-appropriate versions of the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Prevalence estimates were calculated accounting for clustering at community and household levels and associations with key demographic variables assessed through multivariable random-effects logistic regression. 1,318 participants from 477 households were surveyed. The prevalence of scabies was 9.3% (95% CI: 6.5-13.2%), across 75 (19.7%) households; impetigo or infected scabies prevalence was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4-1.9%). The majority (52%) of scabies cases were classified as severe. Scabies prevalence was lower in females and higher in the youngest age group; no associations were found with other collected demographic or socio-economic variables. DLQI scores indicated a very or extremely large effect on HRQoL in 29% of adults and 18% of children diagnosed with scabies. Our study indicates a substantial burden of scabies in this peri-urban population in Liberia. This was associated with significant impact on quality of life, highlighting the need for action to control scabies in this population. Further work is needed to assess the impact of interventions in this context on both the prevalence of scabies and quality of life.","['Collinson S', 'Timothy J', 'Zayzay SK', 'Kollie KK', 'Lebas E', 'Candy N', 'Halliday KE', 'Pullan R', 'Fallah M', 'Walker SL', 'Marks M']",2020,14,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Collinson S, et al.

33278622,The economic and health burdens of diseases caused by group A Streptococcus in New Zealand.,"OBJECTIVES: In preparation for the future arrival of a group A Streptococcus (GAS) vaccine, this study estimated the economic and health burdens of GAS diseases in New Zealand (NZ).
METHODS: The annual incidence of GAS diseases was based on extrapolation of the average number of primary healthcare episodes managed each year in general practices (2014-2016) and on the average number of hospitalizations occurring each year (2005-2014). Disease incidence was multiplied by the average cost of diagnosing and managing an episode of disease at each level of care to estimate the annual economic burden.
RESULTS: GAS affected 1.5% of the population each year, resulting in an economic burden of 29.2 million NZ dollars (2015 prices) and inflicting a health burden of 2373 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Children <5 years of age were the most likely age group to present for GAS-related healthcare. Presentations for superficial throat and skin infections (predominantly pharyngitis and impetigo) were more common than other GAS diseases. Cellulitis contributed the most to the total economic and health burdens. Invasive and immune-mediated diseases disproportionately contributed to the total economic and health burdens relative to their frequency of occurrence.
CONCLUSION: Preventing GAS diseases would have substantial economic and health benefits in NZ and globally.","['Cannon JW', 'Zhung J', 'Bennett J', 'Moreland NJ', 'Baker MG', 'Geelhoed E', 'Fraser J', 'Carapetis JR', 'Jack S']",2021,103,,Int J Infect Dis,"Cannon JW, et al.

33275592,"Community perspectives on scabies, impetigo and mass drug administration in Fiji: A qualitative study.","Scabies is endemic in Fiji and is a significant cause of morbidity. Little is known about the sociocultural beliefs and practices that affect the occurrence of scabies and impetigo, or community attitudes towards the strategy of mass drug administration that is emerging as a public health option for scabies and impetigo control in Fiji and other countries. Data were collected during semi-structured interviews with 33 community members in four locations in Fiji's Northern Division. Thematic analysis examined participants' lived experiences of scabies and impetigo; community knowledge and perceptions about scabies and impetigo aetiology and transmission; community-based treatment and prevention measures; and attitudes towards mass drug administration. Many indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) participants noted extensive and ongoing experience of scabies and impetigo among children in their families and communities, but only one participant of Indian descent (Indo-Fijian) identified personal childhood experience of scabies. Scabies and impetigo were perceived as diseases affecting children, impacting on school attendance and families' quality of sleep. Awareness of scabies and impetigo was considerable, but there were major misconceptions around disease causation and transmission. Traditional remedies were preferred for scabies treatment, followed by biomedicines provided by local health centres and hospitals. Treatment of close household contacts was not prioritised. Attitudes towards mass drug administration to control scabies were mostly positive, although some concerns were noted about adverse effects and hesitation to participate in the planned scabies elimination programme. Findings from this first study to document perspectives and experiences related to scabies and impetigo and their management in the Asia Pacific region illustrate that a community-centred approach to scabies and impetigo is needed for the success of control efforts in Fiji, and most likely in other affected countries. This includes community-based health promotion messaging on the social dynamics of scabies transmission, and a campaign of education and community engagement prior to mass drug administration.","['Mitchell E', 'Bell S', 'Thean LJ', 'Sahukhan A', 'Kama M', 'Koroivueti A', 'Kaldor J', 'Steer A', 'Romani L']",2020,14,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mitchell E, et al.

33241298,Health Disparities among Australia's Remote-Dwelling Aboriginal People: A Report from 2020.,"BACKGROUND: Australia has 2 distinct indigenous groups, Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines. The Aborigines, described in this report, first colonized the continent 65 millennia ago. Those still living in the Northern Territory (NT) retain much ancestrally derived genetic complement but also are the most health-challenged by environment and lifestyle in 21st century. Reports providing overviews of these disparities are, as yet, rare.
CONTENT: This review defines the studied population and then describes and attempts to explain contemporary clinical findings among Australia's remote-dwelling Aborigines, principally in the NT. The report is structured by life stage and then by organ system. Finally, a brief synthesis is advanced concerning the disparities that Australia's Aboriginals face.
SUMMARY: In 2015-2017, NT aboriginal life expectancy for people then born was 66.6 years for men and 69.9 years for women compared with 78.1 and 82.7 years, respectively, among nonindigenous Territorians. Principal causes of the reduced longevity, with nonindigenous comparisons, include adolescent pregnancy, with maternal use of alcohol and tobacco (each 7-fold greater); fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; skin infections, both scabies and impetigo (50-fold greater); rheumatic heart disease (260-fold greater); premature acute myocardial infarction (9-fold greater); bronchiectasis (40-fold greater); lung cancer (2-fold greater); diabetes mellitus (10-fold greater); renal failure (30-fold greater); and suicide (2-fold greater).

Dermatologic manifestations are one of the sequelae after transplantation. To study the prevalence and associated risk factors of dermatologic manifestations after pediatric LT and HSCT. A 20-year retrospective cohort study was conducted in children, aged ≤15 years, who received LT or HSCT from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Medical records were reviewed for data collection until December 31, 2018. A total of 70 LT and 51 HSCT recipients were included. The percentages of overall dermatologic manifestations after LT and HSCT were 64.3% and 64.7%, respectively. Viral infection was the most common manifestation in both groups, with mucocutaneous HSV infection as the most prevalent. One HSCT recipient developed leukemia cutis. GVHD was revealed in 27.5% of HSCT recipients. Impetigo and xerosis were significantly observed in patients using azathioprine and prednisolone. Approximately two-thirds of pediatric LT and HSCT recipients experienced dermatologic manifestations, potentially associated with immunosuppressive agents. Thus, regular skin examination and optimized immunosuppression would be beneficial in these recipients.","['Tangthanapalakul A', 'Chaijitraruch N', 'Techavichit P', 'Sosothikul D', 'Chatproedprai S', 'Chongsrisawat V', 'Tempark T', 'Wananukul S']",2021,25,3,Pediatr Transplant,"Tangthanapalakul A, et al.

33105179,Impetigo.,"Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial infection of the skin, with a global disease burden of greater than 140 million. Children are more affected than adults and incidence decreases with age. Principal pathogens implicated include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. There are two common variants of impetigo: nonbullous (70%) and bullous (30%). Nonbullous impetigo is caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes whereas bullous impetigo is caused by S. aureus. The classic appearance of distinctive honey-colored, crusted legions aids in diagnosis, which is most often based on clinical presentation. The disease is generally mild and felt to be self-limited; however, antimicrobial treatment is often initiated to reduce spread and shorten clinical course. Treatment for limited impetigo is topical whereas oral therapy is recommended for extensive cases. Rising rates of bacterial resistance to standard treatment regimens should inform treatment decisions. Complications, while rare, can occur.",['Johnson MK'],2020,42,4,Adv Emerg Nurs J,Johnson MK.

33035362,Efficacy and safety of treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α drugs for severe impetigo herpetiformis.,"Impetigo herpetiformis (IH) is a rare pustular dermatosis. It can be life-threatening for both the mother and fetus and often causes therapeutic problems. However, there is no specific guideline for the treatment of IH and the evidence regarding the efficacy of treatments for IH has not been established. Herein, we report two cases of IH, which were successfully treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α drugs. The serum levels of the drugs in the infants and mothers were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Case 1 was a 35-year-old, gravida 2, para 1, female patient in week 20 of pregnancy; she was treated with adalimumab (ADA) until delivery. Case 2 was a 26-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, female patient in week 30 of pregnancy; she was treated with certolizumab pegol (CZP) until delivery. In both cases, the skin lesions started regressing considerably after administration of the biologic agents. We examined the serum levels of the biologic agents in the mothers and infants using ELISA. In case 1, the ADA serum level in the infant was as high as that in the mother at birth; it then decreased below the lower limit of quantification at week 12 post-delivery. In case 2, the CZP serum level in the infant was below the lower limit of quantification at birth. In this report, we revealed that biologic agents could be an effective treatment for severe IH and that CZP treatment can be considered safe for the mothers and fetuses.","['Fukushima H', 'Iwata Y', 'Arima M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sugiura K']",2021,48,2,J Dermatol,"Fukushima H, et al.

33017395,Estimation of the force of infection and infectious period of skin sores in remote Australian communities using interval-censored data.,"Prevalence of impetigo (skin sores) remains high in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, Fiji, and other areas of socio-economic disadvantage. Skin sore infections, driven primarily in these settings by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) contribute substantially to the disease burden in these areas. Despite this, estimates for the force of infection, infectious period and basic reproductive ratio-all necessary for the construction of dynamic transmission models-have not been obtained. By utilising three datasets each containing longitudinal infection information on individuals, we estimate each of these epidemiologically important parameters. With an eye to future study design, we also quantify the optimal sampling intervals for obtaining information about these parameters. We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.","['Lydeamore MJ', 'Campbell PT', 'Price DJ', 'Wu Y', 'Marcato AJ', 'Cuningham W', 'Carapetis JR', 'Andrews RM', 'McDonald MI', 'McVernon J', 'Tong SYC', 'McCaw JM']",2020,16,10,PLoS Comput Biol,"Lydeamore MJ, et al.

32868360,Protocol for a cluster-randomised non-inferiority trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin for the control of scabies using a mass drug administration strategy (the RISE study).,"INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a significant contributor to global morbidity, affecting approximately 200 million people at any time. Scabies is endemic in many resource-limited tropical settings. Bacterial skin infection (impetigo) frequently complicates scabies infestation in these settings. Community-wide ivermectin-based mass drug administration (MDA) is an effective control strategy for scabies in island settings, with a single round of MDA reducing population prevalence by around 90%. However, current two-dose regimens present a number of barriers to programmatic MDA implementation. We designed the Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial to investigate whether one-dose MDA may be as effective as two-dose MDA in controlling scabies in high-prevalence settings.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RISE is a cluster-randomised non-inferiority trial. The study will be conducted in 20 isolated villages in Western Province of Solomon Islands where population prevalence of scabies is approximately 20%. Villages will be randomly allocated to receive either one dose or two doses of ivermectin-based MDA in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of the study is to determine if ivermectin-based MDA with one dose is as effective as MDA with two doses in reducing the prevalence of scabies after 12 months. Secondary objectives include the effect of ivermectin-based MDA on impetigo prevalence after 12 and 24 months, the prevalence of scabies at 24 months after the intervention, the impact on presentation to health facilities with scabies and impetigo, and the safety of one-dose and two-dose MDA.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the ethics review committees of the Solomon Islands and the Royal Children's Hospital, Australia. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and in meetings with the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health and Medical Services and participating communities.

32693853,Using the MCRISP Network for Surveillance of Pediatric Exanthema in Child Care Centers.,"BACKGROUND: Systematic monitoring of exanthema is largely absent from public health surveillance despite emerging diseases and threats of bioterrorism. Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is the first online program in child care centers to report pediatric exanthema.
METHODS: MCRISP aggregated daily counts of children sick, absent, or reported ill by parents. We extracted all MCRISP exanthema cases from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019. Cases were assessed with descriptive statistics and counts were used to construct epidemic curves.
RESULTS: 360 exanthema cases were reported from 12,233 illnesses over 4.5 seasons. Children ages 13-35 months had the highest rash occurrence (45%, n = 162), followed by 36-59 months (41.7%, n = 150), 0-12 months (12.5%, n = 45), and kindergarten (0.8%, n = 3). Centers reported rashes of hand-foot-mouth disease (50%, n = 180), nonspecific rash without fever (15.3%, n = 55), hives (8.1%, n = 29), fever with nonspecific rash (6.9%, n = 25), roseola (3.3%, n = 12), scabies (2.5%, n = 9), scarlet fever (2.5%, n = 9), impetigo (2.2%, n = 8), abscess (1.95, n = 7), viral exanthema without fever (1.7%, n = 6), varicella (1.7%, n = 6), pinworms (0.8%, n = 3), molluscum (0.6%, n = 2), cellulitis (0.6%, n = 2), ringworm (0.6%, n = 2), and shingles (0.2%, n = 1).

32614791,Looking for NTDs in the skin; an entry door for offering patient centered holistic care.,"INTRODUCTION: The majority of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have established primary skin manifestations or associated clinical feature. Skin NTDs often result in physical impairment and disfigurement, which can lead to disability. Skin diseases have been proposed as an entry point for integrated NTDs control. However, the magnitude and overlap of skin NTDs is poorly understood.
METHODOLOGY: An institution-based cross-sectional study was done using medical records of dermatology patients between July 2017 and June 2018 in a dermatology service in Northeast Ethiopia. A total of 661 patient records were selected using simple random sampling.
RESULTS: A total of 656 complete records were included in analysis. Skin NTDs constituted 17.2% (n = 113) of the overall of skin diseases. Of skin NTDS, cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 40; 35.4%), leprosy (n = 38; 33.6%), and scabies (n = 31; 27.4%) were the most common. Additionally, there were four cases of mycetoma. Of the non NTDs, poverty-related infections such as superficial fungal (n = 118; 21.1%) and bacterial (n = 33; 5.2%) infections were also frequent. Tinea capitis was the most common superficial fungal infections. Impetigo and cellulitis were the predominant bacterial infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Skin NTDsand other poverty related skin infections were common at the dermatology service. Dermatological services could act as a good entry point for integrated management of skin NTDs. Future studies should assess how different preventive strategies like contact tracing, early diagnosis and mass drug administration can be integrated.","['Abdela SG', 'Diro E', 'Zewdu FT', 'Berhe FT', 'Yeshaneh WE', 'Tamirat KS', 'Tweya H', 'Timire C', 'Van Griensven J']",2020,14,6.1,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Abdela SG, et al.

32550690,Treatment of Impetigo in the Pediatric Population: Consensus and Future Directions.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. Treatment of localized lesions can be achieved through topical antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are reserved for extensive disease. Increasing antimicrobial resistance to existing therapies have raised concerns. Antimicrobial stewardship, achieved through the responsible use of antibiotics, is an important measure to re-duce bacterial resistance. This review highlights treatment options for impetigo and shares consensus statements to help guide the management of impetigo in the pediatric population.
OBJECTIVE: An expert panel of dermatologists and pediatricians convened in February 2019 to establish evidence-based consensus on the management of impetigo in the pediatric patient population.
METHODS: The consensus was created in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Prior to the consensus meeting, a systematic literature review was conducted, with the selected literature deemed clinically relevant to the consensus statements. Statements were further refined and assessed systematically following established standards. The consensus process consisted of a modified Delphi approach. The consensus was established through a minimal 75% &ldquo;agree&rdquo; rate.
RESULTS: Thirteen consensus statements were developed addressing clinical challenges, existing treatment options and their limita-tions, and new therapeutic alternatives.
CONCLUSION: Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in treating impetigo has been reported. Antimicrobial stewardship is critical to optimize patient outcomes and to prevent the development of resistance. Healthcare providers should be aware of local resistance patterns in impetigo to help guide therapy. The use of newer safe and effective topical antibiotic alternatives as a first-line treatment should be an important step in antimicrobial stewardship.J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(3): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.4679.","['Schachner LA', 'Torrelo A', 'Grada A', 'Micali G', 'Kwong PC', 'Scott GB', 'Benjamin L', 'Gonzalez ME', 'Andriessen A', 'Eberlein T', 'Eichenfield LF']",2020,19,3,J Drugs Dermatol,"Schachner LA, et al.

Moreover, particular situations, such as skin diseases of bacterial origin in pregnancy and infants often warrant topical therapy. However, the occurrence of local delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance are becoming great challenges faced by many dermatologists today. This narrative review provides an overview of the main topical antibiotics used in dermatology, focusing on their clinical role in the most common dermatological indications. For this purpose, a review of MEDLINE and PubMed for pertinent, scientific, and clinical publications until March 2020 was performed.

32415796,Kampo medicines suppress the production of exfoliative toxins causing impetigo in Staphylococcus aureus.,"An alternative approach, such as antivirulence therapy that modulates the production of bacterial toxins or virulence factors, is necessary to tackle the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains. Here, we investigated the potential antivirulence effects of seven Kampo medicines (Jumihaidokuto, Eppikajutsuto, Jizusoippo, Shomakakkonto, Sammotsuogonto, Hainosankyuto and Inchinkoto) against exfoliative toxin (ET)-positive Staphylococcus aureus, which is the major causative agent of impetigo. A growth inhibition assay showed that all of the selected Kampo medicines inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 1/5 (2.5 mg/mL) or less of the conventionally used concentrations. Among these, Jizusoippo and Inchinkoto (0.25-1 mg/mL) suppressed the production of ET without inhibiting the bacterial growth. Furthermore, Jizusoippo and Inchinkoto significantly suppressed the expression of ET genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings strongly suggest, for the first time, that Kampo medicines, especially Jizusoippo and Inchinkoto, have the potential to serve as antivirulence agents against skin infections caused by S. aureus by suppressing the production of ET.","['Katayama I', 'Nakaminami H', 'Yamada T', 'Ikoshi H', 'Noguchi N']",2020,47,7,J Dermatol,"Katayama I, et al.

Treatment of recalcitrant generalized PPP may be challenging as available therapeutic options are limited. We herein present a 24-year-old pregnant woman with generalized PPP accompanied by high fever, fatigue, leukocytosis, and elevated levels of serum acute phase reactants. The patient was resistant to a combination treatment of high-dose cyclosporine (7.5 mg/kg/d, peroral), systemic methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/d, intramuscular), and empirical antibiotherapy. However, she dramatically improved with infliximab (5 mg/kg, intravenous infusion), which was introduced at week 28 of pregnancy. Even within 24 hours after the first infusion of infliximab, pustular lesions began to regress with a rapid decline in fever. Following the third infusion, clearance of pustular lesions with a slight erythema was observed. Serum levels of leukocytes and acute phase reactants returned to normal. There were no adverse events related to infliximab therapy. At 40 weeks, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby. Our experience reported herein suggests that infliximab may serve as a rapidly acting, highly effective, and well-tolerated ""rescue"" therapy in recalcitrant generalized PPP, which poses a big therapeutic challenge for clinicians.","['Babuna Kobaner G', 'Polat Ekinci A']",2020,33,4,Dermatol Ther,Babuna Kobaner G and Polat Ekinci A.

32383305,The in vitro antibacterial effect of permethrin and formaldehyde on Staphylococcus aureus.,"Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a threat to human health, and effective treatment options against them are needed. This study aimed to determine whether the insecticide permethrin was capable of inhibiting the growth of S. aureus or if some other component of a permethrin cream was responsible for a decrease in scabies associated bacterial infection previously observed. Ten S. aureus strains were grown in the presence of permethrin and formaldehyde both alone and in combination with percent inhibition determined by viable counts. Also, a time-kill assay was conducted on S. aureus exposed to the same conditions. Finally, the morphology of S. aureus grown in the presence of permethrin was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial inhibition by permethrin ranged from 0% to 41% whereas inhibition by formaldehyde was 100%. The time-kill curves of permethrin exposed cells were very similar to the positive growth control while the formaldehyde and combination exposure showed complete inhibition even at the 0-hr time point. The scanning electron micrographs of permethrin grown S. aureus showed healthy cocci cells with no sign of cell damage. Our results show that permethrin is not capable of inhibiting the growth of bacteria enough for it to be termed bactericidal. Formaldehyde is a known antiseptic and therefore was responsible for the antibacterial effect observed after the use of permethrin cream.","['Nikolic P', 'Mudgil P', 'Whitehall J']",2020,9,8,Microbiologyopen,"Nikolic P, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence and associations of impetigo in general practice (GP) registrars' consultations.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study data.
RESULTS: Impetigo was managed in 0.24% of problems and 0.43% of consultations. Patient variables associated with impetigo presentations were younger age and impetigo as a new problem, while patients with non-English-speaking backgrounds were less likely to present with impetigo. Associated registrar variables were being new to the registrar and practicing in outer regional/remote locations. Compared with all other problems/diagnoses, impetigo more often involved information seeking, ordering pathology, and prescription of medication, but less often involved follow-up or referral.
CONCLUSIONS: Impetigo accounts for 0.43 per 100 GP registrar consultations in Australia. Association with outer regional/remote areas may reflect climate and socioeconomic factors that predispose to impetigo. Associated pathology requests may reflect a lack of confidence in GP registrars' management of impetigo. Cultural differences may exist regarding health-seeking behavior relating to impetigo.","['Gorges H', 'Heal C', 'van Driel M', 'Tapley A', 'Davis J', 'Davey A', 'Holliday E', 'Ball J', 'Najib N', 'Spike N', 'Fitzgerald K', 'Magin P']",2020,10,2,Dermatol Pract Concept,"Gorges H, et al.

On examination, there are erythematous, umbilicated papules and vesicles, some with erosions and crusting, surrounding the mouth and areolas; a few lesions are visible on the forearms. The mucous membranes were unaffected, the patient was afebrile, and no lymphadenopathies were present. A diagnosis of eczema herpeticum (HE) was suspected, and a direct fluorescent antibody test was positive for herpes simplex virus. Even when the clinical presentation is characteristic, the eruption might be confused with other infections like impetigo and primary varicella infection. Misdiagnosis can lead to severe complications, including bacteremia and death. EH is considered a medical emergency, and the index of suspicion for this infection should be high among clinicians. Prompt treatment with oral acyclovir should be initiated; in cases of severe disease or immunocompromised patients, hospitalization for systemic antivirals is required. If EH is recognized early it is easily and effectively treated.

AD may impair patient quality of life in a number of ways, one of which is its impact on sleep. The way that the condition affects sleep has not yet been fully elucidated; it is clear that the symptoms of the disease such as pruritus and scratching can affect sleep but other factors, such as changes in the immunological system related to the disease can also have an effect. We argue that this relationship may be bi-directional, with changes to the skin barrier (barrier dysfunction, alterations in its microbiome and oxidative stress) and immunological function caused by the condition impairing sleep and leading to imbalanced inflammatory pathways that exacerbate AD and other associated conditions such as impetigo. We highlight the need for further studies to investigate this correlation between AD and sleep to make the role of this relationship clearer.","['Xerfan EMS', 'Tomimori J', 'Andersen ML', 'Tufik S', 'Facina AS']",2020,140,,Med Hypotheses,"Xerfan EMS, et al.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether AD is associated with skin infections and related outcomes.
METHODS: Data from the 2006 to 2012 National Emergency Department Sample were analyzed, including an approximately 20% sample of all US emergency department (ED) visits (N = 198,102,435 adults or children).
RESULTS: Skin infections were increased in ED visits of adults (7.14% vs 3.76%) and children (5.15% vs 2.48%) with AD. In multivariable logistic regression models, AD was associated with significantly higher odds of skin infection in adults (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.93 [1.89-1.97]) and children (2.23 [2.16-2.31]).

32008574,Osteomyelitis complicating secondarily infected atopic eczema: two case reports and a narrative literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Atopic eczema is a relapsing, itchy chronic cutaneous inflammatory disease that commonly affects children. The disease is often complicated by cutaneous infections such as eczema herpeticum, eczema vaccinatum and a varied number of bacterial infections - impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas. However, rare case reports of infective endocarditis, otitis media and osteo-articular infections have been associated with atopic eczema. These associations possibly represent the extracutaneous infectious complications of atopic eczema.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present two cases of osteomyelitis in HIV negative children with habitual scratching of poorly managed and/or uncontrolled atopic eczema respectively. Both cases presented to the orthopaedic surgeons and were admitted as acute phalangeal osteomyelitis and acute - on - chronic tibial osteomyelitis respectively. The first case was an 8 year old girl who had moderate-severe poorly-controlled atopic eczema and contiguously spread phalangeal osteomyelitis. The second case was an 11 year old pre-pubertal boy who had untreated atopic eczema and tibial osteomyelitis possibly from haematogenously spread Staphylococcus aureus infection. Both were successfully discharged from hospital and currently have well controlled eczema. The 11 year old patient is also being reviewed monthly by the orthopaedic surgeons and is chronic suppressive antibiotics. He may require sequestrectomy, should it be needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Invasive staphylococcal and streptococcal osteo-articular (OA) infection can arise as an extra-cutaneous infectious complication of poorly controlled atopic eczema. It is more common in the 3 to 15 year age group and especially in boys with a septic arthritis to osteomyelitis ratio of around 29:5. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with moderate-severe atopic eczema and they ought to promptly manage these OA infections with intravenous antibiotics to avoid further complications.","['Masuka JT', 'Troisi K', 'Mkhize Z']",2020,20,1,BMC Dermatol,"Masuka JT, et al.

Staphylococci and streptococci are the most common pathogens. Uncomplicated impetigo and ecthyma can be managed with topical antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be prescribed for patients with complicated impetigo and ecthyma and for patients with cellulitis. For patients with cellulitis and systemic signs of infection, systemic antibiotics are indicated but hospitalization or intravenous administration may not be required. Erysipelas can be managed with oral or intravenous penicillin. Purulent SSTIs by definition involve collections of pus and include abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles. Larger abscesses are appropriate for incision and drainage. Patients with uncomplicated carbuncles or abscesses may not require antibiotics afterward. However, antibiotics are recommended for patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have not improved with initial antibiotic therapy, patients with impaired host defenses, and patients with SIRS and hypotension.",['Trelease-Bell A'],2020,489,,FP Essent,Trelease-Bell A.

This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin in paediatric patients by age group.
METHODS: Pooled data for patients aged 6 months to <18 years who had participated in a phase I or in two phase III clinical trials of ozenoxacin 1% cream were analysed by age group: 0.5-<2, 2-<6, 6-<12, and 12-<18 years.
RESULTS: The combined population comprised 529 patients with non-bullous impetigo treated with ozenoxacin (n = 239), vehicle (n = 201), or retapamulin as internal validation control (n = 89). Studies were well matched for extent and severity of impetigo and therapeutic schedule (twice daily application for 5 days). The clinical success rate after 5 days' treatment (day 6-7, end of therapy), and microbiological success rates after 3-4 days' treatment and at the end of therapy, were significantly higher with ozenoxacin than vehicle (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Clinical and bacterial eradication rates were higher with ozenoxacin than vehicle in each age group. No safety concerns were identified with ozenoxacin. One (0.3%) of 327 plasma samples exceeded the lower limit of quantification for ozenoxacin, but the low concentration indicated negligible systemic absorption.
CONCLUSION: This combined analysis supports the efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin administered twice daily for 5 days. Ozenoxacin 1% cream is a new option to consider for treatment of non-bullous impetigo in children aged 6 months to <18 years.","['Torrelo A', 'Grimalt R', 'Masramon X', 'Albareda López N', 'Zsolt I']",2020,236,3,Dermatology,"Torrelo A, et al.

31790819,A review of the antimicrobial potential of herbal drugs used in popular Italian medicine (1850s-1950s) to treat bacterial skin diseases.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Before the advent of modern antibiotics, microbial infections were treated with herbal medicine or cauterization. Literature from the latter half of the nineteenth to the early mid-twentieth century, when antibiotics became widely available, arguably holds the most progressive information about herbal remedies to treat bacterial skin diseases. The corpus of literature produced in Italy during that period is not easily accessible and mostly out of print.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plant-based remedies utilized in popular Italian medicine to treat anthrax, boils, erysipelas, impetigo, pustules, and whitlow were sourced from literature indexed in and available through the National Library Service website of the Italian Libraries Network. The remedies are assessed for their antimicrobial potential based on a detailed search of the herbal drug species in scientific databases.
RESULTS: A considerable part of the reviewed recipes included specific excipients (41 out of 139) and others were produced with fresh plant material (48 out of 139). Out of the 52 identified herbal drug species used in popular Italian medicine against dermatologic infections, extracts of 43 were shown to have moderate in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
CONCLUSION: The antibacterial activity of the extracts and pure compounds as reported in the reviewed literature is mostly based on in vitro assays and generally does not encourage follow up studies. The effectiveness of the reported recipes, which include fresh plant material and excipients can only be assessed through in vivo studies. Those remedies including herbal drugs with reported antimicrobial activity might have the potential as complementary therapies. The reviewed plant based antimicrobial recipes might serve as inspirations in the search for alternative topical antibacterial strategies and the search for their synergistic and potentiating ingredients.","['Mazzei R', 'Leonti M', 'Spadafora S', 'Patitucci A', 'Tagarelli G']",2020,250,,J Ethnopharmacol,"Mazzei R, et al.

31755570,Disseminated bullous impetigo and atopic dermatitis: Case series and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common skin infection of early childhood, resulting from desmoglein-1 cleavage by Staphylococcus aureus exfoliative toxins. Due to compromised barrier function and immune dysregulation, children with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at increased risk of cutaneous infections, yet no literature has been published on disseminated bullous impetigo (DBI) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to explore the atopic phenotypes, antibiotic sensitivities, and treatment courses of children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at our institution.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of 12 children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at Johns Hopkins from 12/2016 to 5/2017.
RESULTS: Eleven children (92%) had severe AD. All children were initially misdiagnosed; the majority (67%) were misdiagnosed with AD flares, and other misdiagnoses included scabies, eczema herpeticum, ecthyma, varicella, and eczema coxsackium. All cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Three children (25%) had clindamycin-resistant strains of MSSA, and only one child was positive for both MSSA and methicillin-resistant S aureus. All children were treated with systemic antibiotics and experienced resolution of symptoms within 24-48 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: This case series is the first of its kind exploring children with DBI with the atopic diathesis. Our results indicate that DBI is often misdiagnosed, and increased training is likely needed for pediatricians, emergency room physicians, and dermatologists. Earlier diagnosis of bullous impetigo may prevent dissemination and spare a patient treatment with systemic antibiotics. Given the high rate of clindamycin resistance observed in this series, we recommend cephalosporins to treat uncomplicated cases of DBI.","['Mannschreck D', 'Feig J', 'Selph J', 'Cohen B']",2020,37,1,Pediatr Dermatol,"Mannschreck D, et al.

31748786,Longitudinal Analysis of Group A Streptococcus emm Types and emm Clusters in a High-Prevalence Setting: Relationship between Past and Future Infections.,"Group A Streptococcus is a pathogen of global importance, but despite the ubiquity of group A Streptococcus infections, the relationship between infection, colonization, and immunity is still not completely understood. The M protein, encoded by the emm gene, is a major virulence factor and vaccine candidate and forms the basis of a number of classification systems. Longitudinal patterns of emm types collected from 457 Fijian schoolchildren over a 10-month period were analyzed. No evidence of tissue tropism was observed, and there was no apparent selective pressure or constraint of emm types. Patterns of emm type acquisition suggest limited, if any, modification of future infection based on infection history. Where impetigo is the dominant mode of transmission, circulating emm types either may not be constrained by ecological niches or population immunity to the M protein, or they may require several infections over a longer period of time to induce such immunity.","['Campbell PT', 'Tong SYC', 'Geard N', 'Davies MR', 'Worthing KA', 'Lacey JA', 'Smeesters PR', 'Batzloff MR', 'Kado J', 'Jenney AWJ', 'Mcvernon J', 'Steer AC']",2020,221,9,J Infect Dis,"Campbell PT, et al.

31662391,Antibiotic stewardship in skin infections: a cross-sectional analysis of early-career GP's management of impetigo.,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence and associations of systemic antibiotic prescription for impetigo by early-career general practitioners (GPs) (GP registrars in their first 18 months in general practice).
DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study.
SETTING: ReCEnT is an ongoing multisite cohort study of Australian registrars' in-consultation clinical practice across five Australian states.
PARTICIPANTS: Registrars participating in ReCEnT from 2010 to 2017.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Management of impetigo with systemic antibiotics.
RESULTS: 1741 registrars (response rate 96%) provided data from 384 731 problems identified in 246 434 consultations. Impetigo, on first presentation or follow-up, was managed in 930 (0.38%, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.40) consultations and comprised 0.24% (95% CI 0.23 to 0.26) of problems. 683 patients presented with a new diagnosis of impetigo of which 38/683 (5.6%) were not prescribed antibiotics; 239/683 (35.0%) were prescribed solely topical antibiotics; 306/683 (44.8%) solely systemic antibiotics and 100/683 (14.6%) both systemic and topical antibiotics. The most common systemic antibiotic prescribed was cephalexin (53.5%). Variables independently associated with prescription of systemic antibiotics were an inner regional (compared with major city) location (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.13; p=0.028), seeking in-consultation information or advice (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.23; p<0.001) and ordering pathology (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.33; p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Australian early-career GPs prescribe systemic antibiotics (the majority broad-spectrum) for a high proportion of initial impetigo presentations. Impetigo guidelines should clearly specify criteria for systemic antibiotic prescription and individual antibiotic choice. The role of non-antibiotic management and topical antiseptics needs to be explored further.","['Heal C', 'Gorges H', 'van Driel ML', 'Tapley A', 'Davis J', 'Davey A', 'Holliday L', 'Ball J', 'Najib N', 'Spike N', 'FitzGerald K', 'Magin P']",2019,9,10,BMJ Open,"Heal C, et al.

31630410,Skin infections in Australian Aboriginal children: a narrative review.,"Impetigo, scabies, cellulitis and abscesses are common in Australian Aboriginal children. These conditions adversely affect wellbeing and are associated with serious long term sequelae, including invasive infection and post-infectious complications, such as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, which occurs at the highest documented rates in the world in remote Aboriginal communities. Observational research in remote communities in northern Australia has demonstrated a high concurrent burden of scabies and impetigo and their post-infectious complications. Few data are available for other Australian states, especially for urban Aboriginal children; however, nationwide hospital data indicate that the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in skin infection prevalence also exists in urban settings. The Australian National Healthy Skin Guideline summarises evidence-based treatment of impetigo, scabies and fungal infections in high burden settings such as remote Aboriginal communities. It recommends systemic antibiotics for children with impetigo, and either topical permethrin or oral ivermectin (second line) for the individual and their contacts as equally efficacious treatments for scabies. β-Lactams are the treatment of choice and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin are effective alternatives for treatment of paediatric cellulitis. Abscesses require incision and drainage and a 5-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin. Addressing normalisation of skin infections and the social determinants of skin health are key challenges for the clinician. Research is underway on community-wide skin health programs and the role for mass drug administration which will guide future management of these common, treatable diseases.","['Davidson L', 'Knight J', 'Bowen AC']",2020,212,5,Med J Aust,"Davidson L, et al.

31568247,"Prevalence, Clinical Features and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Group A Streptococcal Skin Infections in School Children in Urban Western and Northern Uganda.","BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) skin infections can lead to invasive sepsis, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and potentially rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Within a study to identify predisposing factors of RHD in Ugandan schoolchildren, we determined the prevalence of skin infections and assessed the clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility of GAS skin infection.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted at 3 urban primary schools in Western and Northern Uganda in March 2017. A dermatologist rendered clinical diagnoses and obtained a skin swab specimen from lesions with signs of bacterial infection. Beta-hemolytic colonies underwent Lancefield grouping, species identification by polymerase chain reaction and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
RESULTS: From 3265 schoolchildren, we observed 32% with ≥1 fungal, 1.8% with ≥1 bacterial, 0.9% with ≥1 viral, and 0.2% with ≥1 ectoparasitic infection. Of 79, 25 (32%) specimens were GAS-positive, of which one-third demonstrated tetracycline resistance. Of 17 impetigo cases, 13 (76%) were located on the leg/foot and 3 (18%) on the head/neck. Prevalence of GAS skin infection was 0.8% (25 of 3265). In Northern Uganda, where subclinical definite RHD prevalence is 1.1%, GAS skin infection prevalence was 1.2% (4 of 343) and 0.9% (3 of 352).
CONCLUSION: This study identifies tetracycline-resistant GAS in Ugandan communities, suggests modified skin examination of exposed anatomic locations may be appropriate for population-based GAS skin infection studies, and underscores need for clear case definitions of GAS skin infection. Future studies are needed to evaluate the role of GAS skin infection in development of RHD in Ugandan communities.","['Chang AY', 'Scheel A', 'Dewyer A', 'Hovis IW', 'Sarnacki R', 'Aliku T', 'Okello E', 'Bwanga F', 'Sable C', 'Maurer TA', 'Beaton AZ']",2019,38,12,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Chang AY, et al.

31556861,Severe Group A and Group B Streptococcus Diseases at a Pediatric ICU: Are they Still Sensitive to the Penicillins?,"BACKGROUND: Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and Group B streptococcus (GBS) are two common pathogens that are associated with many diseases in children. Severe infections as a result of these two streptococci are albeit uncommon but associated with high mortality and morbidity, and often necessitate intensive care support. This paper aims to review the mortality and morbidity of severe infection associated with GAS and GBS isolations at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).
METHODS: All children admitted to PICU of a teaching hospital between October 2002 and May 2018 with laboratory-proven GAS and GBS isolations were included.
RESULTS: There were 19 patients (0.7% PICU admissions) with streptococcal isolations (GAS, n=11 and GBS, n=8). Comparing to GAS, GBS affected infants were younger (median age 0.13 versus 5.47 years, 95% CI, 1.7-8.5, p=0.0003), and cerebrospinal fluids more likely positive (p = 0.0181). All GAS and GBS were sensitive to penicillin (CLSI: MICs 0.06 - 2.0 μg/mL), with the majority of GAS sensitive to clindamycin and erythromycin, and half of the GBS resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. Co-infections were prevalent, but viruses were only isolated with GAS (p=0.024). Isolation of GAS and GBS was associated with nearly 40% mortality and high rates of mechanical ventilation and inotropic supports. All non-survivors had high mortality (PIM2) and sepsis scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe GAS and GBS are rare but associated with high mortality and rates of mechanical ventilation and inotropic supports in PICU. The streptococci are invariably sensitive to penicillin. The high PIM2 and Sepsis scores suggest that prompt recognition of sepsis and the timely judicious institution of antibiotics and intensive care support may be life-saving for these devastating infections.","['Hon KL', 'Chow TC', 'Cheung TS', 'Lam WT', 'Hung LT', 'So KW', 'Margaret IP', 'Qian SY']",2020,15,2,Curr Clin Pharmacol,"Hon KL, et al.

31551385,"SToP (See, Treat, Prevent) skin sores and scabies trial: study protocol for a cluster randomised, stepped-wedge trial for skin disease control in remote Western Australia.","INTRODUCTION: Skin is important in Australian Aboriginal culture informing kinship and identity. In many remote Aboriginal communities, scabies and impetigo are very common. Untreated skin infections are painful, itchy and frequently go untreated due to under-recognition and lack of awareness of their potential serious complications. We hypothesise that the skin infection burden in remote Aboriginal communities can be reduced by implementing streamlined training and treatment pathways integrated with environmental health and health promotion activities, tested in the See, Treat, Prevent (SToP skin sores and scabies) trial.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SToP will evaluate a skin control programme using a stepped-wedge, cluster randomised trial design with three intervention components (the 'SToP activities'): (1) seeing skin infections (development of training resources implemented within a community dermatology model); (2) treating skin infections (employing the latest evidence for impetigo, and scabies treatment); and (3) preventing skin infections (embedded, culturally informed health promotion and environmental health activities). Four community clusters in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia will participate. Following baseline data collection, two clusters will be randomly allocated to the SToP activities. At 12 months, the remaining two clusters will transition to the SToP activities. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of impetigo in children (5-9 years) at school-based surveillance. Secondary outcome measures include scabies diagnosis, other child health indicators, resistance to cotrimoxazole in circulating pathogenic bacteria, determining the economic burden of skin disease and evaluating the cost effectiveness of SToP activities.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol was approved by the health ethics review committees at the Child and Adolescent Health Service (Approval number RGS0000000584), the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (Reference number: 819) and the University of Western Australia (Reference RA/4/20/4123). Study findings will be shared with community members, academic and medical communities via publications and presentations, and in reports to funders. Authorship for all publications based on this study will be determined in line with the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Sharing results with organisations and communities who contributed to the study is paramount. The results of the SToP trial will be shared with participants in a suitable format, such as a single summary page provided to participants or presentations to communities, the Kimberly Aboriginal Health Planning Forum Research Subcommittee and other stakeholders as appropriate and as requested. Communication and dissemination will require ongoing consultation with Aboriginal communities to determine appropriate formats.

31540550,"Talking skin: attitudes and practices around skin infections, treatment options, and their clinical management in a remote region in Western Australia.","INTRODUCTION: Skin infections including scabies and impetigo have a high burden and cause significant morbidity in remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about community, healthcare practitioner and service provider perspectives on skin infections and treatment preferences. An increased understanding of their respective knowledge, attitudes and practices will contribute to improving healthcare seeking behaviour, improved diagnosis, treatment acceptability and quality of care within remote Aboriginal communities. The aim of this study was to explore Aboriginal parent/carer, healthcare practitioner, and service provider attitudes and practices regarding skin infections in Aboriginal communities in remote communities in the Pilbara, Western Australia. The study documents their perspectives and preferences regarding treatments for skin infections, as well as the perceived barriers and enablers to treatment uptake for scabies and impetigo amongst Aboriginal families in this region.
METHODS: A qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions was conducted with parents/carers, healthcare practitioners and community service providers in four remote communities in Western Australia. All interviews and focus group discussions were voice recorded and data were analysed using NVivo software and thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Despite the high burden, skin infections were considered normal in these communities, and their impact on child health was under-recognised. Common themes identified by all participants included the inadequacy of health services, the pain of the benzathine penicillin G injection, uncertainty regarding the use of oral antibiotics and topical creams, and the need for health practitioner training and improved communication and resources.
CONCLUSION: Documenting carer, service provider and healthcare practitioner perspectives on skin infections provides a more informed understanding of the context in which treatment decisions are made. The ongoing need for culturally appropriate targeted, translational health education; improved treatment guidelines and feasible, painless treatments; and potential for the use of bush medicines for skin infections were themes that emerged.","['Amgarth-Duff I', 'Hendrickx D', 'Bowen A', 'Carapetis J', 'Chibawe R', 'Samson M', 'Walker R']",2019,19,3,Rural Remote Health,"Amgarth-Duff I, et al.

31519153,Prevalence of scabies and impetigo in the Solomon Islands: a school survey.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies, a parasitic disease of the skin, is a major public health problem, largely affecting children. Scabies is often complicated by impetigo which can result in serious complications including invasive infections and immune mediated diseases. Scabies and impetigo are reported to have high prevalence in tropical settings including the Solomon Islands.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional prevalence survey at Gizo Primary School in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands in August 2018. The diagnosis of scabies was based on criteria developed by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies in 2018. Population attributable risk was calculated to determine the effect of scabies on the prevalence of impetigo, and both adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios were calculated to identify differences between sexes and age groups.
RESULTS: A total of 324 students were assessed (47.5% of those enrolled at the school). The prevalence of scabies was 54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.7-59.8) and most disease was mild (68.8%). The prevalence was higher in males (63.5%; adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7), and in those aged 10-12 years (61.4%; ARR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9 when compared to those aged 4-6 years). The prevalence of impetigo was 32.1%, with males more likely to be affected (41.7%, ARR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) but with no significant differences between age groups. 63.5% of those with impetigo had scabies, corresponding to a population attributable risk of 11.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a very high burden of scabies and impetigo among primary school students in Gizo.

31516307,Acute rheumatic fever diagnosis and management: Review of the global implications of the new revised diagnostic criteria with a focus on Saudi Arabia.,"Rheumatic fever (RF) is a common cause of acquired heart disease in children worldwide. It is a delayed, nonsuppurative, autoimmune phenomenon following pharyngitis, impetigo, or scarlet fever caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection. RF diagnosis is clinical and based on revised Jones criteria. The first version of the criteria was developed by T. Duckett Jones in 1944, then subsequently revised by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1992 and 2015. However, RF remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because of the lack of specific clinical or laboratory findings. As a result, it has been difficult for some time to maintain a balance between over- and underdiagnosis of RF cases. The Jones criteria were revised in 2015 by the AHA, and the main modifications were as follows: the population was subdivided into moderate- to high-risk and low risk; the concept of subclinical carditis was introduced; and monoarthritis was included as a feature of musculoskeletal inflammation in the moderate- to high-risk population. This review will highlight the major changes in the AHA 2015 revised Jones criteria for pediatricians and general practitioners.","['Alqanatish J', 'Alfadhel A', 'Albelali A', 'Alqahtani D']",2019,31,4,J Saudi Heart Assoc,"Alqanatish J, et al.

31477954,Prevalence of Community-Acquired Pyoderma in Dermatological Outpatient Department of a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"INTRODUCTION: Pyoderma is defined as any purulent skin disease and represents infections in epidermis and dermis or hair follicles. This study aims to find out the prevalence of community-acquired pyoderma in dermatological outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among patients who presented at dermatology outpatient department of Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital between December 2018 and March 2019 after ethical clearance from institutional review committee. Convenience sampling method was done. Data was collected and analysis was done using SPSS software, point estimate at 95% CI was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data.
RESULTS: Out of 385 cases, 72 (18%) cases were of community-acquired pyoderma. Prevalence of community-acquired pyoderma is 72 (18%). Primary pyoderma was seen in 49 (12.72%) mainly folliculitis 17 (4.41%), furunculosis 16 (4.15%), impetigo 6 (1.55%), abscess 6 (1.55%) and bacterial paronychia 4 (1.03%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism isolated in 42 (58.3%) cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 3 (4.17%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was most sensitive to Vancomycin 42 (100%) followed by Gentamycin 40 (95.2%), Ciprofloxacin 40 (95.2%) and Ceftriaxone 40 (95.2%). Highest resistance was seen to Azithromycin in 13 (30.95%), followed by Cloxacilllin in 11 (26.19%). Males were affected predominantly in 49 (68.06%) as compared to females in 23 (31.94%).
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of community-acquired pyoderma is high among patients visiting dermatological outpatient departments of a tertiary care hospital compared to other studies. Antibiotic resistance of commonly used antibiotics are increasing and thus proper culture and sensitivity reports may be required to guide our treatment.","['Ghimire RB', 'Pokharel K', 'Shrestha S']",2019,57,217,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,"Ghimire RB, et al.

31425513,The diagnosis of scabies by non-expert examiners: A study of diagnostic accuracy.,"BACKGROUND: Although scabies is estimated to be one of the most common skin conditions globally, prevalence data is not available in most settings. Disease mapping is required to develop and monitor successful control programs. Non-expert health workers are likely to play an important role in scabies mapping activities in endemic settings.
METHODOLOGY: Four non-expert health workers were trained in the diagnosis of scabies and impetigo. The health worker diagnosis was compared to a reference consensus diagnosis of two doctors experienced in diagnosis. The study was conducted in a primary school in Gizo, Solomon Islands, in August 2018. The six examiners consecutively assessed school students, blinded to each other's findings. Training and diagnostic procedures followed criteria for scabies diagnosis established by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies in 2018.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Amongst the 171 students who underwent clinical assessment the prevalence of scabies and impetigo according to the reference standard was 55% and 45% respectively. Sensitivity of the non-expert health workers' diagnosis compared to the reference standard was 55.3% for scabies (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.1-60.4) with a specificity of 89.9% (95% CI 86-93.1) and 52.6% for impetigo (95% CI 46.9-58.3) with a specificity 97.8% (95% CI 95.7-99). Sensitivity for moderate to severe scabies was 93.5% (95% CI 86.3-97.6) with a specificity of 74% (95% CI 70.2-77.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Following brief training, the diagnostic accuracy of non-expert health workers for scabies and impetigo was promising, especially for moderate to severe disease. Modifications to training and processes are recommended to further improve accuracy. The diagnosis by non-expert health workers may be acceptable for scabies and impetigo mapping in endemic areas.","['Osti MH', 'Sokana O', 'Gorae C', 'Whitfeld MJ', 'Steer AC', 'Engelman D']",2019,13,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Osti MH, et al.

31334625,Topical Ozenoxacin Cream 1% for Impetigo: A Review.,"Background: Impetigo, a bacterial infection that is highly contagious, involves the superficial skin. Topical treatment for impetigo includes amongst other bacitracin, gentamycin, mupirocin, retapamulin, and more recently, ozenoxacin 1% cream. For more severe conditions systemic antibiotics are prescribed and may be combined with a topical treatment. The current review explored the challenges in treating impetigo in pediatric and adult populations and examined the role of ozenoxacin 1% cream as a safe and effective treatment option. Methods: We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (2010-2018) using the terms impetigo, bullous impetigo, non-bullous impetigo, antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance, mupirocin, retapamulin, and ozenoxacin. The selected publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. Results: Although guidelines were updated regularly, the recommended treatments have not changed much since 2014. Emerging antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in dermatology and pediatrics. Impetigo therapy choices should consider the resistance pattern of S. aureus. Ozenoxacin 1% cream is a prescription medicine for topical treatment of impetigo in adults and children 2 months or older. Ozenoxacin has a low probability of selecting spontaneous resistant mutants in quinolone-susceptible or quinolone-resistant bacterial strains and has shown to be active against MRSA isolates. Ozenoxacin 1% cream has potent bactericidal activity and was shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of impetigo in two well-controlled Phase 3 trials. Conclusions: Resistance patterns in a wide range of pathogens against oral or topical antibiotics and antiseptics used for the treatment of dermatological conditions, such as impetigo have been observed. When making treatment decisions for impetigo MRSA and other antimicrobial resistance has to be taken into account. Ozenoxacin 1% cream offers a potent bactericidal activity and has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety. Combined with its favorable features, such as a low dosing frequency and a 5 days treatment regimen, ozenoxacin 1% cream is an important option for the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

Various cutaneous lesions have been described after herpes zoster. This study included 24 patients with Wolf's isotopic response after herpes zoster infection, which presented as manifestations ranging from inflammatory disease to carcinoma. Histopathological examinations in 12 patients and immunohistochemical analyses in 10 patients allowed exploration of secondary microscopic changes in the lesions. CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratios were normal and infiltrating cells included mast cells, eosinophils, and tumour cells. Our study has described additional patients with confirmed Wolf's isotopic response following herpes zoster infection; moreover, it has extended the spectrum of Wolf's isotopic response to include impetigo. We suggest Wolf's isotopic response classification categories for herpes zoster-associated Wolf's isotopic response. Additionally, clinicians should consider the possibilities of different diseases in Wolf's isotopic response, especially malignancies.","['Wang T', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang S', 'Qu T', 'Liu Y', 'Jin H']",2019,99,11,Acta Derm Venereol,"Wang T, et al.

31315580,Understanding group A streptococcal pharyngitis and skin infections as causes of rheumatic fever: protocol for a prospective disease incidence study.,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infections cause the autoimmune disease acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which can progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Treating pharyngitis caused by GAS with antibiotics is important in preventing ARF. However, it is difficult to distinguish these infections from GAS carriers. There is growing evidence for GAS skin infections as a cause of ARF. This study will identify the incidence of true GAS pharyngitis and serological responses to GAS skin infections. The effectiveness of antibiotics for these conditions will be explored, and modifiable risk factors. Serum antibody titres indicating the upper limits of normal (ULN for ASO/ADB antibodies) will be established alongside carriage rates in asymptomatic children.
METHODS: This is a prospective disease incidence study, with an associated case-control study. The study population includes 1000 children (5-14 years) from Auckland, New Zealand, 800 of whom have visited their healthcare professional, resulting in a throat or skin swab for GAS, and 200 who are asymptomatic. The conditions of interest are GAS throat swab positive pharyngitis (n = 200); GAS carriage (n = 200); GAS negative throat swab (n = 200); GAS skin infections (n = 200); and asymptomatic controls (n = 200). All participants, except asymptomatic controls, will have acute and convalescent serological testing for ASO/ADB titres (collected < 9 days, and 2-4 weeks following symptom onset, respectively), alongside viral PCR from throat swabs. Asymptomatic controls will have ASO/ADB titres measured in one blood specimen and a throat swab for microbial culture. Caregivers of children will be interviewed using a questionnaire and any GAS isolates identified will be emm typed. The persistence of GAS antibodies will also be investigated.
DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will fill critical gaps in scientific knowledge to better understand the pathophysiology of ARF, improve clinical management of GAS infections, and design more effective ARF prevention programmes. In particular it will measure the incidence of true, serologically confirmed GAS pharyngitis; assess the immune response to GAS skin infections and its role as a cause of ARF; examine the effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treating GAS pharyngitis and carriage; and identify whether risk factors for GAS infections might provide intervention points for reducing ARF.","['Bennett J', 'Moreland NJ', 'Oliver J', 'Crane J', 'Williamson DA', 'Sika-Paotonu D', 'Harwood M', 'Upton A', 'Smith S', 'Carapetis J', 'Baker MG']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bennett J, et al.

31140653,Data augmentation in dermatology image recognition using machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, over 80 million people are affected by acne, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, psoriasis, and impetigo. Artificial intelligence and machine learning could prove to be a good tool for assisting in the diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of data augmentation in machine learning image recognition of five dermatological disease manifestations-acne, atopic dermatitis, impetigo, psoriasis, and rosacea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Open-source dermatological images were gathered and used to retrain TensorFlow Inception version-3. Retraining was done twice-once with and once without data augmentation. Both models were tested with the same images, and R software was used to perform statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The average of each of the statistical measures (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPN, MCC, and F1 Score) increased when data augmentation was added to the model. In particular, the average Matthews correlation coefficient increased by 7.7%. Each of the five dermatological manifestations had an increase in area under the curve (AUC) after data augmentation with the average increase in AUC of 0.132 and a standard deviation of 0.033. Atopic dermatitis had the highest increase in AUC of 0.18. With data augmentation, the lowest AUC was 0.87 for psoriasis and the highest was 0.97 for acne, indicating that the model performs well.
CONCLUSION: With a deep learning-based approach, it is possible to differentiate dermatological images with appreciable MCC, F1 score, and AUC. Further, data augmentation can be used to increase the model's accuracy by a significant amount.",['Aggarwal SLP'],2019,25,6,Skin Res Technol,Aggarwal SLP.

31131410,Prevalence of Scabies and Impetigo 3 Years After Mass Drug Administration With Ivermectin and Azithromycin.,"BACKGROUND: Ivermectin-based mass drug administration has emerged as a promising strategy for the control of scabies and impetigo in settings where the diseases are endemic. Current follow-up data are limited to 12 months for the majority of studies. Longer-term data are vital to inform the sustainability of interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a prevalence survey for scabies and impetigo in 10 villages in Choiseul Province of the Solomon Islands 36 months after a single round of ivermectin and azithromycin mass drug coadministration. In the primary analysis, we compared the prevalence of scabies and impetigo at 36 months to the prevalence at baseline.
RESULTS: At 36 months, the prevalence of scabies was 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-6.1), which was significantly lower than at baseline (18.7%; relative reduction, 74.9%; 95% CI, 61.5%-87.7%; P < .001). The prevalence of impetigo was 9.6% (95% CI, 8.1%-11.4%), significantly lower than at baseline (24.7%; relative reduction, 61.3%; 95% CI, 38.7%-100%; P < .001). The highest prevalence of scabies was among children aged <5 years (12.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 33.2; 95% CI, 6.6-603.2), and the highest prevalence of impetigo was among children aged 5-9 years (16.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 8.1; 95% CI, 3.6-21.8).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a sustained impact of a single round of ivermectin and azithromycin mass drug coadministration on the prevalence of scabies and impetigo 3 years after the intervention. Our data provide further support to adopt this intervention as a central component of global scabies control efforts.

31002964,Staphylococcus aureus versus neutrophil: Scrutiny of ancient combat.,"Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes many infections and diseases. This pathogen can cause many types of infections such as impetigo, toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST1), pneumonia, endocarditis, and autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematosus and can infect other healthy individuals. In the pathogenic process, colonization is a main risk factor for invasive diseases. Various factors including the cell wall-associated factors and receptors of the epithelial cells facilitate adhesion and colonization of this pathogen. S. aureus has many enzymes, toxins, and strategies to evade from the immune system either by an enzyme that lyses cellular component or by hiding from the immune system via surface antigens like protein A and second immunoglobulin-binding protein (Sbi). The strategies of this bacterium can be divided into five groups: A: Inhibit neutrophil recruitment B: Inhibit phagocytosis C: Inhibit killing by ROS, D: Neutrophil killing, and E: Resistance to antimicrobial peptide. On the other hand, innate immune system via neutrophils, the most important polymorphonuclear leukocytes, fights against bacterial cells by neutrophil extracellular trap (NET). In this review, we try to explain the role of each factor in immune evasion.","['Nasser A', 'Moradi M', 'Jazireian P', 'Safari H', 'Alizadeh-Sani M', 'Pourmand MR', 'Azimi T']",2019,131,,Microb Pathog,"Nasser A, et al.

31001659,[Tinea barbae profunda due to Trichophyton mentagrophytes : Case report and review].,"Tinea barbae is a rare dermatomycocis, by definition follicular bound in the beard area of adult men. Manifestation usually starts with erythema accompanied by desquamation. Deeper distribution along terminal hairs leads to folliculitis with formation of pustules and nodes as well as abscesses; fixed adherent yellowish crusts may appear. Frequently there is locoregional swelling of the lymph nodes and occasionally a deterioration of general condition with (sub)febrile temperatures. Often this leads to the initial suspected diagnosis of a bacterial folliculitis barbae or impetigo contagiosa. Tinea barbae is mostly induced by species of the genus Trichophyton (T.). The pathogens are diverse and are mostly zoophilic, sometimes anthropophilic and rarely geophilic dermatophytes. With the help of a specific anamnesis and diagnostic procedure, including mycological examinations, histology and molecular detection of dermatophytes via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tinea barbae-in our patient induced by T. mentagrophytes-can be rapidly diagnosed. Early initiation and adequate treatment duration lead to restitutio ad integrum.","['Kirsten H', 'Haiduk J', 'Nenoff P', 'Uhrlaß S', 'Ziemer M', 'Simon JC']",2019,70,8,Hautarzt,"Kirsten H, et al.

30995649,Staphylococcus aureus and Host Immunity in Recurrent Furunculosis.,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the severest and most persistent bacterial pathogens. The most frequent S. aureus infections include impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, furunculosis, abscesses, hidradenitis suppurativa, and mastitis. S. aureus produces a great variety of cellular and extracellular factors responsible for its invasiveness and ability to cause pathological lesions. Their expression depends on the growth phase, environmental factors, and location of the infection. Susceptibility to staphylococcal infections is rooted in multiple mechanisms of host immune responses and reactions to bacterial colonization. Immunological and inflammatory processes of chronic furunculosis are based on the pathogenicity of S. aureus as well as innate and acquired immunity. In-depth knowledge about them may help to discover the whole pathomechanism of the disease and to develop effective therapeutic options. In this review, we focus on the S. aureus-host immune interactions in the pathogenesis of recurrent furunculosis according to the most recent experimental and clinical findings.","['Nowicka D', 'Grywalska E']",2019,235,4,Dermatology,Nowicka D and Grywalska E.

30994967,A cluster of acute rheumatic fever cases among Aboriginal Australians in a remote community with high baseline incidence.,"OBJECTIVES: We report a cluster of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) cases and the public health response in a high-burden Australian setting.
METHODS: The public health unit was notified of an increase in ARF cases in a remote Australian Aboriginal community. A multi-disciplinary group coordinated the response. Household contacts were screened for ARF or group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection by questionnaire and swab collection, offered an echocardiogram if aged 5-20 years, and intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin if aged over one year or if less than one year with impetigo.
RESULTS: Fifteen definite and seven probable ARF cases were diagnosed in the community in July-December 2014 (all-age incidence of definite ARF: 1,473/100,000). The public health response identified two additional cases of ARF. A total of 81 contacts were screened; GAS was detected in 3/76 (4%) throat swabs and 11/24 (46%) skin swabs. Molecular typing revealed high GAS strain diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ARF during this cluster was very high. Carriage and infection with GAS was observed, but no outbreak strain identified. Implications for public health: A national public health guideline has since been developed that includes advice on the investigation of an ARF outbreak/cluster. Sustained efforts with strong community engagement are required to tackle high ARF rates.","['Francis JR', 'Gargan C', 'Remenyi B', 'Ralph AP', 'Draper A', 'Holt D', 'Krause V', 'Hardie K']",2019,43,3,Aust N Z J Public Health,"Francis JR, et al.

30956111,"Efficacy of mass drug administration with ivermectin for control of scabies and impetigo, with coadministration of azithromycin: a single-arm community intervention trial.","BACKGROUND: In small community-based trials, mass drug administration of ivermectin has been shown to substantially decrease the prevalence of both scabies and secondary impetigo; however, their effect at large scale is untested. Additionally, combined mass administration of drugs for two or more neglected diseases has potential practical advantages, but efficacy of potential combinations should be confirmed.
METHODS: The azithromycin ivermectin mass drug administration (AIM) trial was a prospective, single-arm, before-and-after, community intervention study to assess the efficacy of mass drug administration of ivermectin for scabies and impetigo, with coadministration of azithromycin for trachoma. Mass drug administration was offered to the entire population of Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, and of this population we randomly selected two sets of ten sentinel villages for monitoring, one at baseline and the other at 12 months. Participants were offered a single dose of 20 mg/kg azithromycin, using weight-based bands. Children weighing less than 12·5 kg received azithromycin oral suspension (20 mg/kg), and infants younger than 6 months received topical 1% tetracycline ointment. For ivermectin, participants were offered two doses of oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg 7-14 days apart using weight-based bands, or 5% permethrin cream 7-14 days apart if ivermectin was contraindicated. Our study had the primary outcomes of safety and feasibility of large-scale mass coadministration of oral ivermectin and azithromycin, which have been previously reported. We report here the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in residents of the ten baseline villages compared with those in the ten 12-month villages, as measured by examination of the skin, which was a secondary outcome of the trial. Further outcomes were comparison of the number of all-cause outpatient attendances at government clinics in Choiseul Province at various timepoints before and after mass drug administration. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Trials Registry (ACTRN12615001199505).
FINDINGS: During September, 2015, over 4 weeks, 26 188 people (99·3% of the estimated population of Choiseul [n=26 372] as determined at the 2009 census) were treated. At baseline, 1399 (84·2%) of 1662 people living in the first ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 261 (18·7%) had scabies and 347 (24·8%) had impetigo. At 12 months after mass drug administration, 1261 (77·6%) of 1625 people in the second set of ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 29 (2·3%) had scabies (relative reduction 88%, 95% CI 76·5-99·3) and 81 (6·4%) had impetigo (relative reduction 74%, 63·4-84·7). In the 3 months after mass drug administration, 10 614 attended outpatient clinics for any reason compared with 16 602 in the 3 months before administration (decrease of 36·1%, 95% CI 34·7-37·6), and during this period attendance for skin sores, boils, and abscesses decreased by 50·9% (95% CI 48·6-53·1).
INTERPRETATION: Ivermectin-based mass drug administration can be scaled to a population of over 25 000 with high efficacy and this level of efficacy can be achieved when mass drug administration for scabies is integrated with mass drug administration of azithromycin for trachoma. These findings will contribute to development of population-level control strategies. Further research is needed to assess durability and scalability of mass drug administration in larger, non-island populations, and to assess its effect on the severe bacterial complications of scabies.

30814052,Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the duration of prescriptions for antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care and to compare this with guideline recommendations.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: General practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, 2013-15.
PARTICIPANTS: 931 015 consultations that resulted in an antibiotic prescription for one of several indications: acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions with a duration exceeding the guideline recommendation and the total number of days beyond the recommended duration for each indication.
RESULTS: The most common reasons for antibiotics being prescribed were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), and acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%). Antibiotic treatments for upper respiratory tract indications and acute cough and bronchitis accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations. Notable exceptions were acute sinusitis, where only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions exceeded seven days and acute sore throat where only 2.1% (2.0% to 2.1%) exceeded 10 days (recent guidance recommends five days). More than half of the antibiotic prescriptions were for longer than guidelines recommend for acute cystitis among females (54.6%, 54.1% to 55.0%). The percentage of antibiotic prescriptions exceeding the recommended duration was lower for most non-respiratory infections. For the 931 015 included consultations resulting in antibiotic prescriptions, about 1.3 million days were beyond the durations recommended by guidelines.
CONCLUSION: For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. Substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure can be accomplished by aligning antibiotic prescription durations with guidelines.","['Pouwels KB', 'Hopkins S', 'Llewelyn MJ', 'Walker AS', 'McNulty CA', 'Robotham JV']",2019,364,,BMJ,"Pouwels KB, et al.

30807768,Human Keratinocytes Use Sphingosine 1-Phosphate and its Receptors to Communicate Staphylococcus aureus Invasion and Activate Host Defense.,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator generated when a cell membrane or its components are damaged by various factors. S1P regulates diverse cell activities via S1P receptors (S1PRs). Keratinocytes express S1PR1-5. Although it is known that S1PRs control keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis, and wound healing, S1PR functions in keratinocyte infections have not been fully elucidated. We propose that the S1P-S1PR axis in keratinocytes works as a biosensor for bacterial invasion. Indeed, in human impetigo infection, we found high epidermal expression of S1PR1 and S1PR2 in the skin. Furthermore, in normal human epidermal keratinocytes in vitro, treatment with Staphylococcus aureus bacterial supernatant not only induced S1P production but also increased the transcription of S1PR2, confirming our in vivo observation, as well as increased the levels of TNFA, IL36G, IL6, and IL8 mRNAs. However, direct treatment of normal human epidermal keratinocytes with S1P increased the expressions of IL36G, TNFA, and IL8, but not IL6. In both S1P- and S. aureus bacterial supernatant-treated normal human epidermal keratinocytes, S1PR1 knockdown reduced IL36G, TNFA, and IL8 transcription, and the S1PR2 antagonist JTE013 blocked the secretion of these cytokines. Overall, we have proven that during infections, keratinocytes communicate damage by using S1P release and tight control of S1PR1 and 2.","['Igawa S', 'Choi JE', 'Wang Z', 'Chang YL', 'Wu CC', 'Werbel T', 'Ishida-Yamamoto A', 'Di Nardo A']",2019,139,8,J Invest Dermatol,"Igawa S, et al.

30803017,"Clonal change of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with impetigo in Kagawa, Japan.","Recently, the USA300 clone, which is a Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive clonal complex 8-staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV (CC8-IV) community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strain, emerged in community and hospital settings in Japan. Hence, clonal types of CA-MRSA strains are predicted to be changing. Nonetheless, long-term surveillance of CA-MRSA has not been conducted in Japan. Here, we investigated the transition and current status of CA-MRSA strains isolated from outpatients with impetigo; the samples were collected between 2007 and 2016 in Kagawa, Japan. The detection rate (22.8%, 488/2139 strains) of MRSA slightly decreased in these 10 years. Molecular epidemiological analyses showed that the prevalence of the CC89-II clone, which is a typical CA-MRSA genotype of causative agents of impetigo, significantly decreased from 48.0% (48/100 strains) in 2007-2009 to 21.9% (16/73 strains) in 2013-2016. By contrast, a non-USA300 CC8-IV clone, which is a highly pathogenic CA-MRSA/J clone, significantly increased in prevalence from 9.0% (9/100 strains) to 32.9% (24/73 strains). The prevalence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA strains increased annually from 2012 (0%) to 2015 (6.7%), whereas only one of these strains turned out to be the USA300 clone. Antibiotic susceptibility data revealed that the rates of resistance to gentamicin and clindamycin among CA-MRSA strains decreased along with the decreased prevalence of the CC89-II clone and increased prevalence of the CA-MRSA/J clone. Our data strongly suggest that the clonal types and antibiotic susceptibility of CA-MRSA isolated from patients with impetigo dramatically changed during the last 10 years in Japan.","['Sasai N', 'Nakaminami H', 'Iwasaki M', 'Iwao M', 'Misegawa K', 'Hasui M', 'Sato M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Yoshida T', 'Asano T', 'Senoue M', 'Ikeda M', 'Noguchi N']",2019,46,4,J Dermatol,"Sasai N, et al.

METHODS: Five Italian pediatric societies appointed a core working group. In selected conditions, specially trained personnel evaluated quality assessment of treatment strategies according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology. MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with a strategy combining MeSH and free text terms.
FINDINGS: The literature review included 364 articles focusing on impetigo, skin abscess, and cellulitis/orbital cellulitis. The articles included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology for impetigo comprised 5 RCTs and 1 observational study; for skin abscess, 10 RCTs and 3 observational studies were included; for cellulitis and erysipelas, 5 RCTs and 5 observational studies were included; and for orbital cellulitis, 8 observational studies were included. Recommendations were formulated according to 4 grades of strength for each specific topic (impetigo, skin abscesses, cellulitis, and orbital cellulitis). Where controversies arose and expert opinion was considered fundamental due to lack of evidence, agreement according to Delphi consensus recommendations was included.

30704422,Reliability and accuracy of smartphones for paediatric infectious disease consultations for children with rash in the paediatric emergency department.,"OBJECTIVE: Smartphones and associated messaging applications have become the most common means of communication among health care workers and the general population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of smartphones for the diagnosis of rash in children admitted to emergency departments during the night shift.
METHODS: The images of the children who were admitted to the paediatric emergency department with rash were included in this study, and at least two images taken with smartphones by residents or paediatric infectious disease fellows were re-directed to the chief consultant of the Paediatric-Infectious Department via smartphone. Initial diagnosis by the consultant was recorded, and the patient's physical examination was performed by another clinician on the first working day; diagnostic tests were planned by this clinician. The definitive diagnosis was recorded and compared with the initial diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among the 194 patients, the most common final diagnoses were chickenpox (varicella-zoster infections) in 33 patients (17.0%) and skin infections (including impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas and cellulitis) in 33 patients (17.0%). The initial diagnosis, which was performed via WhatsApp on a smartphone, was identical to the final diagnosis in 96.3% of the cases. Incompatible initial diagnoses included 4 measles cases, 1 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome case, 1 cutaneous leishmaniasis case and 1 petechial rash case.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that the use of a smartphone-based instant messaging application for transmitting images of paediatric rash is accurate and useful for diagnosis. However, physical examination and medical history are still the primary methods.

30686133,Ozenoxacin: a review of preclinical and clinical efficacy.,"Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children. Treatment is becoming complicated due to the development of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the main pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Ozenoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone antimicrobial, has demonstrated efficacy in impetigo. Areas covered: This article reviews the microbiology, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ozenoxacin, and its clinical and microbiological efficacy in impetigo. Expert opinion: In an environment of increasing antimicrobial resistance and concurrent slowdown in antimicrobial development, the introduction of a new agent is a major event. Ozenoxacin is characterized by simultaneous affinity for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, appears to be impervious to certain efflux pumps that confer bacterial resistance to other quinolones, shows low selection of resistant mutants, and has a mutant prevention concentration below its concentration in skin. These mechanisms protect ozenoxacin against development of resistance, while the absence of a fluorine atom in its structure confers a better safety profile versus fluoroquinolones. In vitro studies have demonstrated high potency of ozenoxacin against staphylococci and streptococci including resistant strains of S. aureus. Clinical trials of ozenoxacin in patients with impetigo reported high clinical and microbiological success rates.

30684672,The effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on the expression of biofilm associated genes in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from wound infections in burn patients.,"PURPOSE: Burn patients are particularly susceptible to microbial infection. Staphylococcus aureus causes burn wound, impetigo and cellulitis. Although sub-lethal antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) would not result in microorganism killing, it can considerably influence microbial virulence factor.
METHODS: Twelve methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolated from burns patients. To determine the sub-lethal dose of aPDT, 12 clinical isolates of S. aureus photosensitized with 100 μg ml 
RESULT: Fifty and 100 μg ml
CONCLUSION: The potential of TBO-mediated aPDT could reduce the expression of ica ABCD as important genes involved in biofilm formation and ica R gene as a repressor of the ica operon. Therefore, the use of aPDT agents as a complementary therapy in wound infections of burn patients is recommended.","['Mahmoudi H', 'Pourhajibagher M', 'Alikhani MY', 'Bahador A']",2019,25,,Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,"Mahmoudi H, et al.

30677843,Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica: A review of interdigital candidiasis.,"Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica (EIB) is a Candida infection affecting the third web space, between the third and fourth fingers. In 1915, Gougerot and Goncea first described saccharomycetic organisms isolated from the hands and feet. Johannes Fabry later named it in 1917, well before the genus Candida was introduced in 1923. EIB is most common among those who work with their hands frequently in water, such as dishwashers, launderers, bartenders, and homemakers. Clinical presentation most commonly consists of a central erythematous erosion surrounded by a rim of white macerated skin involving at least one interdigital web space. The differential diagnosis is narrow, consisting of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), erythrasma, inverse psoriasis, and bacterial infection (i.e. impetigo). The diagnosis is made by clinical examination in addition to fungal culture and KOH testing. The prognosis is good and treatment options include avoidance of frequent water immersion and topical or oral antifungal agents. Suspicion for secondary infections such as erysipelas and cellulitis should remain high until lesions have resolved. This review aims to address the history, epidemiology, pathophysiology, histopathology, clinical presentation, differential diagnoses, diagnosis, prognosis, and management of EIB. It also suggests an alternative name in place of the current misnomer.","['Schlager E', 'Ashack K', 'Khachemoune A']",2018,24,8,Dermatol Online J,"Schlager E, et al.

30589906,Exploration of a simplified clinical examination for scabies to support public health decision-making.,"INTRODUCTION: In most settings, the diagnosis of scabies is reliant on time-consuming and potentially intrusive clinical examination of all accesible regions of skin. With the recent recognition of scabies as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization there is a need for standardised approaches to disease mapping to define populations likely to benefit from intervention, and to measure the impact of interventions. Development and validation of simplified approaches to diagnose scabies would facilitate these efforts.
METHODS: We utilised data from three population-based surveys of scabies. We classified each individual as having scabies absent or present overall, based on whole body assessment, and in each of 9 regions of the body. We calculated the sensitivity of diagnosing the presence of scabies based on each individual body region compared to the reference standard based on whole body examination and identified combinations of regions which provided greater than 90% sensitivity. We assessed the sensitivity according to gender, age group, severity of scabies and the presence or absence of impetigo.
RESULTS: We included 1,373 individuals with scabies. The body regions with highest yield were the hands (sensitivity compared to whole body examination 51.2%), feet (49.7%), and lower legs (48.3%). Examination of the exposed components of both limbs provided a sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI 91.2-94.4%). The sensitivity of this more limited examination was greater than 90% regardless of scabies severity or the presence or absence of secondary impetigo.
DISCUSSION: We found that examination limited to hands, feet and lower legs was close to 90% for detecting scabies compared to a full body examination. A simplified and less intrusive diagnostic process for scabies will allow expansion of mapping and improved decision-making about public health interventions. Further studies in other settings are needed to prospectively validate this simplified approach.","['Marks M', 'Engelman D', 'Romani L', 'Mason D', 'Sokana O', 'Kama M', 'Whitfeld M', 'Steer AC', 'Kaldor J']",2018,12,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Marks M, et al.

30571826,Sweet Syndrome in Pediatrics. A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Sweet's syndrome is a very rare dermatosis in pediatrics, of unknown pathogenesis, clinically characterized by fever, neutrophilia, raised and painful plaques on the skin of the face, neck, and limbs, and histologically by dermal infiltration of neutrophils.
OBJECTIVE: To present a clinical case of Sweet Syndrome in a pediatric patient.
CLINICAL CASE: 3-years-old female child, with history of complex chromosomopathy 46XX add(8), with a 7-day history of plaques and blisters on the back and later also on the limbs, associated with high fever, without response to antibiotic treatment pres cribed due to suspicion of bullous impetigo. Physical examination showed multiple erythematous- violaceous plaques, with bullous center on the back, upper and lower limbs, along with plaques and erythematous nodules on the left arm and thigh. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutro philia (absolute neutrophil count 45954/mm3) and elevated CRP (347 mg/L). Biopsy of skin lesions reported histopathological findings compatible with Sweet's Syndrome. Treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was indicated with good clinical response. After two weeks of treatment, she presented crusty plaques of smaller size, without bullous lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome is an uncom mon dermatosis in pediatrics, therefore, a high index of suspicion should be held in the presence of fever associated with persistent skin lesions. While most cases are idiopathic, screening for associated conditions, mainly proliferative disorders, infections, and immunodeficiencies must be performed.","['Stevens G J', 'Yutronic H J', 'Pizarro O J', 'Velozo P L']",2018,89,4,Rev Chil Pediatr,"Stevens G J, et al.

30571809,[Pemphigus vulgaris in pediatrics: A case report].,"INTRODUCTION: pemphigus vulgaris is a serious and infrequent disease in children. Its timely diagnosis and treatment allows modifying its prognosis. The objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, and the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of this uncommon autoimmune blistering disease in children.
CLINICAL CASE: 2-year-old male patient, previously healthy. He initially presented generalized dermatosis with maximum lesion areas at the umbilical region, limbs and genitals; characterized by blisters, some denuded, and of easy bleeding, without mucosal involvement nor fever. Bullous impetigo was diagnosed and topical and systemic antibiotic treatment was started, showing no clinical improvement. He developed extension of the lesions with oral and anal mucosal involvement. The histologic and direct immunofluorescent study of lesions and perilesional skin confirm the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient started treatment with corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents with good clinical response.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the similarity with other more prevalent infectious and inflammatory diseases, a high index of suspicion is required in order to avoid delays in the diagnosis and the start of treatment. In patients with blisters with an unexpected clinical evolu tion, it is necessary to conduct a joint evaluation with a dermatologist and to assess the opportunity of performing a biopsy of the lesion and perilesional skin for histological study and direct immunofluo rescence, which will allow diagnostic confirmation.","['Casuriaga Lamboglia AL', 'Minut Gubitosi A', 'Guebenlián Bakerdjian C', 'Giachetto Larraz G']",2018,89,5,Rev Chil Pediatr,"Casuriaga Lamboglia AL, et al.

30568740,Efficacy of Dalbavancin and Telavancin in the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections.,"OBJECTIVES: Two glycopeptide analogues, such as dalbavancin and telavancin, with improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters have been developed. These two glycopeptide analogues are approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of various Gram-positive bacterial skin infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have conducted an open labelled prospective randomized study to compare the efficacy of these two drugs. A total of 200 patients diagnosed with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) were recruited for the study. They were randomized to receive either a single dose of dalbavancin 1500 mg i.v (Group I) or telavancin 10 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) every 24 hours for six days (Group II). The skin infection rating score (SIRS) was calculated on Day 0 for all patients at the time of diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of the lesions were assessed based on the following factors: blistering, exudate/pus, erythema/inflammation and itching/pain. Each factor was classified as one of the following: absent - 0, minimal - 1, moderate - 2 and severe - 3.
RESULTS: Clinically successful treatment was defined as complete resolution of clinically meaningful signs and symptoms of infection, including SIRS score of 0. The outcome measure was the percentage of patients with SIRS score of 0 on day 7 (clinical success). The third most common diagnosis at baseline was impetigo (13% in both groups). Patients who received dalbavancin had a higher clinical success rate than those receiving telavancin.
CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study show that single i.v dose of dalbavancin is better than telavancin repeated doses in treatment of ABSSSI.","['Jagan N', 'Pendru R', 'Jyothinath K']",2018,13,3,Maedica (Bucur),"Jagan N, et al.

Candidate GAS vaccines based on the J8 peptide have demonstrated promising immunogenicity in mice, however, less is known about the role of J8 antibodies in the human immune response to GAS infection. We analysed the stimulation of J8 antibodies in response to infection, and the role of existing J8 antibodies in protection against subsequent infection, using data collected in the Fijian population: (1) cross sectional population serosurvey; (2) paired serum collection for assessment of M-specific and J8 antibody responses; and (3) longitudinal assessment of GAS infection and immunity. Median J8 antibody concentrations peaked in the 5-14 year age group, but there was no sustained increase with age. J8 antibody concentration was neither a significant predictor of time to next infection, nor did it show any relationship to the time since last recorded skin infection. Similarly, J8 antibody fold changes over a defined period were associated neither with the time since last skin infection, nor the number of intervening skin infections. While strong M-specific antibody responses were observed for skin infection, similarly strong J8 antibody responses were not observed. There is no indication that antibodies to the J8 antigen would be useful as either a marker of GAS infection or a measure of population immunity, with J8 antibody responses to infection fleeting, if existent at all.","['Campbell PT', 'Frost H', 'Smeesters PR', 'Kado J', 'Good MF', 'Batzloff M', 'Geard N', 'McVernon J', 'Steer A']",2018,36,50,Vaccine,"Campbell PT, et al.

30346521,Impetigo incidence and treatment: a retrospective study of Dutch routine primary care data.,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of recently published data on impetigo presentation incidence and treatment practices in the routine Western European primary care setting.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate impetigo incidence, treatments and recurrence in primary care in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A retrospective, observational study. Electronic records of patients treated for impetigo in 2015 at 29 general practices in Utrecht and surrounds were reviewed. An episode of impetigo was defined as one or more patient-doctor contacts within 8 weeks of the index consultation. Within an episode, patient demographics and prescribing patterns were analysed including number of treatments, and the category and sequence of individual medicines.
RESULTS: A total of 1761 impetigo episodes were managed, with an incidence rate of 13.6 per 1000 person years. Impetigo peaked in summer. Most patients, the majority children, experienced a single episode (93%), and 25% had eczema as comorbidity. Topical antibiotics (primarily fusidic acid) were the most prescribed initial treatments (85%), followed by oral antibiotics (14%). Topical antibiotics were progressively used less over subsequent treatments, while there was an inverse increase in oral antibiotic use. Topical fusidic acid as the most common first line treatment seemed satisfactory as only 12% of initial treatments with this drug received further therapy. Repeat treatments generally occurred within 7 days.
CONCLUSION: This study of impetigo prescribing patterns in primary care highlighted that Dutch general practitioners were generally adherent to national treatment guidelines. Topical treatment, and if needed systemic small-spectrum antibiotic treatment, appeared satisfactory; these findings aid in antimicrobial stewardship.","['Loadsman MEN', 'Verheij TJM', 'van der Velden AW']",2019,36,4,Fam Pract,"Loadsman MEN, et al.

Most purulent infections in the United States are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. For abscesses, we emphasize the importance of incision and drainage. Nonpurulent infections are usually caused by streptococcal species and initial empiric antibiotics need not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

30279113,Comparative analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from outpatients of dermatology unit in hospitals and clinics.,"Community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) is a causative agent of intractable skin infections. In general, clinical symptoms of hospital outpatients with skin infections are severer than those of clinic patients. Hence, molecular epidemiological features of the CO-MRSA strains from hospital outpatients are predicted to be different from those of clinic patients. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis for CO-MRSA isolates from outpatients with impetigo in hospitals and clinics located in the same district of Tokyo, Japan. Incidence of MRSA infection was higher in hospital outpatients (21.5%, 20/93 isolates) than in clinic patients (14.5%, 121/845 isolates). The resistance rate to clindamycin, which is a common topical antimicrobial agent in dermatology, in the isolates from hospital outpatients (60.0%) was higher than those from clinic patients (31.4%). Proportion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type II, which is a representative type of hospital-acquired MRSA in Japan, in the isolates from hospital outpatients (65.0%) was significantly higher than those from clinic patients (30.6%) (P < 0.01). Multilocus sequence typing showed that the clonal complex 89-SCCmec type II (CC89-II) clone, which exhibits clindamycin resistance, was the most predominant (55.0%) in the isolates from hospital outpatients. On the other hand, all CC8-IV, CC121-V, and CC89-V clones accounted for 60% in clinic patients were susceptible to clindamycin. Our findings suggested that the clindamycin-resistant CC89-II CO-MRSA clone might be more related to skin infections in hospital outpatients than clinic patients.","['Nakaminami H', 'Sugiyama T', 'Okamura Y', 'Hanawa M', 'Abou M', 'Sawada K', 'Chiba Y', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Kawasaki S', 'Ueki T', 'Funatsu S', 'Nagatani T', 'Noguchi N']",2019,25,3,J Infect Chemother,"Nakaminami H, et al.

30274494,Control Strategies for Scabies.,"Scabies is a neglected tropical disease of the skin, causing severe itching and stigmatizing skin lesions. Further, scabies leads to impetigo, severe bacterial infections, and post-infectious complications. Around 200 million people are affected, particularly among disadvantaged populations living in crowded conditions in tropical areas. After almost 50 years, research into scabies control has shown great promise, particularly in highly-endemic island settings, but these findings have not been widely adopted. Newer approaches, utilizing ivermectin-based mass drug administration, appear feasible and highly effective. Inclusion of scabies in the WHO portfolio of neglected tropical diseases in 2017 may facilitate renewed opportunities and momentum toward global control. However, further operational research is needed to develop evidence-based strategies for control in a range of settings, and monitor their impact. Several enabling factors are required for successful implementation, including availability of affordable drug supply. Integration with existing health programs may provide a cost-effective approach to control.","['Engelman D', 'Steer AC']",2018,3,3,Trop Med Infect Dis,Engelman D and Steer AC.

We provide an accurate evaluation of the incidence and characteristics of ISDs diagnosed in a PED from Buenos Aires, Argentina, over a 1-year period.
METHODS: Prospectively, descriptive study of children evaluated in the PED with ISDs during 2016. ISDs were analyzed on the basis of their incidence, patient demographics, seasonal variations, and hospitalization rates.
RESULTS: ISDs were diagnosed in 1680 (67.9%) of the skin consultations (M/F: 1.1; mean age: 4.4 ± 3.7 years). Bacterial infections were observed in 932 (55.5%) cases.

Bacterial skin infections were more frequent during the summer months, while viral skin infections were more prevalent during spring. Parasitic skin infections were diagnosed more frequently during the winter months. No differences were seen for mycotic skin infections. Hospitalization rate was 1% (all for bacterial skin infections).
CONCLUSION: Our data reveal the extremely high frequency of ISDs seen at the PED, underlying the need for closer cooperation between dermatologists and pediatricians.","['Dei-Cas I', 'Carrizo D', 'Giri M', 'Boyne G', 'Domínguez N', 'Novello V', 'Acuña K', 'Dei-Cas P']",2019,58,3,Int J Dermatol,"Dei-Cas I, et al.

30217275,Skin diseases associated with atopic dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disorder, characterized by an abnormal skin barrier, immune dysfunction, and an altered skin microbiome. Atopic dermatitis may be seen in conjunction with a variety of other skin disorders due to the complex pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, involving genetic and environmental factors that are associated with immune dysfunction, barrier defects, and altered skin microbiomes. Skin disorders associated with atopic dermatitis include diseases sharing similar genetic origins like ichthyosis vulgaris, infectious diseases such as impetigo, and eczema herpeticum, in addition to the cutaneous autoimmune diseases, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. Atopic dermatitis is also often linked to such benign conditions as pityriasis alba and keratosis pilaris. This review discusses the cutaneous comorbidities of atopic dermatitis and their relationship via their occurrence in conjunction with atopic dermatitis.","['Fenner J', 'Silverberg NB']",2018,36,5,Clin Dermatol,Fenner J and Silverberg NB.

30156510,[Investigation of Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factors and typing by multiple locus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF) method].,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important bacterial pathogen that colonizes the throat and skin of human beings and causes a wide variety of diseases ranging from mild infections like pharyngitis, tonsillitis and impetigo to severe invasive infections such streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, septicemia, and necrotizing fasciitis, and produces a wide variety of virulence factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance, virulence genes; [pyrogenic exotoxin genes (speA, C, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, smeZ and ssa), deoxyribonuclease genes (sdaB, spd3, sdc ve sdaD), protease genes (speB, spyCEP ve scpA) and inhibitor genes (mac and sic)] of S.pyogenes strains isolated from throat cultures of patients with symptomatic tonsillo-pharyngitis and typing by multiple locus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF) method. One hundred and fifty S.pyogenes isolates were identified by conventional methods and streptococcus group A latex kit (Biomerieux, France). Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. DNA isolation was performed by using a commercial DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. The virulence genes were determined by multiplex PCR. MLVF method was performed with multiplex PCR using specific primers for repeated sequences within bacterial genome. All of the S.pyogenes isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, vancomycin and linezolid. Among streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes the most frequent gene was smeZ (90.0%) followed by speG (88.0%), speC (58.7%), ssa (42.7%), speA (33.3%), speJ (24.0%), speK (18.7%), speH (14.0%), speI (13.3%), speL and speM (9.3%). Of the DNase genes, sdaB was detected in all strains (100%), spd3, sdc, sdaD genes were determined as 64.7%, 36.0%, 24.7% respectively. Protease genes (speB, spyCEP, scpA) and mac gene from the inhibitor genes were positive in all strains, and sic gene was positive in only 3 (2.0%) of the isolates. Thirty-two different patterns that contained two or more isolates were determined by MLVF analysis. Ninety one isolates were included in any of the 32 different patterns, while 59 isolates were defined as sporadic isolates. In conclusion, S.pyogenes isolates collected from throat cultures of patients with symptomatic tonsillo-pharyngitis in Konya/Turkey were susceptible to all antibiotics studied and have carried a very high rate of virulence factors. However the isolates were mostly clonally unrelated and sporadic. This study is the first report in Turkey, in which S.pyogenes isolates were typed by the MLVF method and a large number of virulence factors were investigated.","['Türk Dağı H', 'Yüksekkaya Ş', 'Seyhan T', 'Fındık D', 'Tuncer İ', 'Arslan U']",2018,52,3,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Türk Dağı H, et al.

30044780,Scabies and risk of skin sores in remote Australian Aboriginal communities: A self-controlled case series study.,"BACKGROUND: Skin sores caused by Group A streptococcus (GAS) infection are a major public health problem in remote Aboriginal communities. Skin sores are often associated with scabies, which is evident in scabies intervention programs where a significant reduction of skin sores is seen after focusing solely on scabies control. Our study quantifies the strength of association between skin sores and scabies among Aboriginal children from the East Arnhem region in the Northern Territory.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Pre-existing datasets from three published studies, which were conducted as part of the East Arnhem Healthy Skin Project (EAHSP), were analysed. Aboriginal children were followed from birth up to 4.5 years of age. Self-controlled case series design was used to determine the risks, within individuals, of developing skin sores when infected with scabies versus when there was no scabies infection. Participants were 11.9 times more likely to develop skin sores when infected with scabies compared with times when no scabies infection was evident (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 11.9; 95% CI 10.3-13.7; p<0.001), and this was similar across the five Aboriginal communities. Children had lower risk of developing skin sores at age ≤1 year compared to at age >1 year (IRR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9).
CONCLUSION: The association between scabies and skin sores is highly significant and indicates a causal relationship. The public health importance of scabies in northern Australia is underappreciated and a concerted approach is required to recognise and eliminate scabies as an important precursor of skin sores.","['Aung PTZ', 'Cuningham W', 'Hwang K', 'Andrews RM', 'Carapetis JR', 'Kearns T', 'Clucas D', 'McVernon J', 'Simpson JA', 'Tong SYC', 'Campbell PT']",2018,12,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Aung PTZ, et al.

29985978,Randomized Trial of Community Treatment With Azithromycin and Ivermectin Mass Drug Administration for Control of Scabies and Impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is a public health problem in many countries, with impetigo and its complications important consequences. Ivermectin based mass drug administration (MDA) reduces the prevalence of scabies and, to a lesser extent, impetigo. We studied the impact of co-administering azithromycin on the prevalence of impetigo and antimicrobial resistance.
METHODS: Six communities were randomized to receive either ivermectin-based MDA or ivermectin-based MDA co-administered with azithromycin. We measured scabies and impetigo prevalence at baseline and 12 months. We collected impetigo lesions swabs at baseline, 3 and 12 months to detect antimicrobial resistance.
RESULTS: At baseline, scabies and impetigo prevalences were 11.8% and 10.1% in the ivermectin-only arm and 9.2% and 12.1% in the combined treatment arm. At 12 months, the prevalences had fallen to 1.0% and 2.5% in the ivermectin-only arm and 0.7% and 3.3% in the combined treatment arm. The proportion of impetigo lesions containing Staphylococcus aureus detected did not change (80% at baseline vs 86% at 12 months; no significant difference between arms) but the proportion containing pyogenic streptococci fell significantly (63% vs 23%, P < .01). At 3 months, 53% (8/15) of S. aureus isolates were macrolide-resistant in the combined treatment arm, but no resistant strains (0/13) were detected at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of azithromycin with ivermectin led to similar decreases in scabies and impetigo prevalence compared to ivermectin alone. The proportion of impetigo lesions containing pyogenic streptococci declined following MDA. There was a transient increase in the proportion of macrolide-resistant S. aureus strains following azithromycin MDA.

29962213,Ozenoxacin: A Novel Topical Quinolone for Impetigo.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the data supporting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling of ozenoxacin and evaluate its place in therapy for impetigo.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using PubMed (1966 to May 2018) and Google Scholar (2000 to May 2018) with the search terms ozenoxacin, T-3912, and GF-001001-00. Other resources included clinicaltrials.gov , the manufacturing product label, and the FDA website.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant English-language data from abstracts, phase 1 to 4 studies, and review articles were included.
DATA SYNTHESIS: FDA labeling of ozenoxacin was based on 2 phase 3 studies conducted in patients 2 months of age and older. Ozenoxacin demonstrated efficacy and safety for use in bullous or nonbullous impetigo from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes as compared with placebo. The lack of systemic absorption results in minimal adverse drug reactions. Studies did not detect possible adverse events commonly associated with other quinolone antibiotics. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This topical quinolone has bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Ozenoxacin may have an expanded clinical role for the treatment of localized impetigo if resistance to current therapies increases significantly. However, ozenoxacin is unlikely to play a significant role in the treatment of impetigo in the foreseeable future, because of lack of direct comparative clinical efficacy data with currently recommended therapies and likely high cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Ozenoxacin, the first nonfluorinated quinolone, is a safe, topical treatment for impetigo in patients 2 months of age and older. Although clinical trials demonstrate efficacy compared with placebo, comparative trials to current treatment options are needed to identify its therapeutic use.","['Wren C', 'Bell E', 'Eiland LS']",2018,52,12,Ann Pharmacother,"Wren C, et al.

29898217,Efficacy and Safety of Ozenoxacin Cream for Treatment of Adult and Pediatric Patients With Impetigo: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Ozenoxacin, a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, has been developed as a cream with 1% active drug for the treatment of impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin cream, 1%, after 5-day twice-daily topical treatment in patients with impetigo.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial included patients 2 months or older with impetigo who were enrolled at centers in 6 countries from June 2, 2014, through May 30, 2015. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat from July 9 through July 22, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topical ozenoxacin or placebo control.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Among the 411 patients who received treatment (210 males [51.1%]; mean [SD] age, 18.6 [18.3] years), ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success compared with placebo, which was evident after 5 days of therapy (112 of 206 [54.4%] vs 78 of 206 [37.9%]; P = .001). Ozenoxacin also demonstrated superior microbiological success compared with placebo after 2 days of therapy (109 of 125 [87.2%] vs 76 of 119 [63.9%]; P = .002). Ozenoxacin was well tolerated, with 8 of 206 patients experiencing adverse effects, with only 1 of these potentially related to the study treatment; none were serious.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Topical ozenoxacin is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of impetigo in patients 2 months and older. This effect is demonstrated by rapid onset of response and superior clinical and microbiological response compared with placebo. Topical ozenoxacin represents a novel option for the treatment of impetigo.

29897142,Clinical and microbiological properties of Staphylococcus lugdunensis skin infections.,"Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an emerging pathogen in skin and soft tissue infections that was previously considered a commensal. The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of skin infections by S. lugdunensis and its appropriate management, in a tertiary referral medical center. The clinical files, bacterial cultures and histopathology reports of all S. lugdunensis isolates from skin infections over a period of 8 years (September 2009-September 2017) were reviewed. S. lugdunensis was isolated from 29 patients with skin infections, aged 7-89 years (mean 33.3 years). A state of immune suppression (drug-induced, malignancy or diabetes) was present in five patients (17%). Folliculitis and cutaneous pustulosis were the most common presentations (16 cases, 55%), followed by secondary infection of hidradenitis suppurativa (five cases, 17%). Other sources of isolation were infected molluscum contagiosum (two cases), folliculitis decalvans (one case), dissecting cellulitis (one case), abscess (one case), cyst (one case), impetigo (one case) and granuloma after trauma (one case). The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed susceptibility to most tested antibiotics, although a few isolates were resistant to gentamycin, penicillin and oxacillin. In 19 of 20 patients for whom follow ups were available, cutaneous manifestations improved or resolved with proper local and/or oral antibiotic therapy. S. lugdunensis may play a role as a primary or secondary pathogen in various skin infections, most commonly folliculitis and pustulosis.

29896852,Interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-36γ but not IL-36Ra are related to acrosyringia in pustule formation associated with palmoplantar pustulosis.,"BACKGROUND: Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a refractory, nonbacterial impetigo confined to the palms and soles. Its pathogenesis is still obscure, but it may be associated with the large eccrine sweat glands and pores of palmoplantar skin. PPP is considered to be a localized pustular psoriasis. Interleukin (IL)-8, IL-36γ and IL-36Ra play important roles in the pathogenesis of pustular psoriasis, but their role in PPP is unclear.
AIM: To evaluate IL-8, IL-36γ and IL-36Ra expression in PPP, and their relationship with acrosyringia and pustule formation.
METHODS: mRNA expression was quantified in skin samples from patients with PPP (n = 7), patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PSV; n = 8) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 6) by reverse-transcription-real-time PCR. Protein expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry (PPP, n = 17; PSV, n = 14; HCs, n = 12). Sweat ducts, including acrosyringia, were stained for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).
RESULTS: IL-8 mRNA and protein were markedly increased in PPP lesions compared with PSV lesions or HC skin. IL-36γ mRNA and protein were significantly more abundant in PPP lesions than in HC skin. IL-36Ra mRNA was significantly overexpressed in PPP lesions compared with HC skin, but there was no difference in IL-36Ra protein between PPP, PSV and HCs. IL-8 was abundantly expressed by neutrophils in PPP pustules, while IL36Ra was localized in the keratinocytes of PPP, PSV and HC skin. IL-36γ and EMA were colocalized in cells surrounding PPP pustules, and IL-36γ was also expressed in sweat duct cells in the dermis.
CONCLUSION: IL-8, IL-36γ and IL-36Ra are overexpressed in PPP lesions. IL-8, IL-36γ and acrosyringia, rather than IL-36Ra, are associated with pustule formation in PPP.","['Xiaoling Y', 'Chao W', 'Wenming W', 'Feng L', 'Hongzhong J']",2019,44,1,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Xiaoling Y, et al.

29852002,Scabies and impetigo in Timor-Leste: A school screening study in two districts.,"INTRODUCTION: Scabies and impetigo are common and important skin conditions which are often neglected in developing countries. Limited data have been published on the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in Timor-Leste. Sequelae including cellulitis, bacteraemia, nephritis, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease contribute significantly to the burden of disease.
METHODS: School students were recruited from schools in Dili (urban) and Ermera (rural) in Timor-Leste for an epidemiological study in October 2016. A standard questionnaire was used to record demographics, anthropometry and skin examination results. Impetigo and scabies were diagnosed based on clinical examination of exposed surfaces, and clinical photographs were reviewed for correlation by an infectious diseases paediatrician. Prevalence of scabies and impetigo were calculated and binary risk factor associations were described using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression multivariate analysis. Continuous variables were analysed for associations using the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 1396 students; median age 11 years (interquartile range (IQR) 9-15). The prevalence of scabies was 22.4% (95% CI 20.2-24.7%) and active impetigo 9.7% (95% CI 8.3-11.4%); 68.2% of students had evidence of either active or healed impetigo. Students in Ermera were more likely than those in Dili to have scabies (prevalence 32.0% vs 5.2%, aOR 8.1 (95% CI 5.2-12.4), p<0.01). There was no difference in the prevalence of active impetigo between urban and rural sites. More than a third of participants were moderately or severely underweight. Stunting was markedly more common in the rural district of Ermera.
CONCLUSION: Scabies and impetigo are common in Timor-Leste, with very high prevalence of scabies in the rural district of Ermera.

29807522,Current State of Nanomedicines in the Treatment of Topical Infectious Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Topical infections, involving a number of diseases such as impetigo, eczema, pustular acne, psoriasis and infected seborrheic dermatitis are one among the many challenges to health which stand out for their profound impact on human species. The treatment of topical infections has always been a difficult proposition because of the lack of efficacy of existing anti-infectives, longer period of treatment and yet incomplete recovery. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains like Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa undermines the need for the development of new delivery systems to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of existing topical anti-infectives.
METHODS: The application of nanotechnology to medicine, or nanomedicine, is rapidly becoming a major driving force behind ongoing changes in the anti-infective field because of its interaction at the sub-atomic level with the skin tissue. The latter, in the current scenario, points towards vesicular carriers like liposomes, lipidic nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles. as the most promising drug delivery solutions for topical infection disorders. These have exhibited immense significance owing to their uniqueness to facilitate the interactions at interfaces with the barrier membranes.
RESULTS: The present review summarizes the emerging efforts in combating topical infections particularly using nanomedicine based delivery systems as new tools to tackle the current challenges in treating infectious diseases. Besides, compiling various research reports, this article also includes formulation considerations, mechanisms of penetration and patents reported.
CONCLUSION: Despite the new emerging technologies and delivery systems, efforts are still needed in the right direction to combat this global challenge.","['Thakur K', 'Sharma G', 'Singh B', 'Chhibber S', 'Katare OP']",2018,13,2,Recent Pat Antiinfect Drug Discov,"Thakur K, et al.

The child was born to Syrian refugees shortly after they arrived in Canada. The case demonstrates the rapid and nearly complete resolution of dramatic skin findings after a course of hydrocortisone ointment and oral antibiotics with adjuvant measures. For resettled refugees, access to family physicians and local language proficiency are common barriers that negatively impact their health and healthcare. We discuss some aspects of how the healthcare model in one Canadian city addresses these issues in the context of this case. The case also raises questions about the burden of dermatological conditions in refugees while in transit and in countries of resettlement. The few reports that exist suggest that some conditions may be relatively common and that the epidemiology warrants additional investigation.","['Green P', 'Munn E']",2018,2018,,BMJ Case Rep,Green P and Munn E.

Affecting any age and race, GPP can occur with other forms of psoriasis or by itself. Stimuli for flares include medications, infections and environmental triggers. The interleukin family and caspase recruitment domain family have been implicated in its pathogenesis. Other forms of pustular psoriasis include impetigo herpetiformis, palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, annular pustular psoriasis and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau. Treatment is not well established, but includes the use of retinoids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, TNF-alpha inhibitors, topical therapy and phototherapy. The use of TNF-alpha inhibitors may result in the formation of antidrug antibodies and should be administered with methotrexate.","['Hoegler KM', 'John AM', 'Handler MZ', 'Schwartz RA']",2018,32,10,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Hoegler KM, et al.

29566923,Cutaneous infections in the mature patient.,"Dermatologists must be familiar with the peculiarities of the micro-organisms that may affect the elderly, in order to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of infections, which may affect their skin, especially because the world population is rapidly aging. It is estimated that there will be 434 million individuals over 80 years of age in 2050. Since the elderly population is rapidly increasing and their infections are usually more severe and different from those observed in younger adults, it leads to a statistical increase of the rates regarding hospitalization and mortality caused by infectious diseases among people over 85 years. Other health issues may be involved in the older population. These include nutritional alterations, as malnutrition or obesity, which can aggravate the infections. Also the usual signs and symptoms of infection are subtle or uncharacteristic in elderly patients, and frequently, they are unable to report their symptoms, which can delay the diagnosis. Among the many infections that may affect the elderly we reviewed the most frequent and those that are different in this age group, as herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, erysipelas, celullitis, impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis and carbunculosis, secondary infections, intertrigo (body folds), fungal infection, and scabies.","['Castro MCR', 'Ramos-E-Silva M']",2018,36,2,Clin Dermatol,Castro MCR and Ramos-E-Silva M.

29490061,Defining the appropriateness and inappropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in primary care.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the appropriateness of prescribing systemic antibiotics for different clinical conditions in primary care, and to quantify 'ideal' antibiotic prescribing proportions in conditions for which antibiotic treatment is sometimes but not always indicated.
METHODS: Prescribing guidelines were consulted to define the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy for the conditions that resulted in antibiotic prescriptions between 2013 and 2015 in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database. The opinions of subject experts were then formally elicited to quantify ideal antibiotic prescribing proportions for 10 common conditions.
RESULTS: Of the antibiotic prescriptions in THIN, 52.5% were for conditions that could be assessed using prescribing guidelines. Among these, the vast majority of prescriptions (91.4%) were for conditions where antibiotic appropriateness is conditional on patient-specific indicators. Experts estimated low ideal prescribing proportions in acute, non-comorbid presentations of many of these conditions, such as cough (10% of patients), rhinosinusitis (11%), bronchitis (13%) and sore throat (13%). Conversely, antibiotics were believed to be appropriate in 75% of non-pregnant women with non-recurrent urinary tract infection. In impetigo and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, experts clustered into distinct groups that believed in either high or low prescribing.
CONCLUSIONS: In English primary care, most antibiotics are prescribed for conditions that only sometimes require antibiotic treatment, depending on patient-specific indicators. Experts estimated low ideal prescribing proportions in many of these conditions. Incomplete prescribing guidelines and disagreement about prescribing in some conditions highlight further research needs.","['Smith DRM', 'Dolk FCK', 'Pouwels KB', 'Christie M', 'Robotham JV', 'Smieszek T']",2018,73,suppl_2,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Smith DRM, et al.

29490060,Actual versus 'ideal' antibiotic prescribing for common conditions in English primary care.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous work based on guidelines and expert opinion identified 'ideal' prescribing proportions-the overall proportion of consultations that should result in an antibiotic prescription-for common infectious conditions. Here, actual condition-specific prescribing proportions in primary care in England were compared with ideal prescribing proportions identified by experts.
METHODS: All recorded consultations for common infectious conditions (cough, bronchitis, exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sore throat, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza-like illness, urinary tract infection, impetigo, acne, gastroenteritis) for 2013-15 were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. The proportions of consultations resulting in an antibiotic prescription were established, concentrating on acute presentations in patients without relevant comorbidities. These actual prescribing proportions were then compared with previously established 'ideal' proportions by condition.
RESULTS: For most conditions, substantially higher proportions of consultations resulted in an antibiotic prescription than was deemed appropriate according to expert opinion. An antibiotic was prescribed in 41% of all acute cough consultations when experts advocated 10%. For other conditions the proportions were: bronchitis (actual 82% versus ideal 13%); sore throat (actual 59% versus ideal 13%); rhinosinusitis (actual 88% versus ideal 11%); and acute otitis media in 2- to 18-year-olds (actual 92% versus ideal 17%). Substantial variation between practices was found.

29472269,Understanding the gender gap in antibiotic prescribing: a cross-sectional analysis of English primary care.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the causes of the gender gap in antibiotic prescribing, and to determine whether women are more likely than men to receive an antibiotic prescription per consultation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of routinely collected electronic medical records from The Health Improvement Network (THIN).
SETTING: English primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who consulted general practices registered with THIN between 2013 and 2015.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Total antibiotic prescribing was measured in children (<19 years), adults (19-64 years) and the elderly (65+ years). For 12 common conditions, the number of adult consultations was measured, and the relative risk (RR) of being prescribed antibiotics when consulting as female or with comorbidity was estimated.
RESULTS: Among 4.57 million antibiotic prescriptions observed in the data, female patients received 67% more prescriptions than male patients, and 43% more when excluding antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infection (UTI). These gaps were more pronounced in adult women (99% more prescriptions than men; 69% more when excluding UTI) than in children (9%; 0%) or the elderly (67%; 38%). Among adults, women accounted for 64% of consultations (62% among patients with comorbidity), but were not substantially more likely than men to receive an antibiotic prescription when consulting with common conditions such as cough (RR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02), sore throat (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01) and lower respiratory tract infection (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01). Exceptions were skin conditions: women were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics when consulting with acne (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.69) or impetigo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: The gender gap in antibiotic prescribing can largely be explained by consultation behaviour. Although in most cases adult men and women are equally likely to be prescribed an antibiotic when consulting primary care, it is unclear whether or not they are equally indicated for antibiotic therapy.","['Smith DRM', 'Dolk FCK', 'Smieszek T', 'Robotham JV', 'Pouwels KB']",2018,8,2,BMJ Open,"Smith DRM, et al.

29422292,Autoinflammatory keratinization diseases: An emerging concept encompassing various inflammatory keratinization disorders of the skin.,"Classifying inflammatory skin diseases is challenging, especially for the expanding group of disorders triggered by genetic factors resulting in hyperactivated innate immunity that result in overlapping patterns of dermal and epidermal inflammation with hyperkeratosis. For such conditions, the umbrella term ""autoinflammatory keratinization diseases"" (AIKD) has been proposed. AIKD encompasses diseases with mixed pathomechanisms of autoinflammation and autoimmunity, and includes IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra)-related pustulosis, CARD14-mediated pustular psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) type V, and familial keratosis lichenoides chronica (KLC). Mechanistically, the entities include generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) without psoriasis vulgaris, impetigo herpetiformis and acrodermatitis continua, which are IL-36Ra-related pustuloses caused by loss-of-function mutations in IL36RN; GPP with psoriasis vulgaris and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis which are CARD14-mediated pustular psoriasiform dermatoses with gain-of-function variants of CARD14; PRP type V which is caused by gain-of-function mutations in CARD14; and, familial KLC in which mutations in NLRP1, an inflammasome sensor protein predominantly expressed in skin, have been identified.

29377078,Impact of climate change on dermatological conditions related to flooding: update from the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Committee.,"Climate change contributes to the increase in severity and frequency of flooding, which is the most frequent and deadly disaster worldwide. Flood-related damage can be very severe and include health effects. Among those health impacts, dermatological diseases are one of the most frequently encountered. Both infectious and noninfectious dermatological conditions are increasing after flooding. We searched PubMed using the search term climate change OR global warming OR rainfall OR flooding OR skin. Articles published in the English-language literature were included. We also searched the International Society of Dermatology website library on climate change for additional articles. There is an increased risk of trauma during the course of a natural disaster. The majority of post-tsunami wound infections were polymicrobial, but gram-negative bacteria were the leading causes. Infectious diseases with dermatological manifestations, such as impetigo, leptospirosis, measles, dengue fever, tinea corporis, malaria, and leishmaniasis, are important causes of morbidity among flood-afflicted individuals. Insect bites and stings, and parasite infestations such as scabies and cutaneous larva migrans are also frequently observed. Inflammatory conditions including irritant contact dermatitis are among the leading dermatological conditions. Dermatological conditions such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, psoriasis, and urticaria can be induced or exacerbated by psychological conditions post disaster. Prevention is essential in the management of skin diseases because of flooding. Avoiding exposure to contaminated environments, wearing protective devices, rapid provision of clean water and sanitation facilities, prompt vector controls, and education about disease risk and prevention are important.","['Dayrit JF', 'Bintanjoyo L', 'Andersen LK', 'Davis MDP']",2018,57,8,Int J Dermatol,"Dayrit JF, et al.

BACKGROUND: In 2016, a service (Pharmacy First) was introduced in Forth Valley for the management of UTI, impetigo and exacerbation of COPD using patient group directions in community pharmacies. Trained pharmacists supplied a limited range of prescription medicines. Pathways for GP referral were defined. After 5 months of implementation, the service was evaluated. METHODS: A quantitative evaluation was undertaken. Feedback was sought from patients, GPs, pharmacists and GP reception staff, using structured questionnaires. Pharmacy records were used to assess referrals and pharmacy data summarised the number and type of consultations. Basic cost data was obtained from the Health Board.FindingsIn all, 75 pharmacies (of 76), and all 55 GP practices in the area, participated in the service. Over a 5-month period, 1189 cases were managed, the majority being for UTI (75.4%) followed by impetigo (15.2%), then COPD (9.3%). Of all cases, 77.9% were prescribed medication by the pharmacist, 9.1% were given advice only and 16.7% were referred to the GP. Independent clinical assessment of a random sample of 30 GP referrals considered all to be 'appropriate'. Feedback was received from 69 pharmacists, 34 GPs, 54 reception staff and 73 patients. Patients were very satisfied with the service, most frequently citing the 'quick and efficient' access to treatment, and a 'professional service'. Two thirds of GPs (67%) and 59% of reception staff found the service useful, mainly because it reduced pressure on GP appointments. A further cost benefit evaluation would allow objective assessment of the value of this service.","['Stewart F', 'Caldwell G', 'Cassells K', 'Burton J', 'Watson A']",2018,19,6,Prim Health Care Res Dev,"Stewart F, et al.

Although there is an increased incidence of infectious episodes in renal transplant recipients, IRGN as a cause of de novo glomerulonephritis is rarely seen probably due to impaired immunity. We hereby report a 28-year-old male renal transplant recipient, who developed IRGN following impetigenous skin lesions after six years of transplant. He developed rapid worsening of allograft function and was started on hemodialysis. Allograft renal biopsy showed diffuse exudative endocapillary proliferation with crescents. Electron microscopy revealed large subepithelial hump-like deposits. Despite pulse steroid therapy, he became dialysis dependent. Our patient is unique in the way that poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in an adult after renal transplantation has not been reported so far. We conclude that IRGN after renal transplant, though rare is a possible etiology for allograft dysfunction. There is no definitive treatment protocol for this de novo glomerulonephritis which has an overall poor prognosis.","['Gopalakrishnan N', 'Jeyachandran D', 'Abeesh P', 'Dineshkumar T', 'Kurien AA', 'Sakthirajan R', 'Balasubramaniyan T']",2017,28,6,Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl,"Gopalakrishnan N, et al.

29190667,Hospital admissions for skin infections among Western Australian children and adolescents from 1996 to 2012.,"The objective of this study was to describe the occurrence of skin infection associated hospitalizations in children born in Western Australia (WA). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in WA between 1996 and 2012 (n = 469,589). Of these, 31,348 (6.7%) were Aboriginal and 240,237 (51.2%) were boys. We report the annual age-specific hospital admission rates by geographical location and diagnostic category. We applied log-linear regression modelling to analyse changes in temporal trends of hospitalizations. Hospitalization rates for skin infections in Aboriginal children (31.7/1000 child-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.0-32.4) were 15.0 times higher (95% CI 14.5-15.5; P<0.001) than those of non-Aboriginal children (2.1/1000 child-years; 95% CI 2.0-2.1). Most admissions in Aboriginal children were due to abscess, cellulitis and scabies (84.3%), while impetigo and pyoderma were the predominant causes in non-Aboriginal children (97.7%). Admissions declined with age, with the highest rates for all skin infections observed in infants. Admissions increased with remoteness. Multiple admissions were more common in Aboriginal children. Excess admissions in Aboriginal children were observed during the wet season in the Kimberley and during summer in metropolitan areas. Our study findings show that skin infections are a significant cause of severe disease, requiring hospitalization in Western Australian children, with Aboriginal children at a particularly high risk. Improved community-level prevention of skin infections and the provision of effective primary care are crucial in reducing the burden of skin infection associated hospitalizations. The contribution of sociodemographic and environmental risk factors warrant further investigation.","['Abdalla T', 'Hendrickx D', 'Fathima P', 'Walker R', 'Blyth CC', 'Carapetis JR', 'Bowen AC', 'Moore HC']",2017,12,11,PLoS One,"Abdalla T, et al.

Antibiotics are the first-line treatment when multiple lesions exist, but with an increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria the successful management of impetigo in the future is an area of concern.
COMMENT: Current treatment options that favour the use of oral antibiotic therapy are increasingly problematic. Widespread use of these agents contributes to antimicrobial resistance and has adverse consequences for individuals and communities. There is a need for new topical antimicrobials and antiseptics as an alternative treatment strategy.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: To successfully treat impetigo into the future and ensure that therapy does not contribute to bacterial resistance, additional research is required to ascertain the usefulness of alternative agents, including new topical antimicrobials and antiseptics.","[""D'Cunha NM"", 'Peterson GM', 'Baby KE', 'Thomas J']",2018,43,1,J Clin Pharm Ther,"D'Cunha NM, et al.

29020160,Immune Cross-Opsonization Within emm Clusters Following Group A Streptococcus Skin Infection: Broadening the Scope of Type-Specific Immunity.,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) skin infections are particularly prevalent in developing nations. The GAS M protein, by which strains are differentiated into >220 different emm types, is immunogenic and elicits protective antibodies. A major obstacle for vaccine development has been the traditional understanding that immunity following infection is restricted to a single emm type. However, recent evidence has led to the hypothesis of immune cross-reactivity between emm types.
METHODS: We investigated the human serological response to GAS impetigo in Fijian schoolchildren, focusing on 3 major emm clusters (E4, E6, and D4). Pre- and postinfection sera were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with N-terminal M peptides and bactericidal assays using the infecting-type strain, emm cluster-related strains, and nonrelated strains.
RESULTS: Twenty of the 53 paired sera demonstrated a ≥4-fold increase in antibody titer against the infecting type. When tested against all cluster-related M peptides, we found that 9 of 17 (53%) paired sera had a ≥4-fold increase in antibody titer to cluster-related strains as well. When grouped by cluster, the mean change to cluster-related emm types in E4 and E6 was >4-fold (5.9-fold and 19.5-fold, respectively) but for D4 was 3.8-fold. The 17 paired sera were tested in bactericidal assays against selected cluster-related and nonrelated strains. While the responses were highly variable, numerous instances of cross-reactive killing were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that M type-specific and cross-reactive immune responses occur following skin infection. The cross-reactive immune responses frequently align with emm clusters, raising new opportunities to design multivalent vaccines with broad coverage.","['Frost HR', 'Laho D', 'Sanderson-Smith ML', 'Licciardi P', 'Donath S', 'Curtis N', 'Kado J', 'Dale JB', 'Steer AC', 'Smeesters PR']",2017,65,9,Clin Infect Dis,"Frost HR, et al.

It uses different adhesins and virulence factors like Cpa (collagen binding protein) and Scl (collagen-like protein) in its pathogenicity. Scl having similarities with human collagen may contribute to inducing autoimmunity in the host. Here we assessed gene expression, antibody titer of Cpa, Scl1 and Scl2 in both clinical GAS isolates (n = 45) and blood (n = 45) obtained from pharyngitis, ARF (acute rheumatic fever) and RHD respectively. Skin isolates (n = 30) were obtained from impetigo patients. The study revealed a total of 27 GAS emm types. Frequency of cpa, scl1, scl2 was high in ARF isolates. The antibody titer of these proteins was high in all isolates, and also in patients with pharyngitis and ARF. All isolates showed high binding affinity toward collagen I and IV, which further indicates a potential host pathogen interaction. Our study reflects a strong association of Cpa and Scls in early and post-GAS pathogenicity. However, the increased antibody titer of Scl1 and Scl2 during ARF may be attributed to a cogent immune response in the host.","['Chaudhary P', 'Kumar R', 'Sagar V', 'Sarkar S', 'Singh R', 'Ghosh S', 'Singh S', 'Chakraborti A']",2018,169,1,Res Microbiol,"Chaudhary P, et al.

28868633,A 5-year randomized trial on the safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis: a critical appraisal.,"AIM: The PETITE study (Sigurgeirsson et al.) aimed to compare safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream (PIM) and low-to-medium-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) in children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).
SETTING AND DESIGN: Participants of this 5-year drug-company sponsored multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial were recruited between April 2004 and October 2005. No details are reported regarding the study sites.
STUDY EXPOSURE: Infants aged ≥ 3 to < 12 months with mild-to-moderate AD were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either PIM or a low- or medium-potency TCS cream/ointment for 5 years. No information on specific TCS products used was provided. The topical treatment was applied twice daily 'until complete AD clearance or for as long as allowed by the label of the specific TCS', and was reinitiated at the occurrence of first signs and symptoms of AD flares. In the PIM group, exacerbations not controlled by PIM were treated with short-term TCSs.
OUTCOMES: Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded 'during clinic visits'. In a proportion of the patients, various immunological assessments including antibody titres to common vaccine antigens, immunoglobulin levels, B and T lymphocyte cell counts, and T-cell proliferation tests were performed. The children's growth was assessed by measuring height and weight. AD severity was measured using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score and the percentage of the total body surface area affected. No specific information was provided on the number and scheduling of study visits. Primary outcomes were the incidence of AEs 'of primary clinical interest' and those with a crude incidence of ≥ 5% in either treatment group. Secondary outcome was 'long-term efficacy' defined as IGA ≤ 1 at week 3 and year 5.
RESULTS: Patients in the PIM group experienced significantly more AEs [bronchitis (P = 0·02), infected eczema (P ≤ 0·001), impetigo (P = 0·045), nasopharyngitis (P = 0·04)]. No significant differences were seen for the other AEs. The overall incidence of SAEs was slightly higher for PIM (20·5% vs. 17·3%; P = 0·046). The proportion of participants with IGA ≤ 1 at year 5 was 88·7% for PIM and 92·3% for TCS, a success rate difference of 3·6% (95% confidence interval 0·8-6·4) favouring TCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Sigurgeirsson et al. conclude that the long-term management of mild-to-moderate AD in children with both TCS and PIM is safe, and that PIM has similar efficacy to TCS.

28823705,Acanthamoeba castellanii interactions with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Among the genus Streptococcus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are the major causes of pharyngitis, impetigo, pneumonia and meningitis in humans. Streptococcus spp. are facultative anaerobes that are nutritionally fastidious, yet survive in the environment and target the predisposed population. Antibacterial disinfectants have been partially effective only, indicating the need for novel preventative measures and to understand mechanisms of bacterial resistance. Acanthamoeba is a free-living protist that is known to harbour microbial pathogens, provide shelter, and assist in their transmission to susceptible population. The overall aim of this study was to determine whether S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae can interact with A. castellanii by associating, invading, and surviving inside trophozoites and cysts. It was observed that both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were able to associate as well as invade and/or taken up by the phagocytic A. castellanii trophozoite. Notably, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survived the encystation process, avoided phagocytosis, multiplied, and exhibited higher recovery from the mature cysts, compared with the trophozoite stage (approximately 2 bacteria per amoebae ratio for cyst stage versus 0.02 bacteria per amoeba ration for trophozoite stage). As Acanthamoeba cysts are resilient and can disperse through the air, A. castellanii can act as a vector in providing shelter, facilitating growth and possibly genetic exchanges. In addition, these interactions may contribute to S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survival in harsh environments, and transmission to susceptible population and possibly affecting their virulence. Future studies will determine the molecular mechanisms associated with Acanthamoeba interactions with Streptococcus and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria and in turn expedite the discovery of novel therapeutic and/or preventative measures.","['Siddiqui R', 'Yee Ong TY', 'Jung SY', 'Khan NA']",2017,183,,Exp Parasitol,"Siddiqui R, et al.

METHODS: We performed a literature search using the MEDLINE electronic database. Only original articles published in English were considered for review.
RESULTS: Biofilms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acne, eczema, hidradenitis suppurativa, onychomycosis, miliaria, and impetigo. Adverse dermal-filler reactions are also linked to biofilms. Strict aseptic technique and prophylactic antibiotics are recommended in order to avoid such complications. Finally, biofilms are implicated in wounds, mainly chronic and diabetic, where they impede healing and cause recurrent infections. Several novel anti-biofilm agents and wound debridement have been shown to be beneficial.

An additional 10,904 cases occurred in theater of operations (460.0 per 10,000 p-yrs). Approximately half (49.4%) were classified as ""other SSTI"" (e.g., folliculitis, impetigo); 45.9% were cellulitis/abscess; 4.6% were carbuncles/furuncles; and 0.1% were erysipelas. Annual incidence rates declined by 46.6% over the surveillance period. In general, higher rates of SSTIs were associated with younger age, recruit trainee status, and junior enlisted rank. During the surveillance period, 238,924 service members were treated for SSTIs in outpatient or inpatient settings, which accounted for 395,361 medical encounters and 19,213 hospital bed days.

28723479,Infectious Complications of Circumcision and Their Prevention.,"CONTEXT: A growing body of evidence supports the health benefits of circumcision, but the occurrence of infectious complications is of concern.
OBJECTIVE: To review literature presenting past data and studies of infectious complications of circumcision and their prevention.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, Embase, Turning Research into Practice, PubMed, and Medline databases from their inception through June 25, 2015. Results were closely evaluated, and articles and documents that were not pertinent or redundant were excluded.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Although uncommon, local, systemic, and toxin-related infectious complications of circumcision represent a significant clinical problem. In general, untrained providers create more infectious and noninfectious complications when performing male circumcision than do well-trained providers, regardless of whether they are physicians, nurses, or traditional religious providers. Local complications include staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, cellulitis, impetigo, pyoderma, necrotizing fasciitis, scalded skin syndrome (staphylococcal), Fournier gangrene, glanular necrosis, scrotal abscess, and peritonitis. Ritual circumcision is rarely associated with acquisition of tuberculosis, diphtheria, or herpes virus. Systemic infectious complications include bacteremia, wound sepsis, and meningitis. Circumcision has also been associated with neonatal and adult tetanus.
CONCLUSIONS: Infectious complications following circumcision should be reduced with trained and competent practitioners performing the procedure using sterile techniques.

28722612,The Epidemiology of Scabies and Impetigo in Relation to Demographic and Residential Characteristics: Baseline Findings from the Skin Health Intervention Fiji Trial.,"Scabies and associated impetigo are under-recognized causes of morbidity in many developing countries. To strengthen the evidence base for scabies control we undertook a trial of mass treatment for scabies. We report on the occurrence and predictors of scabies and impetigo in participants at baseline. Participants were recruited in six island communities and were examined for the presence of scabies and impetigo. In addition to descriptive analyses, logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between demographic variables and outcome of interest. The study enrolled 2051 participants. Scabies prevalence was 36.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.3-38.5), highest in children 5-9 years (55.7%). Impetigo prevalence was 23.4% (95% CI 21.5-25.2) highest in children aged 10-14 (39.0%). People with scabies were 2.8× more likely to have impetigo. The population attributable risk of scabies as a cause of impetigo was 36.3% and 71.0% in children aged less than five years. Households with four or more people sharing the same room were more likely to have scabies and impetigo (odds ratios [OR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2 and OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.2 respectively) compared to households with rooms occupied by a single individual. This study confirms the high burden of scabies and impetigo in Fiji and the association between these two conditions, particularly in young children. Overcrowding, young age, and clinical distribution of lesion are important risk factors for scabies and impetigo. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the decline of endemic scabies would translate into a definite reduction of the burden of associated complications.","['Romani L', 'Whitfeld MJ', 'Koroivueta J', 'Kama M', 'Wand H', 'Tikoduadua L', 'Tuicakau M', 'Koroi A', 'Ritova R', 'Andrews R', 'Kaldor JM', 'Steer AC']",2017,97,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Romani L, et al.

28671945,"Are scabies and impetigo ""normalised""? A cross-sectional comparative study of hospitalised children in northern Australia assessing clinical recognition and treatment of skin infections.","BACKGROUND: Complications of scabies and impetigo such as glomerulonephritis and invasive bacterial infection in Australian Aboriginal children remain significant problems and the overall global burden of disease attributable to these skin infections remains high despite the availability of effective treatment. We hypothesised that one factor contributing to this high burden is that skin infection is under-recognised and hence under-treated, in settings where prevalence is high.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study to assess the burden of scabies, impetigo, tinea and pediculosis in children admitted to two regional Australian hospitals from October 2015 to January 2016. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted in November 2014 (mid-point of the prospective data collection in the preceding year) was performed. Prevalence of documented skin infection was compared in the prospective and retrospective population to assess clinician recognition and treatment of skin infections.
RESULTS: 158 patients with median age 3.6 years, 74% Aboriginal, were prospectively recruited. 77 patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Scabies (8.2% vs 0.0%, OR N/A, p = 0.006) and impetigo (49.4% vs 19.5%, OR 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI 2.1-7.7) were more prevalent in the prospective analysis. Skin examination was only documented in 45.5% of cases in the retrospective review. Patients in the prospective analysis were more likely to be prescribed specific treatment for skin infection compared with those in the retrospective review (31.6% vs 5.2%, OR 8.5 (95% CI 2.9-24.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Scabies and impetigo infections are under-recognised and hence under-treated by clinicians. Improving the recognition and treatment of skin infections by clinicians is a priority to reduce the high burden of skin infection and subsequent sequelae in paediatric populations where scabies and impetigo are endemic.","['Yeoh DK', 'Anderson A', 'Cleland G', 'Bowen AC']",2017,11,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Yeoh DK, et al.

28658887,A Screening Study on Dermatoses in Pregnancy.,"INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy produces many cutaneous changes, some of which are specifically related to pregnancy (dermatoses of pregnancy), some are modifiable by pregnancy and others that are common are named physiologic. These physiologic skin changes, usually do not impair the health of the mother or the fetus but some of them can be cosmetically significant and of importance to the dermatologist.
AIM: The present study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of the physiological and pathological skin changes in pregnancy, and to correlate the prevalence of the major cutaneous changes and diseases in relation to different trimesters of pregnancy and with gravidity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of August 2008 to August 2010. Ethical clearance was sought from Institutional Ethical Committee. Five hundred pregnant women were randomly selected, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and gravidity. Detailed history and complete dermatological examination was done. Results were tabulated and analysed. Statistical analysis was done by Fisher's exact test and Chi square test.
RESULTS: Physiological skin changes were seen in 94.8% of cases, with pigmentary changes being more common (90.8%). Specific dermatoses of pregnancy were observed in 14% of cases with pruritus gravidarum being the most common (10.4%). Prevalence of infection was found to 30.8% with fungal infection being the most common (23.8%). Exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus and neurofibromatosis was observed. Pigmentary changes, striae gravidarum and specific dermatoses of pregnancy were observed in statistically significant proportion in primigravidas and during third trimester.
CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes that the prevalence of physiological skin changes (94.8%) was much higher than specific dermatoses (14%), stressing the fact that in most instances, the skin problems during pregnancy needs only reassurance. But meticulous observation and examination should be done, as pregnancy can influence many dermatological diseases and infections.","['Kannambal K', 'Tharini GK']",2017,11,5,J Clin Diagn Res,Kannambal K and Tharini GK.

28592405,"Current and Emerging Topical Antibacterials and Antiseptics: Agents, Action, and Resistance Patterns.","Bacterial skin infections represent some of the most common infectious diseases globally. Prevention and treatment of skin infections can involve application of a topical antimicrobial, which may be an antibiotic (such as mupirocin or fusidic acid) or an antiseptic (such as chlorhexidine or alcohol). However, there is limited evidence to support the widespread prophylactic or therapeutic use of topical agents. Challenges involved in the use of topical antimicrobials include increasing rates of bacterial resistance, local hypersensitivity reactions (particularly to older agents, such as bacitracin), and concerns about the indiscriminate use of antiseptics potentially coselecting for antibiotic resistance. We review the evidence for the major clinical uses of topical antibiotics and antiseptics. In addition, we review the mechanisms of action of common topical agents and define the clinical and molecular epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in these agents. Moreover, we review the potential use of newer and emerging agents, such as retapamulin and ebselen, and discuss the role of antiseptic agents in preventing bacterial skin infections. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical efficacy and drivers of resistance to topical agents will inform the optimal use of these agents to preserve their activity in the future.","['Williamson DA', 'Carter GP', 'Howden BP']",2017,30,3,Clin Microbiol Rev,"Williamson DA, et al.

Thus, to elucidate the prevalence and characteristics of pvl-positive community-onset MRSA in Japan, we conducted a molecular epidemiological analysis for 854 S. aureus isolates obtained from outpatients with skin infections during 2013 and 2014. The isolation rate of MRSA was 25.6% (219 isolates), and the ratio of pvl-positive MRSA was 13.2% (29 isolates). Notably, the proportion (93.8%) of pvl-positive isolates was particularly high among MRSA isolates from Ishigaki island in Okinawa. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing showed that the pulsotype C isolates (11 isolates) were typical USA300 clones with arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) type I-CC8-IV lineages and prevalent on the main island of Japan (Honshu). Pulsotypes A (11 isolates) and B (four isolates) consisted of ACME-negative CC8-IV clones and were specific for Ishigaki island. Both USA300 and Okinawa-Ishigaki specific clones were associated with deep-seated skin infections, such as furuncle and cellulitis.

28545045,"Differences in SpeB protease activity among group A streptococci associated with superficial, invasive, and autoimmune disease.","The secreted cysteine proteinase SpeB is an important virulence factor of group A streptococci (GAS), whereby SpeB activity varies widely among strains. To establish the degree to which SpeB activity correlates with disease, GAS organisms were recovered from patients with pharyngitis, impetigo, invasive disease or acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and selected for analysis using rigorous sampling criteria; >300 GAS isolates were tested for SpeB activity by casein digestion assays, and each GAS isolate was scored as a SpeB-producer or non-producer. Highly significant statistical differences (p < 0.01) in SpeB production are observed between GAS recovered from patients with ARF (41.5% SpeB-non-producers) compared to pharyngitis (20.5%), invasive disease (16.7%), and impetigo (5.5%). SpeB activity differences between pharyngitis and impetigo isolates are also significant, whereas pharyngitis versus invasive isolates show no significant difference. The disproportionately greater number of SpeB-non-producers among ARF-associated isolates may indicate an altered transcriptional program for many rheumatogenic strains and/or a protective role for SpeB in GAS-triggered autoimmunity.","['Ly AT', 'Noto JP', 'Walwyn OL', 'Tanz RR', 'Shulman ST', 'Kabat W', 'Bessen DE']",2017,12,5,PLoS One,"Ly AT, et al.

28528647,Transition Metal Homeostasis in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.,"Trace metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu are essential for various biological functions including proper innate immune function. The host immune system has complicated and coordinated mechanisms in place to either starve and/or overload invading pathogens with various metals to combat the infection. Here, we discuss the roles of Fe, Mn and Zn in terms of nutritional immunity, and also the roles of Cu and Zn in metal overload in relation to the physiology and pathogenesis of two human streptococcal species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. S. pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that is carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx by up to 70% of the population; however, transition to internal sites can cause a range of diseases such as pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis and bacteraemia. S. pyogenes is a human pathogen responsible for diseases ranging from pharyngitis and impetigo, to severe invasive infections. Both species have overlapping capacity with respect to metal acquisition, export and regulation and how metal homeostasis relates to their virulence and ability to invade and survive within the host. It is becoming more apparent that metals have an important role to play in the control of infection, and with further investigations, it could lead to the potential use of metals in novel antimicrobial therapies.","['Turner AG', 'Ong CY', 'Walker MJ', 'Djoko KY', 'McEwan AG']",2017,70,,Adv Microb Physiol,"Turner AG, et al.

28429969,Advances in pharmacotherapeutic management of common skin diseases in neonates and infants.,"neonatal and infantile skin diseases are frequently encountered in the clinical practice and represent worldwide a socioeconomic issue. They encompass a wide range of acquired or congenital conditions, including infections, vascular lesions and inflammatory diseases and can present with different degrees of severity, leading in some cases to dramatic complications. Areas covered: In this paper we report the most recent evidences on the management of some common skin diseases in neonates and infants. Hemangiomas, viral, fungal and bacterial infections, omphalitis, atopic and seborrhoeic dermatitis, napkin disease will be treated and discussed. Expert opinion: The majority of the dermatologic alterations in neonates are physiological, transient and do not require any treatment, thus the parents can be reassured about the good prognosis. However, in some cases, serious conditions must be excluded. In particular neonatal and infantile infections should be promptly recognized and properly managed, to avoid severe complications. The therapeutic options include traditional and, although few, innovative medical treatments, which will be carefully taken into consideration by the expert Dermatologists and Paediatricians.","['Patrizi A', 'Neri I', 'Ricci G', 'Cipriani F', 'Ravaioli GM']",2017,18,7,Expert Opin Pharmacother,"Patrizi A, et al.

28408046,[Evaluation of practices in the management of scabies in children].,"BACKGROUND: Scabies has been on the rise in France in recent years and has posed therapeutic problems, mainly due to the withdrawal of benzyl benzoate. The objective of this study was to describe prescribing practices for scabies in children.
METHODS: A national survey was conducted by means of a standardized questionnaire covering various clinical situations of scabies and the drugs used preferentially according to age, which was sent out between December 2014 and March 2015 to members of the clinical research group of the French Society of Paediatric Dermatology.
RESULTS: Of the 38 experts contacted, 20 replied. For a typical case of scabies, 55% of the experts initially prescribed oral ivermectin for children aged 6 years, 15% prescribed ivermectin in children aged 2 years, and 5% in infants aged 3 months. Ivermectin was more widely prescribed after failure of prior treatment or recurrence of scabies, on skin lesions or impetigo, if precarious, especially for profuse hyperkeratotic scabies. A total of 35% of the experts reported no prescribing restrictions with regard to patient age or weight. Discrepancies were observed concerning the mode of administration and the time between consecutive doses. Esdepallethrin remained the preferred local treatment among the experts (38% of all topical prescriptions) except in asthmatic children, while permethrin was the least-prescribed topical agent.
DISCUSSION: This study confirms the heterogeneity of our practices. Formal expert recommendations are awaited, particularly concerning the use of ivermectin in infants.","['Lê MS', 'Richard MA', 'Baumstarck K', 'Hesse S', 'Gaudy-Marqueste C', 'Grob JJ', 'Mallet S', 'le groupe de recherche en dermatologie pédiatrique de la Société Française de Dermatologie']",2017,144,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Lê MS, et al.

A number of group A streptococcus vaccine candidates have been developed, but only one 26-valent recombinant M protein vaccine has entered clinical trials. Differing from the design of a 26-valent recombinant M protein vaccine, we provide here a vaccination using the polyvalence epitope recombinant FSBM protein (rFSBM), which contains four different epitopes, including the fibronectin-binding repeats domain of streptococcal fibronectin binding protein Sfb1, the C-terminal immunogenic segment of streptolysin S, the C3-binding motif of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, and the C-terminal conserved segment of M protein. Vaccination with the rFSBM protein successfully prevented mortality and skin lesions caused by several emm strains of GAS infection. Anti-FSBM antibodies collected from the rFSBM-immunized mice were able to opsonize at least six emm strains and can neutralize the hemolytic activity of streptolysin S. Furthermore, the internalization of GAS into nonphagocytic cells is also reduced by anti-FSBM serum. These findings suggest that rFSBM can be applied as a vaccine candidate to prevent different emm strains of GAS infection.","['Kuo CF', 'Tsao N', 'Hsieh IC', 'Lin YS', 'Wu JJ', 'Hung YT']",2017,12,3,PLoS One,"Kuo CF, et al.

28318768,Clinical development strategy for a candidate group A streptococcal vaccine.,"GroupA streptococci (GAS) cause a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from benign pharyngitis and skin infections to severe invasive disease and the immune sequelae rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Pharyngitis, one of the most frequent diseases caused by GAS, is highly prevalent in school-age children in temperate climates and a major cause of antibiotic use. An efficacious vaccine would reduce disease burden associated with pharyngitis and the need of care for sick children. Importantly, GAS pharyngitis is recognised as the main precursor for acute rheumatic fever so a vaccine that is efficacious against GAS pharyngitis should also prevent acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. It may also prevent post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and invasive disease since GAS pharyngitis is one of the precursors for these clinical syndromes. There has been no clearly articulated pathway for clinical trial design leading to GAS vaccine registration. This review outlines a clinical development strategy detailing the phases of development required for registration of a candidate GAS vaccine for GAS pharyngitis initially, followed by impetigo and associated sequelae. The major advantages of a strategy first focused on GAS pharyngitis is an early proof of principle, that can be followed by studies for other clinical syndromes. The end goal being the availability of a preventive tool for the most prevalent GAS-associated diseases globally.","['Schödel F', 'Moreland NJ', 'Wittes JT', 'Mulholland K', 'Frazer I', 'Steer AC', 'Fraser JD', 'Carapetis J']",2017,35,16,Vaccine,"Schödel F, et al.

The recombinant fusion protein (SpeAB) combines inactive mutant forms of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB). The SpeAB vaccine evaluated in this study was adsorbed to an aluminum adjuvant and demonstrated robust immunogenicity, eliciting production of specific neutralizing antibodies against SpeA and SpeB, two major virulence factors of S. pyogenes. Stability studies suggest that the vaccine will retain immunogenicity for at least 2 years when stored at refrigerated temperatures. This novel vaccine shows great potential to provide protection against GAS infections and to reduce the burden of GAS disease globally.","['Burlet E', 'HogenEsch H', 'Dunham A', 'Morefield G']",2017,19,3,AAPS J,"Burlet E, et al.

28232364,Antibiotic prescribing during office hours and out-of-hours: a comparison of quality and quantity in primary care in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary and non-first-choice antibiotic prescribing is a significant problem in primary care. It is often argued that irrational prescribing is higher during out-of-hours (OOH) consultations.
AIM: To obtain insight into the quantity and quality of OOH antibiotic prescribing for commonly presented infectious diseases.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Two two-way comparisons of 1) nationally dispensed antibiotics during office hours and OOH care, using data from the Dutch Foundation of Pharmaceutical Statistics, and 2) regional prescribing quality data from 45 primary care practices from Utrecht and its vicinity, and two large OOH services in Utrecht and Woerden.
METHOD: From the national data, yearly dispensed antibiotics were analysed per prescriber type, with respect to time (office hours or OOH) of prescription, types of antibiotics, and patients' age group. Regional prescribing rates, choice of antibiotic, and appropriateness of prescribing were compared for otitis media, sinusitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, cystitis, and impetigo. Appropriateness was assessed by comparing all relevant information from medical files with the guideline recommendations.
RESULTS: Only 6% of GP-prescribed antibiotics were prescribed OOH. OOH, cystitis and acute otitis media presented most often. First-choice prescribing was comparable for the two settings, whereas prescribing rates were higher OOH, with comparatively more amoxicillin(/clavulanate). The appropriateness evaluation, however, revealed that overprescribing was comparable, or even lower than, for daily practice.
CONCLUSION: The suggestion that OOH antibiotic prescribing quality is worse than in daily practice does not seem founded. The higher OOH prescribing rates can be explained by a different population of presenting patients. The appropriateness of prescribing rather than prescribing rates, therefore, should be used to determine quality.","['Debets VE', 'Verheij TJ', 'van der Velden AW', 'SWAB’s Working Group on Surveillance of Antimicrobial Use']",2017,67,656,Br J Gen Pract,"Debets VE, et al.

28196318,Common Skin Conditions in Children: Skin Infections.,"Skin infections account for a significant subset of dermatologic conditions of childhood. Common cutaneous viral infections in children include warts, molluscum contagiosum, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and herpes simplex. Although viral infections are self-limited and often only mildly symptomatic, they can cause anxiety, embarrassment, and health care use. Recognition of their common and atypical presentations is necessary to differentiate them from other skin conditions of similar morphology. Impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess comprise the majority of childhood bacterial skin infections and are treated with topical or systemic antibiotics that cover group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Common fungal dermatologic infections in children are oral and genital candidiasis, tinea capitis, and tinea corporis. Management consists of topical and systemic antifungals, including nystatin, triazoles, terbinafine, griseofulvin, and imidazoles. Scabies is the most common parasitic skin infection among children and is managed with topical permethrin. Although serious illness is not common among children returning from international travel, patients presenting with fever and rash, especially petechial or hemorrhagic lesions, require thorough evaluation. Of the numerous reportable conditions that present with childhood rash, tick-borne illnesses, measles, rubella, and varicella are the most common.","['Rayala BZ', 'Morrell DS']",2017,453,,FP Essent,Rayala BZ and Morrell DS.

Among them are milia, cutis marmorata, congenital dermal melanocytosis, and the benign neonatal pustular eruptions (eg, benign cephalic pustulosis, erythema toxicum neonatorum, transient neonatal pustular melanosis). Clinicians need to recognize these benign skin conditions and differentiate them from more serious conditions, such as infectious pustular eruptions from bacterial, viral, and fungal causes, and inflammatory conditions, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Notable bacterial pustular eruptions are bullous impetigo and congenital syphilis. Viral pustular dermatoses include neonatal herpes simplex virus infection and varicella zoster virus infection, which consists of congenital varicella syndrome, perinatal varicella, and infantile zoster. Fungal pustular eruptions include congenital and neonatal candidiasis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a self-limited condition that occurs with varying severity; symptomatic treatment is reserved for the more severe forms. Diaper dermatitis encompasses a broad clinical diagnosis, including allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, infections, psoriasis, and other dermatologic conditions. Critical components of newborn skin care are immersion bathing, umbilical cord care, and use of emollients to augment skin barrier function.","['Rayala BZ', 'Morrell DS']",2017,453,,FP Essent,Rayala BZ and Morrell DS.

The use of the necklaces can pose a risk of death by strangulation, however, there are no data on the potential infectious risk linked to bacterial colonisation associated with the necklaces. We aimed to analyse bacterial colonisation of amber necklaces worn by children during hospital consultations. This prospective observational study included all children wearing a teething necklace at consultation in the Paediatric Dermatology and the Paediatric Emergency Department of our hospital from April to December 2014. The study included 27 children (median age: 10.7 months; 70.4% female). The surface of necklaces underwent bacteriological analyses using three different agar cultures. Parents completed a brief questionnaire to provide reasons for using necklaces and express awareness of risks. One child had a history of impetigo. All necklaces were colonised by bacteria (median: four species per necklace [range: 1-9]); 32 different species were found, the most frequent being coagulase-negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus epidermidis in 88.9% of cases). In three cases, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was found. The most frequent reason for wearing a necklace was to prevent teething pain (n = 17; 63.0%); the necklace was judged effective (moderately/highly effective) in 74.1% of cases, however, 70.4% of parents considered the use of the necklace to be risky. Amber necklaces may be highly colonised by commensal germs of the skin, mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci. Although these bacteria are saprophytes, they may become pathogenic in particular conditions.","['Machet P', 'Lanotte P', 'Giraudeau B', 'Leperlier M', 'Tavernier E', 'Maruani A']",2016,26,6,Eur J Dermatol,"Machet P, et al.

27862501,Staphylococcus aureus penetrate the interkeratinocyte spaces created by skin-infiltrating neutrophils in a mouse model of impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a bacterial skin disease characterized by intraepidermal neutrophilic pustules. Previous studies have demonstrated that exfoliative toxin producing staphylococci are isolated in the cutaneous lesions of human and canine impetigo. However, the mechanisms of intraepidermal splitting in impetigo remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how staphylococci penetrate the living epidermis and create intraepidermal pustules in vivo using a mouse model of impetigo.
METHODS: Three Staphylococcus aureus strains harbouring the etb gene and three et gene negative strains were epicutaneously inoculated onto tape-stripped mouse skin. The skin samples were subjected to time course histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses to detect intraepidermal neutrophils and infiltrating staphylococci. To determine the role of neutrophils on intraepidermal bacterial invasion, cyclophosphamide (CPA) was injected intraperitoneally into the mice to cause leucopenia before the inoculation of etb gene positive strains.
RESULTS: In mice inoculated with etb gene positive S. aureus, intraepidermal pustules resembling impetigo were detected as early as 4 h post-inoculation (hpi). Neutrophils in the epidermis were detected from 4 hpi, whereas intraepidermal staphylococci was detected from 6 hpi. The dimensions of the intraepidermal clefts created in mice inoculated with etb gene positive strains at 6 hpi were significantly larger than those in mice inoculated with et gene negative strains. In CPA treated mice, staphylococci or neutrophils were not detected in the deep epidermis until 6 hpi.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that intraepidermal neutrophils play an important role in S. aureus invasion into the living epidermis in a mouse model of impetigo.","['Imanishi I', 'Hattori S', 'Hisatsune J', 'Ide K', 'Sugai M', 'Nishifuji K']",2017,28,1,Vet Dermatol,"Imanishi I, et al.

27848173,Assessing pharmacists' readiness to prescribe oral antibiotics for limited infections using a case-vignette technique.,"Background Pharmacist's skills are underutilized whilst they are directly involved with antibiotic supply to the community. Addressing this issue could lead to better use of antibiotics and hence decreased resistance. Objective Explore how pharmacists can prescribe oral antibiotics to treat a limited range of infections whilst focusing on their confidence and appropriateness of prescribing. Setting Community pharmacies, Western Australia. Method Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire also containing case vignettes. These were distributed to a random sample of metropolitan and rural community pharmacies in Western Australia. A Generalised Estimating Equation was used to compare respondents' level of confidence in treating various infections and to assess appropriateness of prescribing. Main outcome measure Appropriateness and confidence of antibiotic prescribing. Results A response rate of 34.2% (i.e. 425 responses to case vignettes) was achieved from 240 pharmacies. There were high levels of confidence to treat simple infections such as uncomplicated UTIs (n = 73; 89.0%), impetigo (n = 65; 79.3%), mild bacterial skin infections (n = 62; 75.6%) and moderate acne (n = 61; 72.4%). Over 80% of respondents were confident to prescribe amoxicillin (n = 73; 89%), trimethoprim (n = 72; 87.8%), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (n = 70; 85.4%), flucloxacillin (n = 70; 85.4%) and cephalexin (n = 68; 82.9%). High levels of appropriate antibiotic prescribing were shown for uncomplicated UTI (97.2%), cellulitis (98.2%) and adolescent acne (100.0%). Conclusion This study identified key limited infections and antibiotics for which pharmacists were supportive and confident to prescribe. This role could lead to better use of antibiotics in the community and minimisation of resistance.","['Ung E', 'Czarniak P', 'Sunderland B', 'Parsons R', 'Hoti K']",2017,39,1,Int J Clin Pharm,"Ung E, et al.

29967859,Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome in Child. A Case Report and a Review from Literature.,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is the medical term used to define a skin condition induced by the exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The disorder is also known as Ritter disease, bullous impetigo, neonatal pemphigus, or staphylococcal scarlet fever. The disease especially affects infants and small children, but has also been described in adults. Prompt therapy with proper antibiotics and supportive treatment has led to a decrease in the mortality rate. The current case report describes the clinical progress of a patient with generalized erythema and fever, followed by the appearance of bullous lesions with tendency to rupture under the smallest pressure, and with extended areas of denudation. The patient aged four years and six months was admitted to our clinic to establish the aetiology and treatment of a generalized bullous exanthema, followed by a skin denudation associated with fever and impaired general status. Based on clinical and paraclinical examinations a diagnosis of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome was established which responded favourably to antibiotic treatment, hydro-electrolytic re-equilibration, and adequate local hygiene. Staphylococcal infection can represent a problem of significant pathological importance sometimes requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving paediatricians, dermatologists, infectious diseases specialists, and plastic surgeons.","['Grama A', 'Mărginean OC', 'Meliț LE', 'Georgescu AM']",2016,2,4,J Crit Care Med (Targu Mures),"Grama A, et al.

27798212,MRSA infections among patients in the emergency department: a European multicentre study.,"BACKGROUND: MRSA is a therapeutic concern worldwide, and a major agent of community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections (CA-SSTIs). While the US epidemiology of MRSA in CA-SSTIs is well described and reports the high prevalence of the USA300 clone, data on the European situation are lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and clonal characteristics of MRSA in CA-SSTIs in seven European emergency departments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April to June 2015, patients presenting to the tertiary hospital emergency department with a Staphylococcus aureus CA-SSTI were prospectively enrolled. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of Panton-Valentine leucocidin encoding genes and spa-typing, MLST and/or DNA microarray.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and five cases of S. aureus-associated CA-SSTIs were included, comprising folliculitis, furuncles, abscesses, paronychia, impetigo, carbuncles and cellulitis. Of the 205 cases, we report an MRSA prevalence rate of 15.1%, with a north (0%) to south (29%) increasing gradient. Fifty-one isolates were Panton-Valentine leucocidin-positive (24.9%), whether MSSA or MRSA, with a heterogeneous distribution between countries. Clonal distribution of MSSA and MRSA showed high diversity, with no predominant circulating clone and no archetypical USA300 CA-MRSA clone.
CONCLUSIONS: This original prospective multicentre study highlights stark differences in European MRSA epidemiology compared with the USA, and that the USA300 CA-MRSA clone is not predominant among community-infected patients in Europe.","['Bouchiat C', 'Curtis S', 'Spiliopoulou I', 'Bes M', 'Cocuzza C', 'Codita I', 'Dupieux C', 'Giormezis N', 'Kearns A', 'Laurent F', 'Molinos S', 'Musumeci R', 'Prat C', 'Saadatian-Elahi M', 'Tacconelli E', 'Tristan A', 'Schulte B', 'Vandenesch F', 'ESCMID Study Group on Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections (ESGS)']",2017,72,2,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Bouchiat C, et al.

27638231,Opportunities for Integrated Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases That Affect the Skin.,"Many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect the skin, causing considerable disability, stigma, and exacerbation of poverty. However, there has been relatively little investment into laboratory research, epidemiology, diagnostic tools or management strategies to control tropical skin disease. Integration may advance the control of skin disease across a range of domains, including mapping, diagnosis, clinical management, and community control measures such as mass drug administration. Examples of successful integration strategies include programs targeting scabies, impetigo, yaws, and diseases causing lymphoedema. Future strategies should build on these experiences and the experience of integration of other NTDs, strengthen existing health systems, and contribute toward the attainment of Universal Health Coverage. Strong partnerships and political support and will be necessary to achieve these goals.","['Engelman D', 'Fuller LC', 'Solomon AW', 'McCarthy JS', 'Hay RJ', 'Lammie PJ', 'Steer AC']",2016,32,11,Trends Parasitol,"Engelman D, et al.

27744506,"Staphylococcus aureus-Associated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections: Anatomical Localization, Epidemiology, Therapy and Potential Prophylaxis.","Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are among the most common infections worldwide. They range in severity from minor, self-limiting, superficial infections to life-threatening diseases requiring all the resources of modern medicine. Community (CA) and healthcare (HA) acquired SSTIs are most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus . They have variable presentations ranging from impetigo and folliculitis to surgical site infections (SSIs). Superficial SSTIs may lead to even more invasive infections such as bacteraemia and osteomyelitis. Here we describe the anatomical localization of the different SSTI associated with S. aureus, the virulence factors known to play a role in these infections, and their current epidemiology. Current prevention and treatment strategies are also discussed. Global epidemiological data show increasing incidence and severity of SSTIs in association with methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA). CA-SSTIs are usually less morbid compared to other invasive infections caused by S. aureus, but they have become the most prevalent, requiring a great number of medical interventions, extensive antibiotic use, and therefore a high cost burden. Recurrence of SSTIs is common after initial successful treatment, and decolonization strategies have not been effective in reducing recurrence. Furthermore, decolonization approaches may be contributing to the selection and maintenance of multi-drug resistant strains. Clinical studies from the early 1900s and novel autovaccination approaches suggest an alternative strategy with potential effectiveness: using vaccines to control S. aureus cutaneous infections.","['Olaniyi R', 'Pozzi C', 'Grimaldi L', 'Bagnoli F']",2017,409,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Olaniyi R, et al.

A novel foam formulation of minocycline for topical use may improve convenience and treatment utilization for pediatric patients with impetigo.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied minocycline foam (FMX-102 1% and 4%) in the treatment of impetigo and to determine the optimal therapeutic active ingredient concentration.
METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, comparative clinical trial, 32 subjects aged ≥2 years with a clinical diagnosis of pure impetigo, impetigo contagiosa, or uncomplicated blistering impetigo were randomized to treatment with FMX-102 1% or 4%, twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were followed for up to 7 days post-treatment.
RESULTS: Clinical cure, defined as ≥80% cured lesions (fully recovered lesions, visually determined by investigators), was achieved by 57.1% and 50.0% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, at the end of treatment (visit 3). Clinical success, defined as the absence of lesions, or the drying or improvement of treated lesions (decrease in size of affected area, lesion number, or both), was demonstrated in 81.3% and 78.6% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, following 3 days of treatment (visit 2), in 92.3% and 100% of the respective subjects at the end of treatment, and in 100% in both groups at follow-up (visit 4). Bacteriologic success rates at the end of treatment, defined as complete pathogen eradication, were 85% and 74% in the FMX-102 1% and 4% groups, respectively. The bacteriologic success rate for MRSA infections was 100% (11/11), with no recurrences. Both FMX-102 1% and 4% were considered well tolerated and safe.

27736855,Where to from here? The treatment of impetigo in children as resistance to fusidic acid emerges.,"Admissions for skin and soft-tissue infections have been increasing steadily in children and in the general population. Concerns have been raised recently about the increasing widespread use of topical fusidic acid and concurrent increase of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Fusidic acid resistance and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are both more prevalent in youngest age group (<5 year-olds) and particularly in the North island. In New Zealand, fusidic acid is recommended for treatment of minor impetigo and is the only fully-funded topical antibiotic. The evidence base for alternative treatment strategies for mild impetigo is limited. Most children with impetigo in the current Counties Manukau skin and sore throat schools programme received care with wound management with only a few requiring escalation. An upcoming randomised controlled trial comparing topical hydrogen peroxide cream, topical fusidic acid and wound management only (clean and cover) will help provide evidence about the effectiveness of alternative treatments in the New Zealand setting.","['Vogel A', 'Lennon D', 'Best E', 'Leversha A']",2016,129,1443,N Z Med J,"Vogel A, et al.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter study of patients with JIA-associated uveitis that was refractory to conventional immunosuppressive drugs and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents.
RESULTS: We assessed 25 patients (21 female; 47 affected eyes) with a mean ± SD age of 18.5 ± 8.3 years. Uveitis was bilateral in 22 patients. Cystoid macular edema was present in 9 patients. Ocular sequelae found at initiation of TCZ included cataracts (n = 13), glaucoma (n = 7), synechiae (n = 10), band keratopathy (n = 12), maculopathy (n = 9), and amblyopia (n = 5). Before TCZ, patients had received corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents (median 2 [range 1-5]), including adalimumab (n = 24), etanercept (n = 8), infliximab (n = 7), abatacept (n = 6), rituximab (n = 2), anakinra (n = 1), and golimumab (n = 1). Patients received 8 mg/kg TCZ intravenously every 4 weeks in most cases. TCZ yielded rapid and maintained improvement in all ocular parameters. After 6 months of therapy, 79.2% of patients showed improvement in anterior chamber cell numbers, and 88.2% showed improvement after 1 year. Central macular thickness measured by optical coherence tomography in patients with cystoid macular edema decreased from a mean ± SD of 401.7 ± 86.8 μm to 259.1 ± 39.5 μm after 6 months of TCZ (P = 0.012). The best-corrected visual acuity increased from 0.56 ± 0.35 to 0.64 ± 0.32 (P < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 12 months, visual improvement persisted, and complete remission of uveitis was observed in 19 of 25 patients. Significant reduction in the prednisone dosage was also achieved. The main adverse effects were severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, pneumonia and then autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, and viral conjunctivitis and bullous impetigo in 1 patient.

27659511,"Protocol for the systematic review of the prevention, treatment and public health management of impetigo, scabies and fungal skin infections in resource-limited settings.","BACKGROUND: Impetigo, scabies, and fungal skin infections disproportionately affect populations in resource-limited settings. Evidence for standard treatment of skin infections predominantly stem from hospital-based studies in high-income countries. The evidence for treatment in resource-limited settings is less clear, as studies in these populations may lack randomisation and control groups for cultural, ethical or economic reasons. Likewise, a synthesis of the evidence for public health control within endemic populations is also lacking. We propose a systematic review of the evidence for the prevention, treatment and public health management of skin infections in resource-limited settings, to inform the development of guidelines for the standardised and streamlined clinical and public health management of skin infections in endemic populations.
METHODS: The protocol has been designed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. All trial designs and analytical observational study designs will be eligible for inclusion. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature will include PubMed, Excertpa Medica and Global Health. Grey literature databases will also be systematically searched, and clinical trials registries scanned for future relevant studies. The primary outcome of interest will be the clinical cure or decrease in prevalence of impetigo, scabies, crusted scabies, tinea capitis, tinea corporis or tinea unguium. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility assessment and data extraction using standardised electronic forms. Risk of bias assessment will be undertaken by two independent reviewers according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data will be tabulated and narratively synthesised. We expect there will be insufficient data to conduct meta-analysis. The final body of evidence will be reported against the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation grading system.
DISCUSSION: The evidence derived from the systematic review will be used to inform the development of guidelines for the management of skin infections in resource-limited settings. The evidence derived will be intended for use by clinicians, public health practitioners and policy makers in the treatment of skin infections and the development of skin infection control programmes. The review will identify any gaps in the current evidence to provide direction for future research.

29387600,Pustular psoriasis: pathophysiology and current treatment perspectives.,"Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease that classically affects skin and joints and is associated with numerous comorbidities. There are several clinical subtypes of psoriasis including the uncommon pustular variants, which are subdivided into generalized and localized forms. Generalized forms of pustular psoriasis include acute generalized pustular psoriasis, pustular psoriasis of pregnancy, and infantile and juvenile pustular psoriasis. Localized forms include acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. These subtypes vary in their presentations, but all have similar histopathologic characteristics. The immunopathogenesis of each entity remains to be fully elucidated and some debate exists as to whether these inflammatory pustular dermatoses should be classified as entities distinct from psoriasis vulgaris. Due to the rarity of these conditions and the questionable link to the common, plaque-type psoriasis, numerous therapies have shown variable results and most entities remain difficult to treat. With increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of these variants of pustular psoriasis, the development and use of biologic and other immunomodulatory therapies holds promise for the future of successfully treating pustular variants of psoriasis.","['Benjegerdes KE', 'Hyde K', 'Kivelevitch D', 'Mansouri B']",2016,6,,Psoriasis (Auckl),"Benjegerdes KE, et al.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the possible role of SA as an etiologic factor affecting CTCL initiation. We conducted a nested case-control study in a large population-representative database from the UK. Cases were defined as all patients with an incident diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS) between 1995 and 2013. For every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice-site, and duration of follow-up were selected. Exposure of interest was clinical diagnosis of impetigo prior to CTCL diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds-ratio (ORs) and 95 % confidence-interval (CI) for CTCL risk. The results were further stratified according to age, sex and time interval between impetigo and CTCL diagnosis. The study population included 310 cases with MF or SS and 1223 matched controls. Among cases with CTCL 4.8 % (n = 15) had impetigo prior to cancer diagnosis compared to 2 % (n = 24) of controls. The adjusted OR for CTCL diagnosis among patients with prior impetigo was 2.33 (95 % CI 1.12-4.83). The risk was elevated among individuals with impetigo 1-5 years before cancer diagnosis (OR 3.33, 95 % CI 1.00-11.10). There was no change in risk among patients with impetigo more than 5 years before cancer diagnosis (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.35-3.37).

27599660,Bullous Impetigo Rapid Diagnostic and Therapeutic Quiz: A Model for Assessing Basic Dermatology Knowledge of Primary Care Providers.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common dermatologic condition, particularly in children, yet confusion regarding its diagnosis and treatment persists. This study measured pediatricians' ability to diagnose and appropriately treat BI and explored factors that might influence pediatricians' accuracy in managing BI.
METHODS: We administered an expert-validated survey to 64 pediatrics house staff and faculty at three Johns Hopkins Medicine facilities. The survey requested demographic information, diagnoses for five ""unknown"" cases, and preferred treatments for localized and widespread BI.
RESULTS: Overall, BI was diagnosed correctly 31.9% of the time. There was little difference between house staff and faculty performance, although faculty 50 years of age and older demonstrated better diagnostic acumen. Regarding treatment of localized BI, 92% of faculty members and 84.6% of house staff listed mupirocin as first- or second-line treatment. The second most common medication listed for localized BI was bacitracin. Regarding treatment of widespread BI, faculty listed cephalexin or clindamycin as first- or second-line treatment 56.0% of the time and house staff listed one of these two medications 51.3% of the time. Results for faculty 50 years of age and older were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved pediatrician proficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of BI is needed for safe, cost-effective management. Physician age and experience appear to have a limited effect on the accuracy of BI diagnosis and management. Future educational efforts must be directed at trainees and their instructors.","['Simkin DJ', 'Grossberg AL', 'Cohen BA']",2016,33,6,Pediatr Dermatol,"Simkin DJ, et al.

27581776,A Case of Tinea Corporis due to Trichophyton tonsurans that Manifested as Impetigo.,"A 41-year-old man visited our dermatology clinic because an eruption, which was resistant to steroid ointment treatment, had appeared on his right forearm. An oval, soybean-sized erythematous infiltrated lesion with scales and crusts was located in the central part of the extensor surface of the right forearm and showed partial erosion with attached yellow crusts. The lesion had an impetigo-like appearance. Fungal elements were confirmed from the scales by KOH examination and the fungus was identified as Trichophyton tonsurans by fungal culture and molecular method. Clinical features of T. tonsurans infection vary, wherein some patients have strong inflammatory manifestations, while others remain as asymptomatic carriers. Especially at the early stage of the infection, diagnosis is difficult because it is often misdiagnosed as eczema. We report a case of T. tonsurans infection that had impetigo-like appearance. We also studied the mechanism of the disease.","['Shimoyama H', 'Nakashima C', 'Hase M', 'Sei Y']",2016,57,3,Med Mycol J,"Shimoyama H, et al.

27571972,Activation of band 3 mediates group A Streptococcus streptolysin S-based beta-haemolysis.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a human bacterial pathogen that can manifest as a range of diseases from pharyngitis and impetigo to severe outcomes such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. GAS disease remains a global health burden with cases estimated at over 700 million annually and over half a million deaths due to severe infections(1). For over 100 years, a clinical hallmark of diagnosis has been the appearance of complete (beta) haemolysis when grown in the presence of blood. This activity is due to the production of a small peptide toxin by GAS known as streptolysin S. Although it has been widely held that streptolysin S exerts its lytic activity through membrane disruption, its exact mode of action has remained unknown. Here, we show, using high-resolution live cell imaging, that streptolysin S induces a dramatic osmotic change in red blood cells, leading to cell lysis. This osmotic change was characterized by the rapid influx of Cl(-) ions into the red blood cells through SLS-mediated disruption of the major erythrocyte anion exchange protein, band 3. Chemical inhibition of band 3 function significantly reduced the haemolytic activity of streptolysin S, and dramatically reduced the pathology in an in vivo skin model of GAS infection. These results provide key insights into the mechanism of streptolysin S-mediated haemolysis and have implications for the development of treatments against GAS.","['Higashi DL', 'Biais N', 'Donahue DL', 'Mayfield JA', 'Tessier CR', 'Rodriguez K', 'Ashfeld BL', 'Luchetti J', 'Ploplis VA', 'Castellino FJ', 'Lee SW']",2016,1,,Nat Microbiol,"Higashi DL, et al.

27489799,Accelerating the development of a group A Streptococcus vaccine: an urgent public health need.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections cause substantial worldwide morbidity and mortality, mostly associated with suppurative complications such as pharyngitis, impetigo, and non-suppurative immune syndromes such as acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Deaths occur mostly in children, adolescents, and young adults in particular pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries. GAS strains are highly variable, and a GAS vaccine would need to overcome the issue of multiple strains. Several approaches have been used multivalent vaccines using N-terminal polypeptides of different M protein; conserved M protein vaccines with antigens from the conserved C-repeat portion of the M protein; incorporation selected T- and B-cell epitopes from the C-repeat region in a synthetic polypeptide or shorter single minimal B-cell epitopes from this same region; and non-M protein approaches utilizing highly conserved motives of streptococcal C5a peptidase, GAS carbohydrate and streptococcal fibronectin-binding proteins. A GAS vaccine represents urgent need for this neglected disease and should therefore deserve the greatest attention of international organizations, donors, and vaccine manufacturers.","['Excler JL', 'Kim JH']",2016,5,2,Clin Exp Vaccine Res,Excler JL and Kim JH.

27426474,"Clinical, microscopic and microbial characterization of exfoliative superficial pyoderma-associated epidermal collarettes in dogs.","BACKGROUND: The microscopic and microbial features of the spreading epidermal collarettes of canine exfoliative superficial pyodermas are poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical, cytological, microbial and histopathological features of epidermal collarettes in five dogs.
RESULTS: Cytology from the margins of collarettes identified neutrophils, extracellular and intracellular cocci within neutrophils but no acantholytic keratinocytes. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified all bacterial isolates from the centre and margin of five epidermal collarettes as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. PCRs of collarette-associated Staphylococcus strains did not amplify genes encoding for the known exfoliative toxins expA and expB, whereas the predicted siet and speta amplification products were detected in all isolates. Microscopically, epidermal collarettes consisted of interfollicular, epidermal spongiotic pustules. Advancing edges of lesions consisted of peripheral intracorneal clefts in the deep stratum disjunctum above an intact stratum compactum; they contained lytic neutrophil debris, bacterial cocci and fluid, but no acantholytic keratinocytes. This intracorneal location of bacteria was confirmed using Gram stains and fluorescent in situ hybridization with eubacterial- and Staphylococcus-specific probes. The indirect immunofluorescence staining patterns of desmoglein-1, desmocollin-1, claudin-1, E-cadherin and corneodesmosin were discontinuous and patchy in areas of spongiotic pustules, whereas only that of corneodesmosin was weaker and patchy in advancing collarette edges.
CONCLUSION: Epidermal collarettes represent unique clinical and histological lesions of exfoliative superficial pyodermas that are distinct from those of impetigo and superficial bacterial folliculitis. The characterization of possible causative staphylococcal exfoliatin proteases and the role of corneodesmosin in collarette pathogenesis deserve further investigation.","['Banovic F', 'Linder K', 'Olivry T']",2017,28,1,Vet Dermatol,"Banovic F, et al.

27411325,Mimics of Host Defense Proteins; Strategies for Translation to Therapeutic Applications.,"New infection treatments are urgently needed to combat the rising threat of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Despite early clinical set-backs attention has re-focused on host defense proteins (HDPs), as potential sources for new and effective antimicrobial treatments. HDPs appear to act at multiple targets and their repertoire includes disruptive membrane and intracellular activities against numerous types of pathogens as well as immune modulatory functions in the host. Importantly, these novel activities are associated with a low potential for emergence of resistance and little crossresistance with other antimicrobial agents. Based on these properties, HDPs appear to be ideal candidates for new antibiotics; however, their development has been plagued by the many therapeutic limitations associated with natural peptidic agents. This review focuses on HDP mimetic approaches aimed to improve metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics, safety and manufacturing processes. Early efforts with β-peptide or peptoid analogs focused on recreating stable facially amphiphilic structures but demonstrated that antimicrobial activity was modulated by more, complex structural properties. Several approaches have used lipidation to increase the hydrophobicity and membrane activity. One lead compound, LTX-109, has entered clinical study as a topical agent to treat impetigo and nasal decolonization. In a more significant departure from the amino acid like peptidomimetics, considerable effort has been directed at developing amphiphilic compounds that recapitulate the structural and biological properties of HDPs on small abiotic scaffolds. The lead compound from this approach, brilacidin, has completed two phase 2 studies as an intravenous agent for skin infections.","['Scott RW', 'Tew GN']",2017,17,5,Curr Top Med Chem,Scott RW and Tew GN.

27373283,[Clinical analysis of cutaneous manifestations and related factors in patients with ulcerative colitis].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cutaneous manifestations in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and related factors.
METHODS: Patients admitted to Department of Gastroenterology Peking University First Hospital from January 1994 to December 2014 and diagnosed as UC were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Skin disorders were confirmed by the dermatologists. Clinical data were collected and compared between patients with and without cutaneous manifestations.
RESULTS: Among the total 373 UC patients, there were 34 cases (9.1%) with cutaneous manifestations, including 11 pyoderma gangrenosum, 8 erythema nodosum, 6 eczema, 3 psoriasis, 2 pemphigus, 1 granulomatous cheilitis, 1 ichthyosis, 1 acne rosacea, and 1 impetigo. The skin manifestations may occur after the diagnosis, simultaneously or even before the diagnosis of UC, which were 24, 7 and 3 patients respectively. The mean age in patients with skin lesions was (47.2±12.1) years, male to female ratio 0.79∶1. More patients with skin manifestations had severe activity of UC compared with non-skin group [50.0%(17/34) vs 25.1%(85/339), P=0.01]. In addition, the proportion of extensive colitis in skin lesion group was significantly higher than that in non-skin group [76.5%(26/34) vs 54.6%(185/339), P=0.04].
CONCLUSIONS: The cutaneous manifestations associated with UC are polymorphic, erythema nodosums and pyoderma gangrenosums are the most common skin lesions seen in UC patients. Skin lesions occur concurrently, pre or post the diagnosis of UC. Skin lesions in UC patients suggest more severe disease activity. Clinicians need to pay more attention to this group.","['Tian Y', 'Li JX', 'Wang HH', 'Li RY', 'Liu XG']",2016,55,7,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Tian Y, et al.

27364320,Spinal epidural abscess with a rapid course in young healthy infantry recruits with multiple skin lacerations.,"In recent years, there has been high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection among soldiers in the Israeli military, with devastating sequelae in several cases. Emergency department physicians have developed a high level of suspicion for spinal epidural abscess (SEA) in patients presenting known risk factors; however, SEA is a particularly elusive diagnosis in young healthy adults with no history of drug abuse. We review three cases of SEA secondary to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infection in young healthy soldiers without known risk factors. We retrospectively reviewed clinical files of soldiers treated at our Medical Center from 2004-2015 to identify patients diagnosed with SEA. Those aged less than 30years with no history of intravenous drug use, spine surgery or spine trauma were included in the study. Three young army recruits met the inclusion criteria. These young men developed SEA through extension of MSSA infection to proximal skin and soft tissue from impetigo secondary to skin scratches sustained during ""basic"" training. All presented with mild nuchal rigidity and severe persistent unremitting lancinating radicular pain. Although healthy at baseline, they had a severe, rapidly progressive course. Following urgent surgery, two patients recovered after rehabilitation; one remained with paraparesis at late follow-up. Neurological deficits and systemic evidence of S. aureus infection progressed rapidly in these young healthy SEA patients with no history of drug abuse, emphasizing the critical role of timely MRI, diagnosis, and surgery.","['Honig A', 'Or O', 'Barzilay Y', 'Fraifeld S', 'Pikkel YY', 'Eliahou R', 'Cohen JE', 'Itshayek E']",2016,31,,J Clin Neurosci,"Honig A, et al.

27348119,The Prevalence of Scabies and Impetigo in the Solomon Islands: A Population-Based Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies and impetigo are common, important and treatable skin conditions. Reports from several Pacific island countries show extremely high prevalence of these two conditions, but for many countries, including the Solomon Islands, there is a paucity of epidemiological data.
METHODOLOGY: Ten rural villages in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands were included in the study, chosen so that data collection could be integrated with an existing project investigating clinical and serological markers of yaws. All residents were eligible to participate, and 1908 people were enrolled. Participants were interviewed and examined by a paediatric registrar, who recorded relevant demographic information, and made a clinical diagnosis of scabies and/or impetigo, severity and distribution.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.5-21.0), and age and gender weighted prevalence 19.2% (95%CI 16.7-21.9). The adult prevalence of scabies was 10.4% (95%CI 8.2-13.2), and the highest prevalence was found in infants < 1 year of age (34.1%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] compared with adults: 3.6, 95%CI 2.2-6.0) and children aged 1-4 years (25.7%, AOR 2.6, 95%CI 1.7-3.9). Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants, and 4.4% of scabies cases were classified as severe. The total unweighted prevalence of active impetigo was 32.7% (95%CI 30.6-34.8), and age and gender weighted prevalence 26.7% (95%CI 24.2-29.5). The highest prevalence was found in children aged 1-4 years (42.6%, AOR compared with adults: 4.1, 95%CI 2.9-5.8). Scabies infestation was associated with active impetigo infection (AOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.6-2.6); with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Scabies and impetigo are very common in the rural Western Province of the Solomon Islands. Scabies infestation is strongly associated with impetigo. Community control strategies for scabies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.","['Mason DS', 'Marks M', 'Sokana O', 'Solomon AW', 'Mabey DC', 'Romani L', 'Kaldor J', 'Steer AC', 'Engelman D']",2016,10,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mason DS, et al.

Nevertheless, data regarding the effects of mupirocin on the nasal mucosa, in particular on ciliary beat frequency (CBF), is lacking to date. We tested the CBF of ciliated nasal epithelial cells under the influence of Mupirocin-calcium dissolved in tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) containing media in different concentrations comparable to clinical use. Ringer's lactate solution and TBA served as negative control. Cells were visualized with a phase contrast microscope, and the CBF was measured with the SAVA system's region of interest method. Mupirocin-calcium dissolved in TBA led to a statistically significant time- and concentration-dependent decrease in CBF compared to the negative control. TBA addition without mupirocin also led to a significant decrease in CBF, although to a lesser extent than mupirocin/TBA. In conclusion, CBF of human nasal epithelia is significantly reduced by mupirocin-calcium-containing solutions in therapeutic concentrations. Due to our results in this study, mupirocin as a nasal decolonization agent should be used only with care, with a strictly set medical indication, and additional care measures should be considered.","['Birk R', 'Aderhold C', 'Wenzel A', 'Eschenhagen T', 'Kramer B', 'Hörmann K', 'Stuck BA', 'Sommer JU']",2016,273,12,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Birk R, et al.

27312939,Streptococcus pyogenes adhesion and colonization.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a human-adapted pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of disease. GAS can cause relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat or impetigo, and less frequent but severe life-threatening diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. GAS is an important public health problem causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The main route of GAS transmission between humans is through close or direct physical contact, and particularly via respiratory droplets. The upper respiratory tract and skin are major reservoirs for GAS infections. The ability of GAS to establish an infection in the new host at these anatomical sites primarily results from two distinct physiological processes, namely bacterial adhesion and colonization. These fundamental aspects of pathogenesis rely upon a variety of GAS virulence factors, which are usually under strict transcriptional regulation. Considerable progress has been made in better understanding these initial infection steps. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of GAS adhesion and colonization.","['Brouwer S', 'Barnett TC', 'Rivera-Hernandez T', 'Rohde M', 'Walker MJ']",2016,590,21,FEBS Lett,"Brouwer S, et al.

High estrogen levels are responsible for the vascular changes noted on mucosal surfaces. Gingival hyperemia and edema, gingivitis and pyogenic granuloma are the most common alterations of the oral mucosa during gestation. Physiologic changes of the vulvovaginal area are mainly of vascular nature, and include among others varicose veins. The oral and vulvovaginal mucosal surfaces can be affected by diseases that can worsen or develop in pregnancy. Oral lesions are encountered in a large spectrum of diseases including aphthosis, pemphigus vulgaris, systemic lupus, and Behçet disease. Pregnancy dermatoses such as impetigo herpetiformis and gestational pemphigoid can exceptionally affect the oral mucosa. Infections of the vulvovaginal region by Candida species, Trichomononas vaginalis, human papilloma virus, and herpes simplex virus have been associated with fetal risks.

As a result, skin diseases that are Th2 mediated often worsen, whereas skin diseases that are Th1 mediated often improve during gestation. Also, due to fluctuations in glandular activity, skin diseases involving sebaceous and eccrine glands may flare, whereas those involving apocrine glands may improve during pregnancy. Despite these trends, inflammatory and glandular skin diseases do not always follow the predicted pattern, and courses are often diverse. We review the gestational course of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (atopic eruption of pregnancy), psoriasis, impetigo herpetiformis, urticaria, erythema annulare centrifugum, pityriasis rosea, sarcoidosis, Sweet syndrome, and erythema nodosum, as well as glandular skin diseases, including acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, perioral dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Fox-Fordyce disease, hyperhidrosis, and miliaria.

This analysis reports the general health, otitis media (OM), nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage and middle ear microbiology in children less than 36 months of age who received a primary course of at least two doses of PHiD-CV10 or PCV13, and not more than one dose of another pneumococcal vaccine.
RESULTS: Mean ages of 511 PHiD-CV10- and 140 PCV13-vaccinated children were 19 and 13 months, respectively. Most children received 3-dose non-mixed PCV schedules. At the time of assessment, general health was poor and prevalence of risk factors was high in both groups: overall, around 14% of children had scabies, 20% had impetigo, 59% had runny nose and 39% had cough. Average household size was 8 persons, and 60% of the mothers smoked. Bilaterally normal middle ears were detected in 10% and 7%, respectively. OM with effusion (OME), almost all bilateral, was diagnosed in 52% and 50%, any suppurative OM (acute OM or any tympanic membrane perforation [TMP]) in 37% and 41%, and TMP in 14% and 12%, respectively. Children in the PCV13 group had significantly less NP carriage of combined Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) (62% versus 51%) but significantly more polymicrobial (Spn and NTHi) middle ear cultures (12% versus 43%), and significantly less Staphylococcus aureus-positive middle ears (40% versus 7%). Although NP carriage of pneumococcal serotype 19A was low in the PCV13 group, serotypes 19F and 23F persist.
CONCLUSIONS: The general health, particularly ear health, of little children in remote Australian Indigenous communities remains in crisis. In particular, transition to PCV13 did not show substantial further improvement in ear health. Possible vaccine-related differences in microbiology, including potential beneficial effects of PHiD-CV10 on NTHi infection, need to be further evaluated in randomised trials.","['Leach AJ', 'Wigger C', 'Beissbarth J', 'Woltring D', 'Andrews R', 'Chatfield MD', 'Smith-Vaughan H', 'Morris PS']",2016,86,,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Leach AJ, et al.

We aimed to describe UK primary care flucloxacillin prescribing and factors associated with subsequent antibiotic prescribing as a proxy for non-response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical Practice Research Datalink patients with acute prescriptions for oral flucloxacillin between January 2004 and December 2013, prescription details, associated Read codes and patient demographics were identified. Monthly prescribing rates were plotted and logistic regression identified factors associated with having a subsequent antibiotic prescription within 28 days.
RESULTS: 3 031 179 acute prescriptions for 1 667 431 patients were included. Average monthly prescription rates increased from 4.74 prescriptions per 1000 patient-months in 2004 to 5.74 (increase of 21.1%) in 2013. The highest prescribing rates and the largest increases in rates were seen in older adults (70+ years), but the overall increase in prescribing was not accounted for by an ageing population. Prescribing 500 mg tablets/capsules rather than 250 mg became more common. Children were frequently prescribed low doses and small volumes (5 day course) and prescribing declined for children, including for impetigo. Only 4.2% of new prescriptions involved co-prescription of another antibiotic. Age (<5 and ≥60 years), diagnosis of 'cellulitis or abscess' or no associated code, and 500 mg dose were associated with a subsequent antibiotic prescription, which occurred after 17.6% of first prescriptions.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to understand better the reasons for increased prescribing of flucloxacillin in primary care, optimal dosing (and the need to co-prescribe other antibiotics) and the reasons why one in five patients are prescribed a further antibiotic within 4 weeks.","['Francis NA', 'Hood K', 'Lyons R', 'Butler CC']",2016,71,7,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Francis NA, et al.

26940863,Complete genome of Staphylococcus aureus Tager 104 provides evidence of its relation to modern systemic hospital-acquired strains.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections range in severity due to expression of certain virulence factors encoded on mobile genetic elements (MGE). As such, characterization of these MGE, as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms, is of high clinical and microbiological importance. To understand the evolution of these dangerous pathogens, it is paramount to define reference strains that may predate MGE acquisition. One such candidate is S. aureus Tager 104, a previously uncharacterized strain isolated from a patient with impetigo in 1947.
RESULTS: We show here that S. aureus Tager 104 can survive in the bloodstream and infect naïve organs. We also demonstrate a procedure to construct and validate the assembly of S. aureus genomes, using Tager 104 as a proof-of-concept. In so doing, we bridged confounding gap regions that limited our initial attempts to close this 2.82 Mb genome, through integration of data from Illumina Nextera paired-end, PacBio RS, and Lucigen NxSeq mate-pair libraries. Furthermore, we provide independent confirmation of our segmental arrangement of the Tager 104 genome by the sole use of Lucigen NxSeq libraries filled by paired-end MiSeq reads and alignment with SPAdes software. Genomic analysis of Tager 104 revealed limited MGE, and a νSaβ island configuration that is reminiscent of other hospital acquired S. aureus genomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Tager 104 represents an early-branching ancestor of certain hospital-acquired strains. Combined with its earlier isolation date and limited content of MGE, Tager 104 can serve as a viable reference for future comparative genome studies.","['Davis RW', 'Brannen AD', 'Hossain MJ', 'Monsma S', 'Bock PE', 'Nahrendorf M', 'Mead D', 'Lodes M', 'Liles MR', 'Panizzi P']",2016,17,,BMC Genomics,"Davis RW, et al.

26925048,Mass Spectrometry-Based Bacterial Proteomics: Focus on Dermatologic Microbial Pathogens.,"The composition of human skin acts as a natural habitat for various bacterial species that function in a commensal and symbiotic fashion. In a healthy individual, bacterial flora serves to protect the host. Under certain conditions such as minor trauma, impaired host immunity, or environmental factors, the risk of developing skin infections is increased. Although a large majority of bacterial associated skin infections are common, a portion can potentially manifest into clinically significant morbidity. For example, Gram-positive species that typically reside on the skin such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus can cause numerous epidermal (impetigo, ecthyma) and dermal (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, erysipelas) skin infections. Moreover, the increasing incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance represents a serious challenge to modern medicine and threatens the health care system. Therefore, it is critical to develop tools and strategies that can allow us to better elucidate the nature and mechanism of bacterial virulence. To this end, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has been revolutionizing biomedical research, and has positively impacted the microbiology field. Advances in MS technologies have paved the way for numerous bacterial proteomes and their respective post translational modifications (PTMs) to be accurately identified and quantified in a high throughput and robust fashion. This technological platform offers critical information with regards to signal transduction, adherence, and microbial-host interactions associated with bacterial pathogenesis. This mini-review serves to highlight the current progress proteomics has contributed toward the understanding of bacteria that are associated with skin related diseases, infections, and antibiotic resistance.","['Soufi Y', 'Soufi B']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,Soufi Y and Soufi B.

26903974,"Structure and Interactions of a Dimeric Variant of sHIP, a Novel Virulence Determinant of Streptococcus pyogenes.","Streptococcus pyogenes is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens in the human population mostly causing superficial and uncomplicated infections (pharyngitis and impetigo) but also invasive and life-threatening disease. We have previously identified a virulence determinant, protein sHIP, which is secreted at higher levels by an invasive compared to a non-invasive strain of S. pyogenes. The present work presents a further characterization of the structural and functional properties of this bacterial protein. Biophysical and structural studies have shown that protein sHIP forms stable tetramers both in the crystal and in solution. The tetramers are composed of four helix-loop-helix motifs with the loop regions connecting the helices displaying a high degree of flexibility. Owing to interactions at the tetramer interface, the observed tetramer can be described as a dimer of dimers. We identified three residues at the tetramer interface (Leu84, Leu88, Tyr95), which due to largely non-polar side-chains, could be important determinants for protein oligomerization. Based on these observations, we produced a sHIP variant in which these residues were mutated to alanines. Biophysical experiments clearly indicated that the sHIP mutant appear only as dimers in solution confirming the importance of the interfacial residues for protein oligomerisation. Furthermore, we could show that the sHIP mutant interacts with intact histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and the histidine-rich repeats in HRG, and inhibits their antibacterial activity to the same or even higher extent as compared to the wild type protein sHIP. We determined the crystal structure of the sHIP mutant, which, as a result of the high quality of the data, allowed us to improve the existing structural model of the protein. Finally, by employing NMR spectroscopy in solution, we generated a model for the complex between the sHIP mutant and an HRG-derived heparin-binding peptide, providing further molecular details into the interactions involving protein sHIP.","['Diehl C', 'Wisniewska M', 'Frick IM', 'Streicher W', 'Björck L', 'Malmström J', 'Wikström M']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,"Diehl C, et al.

26900921,"Childhood skin and soft tissue infections: new discoveries and guidelines regarding the management of bacterial soft tissue infections, molluscum contagiosum, and warts.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) constitute a significant number of office-based pediatric visits. With SSTIs on the rise, it is not only important to effectively treat the individual, but to do so appropriately and cost-consciously. In this article, we highlight new research related to the treatment of bacterial skin infections, molluscum contagiosum, and cutaneous warts, with the goal of guiding pediatricians in their practice against these common skin conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent data supports the use of topical antibiotics for noncomplicated impetigo. Systemic antibiotics covering gram-positive cocci are recommended for complicated cases of impetigo and deeper nonpurulent SSTIs. Localized purulent bacterial SSTIs can be treated with incision and drainage alone but more systemic involvement warrants treatment with systemic antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus species, especially community acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. For the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, topical cantharidin has a high satisfaction rate among patients and providers. Potassium hydroxide solution is a potentially effective and cheap form of molluscum contagiosum treatment. Imiquimod, however, has an unfavorable efficacy and safety profile as a therapy for molluscum contagiosum. Regarding warts, high-risk human papilloma virus strains have been detected in cutaneous warts in children.
SUMMARY: The high-risk human papilloma virus vaccine may play a role in treating pediatric cutaneous warts in the future, and topical squaric acid dibutylester may effectively treat recalcitrant warts. Finally, both molluscum contagiosum and warts have a high rate of resolution after an extended period of time without any intervention.","['Rush J', 'Dinulos JG']",2016,28,2,Curr Opin Pediatr,"Rush J and Dinulos JG.

This review aims to describe recent advances in molecular differences between throat and skin strains, and the pathogenic mechanisms used by virulence factors that may distinguish between these two groups.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings include a new typing scheme for GAS strains based on sequence clusters of genes encoding the entire surface-exposed portion of M protein; correlations between emm-based typing schemes, clinical disease and surface adhesins; covalent bond formation mediated by GAS pili and other adhesins in binding to host ligands; a key role for superantigens in oropharyngeal infection via binding major histocompatibility complex class II antigen; and migration of GAS-specific Th17 cells from the upper respiratory tract to the brain, which may be relevant to autoimmune sequelae.
SUMMARY: The gap between molecular markers of disease (correlation) and virulence mechanisms (causation) in the establishment of tissue tropisms for GAS infection currently remains wide, but the gap also continues to narrow.

26866691,[Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome in a Very Low Birth Weight Premature Infant].,"INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) was often endemic in the past but is nowadays rare. The hematogeneous spread of exfoliative toxins A (ETA) or B (ETB) produced by specific Staphylococcus aureus strains causes a scald-like eruption with disseminated bullous lesions.
CASE REPORT: A perioral impetigo lesion occurred on day 14 of life in a preterm male infant (1,065 g, 30 weeks of gestational age). Empiric antibiotic therapy with cefotaxime and vancomycin was given for 6 days and led to complete resolution. A Staphylococcus aureus strain was isolated. After a symptom-free interval a relapse was noted on day 26 of life. Despite restarting the antibiotic therapy immediately the initial lesion expanded, and disseminated flaccid blisters on an erythematous base appeared within a few hours. On histological examination the cleavage was in the level of the granular layer. There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky I sign was positive. The antibiotic therapy was changed to a combination of cefotaxime, flucloxacillin and clindamycin which rapidly stopped progression of the exfoliation. Supportive therapy included adequate analgesia, parenteral rehydration, and application of local antiseptics. The preterm infant completely recovered. In the primary lesion an ETA-producing Staphylococcus aureus strain was isolated. Nasal microtrauma by a nasogastric tube was assumed to have caused the fulminant disease. At the same time, no other Staphylococcus aureus infections were seen in our Department of Neonatology.
DISCUSSION: According to the literature, the incidence of SSSS is higher in premature infants and newborns than in older children. Possible causes include lower antibody levels against exfoliative toxins and renal immaturity. Rapid diagnosis and immediate appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent secondary infection, dehydration with electrolyte disturbance, death, and endemic spread.","['Wiedemann K', 'Schmid C', 'Hamm H', 'Wirbelauer J']",2016,220,1,Z Geburtshilfe Neonatol,"Wiedemann K, et al.

26833141,Whole genome sequencing reveals extensive community-level transmission of group A Streptococcus in remote communities.,"Impetigo is common in remote Indigenous children of northern Australia, with the primary driver in this context being Streptococcus pyogenes [or group A Streptococcus (GAS)]. To reduce the high burden of impetigo, the transmission dynamics of GAS must be more clearly elucidated. We performed whole genome sequencing on 31 GAS isolates collected in a single community from children in 11 households with ⩾2 GAS-infected children. We aimed to determine whether transmission was occurring principally within households or across the community. The 31 isolates were represented by nine multilocus sequence types and isolates within each sequence type differed from one another by only 0-3 single nucleotide polymorphisms. There was evidence of extensive transmission both within households and across the community. Our findings suggest that strategies to reduce the burden of impetigo in this setting will need to extend beyond individual households, and incorporate multi-faceted, community-wide approaches.","['Bowen AC', 'Harris T', 'Holt DC', 'Giffard PM', 'Carapetis JR', 'Campbell PT', 'McVERNON J', 'Tong SY']",2016,144,9,Epidemiol Infect,"Bowen AC, et al.

26801833,C55 bacteriocin produced by ETB-plasmid positive Staphylococcus aureus strains is a key factor for competition with S. aureus strains.,"Exfoliative toxin (ET) produced by Staphylococcus aureus is closely associated with the onset of bullous impetigo. To date, three ETs (ETA, ETB and ETD) have been identified. The gene encoding ETB is located in a plasmid designated pETB. Bacteriocin synthesis genes are also located in this plasmid and pETB-positive strains reportedly produce the C55 bacteriocin. In this study, the antibacterial activity against S. aureus strains of the bacteriocin produced by the pETB-positive strain TY4 was investigated. This bacteriocin demonstrated antibacterial activity against all pETB-negative but not pETB-positive strains, including TY4. Additionally, a TY4- strain from which the pETB plasmid had been deleted exhibited susceptibility to the bacteriocin. Further experiments revealed that two immunity factors (orf 46-47 and orf 48) downstream of the bacteriocin synthesis genes in the pETB plasmid are associated with immunity against the bacteriocin produced by TY4. The TY4- with orf46-47 strain exhibited complete resistance to bacteriocin, whereas the TY4- with orf48 strain exhibited partial resistance. Whether bacteriocin affects the proportion of each strain when co-cultured with S. aureus strains was also investigated. When TY4 or TY4- was co-cultured with 209P strain, which is susceptible to the bacteriocin, the proportion of 209P co-cultured with TY4 was significantly less than when 209P was co-cultured with TY4-, whereas the proportion of TY4- with orf46-48 co-cultured with TY4 was greater than with TY4-.

26773616,Leprosy in the Bible.,"For many years, the biblical term tzaraat has referred to leprosy. In fact, the disease or diseases described under this name have no relationship to leprosy, as it was known in the Middle Ages or today; moreover, the term referred not only to skin disease, but also to the state of the ritual impurity and punishment for the sins. Although the real nature of tzaraat remains unknown, the differential diagnosis might include the following: Psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, favus, dermatophyte infections, nummular dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, crusted scabies, syphilis, impetigo, sycosis barbae, alopecia areata, furuncles, scabies, neurodermatitis, scarlet fever, lupus erythematosus, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, folliculitis decalvans, morphea, sarcoidosis, and lichen planopilaris. Leprosy became interchangeable with the biblical leprosy due to two inaccurate translations: The Hebrew tzaraat was first translated into Greek as leprosy in the sixth century, and later, the word leprosy was translated into Arabic as lepra in the ninth century.","['Grzybowski A', 'Nita M']",2016,34,1,Clin Dermatol,Grzybowski A and Nita M.

26693489,"Clinical and Etiological Characteristics of Atypical Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Children from Chongqing, China: A Retrospective Study.","BACKGROUND: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a disease that had similar manifestations to chickenpox, impetigo, and measles, which is easy to misdiagnose and subsequently causes delayed therapy and subsequent epidemic. To date, no study has been conducted to report the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of atypical HFMD.
METHODS: 64 children with atypical HFMD out of 887 HFMD children were recruited, stool was collected, and viral VP1 was detected.
RESULTS: The atypical HFMD accounted for 7.2% of total HFMD in the same period (64/887) and there were two peaks in its prevalence in nonepidemic seasons. Ten children (15.6%) had manifestations of neurologic involvement, of whom 4 (6.3%) were diagnosed with severe HFMD and 1 with critically severe HFMD, but all recovered smoothly. Onychomadesis and desquamation were found in 14 patients (21.9%) and 15 patients (23.4%), respectively. The most common pathogen was coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) which accounted for 67.2%, followed by nontypable enterovirus (26.6%), enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) (4.7%), and coxsackievirus A16 (A16) (1.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical HFMD has seasonal prevalence. The manifestations of neurologic involvement in atypical HFMD are mild and usually have a good prognosis. CV-A6 is a major pathogen causing atypical HFMD, but not a major pathogen in Chongqing, China.","['Yan X', 'Zhang ZZ', 'Yang ZH', 'Zhu CM', 'Hu YG', 'Liu QB']",2015,2015,,Biomed Res Int,"Yan X, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of various dermatoses in infants and children in tertiary health care center in South Gujarat region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study; various dermatoses were studied in pediatric patients up to 14 years of age attending the Dermatology OPD of New Civil Hospital, Surat, Gujarat over a period of 12 months from June 2009 to June 2010. All patients were divided into four different study groups: <1 month (neonates), 1 month to 1 year, >1 to 6 years and 7 to 14 years.
RESULTS: There were 596 boys and 425 girls in total 1021 study populations. Majority of the skin conditions in neonates were erythema toxicum neonatorum (12.97%), scabies (9.92%), mongolian spot (9.16%), and seborrheic dermatitis (7.63%). In > 1 month to 14 years age group of children among infectious disorder, children were found to be affected most by scabies (24.49%), impetigo (5.96%), pyoderma (5.62%), molluscum contagiosum (5.39%), tinea capitis (4.49%), leprosy (2.02%), and viral warts (1.35%) while among non-infectious disorders, they were affected by atopic dermatitis (4.27%), pityriasis alba (4.16%), seborrheic dermatitis (3.60%), pityriasis rosea (3.15%), others (3.01%), phrynoderma (2.70%), lichen planus (2.58%), contact dermatitis (1.57%) and ichthyosis (1.45%).

26650152,Mass Drug Administration for Scabies Control in a Population with Endemic Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is an underrecognized cause of illness in many developing countries. It is associated with impetigo, which can lead to serious systemic complications. We conducted a trial of mass drug administration for scabies control in Fiji.
METHODS: We randomly assigned three island communities to one of three different interventions for scabies control: standard care involving the administration of permethrin to affected persons and their contacts (standard-care group), mass administration of permethrin (permethrin group), or mass administration of ivermectin (ivermectin group). The primary outcome was the change in the prevalence of scabies and of impetigo from baseline to 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 2051 participants were enrolled; 803 were in the standard-care group, 532 in the permethrin group, and 716 in the ivermectin group. From baseline to 12 months, the prevalence of scabies declined significantly in all groups, with the greatest reduction seen in the ivermectin group. The prevalence declined from 36.6% to 18.8% in the standard-care group (relative reduction in prevalence, 49%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 37 to 60), from 41.7% to 15.8% in the permethrin group (relative reduction, 62%; 95% CI, 49 to 75), and from 32.1% to 1.9% in the ivermectin group (relative reduction, 94%; 95% CI, 83 to 100). The prevalence of impetigo also declined in all groups, with the greatest reduction seen in the ivermectin group. The prevalence declined from 21.4% to 14.6% in the standard-care group (relative reduction, 32%; 95% CI, 14 to 50), from 24.6% to 11.4% in the permethrin group (relative reduction, 54%; 95% CI, 35 to 73), and from 24.6% to 8.0% in the ivermectin group (relative reduction, 67%; 95% CI, 52 to 83). Adverse events were mild and were reported more frequently in the ivermectin group than in the permethrin group (15.6% vs. 6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mass drug administration, particularly the administration of ivermectin, was efficacious for the control of scabies and impetigo.

26624616,Long Term Control of Scabies Fifteen Years after an Intensive Treatment Programme.,"INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a major public health problem in the Pacific and is associated with an increased risk of bacterial skin infections, glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Mass drug administration with ivermectin is a promising strategy for the control of scabies. Mass treatment with ivermectin followed by active case finding was conducted in five communities in the Solomon Islands between 1997 and 2000 and resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence of both scabies and bacterial skin infections.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective follow-up study of the communities where the original scabies control programme had been undertaken. All residents underwent a standardised examination for the detection of scabies and impetigo.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty eight residents were examined, representing 69% of the total population of the five communities. Only 1 case of scabies was found, in an adult who had recently returned from the mainland. The prevalence of active impetigo was 8.8% overall and 12.4% in children aged 12 years or less.
DISCUSSION: We found an extremely low prevalence of scabies 15 years after the cessation of a scabies control programme. The prevalence of impetigo had also declined further since the end of the control programme. Our results suggest that a combination of mass treatment with ivermectin and intensive active case finding may result in long term control of scabies. Larger scale studies and integration with other neglected tropical disease control programmes should be priorities for scabies control efforts.","['Marks M', 'Taotao-Wini B', 'Satorara L', 'Engelman D', 'Nasi T', 'Mabey DC', 'Steer AC']",2015,9,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Marks M, et al.

26599569,The Importance of Scabies Coinfection in the Treatment Considerations for Impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Skin infections account for a high disease burden in indigenous children living in northern Australia. Although the relationship between impetigo and scabies is recognized, the prevalence of scabies in children with impetigo is not well reported. We report the prevalence, demographics and treatment success outcomes of impetigo and scabies coinfection in indigenous children who were participants in a randomized controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia.
METHODS: Of 1715 screening episodes for impetigo, 508 children were randomized to receive intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin (BPG), twice daily co-trimoxazole (SXT) for 3 days (4 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 20 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose) or once daily SXT for 5 days (8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose). A clinical diagnosis of scabies; tinea of the skin, scalp or nail; and head lice was made on all children. Scabies presence was not confirmed using diagnostic scrapings. In a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether coinfection with scabies had an impact on treatment success for impetigo.
RESULTS: Of children randomized to receive treatment for impetigo, 84 of 508 (16.5%) had scabies. The presence of scabies ranged from 14.3% to 20.0% in the 3 treatment groups. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection, independent of the treatment groups, was 75.9% and 86.6%, respectively, absolute difference 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): +1% to +21%]. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection in the BPG group was 69.6% and 88.0%, respectively, absolute difference 18.4% (95% CI: -1% to +38%). In the pooled SXT groups, the treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection was 78.6% and 86.0%, respectively, with absolute difference 7.4% (95% CI: -4% to +18%). Treatment success in the pooled SXT group with scabies (78.6%) was higher than in the BPG group (69.6%) with scabies, absolute difference 9.0% (95% CI: +0.1% to +18%). Prediction of treatment success for impetigo is dependent on the presence or absence of scabies and for scabies coinfected impetigo it was higher in the group treated with SXT.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of scabies in an impetigo trial for Indigenous children was high. Treatment success for scabies coinfection was lower than for impetigo overall, with a higher success seen in the SXT group than the BPG group.","['Tasani M', 'Tong SY', 'Andrews RM', 'Holt DC', 'Currie BJ', 'Carapetis JR', 'Bowen AC']",2016,35,4,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Tasani M, et al.

26572929,Focus on the Top Ten Diagnoses Could Reduce Pediatric Dermatology Referrals.,"There is a sense that many patients seen at referral centers could be managed at a primary health care level. The objective of the current study was to examine the range of diagnoses among consultations at the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, to help develop a strategy for targeted education of primary health care personnel. This was a retrospective review of data for children seen at a pediatric dermatology clinic from 2005 to 2010, recorded according to International Classification of Diseases coding and compared with published data from similar clinical settings. There were 13,253 clinic visits, with 4,789 patients seen (median age 4.8 yrs, range 2 days to 18.6 yrs). The top 10 diagnoses accounted for 88.5% of consultations (59.5% atopic eczema [AE], 7.1% seborrheic dermatitis [SD], 4.2% superficial mycoses, 3.1% molluscum contagiosum, 2.8% vitiligo, 2.7% viral warts, 2.4% prurigo or scabies, 2.3% psoriasis, 2.3% hemangioma, 2.1% impetigo). Disease prevalence was somewhat different during the first year of life (AE 43.7%, SD 18.6%, hemangiomas 13.4%). Inflammatory dermatoses (76.6%) were more prevalent than infections and infestations (14.5%). The disease spectrum was similar to that in developed countries, although AE prevalence was higher in this study (followed by London 36%, Greece 35%, and Hong Kong 33%) than in 19 published studies. The top 10 diagnoses accounted for more than 70% of diagnoses in 12 studies. The retrospective nature and setting at a specialist clinic increased bias and limited generalizability. Focused education on the optimal care of common diseases, especially AE, could reduce referrals, improve access, and allow specialists at tertiary centers more time to manage complex and uncommon dermatoses.","['Kakande B', 'Gumedze F', 'Hlela C', 'Khumalo NP']",2016,33,1,Pediatr Dermatol,"Kakande B, et al.

26430479,Age and sex prevalence of infectious dermatoses among primary school children in a rural South-Eastern Nigerian community.,"INTRODUCTION: Various dermatoses, due to their morbidity characteristics, have been shown to negatively impact on learning. The most epidemiologically important seem to be the infectious types because of their transmissibility and amenability to simple school-health measures. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and sex/age correlates of infectious dermatoses in a rural South-eastern Nigerian community.
METHODS: The pupils were proportionately recruited from the three primary schools based on school population. Stratified simple random sampling method was adopted and a table of random numbers was used to select required pupils from each arm. Clinical and laboratory examination was done to establish diagnoses of infectious skin disease. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 16.
RESULTS: The 400 pupils consisted of 153 males and 247 females. Age range was between 6 and 12 years. The prevalence of infectious dermatoses was 72.3%. The five most prevalent clinical forms of infectious dermatoses, in order of decreasing prevalence, were tinea capitis (35.2%), scabies (10.5%), tinea corporis (5.8%), tinea pedis (5.5%), and impetigo (5.0%). More cases, generally, occurred among males than females (80.4% vs 67.2%)); while some specific clinical types, pediculosis and seborrheic dermatitis, exhibited predilection for females. Pyodermas and scabies were significantly more prevalent in the 7-9 age-group; while tinea capitis, tinea corporis, seborrheic dermatitis and pediculosis were more associated with ≥10 age-group.
CONCLUSION: Infectious dermatoses were highly prevalent in the surveyed population. Many of the clinical types exhibited sex- and age-specificity.","['Kalu EI', 'Wagbatsoma V', 'Ogbaini-Emovon E', 'Nwadike VU', 'Ojide CK']",2015,20,,Pan Afr Med J,"Kalu EI, et al.

26345076,Nodular scabies: a classical case report in an adolescent boy.,"This case report presents a classical case of nodular scabies in a 12 year boy who complained of itching for 20-21 days before presentation to the hospital. Application of Betnovate ointment (Betamethasone valerate 0.1 %) before presentation to the hospital had provided only 2-3 days of relief from itching. Dermatological examination revealed skin colored to erythematous papule of 3-4 mm on the body with predilection for web space of fingers and flexural areas and nodules on the scrotum and groin. Based on this, clinical diagnosis of scabies with nodular scabies was made on the child. The scraping obtained from the web-space of the child showed mite under the light microscope, which confirms the diagnosis. Treatment with topical permethrin 5 % lotion resulted in 50-70 % subsidence of itching within a day, and improvement in impetigo lesions of his father in 5 days. However, the scrotal and groin nodular lesion of the child persisted with severe itching. Treatment with topical steroid and tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment did not show much improvement. Intralesional injection of triamcinolone (5 mg/ml) on the nodule resulted in 30-40 % subsidence in itching and 50-60 % reduction in the size of the lesion over 2-3 weeks.","['Ramachandra Reddy D', 'Ramachandra Reddy P']",2015,39,3,J Parasit Dis,Ramachandra Reddy D and Ramachandra Reddy P.

26336623,Zosteriform impetigo: Wolf's isotopic response in a cutaneous immunocompromised district.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo can result from Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Wolf's isotopic response is the occurrence of a new cutaneous disorder at the site of a previously healed disease. A cutaneous immunocompromised district is an area of skin that is more vulnerable than the rest of the individual's body.
PURPOSE: To describe a man with impetigo localized to a unilateral dermatome and review the clinical features of other patients with zosteriform Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection.
METHODS: PubMed was used to search the following terms, separately and in combination: cutaneous, dermatome, dermatomal, district, herpes, immunocompromised, impetigo, infection, isotopic, response, skin, staphylococcal, Staphylococcus aureus, Wolf, zoster, zosteriform. All papers were reviewed and relevant manuscripts, along with their reference citations, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Crusted, eroded and intact, erythematous papules and nodules acutely presented localized to the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve on the face of a 66-year-old man; he did not recall a prior episode of varicella-zoster virus infection in that area. A bacterial culture isolated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Viral cultures and direct fluorescent absorption studies were negative for herpes simplex and herpes zoster virus. All of the lesions resolved after oral treatment with cefdinir. Impetigo and/or furunculosis in a zosteriform distribution have also been described in 3 additional patients. The bacterial culture showed either methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant S. aureus; the skin infection resolved after treatment with oral antibiotics; however one man experienced 2 recurrences in the same area.

26317533,The Global Epidemiology of Impetigo: A Systematic Review of the Population Prevalence of Impetigo and Pyoderma.,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the global childhood population prevalence of impetigo and the broader condition pyoderma.
METHODS: PubMed was systematically searched for impetigo or pyoderma studies published between January 1 1970 and September 30 2014. Two independent reviewers extracted data from each relevant article on the prevalence of impetigo.
FINDINGS: Sixty-six articles relating to 89 studies met our inclusion criteria. Based on population surveillance, 82 studies included data on 145,028 children assessed for pyoderma or impetigo. Median childhood prevalence was 12·3% (IQR 4·2-19·4%). Fifty-eight (65%) studies were from low or low-middle income countries, where median childhood prevalences were 8·4% (IQR 4·2-16·1%) and 14·5% (IQR 8·3-20·9%), respectively. However, the highest burden was seen in underprivileged children from marginalised communities of high-income countries; median prevalence 19·4%, (IQR 3·9-43·3%).
CONCLUSION: Based on data from studies published since 2000 from low and low-middle income countries, we estimate the global population of children suffering from impetigo at any one time to be in excess of 162 million, predominantly in tropical, resource-poor contexts. Impetigo is an under-recognised disease and in conjunction with scabies, comprises a major childhood dermatological condition with potential lifelong consequences if untreated.","['Bowen AC', 'Mahé A', 'Hay RJ', 'Andrews RM', 'Steer AC', 'Tong SY', 'Carapetis JR']",2015,10,8,PLoS One,"Bowen AC, et al.

26280141,Common Skin Rashes in Children.,"Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the ""slapped cheek"" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.","['Allmon A', 'Deane K', 'Martin KL']",2015,92,3,Am Fam Physician,"Allmon A, et al.

26206690,In vitro activity of tedizolid against gram-positive bacteria in patients with skin and skin structure infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia: a Korean multicenter study.,"We compared the activities of tedizolid to those of linezolid and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci recovered from patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in Korean hospitals. Gram-positive isolates were collected from 356 patients with SSSIs and 144 patients with HAP at eight hospitals in Korea from 2011 to 2014. SSSIs included impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, furuncles, abscesses, and infected burns. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by using the CLSI agar dilution method.

Two distinct eta gene-positive bacteriophages isolated from S. aureus strains which recently caused massive outbreaks of pemphigus neonatorum in Czech maternity hospitals were characterized. The phages, designated ϕB166 and ϕB236, were able to transfer the eta gene into a prophageless S. aureus strain which afterwards converted into an ETA producer. Complete phage genome sequences were determined, and a comparative analysis of five designed genomic regions revealed major variances between them. They differed in the genome size, number of open reading frames, genome architecture, and virion protein patterns. Their high mutual sequence similarity was detected only in the terminal regions of the genome. When compared with the so far described eta phage genomes, noticeable differences were found. Thus, both phages represent two new lineages of as yet not characterized bacteriophages of the Siphoviridae family having impact on pathogenicity of impetigo strains of S. aureus.","['Botka T', 'Růžičková V', 'Konečná H', 'Pantůček R', 'Rychlík I', 'Zdráhal Z', 'Petráš P', 'Doškař J']",2015,51,1,Virus Genes,"Botka T, et al.

It is a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. Progress in GAS vaccine development has been hindered by a number of obstacles, including a lack of standardization in immunoassays and the need to define human correlates of protection. In this review, we have examined the current immunoassays used in both GAS and other organisms, and explored the various challenges in their implementation in order to propose potential future directions to identify a correlate of protection and facilitate the development of M protein-based vaccines, which are currently the main GAS vaccine candidates.","['Tsoi SK', 'Smeesters PR', 'Frost HR', 'Licciardi P', 'Steer AC']",2015,2015,,J Immunol Res,"Tsoi SK, et al.

An accumulation of ten patients in five families (A-E) suffering from skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) of CA-MRSA was experienced in 2012, in Fuchu-shi, Tokyo, Japan. Molecular epidemiological investigation was performed for the 10 MRSA strains obtained from 8 children and 2 of their parents to assess endemic patterns of CA-MRSA in the community. Results of molecular typing, presence of toxin genes and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed combined with the patients' clinical information. Each family had its own unique MRSA strain: A, ST30-SCCmec IVd; B, ST8-SCCmec IVd; C, ST8-SCCmec IVa; D, ST8-SCCmec IVl; E, ST8-SCCmec IVl and ST858-SCCmec IVl. Seven strains from the families A-C carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. Three strains from the families D and E carried toxic shock syndrome toxin gene. Strains belonged to the same family demonstrated genetically related banding patterns of pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis. The family C experienced intrafamilial transmission of USA300-0114. Our data showed the MRSA clones disseminating in this community were highly diverse. They contained USA300-0114 clone, the rapidly distributing clone in the world, as well as MRSA clones identified in Japan. Our results suggested intrafamilial transmission of MRSA could be initial phenomenon of wide transmission in a community, therefore CA-MRSA SSTI in children and their family members should be monitored closely in order to notice the spread of highly pathogenic and transmittable strains.","['Uehara Y', 'Ito T', 'Ogawa Y', 'Hirotaki S', 'Shoji T', 'Tame T', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Hiramatsu K']",2015,21,9,J Infect Chemother,"Uehara Y, et al.

Yet the worldwide prevalence of scabies is uncertain. We undertook a systematic review, searching several databases and the grey literature, for population-based studies that reported on the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in a community setting. All included studies were assessed for quality. 2409 articles were identified and 48 studies were included. Data were available for all regions except North America. The prevalence of scabies ranged from 0·2% to 71·4%. All regions except for Europe and the Middle East included populations with a prevalence greater than 10%. Overall, scabies prevalence was highest in the Pacific and Latin American regions, and was substantially higher in children than in adolescents and adults. Impetigo was common, particularly in children, with the highest prevalence in Australian Aboriginal communities (49·0%). Comprehensive scabies control strategies are urgently needed, such as a community-based mass drug administration approach, along with a more systematic approach to the monitoring of disease burden.","['Romani L', 'Steer AC', 'Whitfeld MJ', 'Kaldor JM']",2015,15,8,Lancet Infect Dis,"Romani L, et al.

26087228,"Sacha Inchi Oil (Plukenetia volubilis L.), effect on adherence of Staphylococus aureus to human skin explant and keratinocytes in vitro.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Plukenetia volubilis L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a domesticated vine distributed from the high-altitude Andean rain forest to the lowlands of the Peruvian Amazon. Oil from the cold-pressed seeds, sold under the commercial name of Sacha Inchi Oil (SIO) is actually much in favour because it contains a high percentage of omega 3 and omega 6, and is hence used as a dietary supplement. SIO is also used traditionally for skin care, in order to maintain skin softness, and for the treatment of wounds, insect bites and skin infections, in a tropical context where the skin is frequently damaged.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study was designed in order to verify whether the traditional use of SIO for skin care would have any impact on Staphylococcus aureus growth and skin adherence, as S. aureus is involved in many skin pathologies (impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles and subcutaneous abscesses) being one if the main pathogens that can be found on the skin. Therefore, our objective was to assess SIO bactericidal activity and interference with adherence to human skin explants and the keratinocyte cell line. Cytotoxicity on that cells was also determined. The activity of SIO was compared to coconut oil (CocO), which is widely used for skin care but has different unsaturated fatty acids contents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laboratory testing with certified oil, determined antibacterial activity against radio labelled S. aureus. Cytotoxic effects were measured with XTT on keratinocyte cells and with neutral red on human skin explants; phenol was used as cytotoxic control. Adherence assays were carried out by mixing H3-labelled S. aureus bacteria with keratinocyte cells and human skin explants, incubated with oils 2h before (to determine the inhibition of adherence, assimilated to a preventive effect) or 2h after the contact of the biological material with S. aureus (to assess the detachment of the bacteria, assimilated to a curative effect). Residual radioactivity measured after washings made it possible to determine the adherence intensity. Bactericidal effect was determined by colony counting on trypticase soy agar.
RESULTS: Laboratory assays showed that SIO and CocO, tested undiluted, were not cytotoxic on keratinocytes nor human explants and were not bactericidal neither. SIO was more active as antiadherent (preventive) than CocO on keratinocytes. There was no significant difference between detachment effects (curative) of both oils on keratinocytes but SIO was almost 5 times more active on the detachment of S. aureus from human skin explants.
CONCLUSION: From that study it can be concluded that the use of SIO on dermal cells is safe and efficient in the inhibition of S. aureus adherence. Our results tend to support the traditional use of undiluted SIO in skin care.","['Gonzalez-Aspajo G', 'Belkhelfa H', 'Haddioui-Hbabi L', 'Bourdy G', 'Deharo E']",2015,171,,J Ethnopharmacol,"Gonzalez-Aspajo G, et al.

26065865,Blood Cultures Are Not Useful in the Evaluation of Children with Uncomplicated Superficial Skin and Soft Tissue Infections.,"BACKGROUND: Blood cultures (BCs) are commonly performed on children admitted to hospital for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In recent years, this practice has been questioned in patients with uncomplicated SSTIs because of its low yield. At the same time, however, an increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections has been described; its influence on rates of bacteremia in patients with SSTIs is unclear. The aims of the study were to describe the performance and the yield of BC in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated SSTIs and to determine the prevalence of CA-MRSA as a causative agent in our area.
METHODS: Retrospective study: immunocompetent patients younger than 18 years evaluated in the emergency department and admitted for uncomplicated SSTIs (cellulitis, abscess, impetigo or erysipelas) from July 1, 2010 to June 31, 2014 were included. Patients referred from other hospitals who were receiving parenteral antibiotics and patients with complicated SSTIs (surgical or traumatic wound infection, need for surgical intervention and infected ulcers or burns) were excluded.
RESULTS: We included 445 cases: 348 (78.2%) cellulitis, 78 (17.5%) abscess and 19 (4.3%) impetigo. BCs were performed on 353 (79.3%) patients. Two (0.6%; 95% confidence interval: 0.2-2.0%) were positive and 10 (2.8%; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-5.1%) contaminated. The positive BCs grew S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Wound cultures were performed on 148 (33.3%) patients; 98 (66.2%) were positive. In 22 (22.4%) patients CA-MRSA grew, accounting for 14.9% of overall wound cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: BCs are not useful in the management of immunocompetent patients admitted to the hospital with uncomplicated SSTIs. The prevalence of CA-MRSA is low in our area, but continuing careful surveillance is needed.","['Trenchs V', 'Hernandez-Bou S', 'Bianchi C', 'Arnan M', 'Gene A', 'Luaces C']",2015,34,9,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Trenchs V, et al.

26028191,Zinc disrupts central carbon metabolism and capsule biosynthesis in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Neutrophils release free zinc to eliminate the phagocytosed bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underpinning zinc toxicity towards this human pathogen, responsible for diseases ranging from pharyngitis and impetigo, to severe invasive infections. Using the globally-disseminated M1T1 GAS strain, we demonstrate that zinc stress impairs glucose metabolism through the inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In the presence of zinc, a metabolic shift to the tagatose-6-phosphate pathway allows conversion of D-galactose to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate, partially bypassing impaired glycolytic enzymes to generate pyruvate. Additionally, zinc inhibition of phosphoglucomutase results in decreased capsule biosynthesis. These data indicate that zinc exerts it toxicity via mechanisms that inhibit both GAS central carbon metabolism and virulence pathways.","['Ong CL', 'Walker MJ', 'McEwan AG']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Ong CL, et al.

29387585,Psoriasis in pregnancy: challenges and solutions.,"The available information about the effects of pregnancy on psoriasis and those of psoriasis on pregnancy is almost limited, despite the high frequency of the disease in the general population, as well as in women in reproductive years. Considering the existing evidence, pregnancy does not tend to have a negative influence on psoriasis, as in most women who experience a change in the severity and course of their psoriasis during pregnancy, the change is more likely to be reported as an improvement. This assumption can be applied more convincingly to plaque-type psoriasis, while an exception may be represented by generalized pustular psoriasis, which has been somehow linked to impetigo herpetiformis. Conflicting findings emerged from the few available studies that explored the effect of psoriasis on pregnancy outcomes. Recent studies found an association between moderate-to-severe psoriasis and some pregnancy complications, including pregnancy-induced hypertensive diseases, and have emphasized a trend toward a newborn with low birth weight in patients with psoriasis, especially in those suffering from severe forms. The safety profile during pregnancy is not completely known for many drugs used to treat psoriasis. Moisturizers and low- to moderate-potency topical steroids or ultraviolet B phototherapy represent the first-line therapy for pregnant patients. Many dermatologists may, however, recommend discontinuing all drugs during pregnancy, in consideration of medico-legal issues, and also taking into account that common forms of psoriasis do not compromise the maternal and fetal health. Anyway, for those women whose psoriasis improves during pregnancy, the interruption of any therapy for psoriasis can be a reasonable strategy. The objective of this paper was to review the most relevant literature data on psoriasis in pregnancy, trying to give concurrently practical information about clinical and prognostic aspects, as well as counseling and management.","['Vena GA', 'Cassano N', 'Bellia G', 'Colombo D']",2015,5,,Psoriasis (Auckl),"Vena GA, et al.

25843529,Molecular typing of Chinese Streptococcus pyogenes isolates.,"Streptococcus pyogenes causes human infections ranging from mild pharyngitis and impetigo to serious diseases including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The objective of this study was to compare molecular emm typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) for genotyping of Chinese S. pyogenes isolates. Molecular emm typing and PFGE were performed using standard protocols. Seven variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci reported in a previous study were used to genotype 169 S. pyogenes geographically-diverse isolates from China isolated from a variety of disease syndromes. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis provided greater discrimination between isolates when compared to emm typing and PFGE. Removal of a single VNTR locus (Spy2) reduced the sensitivity by only 0.7%, which suggests that Spy2 was not informative for the isolates screened.

25827622,Photodynamic antibacterial enhanced effect of methylene blue-gold nanoparticles conjugate on Staphylococcal aureus isolated from impetigo lesions in vitro study.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal aureus is the most common organism which has been encountered in impetigo infection. Gold nanoparticles can be used as a tool to deliver antimicrobials or to enhance photodynamic destruction of bacteria.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the photodynamic effect of methylene blue gold nanoparticles (MB-gold nanoparticles conjugate) on S. aureus which were isolated from impetigo lesions.
PATIENT AND METHODS: Twenty children were diagnosed clinically as impetigo, and aged from 3 to 5 years of both sexes were recruited in the study. Two bacteriological samples were collected from each patient, identified and cultured. Samples of S. aureus of a concentration of 10(-1)ml were divided into four groups. S. aureus was treated by MB-gold nanoparticles conjugate, gold nanoparticles, MB, and the fourth group served as a control group. Diode laser (660 nm) was used for photoactivation. The bacterial growth inhibition was determined by two methods: the percentage of reduction of viable bacteria count and the optical density (O.D) of bacterial growth.
RESULTS: The highest significant inhibitory effect on S. aureus was obtained with MB-gold nanoparticles conjugate when irradiated by diode laser 660 nm (P < 0.0001). The percentage of viable bacteria was 3%. The photoactivated gold nanoparticles showed a significant inhibitory effect on bacterial growth (P < 0.05). A non-significant inhibitory effect was elicited in other groups.
CONCLUSION: The photoactivated MB-gold nanoparticles conjugate showed the maximum inhibitory effect on S. aureus activity. The gold nanoparticles proved efficacy as a drug delivery system. It enhanced the photodynamic antibacterial effect of methylene blue.","['Tawfik AA', 'Alsharnoubi J', 'Morsy M']",2015,12,2,Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,"Tawfik AA, et al.

Ten clonal complexes and 12 SCCmec types have been identified. As a result, more than 15 MRSA clones that were defined by the combination of genotype and SCCmec type, were identified. Among them, Clonal Complex (CC) 5-type IIa SCCmec strains were the most major (16 strains). In contrast to the fact that CC5- type IIa SCCmec strains known as a hospital-associated MRSA clone in Japan carried toxic-shock syndrome toxin gene (tst), only 2 of 16 strains have been shown to carry tst. Thirty-eight (70.4%) of isolates belonged to the clones distinct from the CC5-type IIa SCCmec strains. Among them, CC8 strains were major (12 strains), which contained 9 tst-positive CC8-type IVl SCCmec clones and a CC8-type IVa SCCmec strain carrying the Panton Valentine Leukocidin gene (lukS, F-PV). Clones related to impetigo were also identified: 7 exfoliative toxin b (etb) -positive clones, CC89-type IIa SCCmec and CC89-type V SCCmec strains; and 2 exfoliative toxin a (eta) -positive CC121-type V SCCmec strains. Other clones were as follows: CC1-type IVa SCCmec, CC8-type I SCCmec, CC81-type IVg SCCmec, CC97-type IVc SCCmec, CC91-type IVa SCCmec, CC59-type IVg SCCmec, CC45-type IIn SCCmec, CC89-SCCmec nontypeable, and CC8-type IVm, novel subtype of type IV SCCmec were identified in this study.

25738499,Scabies and impetigo prevalence and risk factors in Fiji: a national survey.,"BACKGROUND: Scabies is recognised as a major public health problem in many countries, and is responsible for significant morbidity due to secondary bacterial infection of the skin causing impetigo, abscesses and cellulitis, that can in turn lead to serious systemic complications such as septicaemia, kidney disease and, potentially, rheumatic heart disease. Despite the apparent burden of disease in many countries, there have been few large-scale surveys of scabies prevalence or risk factors. We undertook a population-based survey in Fiji of scabies and impetigo to evaluate the magnitude of the problem and inform public health strategies.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 75 communities, including villages and settlements in both urban and rural areas, were randomly selected from 305 communities across the four administrative divisions, and all residents in each location were invited to participate in skin examination by trained personnel. The study enrolled 10,887 participants. The prevalence of scabies was 23.6%, and when adjusted for age structure and geographic location based on census data, the estimated national prevalence was 18.5%. The prevalence was highest in children aged five to nine years (43.7%), followed by children aged less than five (36.5%), and there was also an indication of prevalence increasing again in older age. The prevalence of scabies was twice as high in iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians compared to Indo-Fijians. The prevalence of impetigo was 19.6%, with a peak in children aged five to nine years (34.2%). Scabies was very strongly associated with impetigo, with an estimated 93% population attributable risk.
CONCLUSIONS: As far as we are aware, this is the first national survey of scabies and impetigo ever conducted. We found that scabies occurs at high levels across all age groups, ethnicities, and geographical locations. Improved strategies are urgently needed to achieve control of scabies and its complications in endemic communities.","['Romani L', 'Koroivueta J', 'Steer AC', 'Kama M', 'Kaldor JM', 'Wand H', 'Hamid M', 'Whitfeld MJ']",2015,9,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Romani L, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and bacteriological efficacy of retapamulin ointment 1% in treatment of patients with cutaneous bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant 
METHODS: Prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open label, single center trial conducted between April 2008 and November 2012 that evaluated efficacy of retapamulin ointment 1% in the treatment of impetigo, folliculitis, and other minor soft tissue infections in children and adults. Fifty patients, who presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic and were clinically diagnosed with impetigo, folliculitis, or minor soft tissue infection suitable for treatment with a topical antibiotic, were screened. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and received treatment: topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days. Seven patients were MRSA positive and qualified for the primary efficacy population. One patient withdrew due to an adverse event. Clinical and microbiological exams were performed at baseline and follow-up 5 to 7 days later to assess clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic responses. Primary outcome was clinical response at follow-up in primary efficacy population with MRSA isolated as the baseline pathogen. Secondary outcomes included clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic responses in patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria.
RESULTS: Clinical response at follow-up in the primary efficacy population (MRSA-positive patients) was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate significance; however, outcomes were excellent, with 7 of 7 patients demonstrating clinical success (5 of 7) or clinical improvement (2 of 7) at follow-up.

25670736,Mechanisms of group A Streptococcus resistance to reactive oxygen species.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is an exclusively human Gram-positive bacterial pathogen ranked among the 'top 10' causes of infection-related deaths worldwide. GAS commonly causes benign and self-limiting epithelial infections (pharyngitis and impetigo), and less frequent severe invasive diseases (bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis). Annually, GAS causes 700 million infections, including 1.8 million invasive infections with a mortality rate of 25%. In order to establish an infection, GAS must counteract the oxidative stress conditions generated by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the infection site by host immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. ROS are the highly reactive and toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2•(-)), hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and singlet oxygen (O2*), which can damage bacterial nucleic acids, proteins and cell membranes. This review summarizes the enzymatic and regulatory mechanisms utilized by GAS to thwart ROS and survive under conditions of oxidative stress.","['Henningham A', 'Döhrmann S', 'Nizet V', 'Cole JN']",2015,39,4,FEMS Microbiol Rev,"Henningham A, et al.

To consider important measures for infection prevention, direct and indirect transmission routes of pathogens must be revealed. Therefore, we studied the role of skin and fabrics in the spread of the impetigo pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and the strain Streptococcus equi (surrogate to Streptococcus pyogenes) in order to assess infection transfer in realistic scenarios. The transmission of test strains was studied with standardized fabric-skin models using a technical artificial skin and fabrics of different fiber types commonly occurring in German kindergartens. In synthetic pus, both test strains persisted on artificial skin and fabrics for at least 4 h. Friction enhanced transfer, depending on the fiber type or fabric construction. In a skin-to-skin setup, the total transfer was higher than via fabrics and no decrease in the transmission rates from donor to recipients could be observed after successive direct skin contacts. Children in kindergartens may be at risk of transmission for impetigo pathogens, especially via direct skin contact, but also by the joint use of fabrics, like towels or handicraft materials. Fabric-skin models used in this study enable further insight into the transmission factors for skin infections on the basis of a practical approach.","['Gerhardts A', 'Henze SV', 'Bockmühl D', 'Höfer D']",2015,34,6,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Gerhardts A, et al.

25586078,Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus isolates from skin and soft tissue infections.,"Many diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus are associated with biofilm formation. However, the ability of S. aureus isolates from skin and soft tissue infections to form biofilms has not yet been investigated. We tested 160 isolates from patients with various skin infections for biofilm-forming capacity in different growth media. All the isolates formed biofilms, the extent of which depended on the type of growth medium. The thickest biofilms were formed when both plasma and glucose were present in the broth; in this case, S. aureus incorporated host fibrin into the biofilm's matrix. There were no differences in the biofilm formation between isolates from different types of skin infections, except for a particularly good biofilm formation by isolates from diabetic wounds and a weaker biofilm formation by isolates from impetigo. In conclusion, biofilm formation is a universal behavior of S. aureus isolates from skin infections. In some cases, such as in diabetic wounds, a particularly strong biofilm formation most likely contributes to the chronic and recurrent character of the infection. Additionally, as S. aureus apparently uses host fibrin as part of the biofilm structure, we suggest that plasma should be included more frequently in in vitro biofilm studies.","['Kwiecinski J', 'Kahlmeter G', 'Jin T']",2015,70,5,Curr Microbiol,"Kwiecinski J, et al.

25551178,"The microbiology of impetigo in indigenous children: associations between Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, scabies, and nasal carriage.","BACKGROUND: Impetigo is caused by both Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; the relative contributions of each have been reported to fluctuate with time and region. While S. aureus is reportedly on the increase in most industrialised settings, S. pyogenes is still thought to drive impetigo in endemic, tropical regions. However, few studies have utilised high quality microbiological culture methods to confirm this assumption. We report the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of impetigo pathogens recovered in a randomised, controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote Indigenous communities of northern Australia.
METHODS: Each child had one or two sores, and the anterior nares, swabbed. All swabs were transported in skim milk tryptone glucose glycogen broth and frozen at -70°C, until plated on horse blood agar. S. aureus and S. pyogenes were confirmed with latex agglutination.
RESULTS: From 508 children, we collected 872 swabs of sores and 504 swabs from the anterior nares prior to commencement of antibiotic therapy. S. pyogenes and S. aureus were identified together in 503/872 (58%) of sores; with an additional 207/872 (24%) sores having S. pyogenes and 81/872 (9%) S. aureus, in isolation. Skin sore swabs taken during episodes with a concurrent diagnosis of scabies were more likely to culture S. pyogenes (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 - 4.4, p = 0.03). Eighteen percent of children had nasal carriage of skin pathogens. There was no association between the presence of S. aureus in the nose and skin. Methicillin-resistance was detected in 15% of children who cultured S. aureus from either a sore or their nose. There was no association found between the severity of impetigo and the detection of a skin pathogen.
CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes remains the principal pathogen in tropical impetigo; the relatively high contribution of S. aureus as a co-pathogen has also been confirmed. Children with scabies were more likely to have S. pyogenes detected. While clearance of S. pyogenes is the key determinant of treatment efficacy, co-infection with S. aureus warrants consideration of treatment options that are effective against both pathogens where impetigo is severe and prevalent.

This variety of clinical expressions, often radically different in individuals infected with the same strain, results from a complex interaction between the bacterial virulence factors, the mode of infection and the immune system of the host. Advances in comparative genomics have led to a better understanding of how, following this confrontation, GAS adapts to the immune system's pressure, either peacefully by reducing the expression of certain virulence factors to achieve an asymptomatic carriage, or on the contrary, by overexpressing them disproportionately, resulting in the most severe forms of invasive infection.","['Bidet P', 'Bonacorsi S']",2014,21 Suppl 2,,Arch Pediatr,Bidet P and Bonacorsi S.

25413920,Primary care treatment guidelines for skin infections in Europe: congruence with antimicrobial resistance found in commensal Staphylococcus aureus in the community.,"BACKGROUND: Over 90% of antibiotics for human use in Europe are prescribed in primary care. We assessed the congruence between primary care treatment guidelines for skin infections and commensal Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) antimicrobial resistance levels in community-dwelling persons.
METHODS: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus was analysed by taking nose swabs from healthy primary care patients in nine European countries (total N = 32,032). Primary care treatment guidelines for bacterial skin infections were interpreted with respect to these antimicrobial resistance patterns. First- and second-choice recommendations were assessed and considered congruent if resistance to the antibiotic did not exceed 20%.
RESULTS: We included primary care treatment guidelines for impetigo, cellulitis, folliculitis and furuncle. Treatment recommendations in all countries were consistent: most of the first-choice recommendations were beta-lactams, both for children and adults. Antimicrobial resistance levels were low, except for penicillin (on average 73% resistance). Considerable variation in antimicrobial resistance levels was found between countries, with Sweden displaying the lowest levels and Spain the highest. In some countries resistance to penicillin and azithromycin was significantly higher in children (4-17 years) compared with adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the first- and second-choice recommendations in the treatment guidelines for skin infections were congruent with commensal S. aureus antimicrobial resistance patterns in the community, except for two recommendations for penicillin. Given the variation in antimicrobial resistance levels between countries, age groups and health care settings, national data regarding antimicrobial resistance in the community should be taken into account when updating or developing primary care treatment guidelines.","['van Bijnen EM', 'Paget WJ', 'den Heijer CD', 'Stobberingh EE', 'Bruggeman CA', 'Schellevis FG', 'APRES Study Team']",2014,15,,BMC Fam Pract,"van Bijnen EM, et al.

25341306,Clinical-epidemiological trends of herpes zoster: a 5-year study.,"UNLABELLED: Herpes zoster (shingles) is a neurocutaneous viral disease, in recent years its incidence increasing throughout the world.
AIM: To study the incidence of herpes zoster among Iasi county patients requiring hospital admission and to analyze the clinical and epidemiological features and socioeconomic status of the study group.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 158 patients admitted to the largest clinical dermatology department in North-eastern Romania, the Clinical Dermatology Department of the Iasi ""Sf. Spiridon"" University Emergency Hospital. The study was conducted over a period of five years and included the analysis of epidemiological data, socioeconomic status, clinical forms of disease, associated diseases, pathology reports for skin biopsy fragments, administered treatment, and disease course.
RESULTS: This study confirms that shingles is not a sex-specific disease, the female/male ratio being 1.22: 1. Most patients belonged to the age group 70-80 years, accounting for about 35% of all patients, followed by the age group 60-70 years (24.6% of cases). A slight increase in the number of cases was recorded in autumn and summer in patients living in rural areas. 1.3% of the cases were diagnosed both with the disseminated form of disease, and complications (eczematization, bacterial superinfection, skin necrosis). 7.6% of patients presented additional skin disorders (pityriasis versicolor, impetigo, psoriasis vulgaris, mucocutaneous candidiasis), which raised the suspicion of an immune deficiency predisposing to shingles. The absence or late initiation of specific antiviral therapy correlated with prolonged hospital stay up to 4-6 days. We found an association between the erythematous form of shingles and young age, while the hemorrhagic or necrotic forms were present in the elderly and/or ill patients. The course was favorable and the length of illness was significantly shortened when the treatment adequate to the clinical form was administered. Associated comorbidities (essential hypertension 38.6%, dyslipidemia 24.6%, diabetes, mellitus 9.49%, chronic venous disease, other skin diseases) represent a factor complicating the development of herpes zoster by the cumulative stress the body is exposed to.
CONCLUSIONS: The main statistically significant epidemiological data in the study group are: older age (over 60 years), associated diseases (which by the marked imbalances induced in the body increase the risk of varicella zoster virus reactivation) intense psychological stress. The following parameters did not change the risk of developing shingles: area of origin, sex, the season at disease onset, number of hospital days, and administered treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease is important for maintaining a good quality of life, to avoid complications, to limit the extent of the disease and its transmission to others.","['Brănişteanu DE', 'Stoleriu G', 'Oanţă A', 'Dorobăţ CM', 'Petrariu FD', 'Anchidin DM', 'Ciubotaru FM', 'Brănişteanu DC']",2014,118,3,Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi,"Brănişteanu DE, et al.

25250996,Impetigo: diagnosis and treatment.,"Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. There are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). Nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. Impetigo primarily affects the skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. Bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by S. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. Both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. Natural therapies such as tea tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. Treatments under development include minocycline foam and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. Topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. Empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and streptococcal infections. Clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole covers methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, but is inadequate for streptococcal infection.","['Hartman-Adams H', 'Banvard C', 'Juckett G']",2014,90,4,Am Fam Physician,"Hartman-Adams H, et al.

25229166,The decline of the impetigo epidemic caused by the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone: an 11.5-year population-based incidence study from a community in Western Norway.,"BACKGROUND: From around the year 2000, Northern Europe experienced a rise in impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus resistant to fusidic acid. A single clone of S. aureus was found to be the bacterial pathogen involved in the impetigo outbreak in Norway, Sweden, the UK and Ireland, termed 'the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone' (EEFIC). We have followed the incidence of impetigo during the years 2001-2012 based on all patients in general practice in the island community of Austevoll, Western Norway. We previously reported a marked decline of impetigo incidence in Austevoll, from 0.0260 cases per person-year in 2002 to 0.0038 in 2009. This article explores indications of an end to the impetigo epidemic caused by the EEFIC clone.
METHODS: All four general practitioners (GPs) in the community (mean population = 4400) were asked to diagnose impetigo in a uniform way and to take bacterial specimens from all impetigo cases. Phenotypic characteristics of specimen bacteria were determined for the whole period and molecular analyses were performed on isolates in the period 2008-2012.
RESULTS: We observed a further decline in incidence of impetigo in Austevoll in the study period. The proportion of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus isolates decreased during the period 2002-2012, with a mean of 80% in the epidemic years of 2002-2004, 55% in 2005-2009, and 6% in 2010-2012. In total, 44 S. aureus isolates from impetigo were subject to molecular analyses in the period 2008-2012, and 11 were found to be related to the EEFIC. All EEFIC isolates were found in 2008-2009, with no new isolates in 2010-2012.
CONCLUSION: There is an apparent end to the impetigo epidemic related to the EEFIC in this population in Western Norway.","['Rørtveit S', 'Skutlaberg DH', 'Langeland N', 'Rortveit G']",2014,46,12,Scand J Infect Dis,"Rørtveit S, et al.

25226722,Infection of the Beard area. Kerion: a review of 2 cases.,"Folliculitis barbae is a common condition of both infective and non-infectious aetiology. It most frequently presents as a superficial folliculitis, with fine pustules appearing at the opening of hair follicles in the beard area, often associated with shaving; known as Bockhart impetigo and usually due to infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. If untreated, the infection and inflammation can progress, leading to a more deeply seated infection known as sycosis barbae. Perifollicular nodules, termed furuncles, may appear and when these are multiple and coalesce, a deep-seated, communicating, pustulating plaque called a carbuncle develops, often with associated systemic upset. Such an appearance, which can prompt incision and drainage, should not, however, be assumed to be solely due to staphylococcal infection. Particularly in the context of a history of close animal contact or a lack of response to antibiotic treatment, a diagnosis of tinea barbae should be considered and investigated. Prompt treatment with antifungal agents and often systemic steroids is required once the diagnosis is made. This will help reduce an exacerbation of the pronounced destruction that results from the immune response to the fungal infection, known as a kerion, which would be compounded by surgical intervention. In this article, we review two such cases and review the investigation and management of the disease.","['Wall D', 'Fraher M', ""O'Connell B"", 'Watson R', 'Timon C', 'Stassen LF', 'Barnes L']",2014,107,7,Ir Med J,"Wall D, et al.

25212256,Efficacy and safety of nadifloxacin for bacterial skin infections: results from clinical and post-marketing studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Skin and soft tissue infections involve microbial invasion of the skin and underlying soft tissues and are estimated to affect 7-10% of hospitalized patients worldwide. Nadifloxacin, a topical fluoroquinolone, has been shown to be effective against aerobic Gram-negative, Gram-positive (including MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococci), and anaerobic bacteria. However, there is paucity of data comparing efficacy and safety of 1% nadifloxacin with other anti-bacterials for skin infections in Indian patients.
METHODS: This article presents the results of one post-marketing surveillance (PMS) and three randomized, open, non-blinded, multi-centric clinical studies that compared nadifloxacin with mupirocin and framycetin, and nadifloxacin with fusidic acid. Patients in India, aged from 1 to 65 years old, suffering from mild to moderate bacterial skin infections including impetigo, secondarily infected wounds, folliculitis, infected atopic dermatitis, and furunculosis were randomly allocated to three treatment groups within the studies. Efficacy was assessed by the evaluation of symptoms of erythema, exudation, swelling, pruritus, crusting, pain and tenderness in all the studies.
RESULTS: A total of 272 subjects were enrolled in the study and subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups; 92 in the nadifloxacin group, 90 in the mupirocin group, and 90 in the framycetin group. A significant reduction in the mean scores for bacterial infection symptoms in the nadifloxacin groups was observed when compared to mupirocin, framycetin and fusidic acid groups. Both physician and patients rated nadifloxacin as excellent (complete remission of symptoms) on a 4-point scale in the studies. No adverse events (AEs) were reported in the clinical studies. In the PMS, only two patients (of 329, 0.6%) reported AEs including burning and itching, one in each patient that had resolved at the time of reporting.

25194957,Exfoliative toxin A staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in preterm infants.,"UNLABELLED: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) demonstrates dermal symptoms due to exfoliative toxin (ET) A or ETB produced by Staphylococcus aureus. We examined the association between anti-ETA antibodies and SSSS onset in neonates. Three preterm infants carried an ETA-producing strain of S. aureus, manifesting as either SSSS or bullous impetigo; a full-term infant carrying the same strain was asymptomatic. The infants (n=106) were categorized into three groups according to their gestational age (GA) as follows: <30 weeks, 30-37 weeks, and >37 weeks. The measured levels of anti-ETA antibody in the three infants displaying SSSS were low before the onset of dermal symptoms; only the asymptomatic full-term infant displayed a high antibody level. Anti-ETA antibody levels in the preterm group with a GA of <30 weeks were statistically lower than those in the term infant group; the prevalences of anti-ETA antibodies above a cutoff value in the three groups of neonates were 55 % (18/33) among preterm infants with a GA <30 weeks, 73 % (25/34) among those with a GA of 30-37 weeks, and 90 % (35/39) among infants with a GA >37 weeks.
CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-ETA antibodies below a particular cutoff level might be associated with SSSS onset in preterm infants.","['Saida K', 'Kawasaki K', 'Hirabayashi K', 'Akazawa Y', 'Kubota S', 'Kasuga E', 'Kusakari M', 'Ishida T', 'Kitamura M', 'Baba A', 'Koike K']",2015,174,4,Eur J Pediatr,"Saida K, et al.

Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is a pruritic disease that usually occurs in primiparous women during the last trimester of pregnancy. Atopic eczema of pregnancy is still controversial as an entity covering conditions with eczematous lesions, prurigo, or folliculitis, and inconstantly associated with a personal history of atopy. Skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence or search for serum anti-BPAg1 (180kD) NC16a antibodies is mandatory in pruritic dermatoses of pregnancy in order to rule out pemphigoid gestationis.

25190737,Survey of the bp/tee genes from clinical group A streptococcus isolates in New Zealand - implications for vaccine development.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) is responsible for a wide range of diseases ranging from superficial infections, such as pharyngitis and impetigo, to life-threatening diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome and acute rheumatic fever (ARF). GAS pili are hair-like extensions protruding from the cell surface and consist of highly immunogenic structural proteins: the backbone pilin (BP) and one or two accessory pilins (AP1 and AP2). The protease-resistant BP builds the pilus shaft and has been recognized as the T-antigen, which forms the basis of a major serological typing scheme that is often used as a supplement to M typing. A previous sequence analysis of the bp gene (tee gene) in 39 GAS isolates revealed 15 different bp/tee types. In this study, we sequenced the bp/tee gene from 100 GAS isolates obtained from patients with pharyngitis, ARF or invasive disease in New Zealand. We found 20 new bp/tee alleles and four new bp/tee types/subtypes. No association between bp/tee type and clinical outcome was observed. We confirmed earlier reports that the emm type and tee type are associated strongly, but we also found exceptions, where multiple tee types could be found in certain M/emm type strains, such as M/emm89. We also reported, for the first time, the existence of a chimeric bp/tee allele, which was assigned into a new subclade (bp/tee3.1). A strong sequence conservation of the bp/tee gene was observed within the individual bp/tee types/subtypes (>97 % sequence identity), as well as between historical and contemporary New Zealand and international GAS strains. This temporal and geographical sequence stability provided further evidence for the potential use of the BP/T-antigen as a vaccine target.","['Steemson JD', 'Moreland NJ', 'Williamson D', 'Morgan J', 'Carter PE', 'Proft T']",2014,63,Pt 12,J Med Microbiol,"Steemson JD, et al.

25172376,"Short-course oral co-trimoxazole versus intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo in a highly endemic region: an open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: Impetigo affects more than 110 million children worldwide at any one time. The major burden of disease is in developing and tropical settings where topical antibiotics are impractical and lead to rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Few trials of systemic antibiotics are available to guide management of extensive impetigo. As such, we aimed to compare short-course oral co-trimoxazole with standard treatment with intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin in children with impetigo in a highly endemic setting.
METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, Indigenous Australian children aged 3 months to 13 years with purulent or crusted non-bullous impetigo were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive benzathine benzylpenicillin (weight-banded injection), twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days (4 mg/kg plus 20 mg/kg per dose), or once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days (8 mg/kg plus 40 mg/kg per dose). At every visit, participants were randomised in blocks of six and 12, stratified by disease severity. Randomisation was done by research nurses and codes were in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Independent reviewers masked to treatment allocation compared digital images of sores from days 0 and 7. The primary outcome was treatment success at day 7 in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12609000858291.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 26, 2009, and Nov 20, 2012, 508 patients were randomly assigned to receive benzathine benzylpenicillin (n=165 [156 analysed]), twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days (n=175 [173 analysed]), or once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days (n=168 [161 analysed]). Treatment was successful in 133 (85%) children who received benzathine benzylpenicillin and 283 (85%) who received pooled co-trimoxazole (absolute difference 0·5%; 95% CI -6·2 to 7·3), showing non-inferiority of co-trimoxazole (10% margin). Results for twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days and once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days were similar. Adverse events occurred in 54 participants, 49 (90%) of whom received benzathine benzylpenicillin.
INTERPRETATION: Short-course co-trimoxazole is a non-inferior, alternative treatment to benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo; it is palatable, pain-free, practical, and easily administered.

25141474,High school wrestling tournament decision making.,"OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to aid in safe coverage of a large scale wrestling tournament and to provide information transferable to other sporting tournaments.
BACKGROUND: Catastrophic injuries dominate the concerns of the medical teams covering sporting events. Insights gained from years of experience by the same medical team for one of the premier high school wrestling tournaments offers practical knowledge for successful preparation of a large scale event. Necessary personnel, equipment, and supplies are critical.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Skin conditions and injuries sustained while wrestling
MEASUREMENTS: Event preparation was performed by the same medical staff for three years, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Skin checks were performed on over 750 wrestlers each year. Disqualifications for untreated or under treated conditions were made as necessary. Approximately 1,700 bouts a year were supervised by the medical personnel. All injuries sustained were recorded by the medical staff and necessary disqualifications were made.
FINDINGS: Each year wrestlers presented with the appropriate skin forms. Only in 2009, did a wrestler not have adequate treatment for MRSA impetigo and was disqualified. There were no catastrophic injuries in the recorded years. Medical disqualifications were also infrequent. In 2006, 2008 and 2009, 6, 17, and 8 disqualifications occurred respectively. The most common type of injury each year was a sprain/strain.
CONCLUSION: Many clinicians are fearful of leading the medical staff for tournaments of such size. The presented recommendations provide an understanding and categorical check list of necessary staffing, logistics, equipment, and supplies. Preparation for known sports specific anticipated injuries and return to play decision making should help, but only successful completion of the event will provide the necessary confidence.","['Axe JM', 'Axe MJ']",2014,86,6,Del Med J,Axe JM and Axe MJ.

25081842,Clinical course in a patient with neutrophil-specific granule deficiency and rapid detection of neutrophil granules as a screening test.,"PURPOSE: Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by atypical neutrophil structure and function that results in frequent and severe bacterial infections. However, the clinical course of patients with SGD have not been described in detail because of the scarcity of the disease. We present the clinical course of an adult patient with SGD and propose a method for making an early diagnosis of SGD.
PATIENT AND METHODS: A32-year-old Japanese woman with SGD had a small impetigo lesion on her face and experienced the rapid spread of a facial abscess to a pulmonary abscess via the blood stream. We also analyzed the expression of neutrophil granule proteins in our patient compared with a healthy control by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We confirmed defects of several neutrophil granule proteins in our patient by flow cytometry.
CONCLUSION: Severe bacterial infections sometimes occur and spread rapidly in SGD. Detection of neutrophil granules by flow cytometry is useful for a rapid diagnosis and a screening of SGD.","['Shigemura T', 'Yamazaki T', 'Shiohara M', 'Kobayashi N', 'Naganuma K', 'Koike K', 'Agematsu K']",2014,34,7,J Clin Immunol,"Shigemura T, et al.

25077423,Vaccination against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes prevents death after influenza virus: S. pyogenes super-infection.,"Influenza virus infections are associated with a significant number of illnesses and deaths on an annual basis. Many of the deaths are due to complications from secondary bacterial invaders, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The β-hemolytic bacteria S. pyogenes colonizes both skin and respiratory surfaces, and frequently presents clinically as strep throat or impetigo. However, when these bacteria gain access to normally sterile sites, they can cause deadly diseases including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia. We previously developed a model of influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection, which we used to demonstrate that vaccination against influenza virus can limit deaths associated with a secondary bacterial infection, but this protection was not complete. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine that targets the M protein of S. pyogenes to determine whether immunity toward the bacteria alone would allow the host to survive an influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection. Our data demonstrate that vaccination against the M protein induces IgG antibodies, in particular those of the IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, and that these antibodies can interact with macrophages. Ultimately, this vaccine-induced immunity eliminated death within our influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection model, despite the fact that all M protein-vaccinated mice showed signs of illness following influenza virus inoculation. These findings identify immunity against bacteria as an important component of protection against influenza virus:bacteria super-infection.","['Klonoski JM', 'Hurtig HR', 'Juber BA', 'Schuneman MJ', 'Bickett TE', 'Svendsen JM', 'Burum B', 'Penfound TA', 'Sereda G', 'Dale JB', 'Chaussee MS', 'Huber VC']",2014,32,40,Vaccine,"Klonoski JM, et al.

25072249,Molluscum contagiosum in a pediatric American Indian population: incidence and risk factors.,"BACKGROUND: Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) causes an innocuous yet persistent skin infection in immunocompetent individuals and is spread by contact with lesions. Studies point to atopic dermatitis (AD) as a risk factor for MCV infection; however, there are no longitudinal studies that have evaluated this hypothesis.
METHODS: Outpatient visit data from fiscal years 2001-2009 for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children were examined to describe the incidence of molluscum contagiosum (MC). We conducted a case-control study of patients <5 years old at an Indian Health Service (IHS) clinic to evaluate dermatological risk factors for infection.
RESULTS: The incidence rate for MC in children <5 years old was highest in the West and East regions. MC cases were more likely to have a prior or co-occurring diagnosis of eczema, eczema or dermatitis, impetigo, and scabies (p<0.05) compared to controls; 51.4% of MC cases had a prior or co-occurring diagnosis of eczema or dermatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first demonstration of an association between AD and MC using a case-control study design. It is unknown if the concurrent high incidence of eczema and MC is related, and this association deserves further investigation.","['McCollum AM', 'Holman RC', 'Hughes CM', 'Mehal JM', 'Folkema AM', 'Redd JT', 'Cheek JE', 'Damon IK', 'Reynolds MG']",2014,9,7,PLoS One,"McCollum AM, et al.

OBJECTIVE: A 5-year study was conducted to monitor prescription use in children younger than 9 months of age.
METHODS: Annual prescription events were monitored in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the Clinformatics™ DataMart Multiplan (IMPACT), a product of OptumInsight Life Sciences, Inc. (Eden Prairie, MN, USA), from the USA.
RESULTS: In the CPRD, of 148 prescriptions, three (2 %) were identified in children aged less than 9 months between years 2008 and 2011. In IMPACT, of 59,210 claims for retapamulin in children, 1,951 (3.3 %) were categorized as definitive, or uncertain for, less than 9 months of age between 2007 and 2011.
CONCLUSION: Retapamulin prescription events in children aged less than 9 months were relatively low compared with other recent estimations of off-label pediatric medicines.

24875186,Scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.,"BACKGROUND: The resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. Scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. Epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. It is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the opportunistic pathogens. A longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. In a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with S. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. A total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16S rDNA tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. We found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in Staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. This increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. Furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted from the commensal S. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to S. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. In contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of Staphylococcus throughout the trial.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first experimental in vivo evidence supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. Our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. The methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. Studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against the mites and the secondary infections.","['Swe PM', 'Zakrzewski M', 'Kelly A', 'Krause L', 'Fischer K']",2014,8,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Swe PM, et al.

24823337,Pediatric burn wound impetigo after grafting.,"Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. Secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium in association with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration has been termed burns impetigo. This may result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment. The events preceding development, the impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment appear unclear and poorly reported. In 5 years, between 2006 and 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. Time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days: the mean time to complete healing was greatest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days). Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and prolonged symptoms. Delay in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when postgraft patients present with suggestive clinical signs and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.","['Aikins K', 'Prasad N', 'Menon S', 'Harvey JG', 'Holland AJ']",2015,36,2,J Burn Care Res,"Aikins K, et al.

24758232,"Prevalences of skin diseases among primary schoolchildren in Damietta, Egypt.","OBJECTIVES: Information on prevalences of pediatric dermatoses in Egypt is scanty. This study aimed to supplement existing data.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Damietta, Egypt between October 2011 and March 2012. It involved 6162 pupils randomly selected from 30 primary schools. The sample was equally divided (3081 pupils/15 schools) between urban and rural areas. Each participant was interviewed for age, gender, residence and complaint. Hygiene status was evaluated and a clinical examination was carried out for skin diseases. Data were coded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Although most children revealed more than one dermatosis, the majority (76.2%) had not complained of disease. The most common disease group included benign neoplasms (87.0%), followed by pigmentary disorders (68.3%), infections (50.9%), adnexal disorders (14.1%), hypersensitivity diseases (14.0%), genodermatoses (0.3%) and papulosquamous diseases (0.2%). The most common subgroup of diseases comprised parasitic infections (47.5%), among which pediculosis prevailed (47.5%), followed by dermatitis (10.0%) in which pityriasis alba dominated (6.0%), followed by hair disorders (9.3%), bacterial infections (5.9%), urticaria (4.4%), sebaceous gland disorders (2.7%), sweat gland disorders (2.3%), viral infections (1.6%) and fungal infections (0.7%). The most commonly found diseases included, in descending order, acquired melanocytic nevus, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, pediculosis, leukoderma, café au lait spots, atrophic scar, cicatricial alopecia, hypertrophic scar, pityriasis alba, papular urticaria, xerosis and impetigo.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of skin diseases, especially of trauma-related disorders and infections, may be mainly attributable to a lack of appropriate health awareness and care, which has created a tendency within the population to adapt without complaining or seeking medical help. Such circumstances, unfortunately, have resulted in a growing community of silent patients.","['El-Khateeb EA', 'Lotfi RA', 'Abd Elaziz KM', 'El-Shiekh SE']",2014,53,5,Int J Dermatol,"El-Khateeb EA, et al.

24696436,Disease manifestations and pathogenic mechanisms of Group A Streptococcus.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), causes mild human infections such as pharyngitis and impetigo and serious infections such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Furthermore, repeated GAS infections may trigger autoimmune diseases, including acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Combined, these diseases account for over half a million deaths per year globally. Genomic and molecular analyses have now characterized a large number of GAS virulence determinants, many of which exhibit overlap and redundancy in the processes of adhesion and colonization, innate immune resistance, and the capacity to facilitate tissue barrier degradation and spread within the human host. This improved understanding of the contribution of individual virulence determinants to the disease process has led to the formulation of models of GAS disease progression, which may lead to better treatment and intervention strategies. While GAS remains sensitive to all penicillins and cephalosporins, rising resistance to other antibiotics used in disease treatment is an increasing worldwide concern. Several GAS vaccine formulations that elicit protective immunity in animal models have shown promise in nonhuman primate and early-stage human trials. The development of a safe and efficacious commercial human vaccine for the prophylaxis of GAS disease remains a high priority.","['Walker MJ', 'Barnett TC', 'McArthur JD', 'Cole JN', 'Gillen CM', 'Henningham A', 'Sriprakash KS', 'Sanderson-Smith ML', 'Nizet V']",2014,27,2,Clin Microbiol Rev,"Walker MJ, et al.

24655406,The clinical and molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus infections in Fiji.,"BACKGROUND: There are few data describing the microbiology and genetic typing of Staphylococcus aureus that cause infections in developing countries.
METHODS: In this study we observed S. aureus infections in Pacific Island nation of Fiji in both the community and hospital setting with an emphasis on clonal complex (CC) genotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: S. aureus was commonly found in impetigo lesions of school children and was recovered from 57% of impetigo lesions frequently in conjunction with group A streptococcal infection. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) comprised 7% (20/299) of isolates and were all non-multi-resistant and all genotyped as CC1. In contrast, there was a diverse selection of 17 CCs among the 105 genotyped methicillin-susceptible S.aureus (MSSA) strains. Isolates of the rare, phylogenetically divergent and non-pigmented CC75 lineage (also called S. argenteus) were found in Fiji.From hospitalized patients the available 36 MRSA isolates from a 9-month period were represented by five CCs. The most common CCs were CC1 and CC239. CC1 is likely to be a community-acquired strain, reflecting what was found in the school children, whereas the CC239 is the very successful multi-drug resistant MRSA nosocomial lineage. Of 17 MSSA isolates, 59% carried genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The S. aureus bacteraemia incidence rate of 50 per 100,000 population is among the highest reported in the literature and likely reflects the high overall burden of staphylococcal infections in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus is an important cause of disease in Fiji and there is considerable genotypic diversity in community skin infections in Fijian schoolchildren. Community acquired- (CA)- MRSA is present at a relatively low prevalence (6.7%) and was solely to CC1 (CA-MRSA). The globally successful CC239 is also a significant pathogen in Fiji.","['Jenney A', 'Holt D', 'Ritika R', 'Southwell P', 'Pravin S', 'Buadromo E', 'Carapetis J', 'Tong S', 'Steer A']",2014,14,,BMC Infect Dis,"Jenney A, et al.

It is currently unclear what percentage of SSTIs is caused by community-associated MRSA in different regions in Canada.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of MRSA in children presenting to a pediatric emergency department with SSTI, and to determine which antibiotics were used to treat these infections.
METHODS: All visits to a pediatric emergency department were reviewed from April 15, 2010 to April 14, 2011. Diagnoses of cellulitis, abscess, impetigo, folliculitis and skin infection (not otherwise specified) were reviewed in detail to determine whether a culture was taken and which antibiotic was prescribed.
RESULTS: There were 367 cases of SSTI diagnosed over the study period. Forty-five (12.3%) patients had lesions that were swabbed for culture and sensitivity. S aureus was the most common organism found, with 14 (66%) methicillin-sensitive cases and seven (33%) methicillin-resistant cases. Of the seven cases of MRSA identified, only one patient had clear risk factors for hospital-acquired MRSA. First-generation cephalosporins were initially prescribed for 280 (76%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of MRSA in the population presenting to a pediatric emergency department in Newfoundland and Labrador appeared to be low, although only a small percentage of infections were cultured. At this time, there appears to be no need to change empirical antibiotic coverage, which remains a first-generation cephalosporin.","['Peebles E', 'Morris R', 'Chafe R']",2014,25,1,Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,"Peebles E, et al.

24628985,Skin and soft tissue infections following marine injuries and exposures in travelers.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in travelers often follow insect bites and can present a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from impetigo to necrotizing cellulitis. Significant SSTIs can also follow marine injuries and exposures in travelers, and the etiologies are often marine bacteria.
METHODS: To meet the objectives of describing the pathogen-specific presenting clinical manifestations, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and outcomes of superficial and deep invasive infections in travelers caused by commonly encountered and newly emerging marine bacterial pathogens, Internet search engines were queried with the key words as MESH terms.
RESULTS: Travel medicine practitioners should maintain a high index of suspicion regarding potentially catastrophic, invasive bacterial infections, especially Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio vulnificus, Chromobacterium violaceum, and Shewanella infections, following marine injuries and exposures.
CONCLUSIONS: Travelers with well-known risk factors for the increasing severity of marine infections, including those with open wounds, suppressed immune systems, liver disease, alcoholism, hemochromatosis, hematological disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and cancer, should be cautioned about the risks of marine infections through exposures to marine animals, seawater, the preparation of live or freshly killed seafood, and the accidental ingestion of seawater or consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish. With the exception of minor marine wounds demonstrating localized cellulitis or spreading erysipeloid-type reactions, most other marine infections and all Gram-negative and mycobacterial marine infections will require therapy with antibiotic combinations.",['Diaz JH'],2014,21,3,J Travel Med,Diaz JH.

Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy.,"A previously healthy 8-month-old Hispanic boy presented with a 5-day history of an erythematous, non-pruritic papular eruption on both legs. The eruption was initially diagnosed as impetigo by his primary care practitioner but progressed despite trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole therapy, with extension to the face, trunk, and all extremities. When the patient subsequently developed a fever of 100.8° F, emesis, diarrhea, and upper respiratory symptoms, he was referred to the pediatric dermatology clinic for evaluation. Further questioning revealed a 3-day febrile illness 6 weeks prior to presentation that was treated with ceftriaxone. Review of systems failed to identify any hematuria, blood in stool, or abdominal pain, but the parents did report swelling of the extremities and face, as well as decreased oral intake. On examination, the infant was in no apparent distress, afebrile, and had mild rhinorrhea. His mucous membranes were unaffected, and no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Cutaneous exam revealed numerous edematous erythematous to violaceous plaques on the cheeks, arms, buttocks, and legs with minimal involvement of the trunk. Several lesions on the arms had a distinct cockade (rosette or iris-like) pattern. There were no vesicles, bullae, or necrosis. Edema of the bilateral lower extremities was noted. Laboratory work up revealed a normal complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, creatinine, and urinalysis. Platelets were borderline elevated at 439 TH/μL (140-440 TH/μL), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) were minimally elevated at 22 mm (0-15 mm) and 3.1 mg/dL (0.0-0.99 mg/dL), respectively.","['Sorensen EP', 'Matiz C', 'Friedlander SF']",2014,43,1,Pediatr Ann,"Sorensen EP, et al.

24456348,Evidence-based primary care treatment guidelines for skin infections in Europe: a comparative analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In Europe, most antibiotics for human use are prescribed in primary care. Incorporating resistance data into treatment guidelines could improve appropriate prescribing, increase treatment effectiveness and control the development of resistance.
OBJECTIVES: This study reviews primary care treatment guidelines for bacterial skin infections across Europe and assesses to what extent they are based on antibiotic resistance data.
METHODS: Thirteen primary care treatment guidelines were obtained from eight countries across Europe. Both the treatment recommendations and the underlying evidence were assessed. The class and dose of recommended antibiotics were investigated and compared using the World Health Organisation's standardized volume of Defined Daily Dose. Furthermore, analysis investigated whether guidelines included references to scientific publications about antibiotic resistance data, and whether these were of national origin.
RESULTS: Guidelines were included regarding common skin infections in primary care: Impetigo, Cellulitis, Erysipelas, Folliculitis and Furuncle. RESULTS showed a high agreement across Europe: all recommended antibiotics are of the beta-lactam class and mainly in the small spectrum. The advised treatment durations are consistent; the dosages, however, vary considerably, with the highest dosages recommended in Sweden. Seven guidelines (54%) did not include scientific references related to resistance.
CONCLUSION: There may be a lack of relevant national data on resistance. This study highlights the need to collect more national resistance data (particularly regarding beta-lactams) to create stronger evidence-based treatment guidelines for skin infections in Europe.","['van Bijnen EM', 'Paget J', 'den Heijer CD', 'Stobberingh EE', 'Bruggeman CA', 'Schellevis FG', 'APRES study team']",2014,20,4,Eur J Gen Pract,"van Bijnen EM, et al.

24449444,An antimicrobial role for zinc in innate immune defense against group A streptococcus.,"BACKGROUND: Zinc plays an important role in human immunity, and it is known that zinc deficiency in the host is linked to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. In this study, we investigate the role of zinc efflux in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]), a human pathogen responsible for superficial infections, such as pharyngitis and impetigo, and severe invasive infections.
METHODS: The clinically important M1T1 wild-type strain was used in this study, and isogenic mutants were constructed with deletions in the czcD gene (Spy0653; which encodes a putative zinc efflux pump) and adjacent gczA gene (Spy0654; which encodes a putative zinc-dependent activator of czcD). Wild-type, isogenic mutants and complemented strains were tested for resistance against zinc stress, intracellular zinc accumulation, and virulence.
RESULTS: Both czcD and gczA mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to zinc. Transcriptional analyses indicate that GczA upregulates czcD in response to zinc. Both mutants displayed increased susceptibility to human neutrophil killing and reduced virulence in a murine infection model. Furthermore, we showed that neutrophils mobilize zinc in response to GAS.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the innate immune system may use zinc as an antimicrobial agent and that zinc efflux is an important contributor to GAS pathogenesis.","['Ong CL', 'Gillen CM', 'Barnett TC', 'Walker MJ', 'McEwan AG']",2014,209,10,J Infect Dis,"Ong CL, et al.

24440616,Antibiotic prescription strategies for acute sore throat: a prospective observational cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Data from trials suggest that antibiotics reduce the risk of complications of sore throat by at least 50%, but few trials for complications have been done in modern settings, and datasets of delayed antibiotic prescription are underpowered. Observational evidence is important in view of poor compliance with antibiotic treatment outside trials, but no prospective observational cohort studies have been done to date.
METHODS: We generated a large prospective cohort from the DESCARTE study, and the PRISM component of DESCARTE, of 12,829 adults presenting with sore throat (≤ 2 weeks duration) in primary care. Our follow-up of the cohort was based on a detailed and structured review of routine medical records, and analysis of the comparison of three antibiotic prescription strategies (no antibiotic prescription, immediate antibiotic prescription, and delayed antibiotic prescription) to control for the propensity to prescribe antibiotics. Information about antibiotic prescription was recorded in 12,677 individuals (4805 prescribed no antibiotics, 6088 prescribed antibiotics immediately, and 1784 prescribed delayed antibiotics). We documented by review of patients' notes (n=11,950) the development of suppurative complications (eg, quinsy, impetigo and cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis) or reconsultation with new or non-resolving symptoms). We used multivariate analysis to control for variables significantly related to the propensity to prescribe antibiotics and for clustering by general practitioner.
FINDINGS: 164 (1.4%) of the 11,950 patients with information available developed complications; otitis media and sinusitis were the most common complications (101 patients [62%]). Compared with no antibiotic prescription, immediate antibiotic prescription was associated with fewer complications (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.91, estimated number needed to treat [NNT 193) as was delayed prescription of antibiotics (0.58, 0.34-0.98; NNT 174). 1787 of the 11,950 patients (15%) reconsulted with new or non-resolving symptoms; the risk of reconsultation was also reduced by immediate (0.83, 0.73-0.94; NNT 40) or delayed antibiotics (0.61, 0.50-0.74; NNT 18).
INTERPRETATION: Suppurative complications are not common in primary care and most are not serious. The risks of suppurative complications or reconsultation in adults are reduced by antibiotics, but not as much as the trial evidence suggests. In most cases, no antibiotic is needed, but a delayed prescription strategy is likely to provide similar benefits to an immediate antibiotic prescription.","['Little P', 'Stuart B', 'Hobbs FD', 'Butler CC', 'Hay AD', 'Delaney B', 'Campbell J', 'Broomfield S', 'Barratt P', 'Hood K', 'Everitt H', 'Mullee M', 'Williamson I', 'Mant D', 'Moore M', 'DESCARTE investigators']",2014,14,3,Lancet Infect Dis,"Little P, et al.

24420805,Six children with allergic contact dermatitis to methylisothiazolinone in wet wipes (baby wipes).,"Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) is a combination preservative used in personal care and household products and is a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Recently, MI alone, without MCI, has been increasingly used in consumer products in attempts to minimize allergic reactions. Wet wipes are extensively tested and traditionally believed to be innocuous. MI in wet wipes (""baby wipes"") has not been previously reported to cause ACD in children in the United States. Only 1 previous report of ACD in a child in Belgium has been recently reported. We report 6 children with chronic, perianal/buttock, and facial eczematous dermatitis, refractory to multiple topical and oral antibiotics and corticosteroids. All tested positive to MCI/MI on patch testing. None wore diapers. All patients had been using wet wipes containing MI (without MCI) to affected areas. Discontinuation of wipes resulted in rapid and complete resolution. This is the first report of pediatric ACD to MI in wet wipes in the United States, and the largest series to date. ACD to MI in wet wipes is frequently misdiagnosed as eczema, impetigo, or psoriasis. Wet wipes are increasingly marketed in personal care products for all ages, and MI exposure and sensitization will likely increase. Dermatitis of the perianal, buttock, facial, and hand areas with a history of wet wipe use should raise suspicion of ACD to MI and prompt appropriate patch testing. Rapid resolution occurs after the allergen exposure is eliminated. All isothiozolinones should be avoided in personal care and household products for these patients.","['Chang MW', 'Nakrani R']",2014,133,2,Pediatrics,Chang MW and Nakrani R.

24359576,Which patients with dermatological conditions are admitted via the emergency department?,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most dermatology admissions to tertiary hospitals in Australia are initially assessed in the emergency department (ED). This 3-year retrospective study examined the types of dermatological conditions that necessitated admission, the factors that predicted admission and the implications for dermatological resource allocation.
METHODS: The ED database was searched using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10(th) revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes and keywords in the presenting complaint and triage notes fields. The two lists were then merged and duplicates removed. All admissions were analysed and the medical records of admissions to the dermatology unit were reviewed to determine their final diagnosis.
RESULTS: In total, 4817 patients with dermatological conditions presented over the 3-year period. Of these, 937 (20%) required admission, of whom 108 (12%) were admitted under the dermatology unit. The most common conditions requiring admission were cellulitis (n = 534, 56%), boils, furuncles and pilonidal sinuses (n = 183, 19%), and non-specific skin infections (n = 32, 3%). The most common conditions admitted under dermatology were psoriasis (n = 27, 25%), eczema (n = 25, 23%), and cellulitis (n = 16, 15%). Key predictors of admission were Australasian triage code, referral by a health-care professional or corrections officer and arrival by ambulance.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of dermatological presentations required admission, mostly for infective processes that did not require specific dermatological care. The predictors of admission reflect the severity of the condition and patients demonstrating these predictors should be referred to the Dermatology unit for admission.","['Lai-Kwon JE', 'Weiland TJ', 'Jelinek GA', 'Chong AH']",2014,55,4,Australas J Dermatol,"Lai-Kwon JE, et al.

24315220,[Treatment of superficial bacterial cutaneous infections: a survey among general practitioners in France].,"BACKGROUND: Superficial bacterial skin infection and superinfection of skin diseases are usually treated by general practitioners using antiseptics or antibiotics. However, acquired resistance to biocidal agents, both systemic and topical, is growing.
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Our aim was to assess the skill of GPs in clinical situations involving common skin infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 16 June 2010, we sent a questionnaire to all GPs in a rural region of France (the Cher department) together with a stamped addressed envelope for the reply. The questionnaire contained seven pages of multiple-choice questions and five clinical cases, each one illustrated with a photograph (sty, furuncle, whitlow, colonized chronic wounds and impetigo). Anonymity of responses was guaranteed. Data was analysed using the Clinsight(®) software package.
RESULTS: The response rate was 51% (102 responses). GPs reported little difficulty in treating these patients (median 3, range 1 to 8 on a scale of increasing difficulty from 0 to 10). The main results of the study are firstly the frequency of combination of at least one antiseptic with one antibiotic (46%); secondly, the frequency of combination of two antibiotics (20% of cases); thirdly, the frequent prescription of systemic antibiotics for chronic wounds colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (61%).
DISCUSSION: Our study shows the high frequency of prescriptions for combined therapy to treat superficial skin infections despite the fact that monotherapy with either an antiseptic or an antibiotic would probably suffice. It also shows the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics for colonization of a chronic wound. The study was limited in terms of size and design: it was a questionnaire rather than an analysis of prescriptions actually made in ""real life"", and the response rate was 51%. In addition, aside from impetigo, for which randomised studies and recommendations were given, the other surface infections (sty, folliculitis, whitlow) tend to be treated more empirically.
CONCLUSION: Dissemination of recommendations regarding the respective role of antiseptics and antibiotics (and their route of administration, topical or systemic) in superficial skin infections would doubtless be useful for prescribers, and more rational use of these agents would help limit bacterial resistance.","['Fourtillan E', 'Tauveron V', 'Binois R', 'Lehr-Drylewicz AM', 'Machet L']",2013,140,12,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Fourtillan E, et al.

24277339,Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: prospective clinical cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To document whether elements of a structured history and examination predict adverse outcome of acute sore throat.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical cohort.
SETTING: Primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: 14,610 adults with acute sore throat (≤ 2 weeks' duration).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Common suppurative complications (quinsy or peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, impetigo or cellulitis) and reconsultation with new or unresolving symptoms within one month.
RESULTS: Complications were assessed reliably (inter-rater κ=0.95). 1.3% (177/13,445) of participants developed complications overall and 14.2% (1889/13,288) reconsulted with new or unresolving symptoms. Independent predictors of complications were severe tonsillar inflammation (documented among 13.0% (1652/12,717); odds ratio 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.89) and severe earache (5% (667/13,323); 3.02, 1.91 to 4.76), but the model including both variables had modest prognostic utility (bootstrapped area under the receiver operator curve 0.61, 0.57 to 0.65), and 70% of complications (124/177) occurred when neither was present. Clinical prediction rules for bacterial infection (Centor criteria and FeverPAIN) also predicted complications, but predictive values were also poor and most complications occurred with low scores (67% (118/175) scoring ≤ 2 for Centor; 126/173 (73%) scoring ≤ 2 for FeverPAIN). Previous medical problems, sex, temperature, and muscle aches were independently but weakly associated with reconsultation with new or unresolving symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Important suppurative complications after an episode of acute sore throat in primary care are uncommon. History and examination and scores to predict bacterial infection cannot usefully identify those who will develop complications. Clinicians will need to rely on strategies such as safety netting or delayed prescription in managing the uncertainty and low risk of complications.","['Little P', 'Stuart B', 'Hobbs FD', 'Butler CC', 'Hay AD', 'Campbell J', 'Delaney B', 'Broomfield S', 'Barratt P', 'Hood K', 'Everitt H', 'Mullee M', 'Williamson I', 'Mant D', 'Moore M', 'DESCARTE investigators']",2013,347,,BMJ,"Little P, et al.

24257256,[Pediatric case series in an ophthalmic camp in Turkana (Kenya)].,"INTRODUCTION: Turkana is the largest district in Kenya, situated in the Northwest of the country. It features a semi-nomadic population of 850,000. Around 60% of population lives below the poverty threshold. The ratio of doctors is 1:75,000 inhabitants. Five ophthalmologists took part in the last deployment in November. Local staff had previously selected the patients from the rural areas, as well as in Lodwar, the capital of the district. Of the 371 patients who attended the clinic, 128 required surgery.
OBJETIVE: To describe the pediatric population attended to in the last «Turkana Eye Project» Camp.
METHODS: Description of the ophthalmic pathologies of the children seen in the clinic in this surgical camp, and the diagnostic and therapeutic options according to the limitations of the environment.
RESULTS: Of the 371 patients, 54 were younger than 15 years old (14.5%). Four children had surgery (3.25% of the 128 patients). In 2 more cases surgery was the indicated but not performed. Therefore, of the total of 54 cases, 6 could be considered as surgical (11.1%), and 17 suffered ophthalmic problems other than refraction defects, or mild ocular surface pathologies: traumatic cataracts, neuropathies, impetigo, exophthalmos, retinal dystrophies, dermoid cysts, or nyctalopia. The etiology was traumatic in four of the 17 children (23.5%).
CONCLUSION: Surgical camps are increasing in the developing countries. They are usually focused on particular pathologies, such as cataracts or trachoma.

24166134,The global burden of skin disease in 2010: an analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions.,"The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2010 estimated the GBD attributable to 15 categories of skin disease from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries. For each of the following diseases, we performed systematic literature reviews and analyzed resulting data: eczema, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, pruritus, alopecia areata, decubitus ulcer, urticaria, scabies, fungal skin diseases, impetigo, abscess, and other bacterial skin diseases, cellulitis, viral warts, molluscum contagiosum, and non-melanoma skin cancer. We used disability estimates to determine nonfatal burden. Three skin conditions, fungal skin diseases, other skin and subcutaneous diseases, and acne were in the top 10 most prevalent diseases worldwide in 2010, and eight fell into the top 50; these additional five skin problems were pruritus, eczema, impetigo, scabies, and molluscum contagiosum. Collectively, skin conditions ranged from the 2nd to 11th leading cause of years lived with disability at the country level. At the global level, skin conditions were the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden. Using more data than has been used previously, the burden due to these diseases is enormous in both high- and low-income countries. These results argue strongly to include skin disease prevention and treatment in future global health strategies as a matter of urgency.","['Hay RJ', 'Johns NE', 'Williams HC', 'Bolliger IW', 'Dellavalle RP', 'Margolis DJ', 'Marks R', 'Naldi L', 'Weinstock MA', 'Wulf SK', 'Michaud C', 'J L Murray C', 'Naghavi M']",2014,134,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Hay RJ, et al.

24157731,The contribution of group A streptococcal virulence determinants to the pathogenesis of sepsis.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is responsible for a wide range of pathologies ranging from mild pharyngitis and impetigo to severe invasive soft tissue infections. Despite the continuing susceptibility of the bacterium to β-lactam antibiotics there has been an unexplained resurgence in the prevalence of invasive GAS infection over the past 30 years. Of particular importance was the emergence of a GAS-associated sepsis syndrome that is analogous to the systemic toxicosis associated with TSST-1 producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Despite being recognized for over 20 years, the etiology of GAS associated sepsis and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remains poorly understood. Here we review the virulence factors that contribute to the etiology of GAS associated sepsis with a particular focus on coagulation system interactions and the role of the superantigens in the development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.","['Reglinski M', 'Sriskandan S']",2014,5,1,Virulence,Reglinski M and Sriskandan S.

24126747,Registered nurse assessment and treatment of skin sepsis in New Zealand schools: the development of protocols.,"BACKGROUND: Skin infection is the commonest medical cause of hospitalisation in school children. Disadvantaged children, usually Maori or Pacific, have high rates of preventable diseases.
AIM: To improve access to early treatment for skin infections using nurse-led school clinics in South Auckland, including provision of antibiotics under delegated standing orders.
METHOD: Evidence-based protocols for the recognition and treatment of skin sepsis were developed following a literature search. A training package was developed for health professionals involved and outcome data were collected from a pilot study in which the protocols were trialled.
RESULTS: An algorithm for diagnosis of skin infections was adapted from Steer et al (Bull World Health Organ. 2009;87:173-9). Fusidic acid ointment was recommended as first-line treatment for localised impetigo. Twice daily oral cephalexin was recommended for extensive impetigo and cellulitis, for palatability and simplicity of dosing. Fifty-six episodes of skin infection received treatment under standing orders in the first 15 weeks of the pilot study.
CONCLUSION: Robust evidence to determine optimal choice, dosage and duration of antibiotic therapy for skin sepsis in children is lacking. The algorithms described are consistent with available evidence and provide a pragmatic approach for use in registered nurse (RN)-led school clinics.","['Vogel AM', 'Lennon DR', 'Gray S', 'Farrell E', 'Anderson P']",2013,126,1380,N Z Med J,"Vogel AM, et al.

The majority of such infections are simple and can be easily treated with antibiotics and appropriate infection control practices. Some, however, can progress to become complex and even life threatening, such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-associated staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, or Streptococcus pyogenes necrotising fasciitis, which carry a mortality rate of up to 65% and 30%, respectively. This review focuses on the most important SSTIs and those more commonly affecting military personnel with advice on how they are best managed.","['Lamb L', 'Morgan M']",2013,159,3,J R Army Med Corps,Lamb L and Morgan M.

24080652,Emergence of Staphylococcus aureus carrying multiple drug resistance genes on a plasmid encoding exfoliative toxin B.,"We report the complete nucleotide sequence and analysis of pETBTY825, a Staphylococcus aureus TY825 plasmid encoding exfoliative toxin B (ETB). S. aureus TY825 is a clinical isolate obtained from an impetigo patient in 2002. The size of pETBTY825, 60.6 kbp, was unexpectedly larger than that of the archetype pETBTY4 (∼30 kbp). Genomic comparison of the plasmids shows that pETBTY825 has the archetype pETBTY4 as the backbone and has a single large extra DNA region of 22.4 kbp. The extra DNA region contains genes for resistance to aminoglycoside [aac(6')/aph(2″)], macrolide (msrA), and penicillin (blaZ). A plasmid deletion experiment indicated that these three resistance elements were functionally active. We retrospectively examined the resistance profile of the clinical ETB-producing S. aureus strains isolated in 1977 to 2007 using a MIC determination with gentamicin (GM), arbekacin (ABK), and erythromycin (EM) and by PCR analyses for aac(6')/aph(2″) and msrA using purified plasmid preparations. The ETB-producing S. aureus strains began to display high resistance to GM, which was parallel with the detection of aac(6')/aph(2″) and mecA, after 1990. Conversely, there was no significant change in the ABK MIC during the testing period, although it had a tendency to slightly increase. After 2001, isolates resistant to EM significantly increased; however, msrA was hardly detected in ETB-producing S. aureus strains, and only five isolates were positive for both aac(6')/aph(2″) and msrA. In this study, we report the emergence of a fusion plasmid carrying the toxin gene etb and drug resistance genes. Prevalence of the pETBTY825 carrier may further increase the clinical threat, since ETB-producing S. aureus is closely related to more severe impetigo or staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), which requires a general antimicrobial treatment.","['Hisatsune J', 'Hirakawa H', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Fudaba Y', 'Oshima K', 'Hattori M', 'Kato F', 'Kayama S', 'Sugai M']",2013,57,12,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Hisatsune J, et al.

A matched case-control study using the General Practice Research Database.,"BACKGROUND: Data to support the hypothesis of a relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and allergies are conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether children with ADHD are more likely to have a history of atopic disorders, skin infections, and medical prescriptions than children without ADHD.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study among boys using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Cases were defined as children with first-time diagnosis of ADHD who were treated with methylphenidate. Four controls who had neither ADHD nor ADHD drug prescriptions in their medical records were matched to each case on age and general practice.
RESULTS: We identified 884 boys with a first-time diagnosis of drug-treated ADHD and 3,536 controls. The independent odds ratios adjusted for age and presence of low birth weight or preterm delivery were 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.7; P < .001) for a medical history of asthma, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.9; P < .001) for impetigo, and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7; P < .001) for any antihistamine drug prescriptions. Other exposures that were more common in cases than controls, though not independently, were cow's milk intolerance and any prescription from the drug categories antiasthmatics, respiratory corticosteroids, topical steroids, antibacterials, or antifungals.
CONCLUSION: Despite possible limitations inherent to observational studies, this study lends support to the emerging evidence that childhood ADHD is associated with atopic diseases and impetigo. Further interdisciplinary research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate targeted preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions.","['Hak E', 'de Vries TW', 'Hoekstra PJ', 'Jick SS']",2013,111,2,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Hak E, et al.

METHOD: A pilot public health nurse (PHN)-led clinic was set up in a South Auckland primary school (roll approximately 400). The clinic was based on a previous sore throat clinic model with modifications aimed at improving programme feasibility and effectiveness. The timely identification and treatment of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) throat infections to prevent rheumatic fever (RF), and the prevention and treatment of four skin infections (cellulitis, impetigo, infected eczema and scabies) were the focus. The pilot ran for 15 weeks from April to July 2011. Evaluation included documentation review, key school and healthcare stakeholder interviews and parent questionnaires.
RESULTS: The consent rate was 92.2%. Of a total 722 throat swabs taken from 337 students, 94 were GAS positive. Ninety-eight assessments of skin conditions were completed at which 76 had a skin infection diagnosed, the most common infection being impetigo (n=46). Thirty-one skin infections were diagnosed in the first week of the pilot. PHN workload was high with a total of 539 phone calls, 137 home visits and 51 school-based parent consultations. The approach was highly acceptable to the majority of key stakeholders. Extrapolating pilot costs results in an estimated annual cost of $510 per student for the programme.
CONCLUSION: It is likely to be both acceptable and feasible to take this model of delivering targeted primary health care to school aged children and use it on a larger scale. The complexity of providing this type of service should not be underestimated and it is essential that robust processes are in place to ensure smooth, safe running of such a programme. Long-term outcome evaluation will be vital to assess programme effectiveness.","['Gray S', 'Lennon D', 'Anderson P', 'Stewart J', 'Farrell E']",2013,126,1373,N Z Med J,"Gray S, et al.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of pediatric patients who presented with atypical cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) from July 2011 to June 2012 at 7 academic pediatric dermatology centers. Patients were included if they tested positive for CVA6 or if they met clinical criteria for atypical HFMD (an enanthem or exanthem characteristic of HFMD with unusual morphology or extent of cutaneous findings). We collected demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data including history of skin conditions, morphology and extent of exanthem, systemic symptoms, and diagnostic test results.
RESULTS: Eighty patients were included in this study (median age 1.5 years, range 4 months-16 years). Seventeen patients were CVA6-positive, and 63 met clinical inclusion criteria. Ninety-nine percent of patients exhibited a vesiculobullous and erosive eruption; 61% of patients had rash involving >10% body surface area. The exanthem had a perioral, extremity, and truncal distribution in addition to involving classic HFMD areas such as palms, soles, and buttocks. In 55% of patients, the eruption was accentuated in areas of eczematous dermatitis, termed ""eczema coxsackium."" Other morphologies included Gianotti-Crosti-like (37%), petechial/purpuric (17%) eruptions, and delayed onychomadesis and palm and sole desquamation. There were no patients with serious systemic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The CVA6-associated enterovirus outbreak was responsible for an exanthem potentially more widespread, severe, and varied than classic HFMD that could be confused with bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, vasculitis, and primary immunobullous disease.","['Mathes EF', 'Oza V', 'Frieden IJ', 'Cordoro KM', 'Yagi S', 'Howard R', 'Kristal L', 'Ginocchio CC', 'Schaffer J', 'Maguiness S', 'Bayliss S', 'Lara-Corrales I', 'Garcia-Romero MT', 'Kelly D', 'Salas M', 'Oberste MS', 'Nix WA', 'Glaser C', 'Antaya R']",2013,132,1,Pediatrics,"Mathes EF, et al.

23712060,Functional tight junction barrier localizes in the second layer of the stratum granulosum of human epidermis.,"BACKGROUND: Mammalian epidermis has two diffusion barriers, the stratum corneum (SC) and tight junctions (TJs). We reported previously that a single living cell layer exists between the SC and TJ-forming keratinocytes in mice; however, the exact location of the TJ barrier in human epidermis has not been defined.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the precise distribution of epidermal TJs in relation to various cell-cell junction proteins and the SC and to clarify the barrier function of TJs against macromolecules in human skin.
METHODS: The localization of various junctional proteins was investigated in human skin sections and in the roofs of bullae formed by ex vivo exfoliative toxin (ET) treatment in three dimensions. ET and single-chain variable fragments (scFv) against desmoglein 1 were used as large diffusion probes.
RESULTS: Human stratum granulosum (SG) cells have a distinct distribution of TJ, adherens junction, and desmosome proteins in the uppermost three layers (SG1-SG3 from the surface inward). Ex vivo injection of ET or scFv demonstrated that only SG2-SG2 junctions function as a TJ barrier, limiting the inside-out diffusion of these proteins. The roofs of bullae formed by ex vivo ET treatment consisted of SC, SG1 cells, and TJ-forming SG2 cells, probably mimicking bulla formation in bullous impetigo.
CONCLUSION: Human epidermis has three SG cell layers with distinct properties just beneath the SC, of which only SG2 cells have functional TJs. Our results suggest that human epidermal TJs between SG2 cells form a paracellular diffusion barrier against soluble proteins, including immunoglobulins and bacterial toxins.","['Yoshida K', 'Yokouchi M', 'Nagao K', 'Ishii K', 'Amagai M', 'Kubo A']",2013,71,2,J Dermatol Sci,"Yoshida K, et al.

23683754,"[Skin and soft-tissue infections in hospitalized patients: epidemiology, microbiological, clinical and prognostic factors].","INTRODUCTION: Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are a frequent cause of consultation in emergence services, and complicated cases require hospitalization. However there are few data in our setting about the clinical characteristics of these infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital admitted patients with a diagnosis of folliculitis, cellulitis, erysipelas, abscesses, hidradenitis, furuncle, impetigo, fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene. Cases were extracted from the data base of diagnostic codes of the Archive and Clinical Documentation Department of Son Llàtzer Hospital from January 2002 to November 2011.
RESULTS: We studied 996 episodes in 841 hospitalized patients with any diagnosis of SSTIs. Cellulitis/erysipelas (66.7%) was the most frequently diagnosed condition, with 77% of all SSTIs being community acquired, and the majority of patients had comorbidities, mainly diabetes (33%) and heart failure (17.7%). The most frequent isolated microorganism was S.aureus (35.1%), in 19 (12.9%) cases with methicillin-resistance (MRSA), 84.2% of them were nosocomial or health care acquired. Monotherapy with aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid was the empiric treatment most frequently used (35.5%). New antibiotics for Gram-positive cocci (linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline) were used in patients with comorbidities that presented more complications (P<.001) and more risk of mortality (P=.001). During admission 10.9% of patients died, but only in 2.7% of them mortality was related to the SSTIs.
CONCLUSIONS: SSTIs attended most frequently in hospitalized patients are mainly cellulitis/erysipela, the majority community acquired. MRSA infections are mainly health care related. Use of new antibiotic for Gram-positive cocci was limited.","['Raya-Cruz M', 'Ferullo I', 'Arrizabalaga-Asenjo M', 'Nadal-Nadal A', 'Díaz-Antolín MP', 'Garau-Colom M', 'Payeras-Cifre A']",2014,32,3,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"Raya-Cruz M, et al.

23652836,Galleria mellonella larvae as an infection model for group A streptococcus.,"Group A streptococcus is a strict human pathogen that can cause a wide range of diseases, such as tonsillitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock, and acute rheumatic fever. Modeling human diseases in animals is complicated, and rapid, simple, and cost-effective in vivo models of GAS infection are clearly lacking. Recently, the use of non-mammalian models to model human disease is starting to re-attract attention. Galleria mellonella larvae, also known as wax worms, have been investigated for modeling a number of bacterial pathogens, and have been shown to be a useful model to study pathogenesis of the M3 serotype of GAS. In this study we provide further evidence of the validity of the wax worm model by testing different GAS M-types, as well as investigating the effect of bacterial growth phase and incubation temperature on GAS virulence in this model. In contrast to previous studies, we show that the M-protein, among others, is an important virulence factor that can be effectively modeled in the wax worm. We also highlight the need for a more in-depth investigation of the effects of experimental design and wax worm supply before we can properly vindicate the wax worm model for studying GAS pathogenesis.","['Loh JM', 'Adenwalla N', 'Wiles S', 'Proft T']",2013,4,5,Virulence,"Loh JM, et al.

Clinical and histological features were typical of impetigo herpetiformis (IH). Systemic steroids resulted in an unstable condition, with no resolution of lesions. Resistance to the above therapeutic scheme served as a stimulus to discuss the use of cyclosporine as a therapeutic option in this condition. Reviewing the limited literature, cyclosporine seems to serve not as a monotherapy in the management of IH but as an additional medication, in order to achieve a stable course of the disease and avoid high doses of systemic steroids.","['Patsatsi A', 'Theodoridis TD', 'Vavilis D', 'Tzevelekis V', 'Kyriakou A', 'Kalabalikis D', 'Sotiriadis D']",2013,5,1,Case Rep Dermatol,"Patsatsi A, et al.

23621731,[Distribution of emm genotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes strains: analogy with the vaccine in development].,"Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common bacterial pathogen causing pharyngotonsillitis, and also can lead to diseases such as otitis media, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia, sepsis and toxic shock-like syndrome. M protein encoded by emm gene is an important virulence factor of S.pyogenes and it is used for genotyping in epidemiological studies. The aims of this study were to determine the M protein types of group A streptococci (GAS) by using emm gene sequence analysis method, to compare the M types in terms of analogy with the vaccine in development and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates. A total of 35 GAS strains isolated from various clinical specimens in our laboratory were included in the study. Strains growing in blood culture were considered as invasive, strains growing in throat and abscess cultures were considered as non-invasive. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and 16S rRNA sequence analysis at species level. emm genotyping of strains identified as S.pyogenes, was performed by PCR method as proposed by the CDC. Amplicons were obtained and sequenced in 23 out of 35 isolates. The results were compared with CDC emm sequence database. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was performed by agar dilution method and evaluated as recommended by CLSI. Twenty-three out of 35 isolates could be typed and 15 different emm genotypes were detected. The most common emm types were emm1 (22%), emm89 (13%), emm18 (9%) and emm19 (9%). The detection rate of other emm types (emm5, 12, 14, 17, 26, 29, 37, 74, 78, 92, 99) was 47%. Types emm1, 12, 19, 74, 89 and 99 were observed in strains isolated from blood cultures. It was detected that nine of the 15 (60%) emm types are within the contents of 26 valent vaccine (emm 1, 5, 12, 14, 18, 19, 29, 89, 92). It was also observed that 17 (74%) of the 23 cases were infected by vaccine types and the four emm types (emm1, 12, 19, 89) identified in blood samples were among the vaccine types. All of the strains were found susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, lincomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin and linezolid, however six isolates were resistant to levofloxacin (MIC= 4 and 16 µg/ml) and one isolate was resistant to tetracycline (MIC= 16 µg/ml). In conclusion, this preliminary local study with limited number of invasive and non-invasive S.pyogenes isolates, emphasized the need for larger scale multi-center studies to determine the analogy and efficacy of the vaccine in development.","['Arslan U', 'Oryaşın E', 'Eskin Z', 'Türk Dağı H', 'Fındık D', 'Tuncer I', 'Bozdoğan B']",2013,47,2,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Arslan U, et al.

23612469,"Comparison of three methods for the recovery of skin pathogens from impetigo swabs collected in a remote community of Northern Territory, Australia.","BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common infection in children living in remote areas. Immediate plating of impetigo swabs is the gold standard for bacterial recovery but is rarely feasible in remote regions. Bacterial culture increases our understanding of antibiotic resistance and strain diversity, which guides treatment protocols and epidemiological monitoring.
METHODS: We investigated three practical alternatives for recovering Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus from transported swabs: dry swabs transported at 4°C with desiccant and plated within 48 h; swabs inoculated into skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol broth (STGGB), transported at 4°C, stored at -70°C and plated within 61 days; and ESwabs inoculated into Amies broth, transported at 4°C and plated within 48 h. Detection of Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus from simultaneously collected swabs was compared for the dry vs STGGB (36 sores) and the STGGB vs Amies (39 sores) methods. Swabs were collected from 43 children (75 sores sampled) in a remote community of Northern Territory, Australia in November 2011. The children had impetigo and were participating in the Skin Sore Trial [Australian Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000858291].
RESULTS: Recovery of Strep. pyogenes for dry vs STGGB was 72% (26/36) and 92% (33/36) and for STGGB vs Amies was 92% (36/39) for both methods. Staphylococcus aureus recovery for dry vs STGGB was 69% (25/36) and 72% 26/36) and for STGGB vs Amies was 74% (29/39) and 85% (33/39).
CONCLUSION: STGGB and Amies media provided higher recovery of Strep. pyogenes than dry swabs. These results and the opportunity to batch and store specimens for molecular studies support the use of STGGB transport media for future impetigo research.","['Bowen AC', 'Tong SY', 'Chatfield MD', 'Andrews RM', 'Carapetis JR']",2013,107,6,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Bowen AC, et al.

23515249,Dynamic pattern and genotypic diversity of Staphylococcus aureus nasopharyngeal carriage in healthy pre-school children.,"OBJECTIVES: It is common wisdom that persistent carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is more frequent in young children than in adults. The objectives of this study were to assess the S. aureus temporal carriage pattern among a healthy community of pre-school children, with concomitant description of genotype diversity, toxin-encoding genes and antibiotic resistance.
METHODS: Among 333 children 3-6 years of age, S. aureus nasopharyngeal carriage was assessed over one school year by culture of three sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates. Identification, methicillin resistance and toxin production profile were determined by PCR. Genotyping was performed by spa sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
RESULTS: Out of 830 samples collected, 286 (34%) yielded S. aureus from 185 carriers (55%). Based on consecutive genotype analysis, only 40/268 (15%) children could be classified as persistent carriers, and the remaining 118 (44%) showed intermittent carriage. spa typing revealed 82 types clustered into 13 spa clonal complexes (CCs). Fourteen strains isolated from 11 (3%) children were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), half of these strains belonged to the commonly hospital-associated spa t008-ST8-SCCmec IV. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were genotypically more diverse. Toxic shock syndrome toxin and egc1/2 complexes were highly prevalent (24%). Contrastingly, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) was carried only by three MSSA strains (0.6% of children). Exfoliative toxins were detected in 10 (3.5%) MSSA strains, of which 5 were related to the impetigo clone CC121.
CONCLUSIONS: Although S. aureus nasopharyngeal carriage was high among healthy pre-school children, persistent carriage seems to be less frequent than previously reported. The prevalence of MRSA carriage was 3%, but was not associated with PVL.","['Blumental S', 'Deplano A', 'Jourdain S', 'De Mendonça R', 'Hallin M', 'Nonhoff C', 'Rottiers S', 'Vergison A', 'Denis O']",2013,68,7,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Blumental S, et al.

23505464,Subpopulations of Staphylococcus aureus clonal complex 121 are associated with distinct clinical entities.,"We investigated the population structure of Staphylococcus aureus clonal complex CC121 by mutation discovery at 115 genetic housekeeping loci from each of 154 isolates, sampled on five continents between 1953 and 2009. In addition, we pyro-sequenced the genomes from ten representative isolates. The genome-wide SNPs that were ascertained revealed the evolutionary history of CC121, indicating at least six major clades (A to F) within the clonal complex and dating its most recent common ancestor to the pre-antibiotic era. The toxin gene complement of CC121 isolates was correlated with their SNP-based phylogeny. Moreover, we found a highly significant association of clinical phenotypes with phylogenetic affiliations, which is unusual for S. aureus. All isolates evidently sampled from superficial infections (including staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, bullous impetigo, exfoliative dermatitis, conjunctivitis) clustered in clade F, which included the European epidemic fusidic-acid resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC). In comparison, isolates from deep-seated infections (abscess, furuncle, pyomyositis, necrotizing pneumonia) were disseminated in several clades, but not in clade F. Our results demonstrate that phylogenetic lineages with distinct clinical properties exist within an S. aureus clonal complex, and that SNPs serve as powerful discriminatory markers, able to identify these lineages. All CC121 genomes harboured a 41-kilobase prophage that was dissimilar to S. aureus phages sequenced previously. Community-associated MRSA and MSSA from Cambodia were extremely closely related, suggesting this MRSA arose in the region.","['Kurt K', 'Rasigade JP', 'Laurent F', 'Goering RV', 'Žemličková H', 'Machova I', 'Struelens MJ', 'Zautner AE', 'Holtfreter S', 'Bröker B', 'Ritchie S', 'Reaksmey S', 'Limmathurotsakul D', 'Peacock SJ', 'Cuny C', 'Layer F', 'Witte W', 'Nübel U']",2013,8,3,PLoS One,"Kurt K, et al.

CASE REPORT: We report an 18-year-old primigravida who presented with IH at nearly 30 weeks' gestation and was the first patient reported in mainland China. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly in spite of treatment with corticosteroids and antibiotics, so we decided to terminate the pregnancy by induction of labor. After vaginal delivery she developed fever and her skin lesions did not disappear naturally. Fortunately her symptoms were resolved with the treatment of antibiotics and acitretin, and at day 60 postpartum her skin lesions had completely disappeared.
CONCLUSION: Although IH is associated with high mortality and morbidity in both fetus and mother, a better prognosis could be achieved with an immediate diagnosis and proper treatment. The etiology of IH needs to be further explored and the process of diagnosis and therapy should be standardized.","['Gao QQ', 'Xi MR', 'Yao Q']",2013,226,1,Dermatology,"Gao QQ, et al.

23432159,Staphylococcus aureus and topical fusidic acid use: results of a clinical audit on antimicrobial resistance.,"BACKGROUND: Fusidic acid (FA) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus poses a problem for treating systemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, in which FA may otherwise remain a viable option. It can also result in treatment failure of common dermatological conditions such as impetigo and infected atopic eczema. Several studies have linked trends in prescribing medication and topical use of FA to development of resistance. However, few case-control studies have evaluated risk factors for developing FA resistance in S. aureus.
METHODS: A clinical audit for antimicrobial resistance was performed in dermatology patients from the National Skin Centre who were admitted for inpatient care from 2006 to 2008 and had positive bacterial cultures for S. aureus. Each FA-resistant S. aureus (FRSA) case was compared with four randomly selected FA-susceptible (FSSA) cases. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively, and potential risk factors for development of resistance were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 37 patients with FRSA (35.1%) had used FA topically compared with 11 of 148 patients with FSSA (7.4%). Findings from multivariate analysis indicate that previous use of topical FA was the only independent risk factor of FA resistance (adjusted OR 7.46, 95% CI [2.60-21.41], P < 0.001). Patients' coexisting illnesses, recent hospitalization, or systemic antibiotic use were not significant risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous recent topical FA use correlated positively with FA resistance in S. aureus. Prescribing physicians must be vigilant of the rise of FA resistance and its resultant problems and prescribe topical FA discerningly.","['Heng YK', 'Tan KT', 'Sen P', 'Chow A', 'Leo YS', 'Lye DC', 'Chan RK']",2013,52,7,Int J Dermatol,"Heng YK, et al.

Occupational cases notified in North Denmark Region in 2008 and 2009 were analysed. Overall, 109 cases (54 females and 55 males) were notified, of whom 56 were infected and 52 cases were carriers, whereas in one case the status was unknown. The most prevalent clonal complex (CC) was 398 (n=26; 23.9%), followed by CC5 (n=17; 15.6%), CC30 (n=14; 12.8%), and CC8 (n=12; 11%). Eighteen cases were occupational with a predominance of CC398 (n= 16; 88.8%); CC8 and CC22 accounted for one case each. There was a significantly higher proportion of occupational cases for CC398 compared with other clonal complexes (p<0.001). All CC398 occupational cases were either farmers or farm workers occupied in swine confinement buildings. The two other cases were nurses working in the region's public hospitals. Most occupational cases were carriers (n=15; 83%). Three were infected, two with impetigo and one with tonsillitis; CC398 was the causative agent in all three cases. CC398 has a porcine reservoir which is huge in Denmark with a total annual production of 27,700,000 pigs. The presented population-based retrospective study shows an infectious potential of CC398 in humans.

23208713,In vivo bioluminescence imaging to evaluate systemic and topical antibiotics against community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-infected skin wounds in mice.,"Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) frequently causes skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, cellulitis, folliculitis, and infected wounds and ulcers. Uncomplicated CA-MRSA skin infections are typically managed in an outpatient setting with oral and topical antibiotics and/or incision and drainage, whereas complicated skin infections often require hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and sometimes surgery. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model of CA-MRSA wound infection to compare the efficacy of commonly used systemic and topical antibiotics. A bioluminescent USA300 CA-MRSA strain was inoculated into full-thickness scalpel wounds on the backs of mice and digital photography/image analysis and in vivo bioluminescence imaging were used to measure wound healing and the bacterial burden. Subcutaneous vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid similarly reduced the lesion sizes and bacterial burden. Oral linezolid, clindamycin, and doxycycline all decreased the lesion sizes and bacterial burden. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole decreased the bacterial burden but did not decrease the lesion size. Topical mupirocin and retapamulin ointments both reduced the bacterial burden. However, the petrolatum vehicle ointment for retapamulin, but not the polyethylene glycol vehicle ointment for mupirocin, promoted wound healing and initially increased the bacterial burden. Finally, in type 2 diabetic mice, subcutaneous linezolid and daptomycin had the most rapid therapeutic effect compared with vancomycin. Taken together, this mouse model of CA-MRSA wound infection, which utilizes in vivo bioluminescence imaging to monitor the bacterial burden, represents an alternative method to evaluate the preclinical in vivo efficacy of systemic and topical antimicrobial agents.","['Guo Y', 'Ramos RI', 'Cho JS', 'Donegan NP', 'Cheung AL', 'Miller LS']",2013,57,2,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Guo Y, et al.

23179674,Molecular markers for the study of streptococcal epidemiology.,"Diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS) range from superficial infections such as pharyngitis and impetigo to potentially fatal rheumatic heart disease and invasive disease. Studies spanning emm-typing surveillance to population genomics are providing new insights into the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and biology of this organism. Such studies have demonstrated the differences that exist in the epidemiology of streptococcal disease between developing and developed nations. In developing nations, where streptococcal disease is endemic, the diversity of GAS emm-types circulating is much greater than that found in developed nations. An association between emm-type and disease, as observed in developed countries is also lacking. Intriguingly, comparative genetic studies suggest that emm-type is not always a good predictor of the evolutionary relatedness of geographically distant isolates. A view of GAS as a highly dynamic organism, in possession of a core set of virulence genes that contribute to host niche specialization and common pathogenic processes, augmented by accessory genes that change the relative virulence of specific lineages is emerging.

23171561,[Burns in children: child abuse or another cause?].,"Burns are common in children but it is not always clear whether the burn is accidental or not. Child abuse should always be considered. We present two children in which the diagnosis only became clear after admission and further investigation. Patient A, a 15-month-old boy, had a burn on his left shoulder. The burn was assumed suspect in view of the unclear history given by the parents and a possible delay in their seeking help. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with impetigo bullosa and successfully treated with antibiotics. Patient B, a 24-month-old girl, had burns on both feet and her right hand, which were infected as a result of the delay in seeking help. The burns were identified as abuse-related. The child was removed from her mother's care and sent to a foster home. A well-defined work-up should be followed in case of burns in children.","['van Ewijk R', 'op de Coul ME', 'Teeuw AH', 'Wolf BH']",2012,156,47,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"van Ewijk R, et al.

23168170,The use of typing methods and infection prevention measures to control a bullous impetigo outbreak on a neonatal ward.,"BACKGROUND: We describe an outbreak of Bullous Impetigo (BI), caused by a (methicillin susceptible, fusidic acid resistant) Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strain, spa-type t408, at the neonatal and gynaecology ward of the Jeroen Bosch hospital in the Netherlands, from March-November 2011.
METHODS: We performed an outbreak investigation with revision of the hygienic protocols, MSSA colonization surveillance and environmental sampling for MSSA including detailed typing of SA isolates. Spa typing was performed to discriminate between the SA isolates. In addition, Raman-typing was performed on all t408 isolates.
RESULTS: Nineteen cases of BI were confirmed by SA positive cultures. A cluster of nine neonates and three health care workers (HCW) with SA t408 was detected. These strains were MecA-, PVL-, Exfoliative Toxin (ET)A-, ETB+, ETAD-, fusidic acid-resistant and methicillin susceptible. Eight out of nine neonates and two out of three HCW t408 strains yielded a similar Raman type. Positive t408 HCW were treated and infection control procedures were reinforced. These measures stopped the outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that treatment of patients and HCW carrying a predominant SA t408, and re-implementing and emphasising hygienic measures were effective to control the outbreak of SA t408 among neonates.","['Koningstein M', 'Groen L', 'Geraats-Peters K', 'Lutgens S', 'Rietveld A', 'Jira P', 'Kluytmans J', 'de Greeff SC', 'Hermans M', 'Schneeberger PM']",2012,1,1,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,"Koningstein M, et al.

23087872,Mucocutaneous manifestations of acquired hypoparathyroidism: An observational study.,"Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder of calcium and phosphorus metabolism due to decreased secretion of parathyroid hormone. Hypoparathyroidism can be hereditary and acquired. Acquired hypoparathyroidism usually occurs following neck surgery (thyroid surgery or parathyroid surgery). Along with systemic manifestations, hypoparathyroidism produces some skin manifestations. Lack of study regarding mucocutaneous manifestations of acquired hypoparathyroidism prompted us to undertake this study. To evaluate the mucocutaneous manifestations of acquired hypoparathyroidism. An observational study done in a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata by comprehensive history taking, through clinical examination and relevant laboratory investigations. Twenty-one patients were included in the study. The commonest form of acquired hypoparathyroidism was neck surgery (thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy operation). Mucocutaneous manifestations were present in 76.19% of patients. The most frequent mucocutaneous manifestation was found in the hairs like the loss of axillary hair (61.9%), loss of pubic hair (52.38%), coarsening of body hair (47.62%), and alopecia areata (9.52%). The nail changes noted were brittle and ridged nail, followed by onycholysis, onychosezia, and onychomedesis. The most common skin features were xerotic skin in 11 patients (52.38%), followed by pellagra-like skin pigmentation, pustular psoriasis and acne form eruption, bullous impetigo, etc. Mucosa was normal in all the cases excepting the one which showed oral candidiasis.","['Sarkar S', 'Mondal M', 'Das K', 'Shrimal A']",2012,16,5,Indian J Endocrinol Metab,"Sarkar S, et al.

23078129,Epidemiological data of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in France from 1997 to 2007 and microbiological characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus associated strains.,"Epidemiological data on staphylococcal scalded skin syndromes (SSSS), including bullous impetigo (BI) and generalized exfoliative syndrome (GES), are scarce. To better characterize SSSS and associated Staphylococcus aureus strains, we conducted a retrospective study of 349 cases collected in France between 1997 and 2007 by the National Reference Centre of Staphylococci. Our results showed a stationary evolution of SSSS cases, with a heterogeneous distribution of cases in France. Although notification was not exhaustive, we estimated an incidence of 0.56 cases/year/million inhabitants, in accordance with previous studies conducted in France and Europe, with a median age of 2 years old and sex ratios of 1. A seasonal effect was observed, with a higher GES/BI ratio in autumn compared with other seasons, which could be explained by the impact of viral co-infection. Genetic analysis of S. aureus strains showed that accessory gene regulator (agr) 4, exfoliative toxin A (eta) and B (etb) genes, staphylococcal and enterotoxin-like O (selo) gene and agr4 etb selo profiles were predominantly associated with GES, whereas agr2 eta and agr4 eta selo were more frequently observed with BI. Only one methicillin-resistant strain was found. Protein A (spa) typing identified two main genotypes: spa clonal complex (CC) 159/sequence-type (ST) 121 (75%) and spaCC346/ST15 (18%). spaCC159 was mainly associated with agr4 eta etb selo, agr4 eta selo and agr4 etb selo, and spaCC346 was mainly associated with agr2 eta, suggesting that French SSSS cases are caused by these two main lineages.

23052313,Is Streptococcus pyogenes resistant or susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole?,"Streptococcus pyogenes is commonly believed to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), resulting in reservations about using SXT for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) where S. pyogenes is involved. S. pyogenes' in vitro susceptibility to SXT depends on the medium's thymidine content. Thymidine allows S. pyogenes to bypass the sulfur-mediated inhibition of folate metabolism and, historically, has resulted in apparently reduced susceptibility of S. pyogenes to sulfur antibacterials. The low thymidine concentration in Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) is now regulated. We explored S. pyogenes susceptibility to SXT on various media. Using two sets of 100 clinical S. pyogenes isolates, we tested for susceptibility using SXT Etests on MHA containing defibrinated horse blood and 20 mg/liter β-NAD (MHF), MHA with sheep blood (MHS), MHA alone, MHA with horse blood (MHBA), and MHA with lysed horse blood (MHLHBA). European Committee on Antibacterial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints defined susceptibility (MIC, ≤ 1 mg/liter) and resistance (MIC, >2 mg/liter). In study 1, 99% of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to SXT on MHA, MHBA, and MHLHBA, with geometric mean MICs of 0.04, 0.04, and 0.05 mg/liter, respectively. In study 2, all 100 S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to SXT on MHF, MHS, MHA, and MHLHBA with geometric mean MICs of 0.07, 0.16, 0.07, and 0.09 mg/liter, respectively. This study confirms the in vitro susceptibility of S. pyogenes to SXT, providing support for the use of SXT for SSTIs. A clinical trial using SXT for impetigo is ongoing.","['Bowen AC', 'Lilliebridge RA', 'Tong SY', 'Baird RW', 'Ward P', 'McDonald MI', 'Currie BJ', 'Carapetis JR']",2012,50,12,J Clin Microbiol,"Bowen AC, et al.

23046498,Neonatal vesiculopustular eruption associated with transient myeloproliferative disorder: report of four cases.,"BACKGROUND: Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) affects up to 10% of patients with Down syndrome (DS). A small proportion of newborns are asymptomatic and only manifest circulating blast cells, with or without leukocytosis, while others present with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serous effusions, and liver fibrosis. Few cases in the literature also have skin manifestations, described as crusted, erythematous, vesiculopustular eruptions occurring mainly on the face, with spreading to the trunk and extremities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with DS and TMD were studied due to the presence of cutaneous eruptions. Systemic involvement, work-up, and follow-up were documented for each patient. Our results were compared with the previously reported cases.
RESULTS: All patients were males, with ages ranging from 1 to 20 days at the time of diagnosis. In three patients, the eruption was papulopustular, and two of them also had vesicles. In one patient, lesions resembled bullous impetigo. In all, the lesions involved the face, followed by the extremities in three and the trunk in two patients. Pathergy phenomena was present in one patient. Hepatomegaly and a leukemoid reaction were present in all patients. Bone marrow showed an M7 immunophenotype in three patients and normal cellularity in one. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 11 months, during which the patients were healthy.
CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the cutaneous eruptions associated with TMD in neonate patients with DS may lead to early diagnosis and avoidance of unnecessary chemotherapy. However, because leukemia may develop later, careful follow-up is mandatory in all cases.","['Narvaez-Rosales V', 'de-Ocariz MS', 'Carrasco-Daza D', 'Ramirez-Davila B', 'Orozco-Covarrubias L', 'Duran-McKinster C', 'Palacios-Lopez C']",2013,52,10,Int J Dermatol,"Narvaez-Rosales V, et al.

22928620,Antibiogram testing of pediatric skin infections in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci aureus: an Egyptian University Hospital-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococci aureus (CA-MRSA) pediatric skin infections have been reported worldwide. However, little is known about pathogens' implications in Egyptian children, and beta-lactams are still the empiric antimicrobials prescribed. This warrants Egyptian studies on antibiogram testing of pediatric skin infections.
OBJECTIVES: To determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates from Egyptian pediatric skin infections to find out if we need reconsideration of the empiric beta-lactam antimicrobial therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Throughout an eight-month cross-sectional study, antibiogram testing was conducted on bacterial isolates from pediatric skin infections. Determination of inducible resistance to clindamycin using D-test was performed for isolates susceptible to clindamycin and resistant to erythromycin.
RESULTS: One-hundred and 21 children (mean age 6.9 years ± 3 SD) presented with pyogenic skin infections. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci aureus (MSSA) were isolated from 114 children, associated with group A Streptococci (GAS) in four of them, while GAS were the only isolates in three patients. A diagnosis of CA-MRSA was fulfilled in four children. Antibiotic susceptibilities differed between isolated organisms but with no statistically significant differences between susceptibility patterns of isolates from primary skin infections and those from secondary infection of skin diseases. Positive D-test was detected in five MSSA isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: CA-MRSA skin infections are not common among Egyptian children and, therefore, beta-lactams are still effective empiric antimicrobial therapy for most infections. Antibiogram testing from suppurative skin lesions are, however, better to be recommended to guide individual therapy. Clindamycin should not be considered for susceptible isolates unless they are erythromycin susceptible or D-test negative.","['Abdel Fattah NS', 'Darwish YW']",2012,51,12,Int J Dermatol,Abdel Fattah NS and Darwish YW.

22901017,Prurigo pigmentosa: clinicopathological study and analysis of 50 cases in Korea.,"Prurigo pigmentosa is a recurrent dermatosis with severe pruritus and several peculiar clinical features. Its exact etiology and pathogenesis are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and chronological changes in the histopathology of prurigo pigmentosa in Korean patients and to assess the etiology of this condition. We reviewed the medical records, clinical photographs and biopsy specimens from 50 patients diagnosed with prurigo pigmentosa. Mean age at diagnosis was 23.7 years (range, 15-61 years). Prurigo pigmentosa started as urticarial papules or plaques, changing first to papulovesicles and then to reticulated brownish macules. The most frequent sites were the back and chest, especially depressed areas such as the central back and inter-mammary area. Dietary change was suspected as a cause of prurigo pigmentosa in 17 patients. Histopathologically, early-stage lesions had dermatitis herpetiformis-like features; fully-developed lesions displayed impetigo-like or acute, generalized, exanthematous, pustulosis-like features; and late lesions presented with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation-like features. Oral minocycline, with or without dapsone, was effective in inhibiting the appearance of new lesions, but did not prevent recurrence. Prurigo pigmentosa is not rare in Korea, is apparently associated with dietary modification and preferentially involves the depressed regions of the trunk.","['Kim JK', 'Chung WK', 'Chang SE', 'Ko JY', 'Lee JH', 'Won CH', 'Lee MW', 'Choi JH', 'Moon KC']",2012,39,11,J Dermatol,"Kim JK, et al.

22834561,"Epidemiologic study of dermatologic disorders among children in South Sinai, Egypt.","BACKGROUND:   Few epidemiologic surveys have been carried out to determine the prevalence of skin diseases in the population of Egypt, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula. Thus, the necessity of such research in South Sinai is pressing. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of various skin diseases among children in South Sinai.
METHODS: A community-based protocol was followed. The study included 2194 children of both genders, 18 years of age and younger, and in six different localities within South Sinai. Data were collected by taking a full history and by systemic and dermatologic clinical examination that included the site, severity, distribution, and extent of skin lesions if present. Subjects were surveyed at general morbidity consultations and campaign field visits. The study was conducted from August 2008 to August 2009. Data were tabulated and analyzed statistically using Pearson's chi-squared test. Differences were considered significant at a P-value of < 0.05.
RESULTS: Findings revealed that 71.4% of the studied population had one or more skin diseases. The highest rate of prevalence applied to parasitic skin infestations (pediculosis capitis, 37.6%). Eczema or dermatitis were found in 25.8% of participants. Pityriasis alba occurred at a rate of 18.3% and seborrheic dermatitis at a rate of 6.7%. Xerosis was found in 11.8% of subjects, viral warts in 4.1%, photosensitivity in 4.1%, acne vulgaris in 2.6%, and fungal skin infections in 1.0%. Other skin diseases diagnosed in low numbers in the study children included impetigo, freckles, and scabies. Prevalences of vitiligo and psoriasis were very low (0.18% and 0.05%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Infective parasitic diseases are a major health problem, particularly among younger children and in subjects of low socioeconomic status.","['Yamamah GA', 'Emam HM', 'Abdelhamid MF', 'Elsaie ML', 'Shehata H', 'Farid T', 'Kamel MI', 'Taalat AA']",2012,51,10,Int J Dermatol,"Yamamah GA, et al.

22823580,Staphylococcal skin disease in livestock.,"UNLABELLED: This review covers cutaneous manifestations of staphylococcal infection in livestock species. CATTLE: In cattle, staphylococcal infections may present as folliculitis or as impetigo. Both may present as mild forms of a group of conditions loosely termed udder dermatitis, which has various clinical presentations and does not always involve staphylococci. GOATS: In goats, staphylococcal infection may be secondary to chorioptic mange or contagious pustular dermatitis (parapox virus infection). While Staphylococcus aureus is usually implicated, infection with Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus hyicus have also been reported. SHEEP: Ovine staphylococcal dermatitis typically involves the head. Trauma due to the close contact of heads over feeding troughs and abrasive plants at pasture may be predisposing factors. PIGS: In pigs, the most common cause of staphylococcal skin disease is S. hyicus, although other bacteria, including Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus chromogenes and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), have also been isolated from some cases of greasy pig disease (exudative epidermitis).
DIAGNOSIS: Routine culture methods are increasingly supplemented by molecular methods to characterize staphylococci.
MANAGEMENT: As commensal bacteria, staphylococcal skin infection is presumed to develop because of predisposing factors. While topical and systemic therapies can be effective, it is important to control for predisposing factors so that recurrences can be prevented. LIVESTOCK-ASSOCIATED MRSA: In recent years, MRSA strains have emerged, particularly in pigs and cattle. While they rarely cause skin disease, they do pose a significant concern for public health authorities.

A prospective cohort of adults with SSTI was established between January 2009 and August 2010 at 4 hospitals in Beijing. Susceptibility testing and molecular typing, including multilocus sequence typing, spa, agr typing, and toxin detection were assessed for all S. aureus isolates. Overall, 501 SSTI patients were enrolled. Cutaneous abscess (40.7%) was the most common infection, followed by impetigo (6.8%) and cellulitis (4.8%). S. aureus accounted for 32.7% (164/501) of SSTIs. Five isolates (5/164, 3.0%) were CA-MRSA. The most dominant ST in CA-MSSA was ST398 (17.6%). The prevalence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (pvl) gene was 41.5% (66/159) in MSSA. Female, younger patients and infections requiring incision or drainage were more commonly associated with pvl-positive S. aureus (P<0.03); sec gene was more often identified in CC5 (P<0.03); seh gene was more prevalent in CC1 (P = 0.001). Importantly, ST59 isolates showed more resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline, and needed more surgical intervention. In conclusion, CA-MRSA infections were rare among adult SSTI patients in Beijing.

22664234,[Bullous mastocytosis in infancy: a rare presentation].,"Mastocytosis is a rare condition related to an abnormal proliferation of mast cells and their accumulation in tissues. Cutaneous mastocytosis is the most common form and mainly affects newborns and infants. The symptoms are caused by the release of mediators contained in mast cells, including histamine. Mastocytosis may be associated with a mutation in the gene encoding the c-kit receptor. Clinically, there are different dermatological findings, which combine acute cutaneous, digestive, or even hemodynamic manifestations in varying degrees. The diagnosis is confirmed by the histological study of a skin sample. We report here the case of a 4-month-old infant suffering from diffuse cutaneous bullous mastocytosis, a very rare variety of mastocytosis. This infant had an erosive and bullous manifestation of dermatosis, initially confused with impetigo. The proliferation of bullous lesions led to her hospitalization. Codeine intake for pain was responsible for a large and extensive bullous reaction associated with anaphylactic shock. This context of bullous spread occurring after taking codeine led to the suspicion of bullous diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, a diagnosis that was confirmed histologically. This observation demonstrates the difficulty of mastocytosis diagnosis, mostly due to its rarity, especially in its diffuse bullous forms. The rapid deterioration of this patient, after the codeine prescription, emphasizes the importance of the eviction of histamine-releaser compounds in the management of this disease.","['Deverrière G', 'Carré D', 'Nae I', 'Cailliez D', 'Boulloche J']",2012,19,7,Arch Pediatr,"Deverrière G, et al.

22642914,Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a human pathogen which causes significant morbidity and mortality globally. GAS typically infects the throat and skin of the host, causing mild infections such as pharyngitis and impetigo, in addition to life threatening conditions including necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), and bacteremia. Repeated infection with GAS may result in the non-suppurative sequelae, acute rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. GAS remains sensitive to the antibiotic penicillin which can be administered as a means to treat infection or as prophylaxis. However, issues with patient compliance and a growing concern over the possible emergence of resistant GAS strains may limit the usefulness of antibiotics in the future. A vaccine capable of preventing GAS infection may be the only effective way to control and eliminate GAS infection and disease.","['Henningham A', 'Barnett TC', 'Maamary PG', 'Walker MJ']",2012,13,72,Discov Med,"Henningham A, et al.

22482480,[Localized inflammatory alopecia of the scalp: an unusual presentation of tularemia].,"BACKGROUND: Tularaemia is a rare arthropod-borne zoonotic infection with 20 to 70 new cases being seen each year in France. Cutaneous ulceration and regional lymphadenopathy are the classical dermatological signs. Diagnosis of atypical forms is more complex.
OBSERVATION: A 48-year-old woman was admitted for an erythematous papular alopecic lesion of the scalp accompanied by fever, chills and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial antibiotic therapy for 20 days with amoxicillin clavulanate was ineffective. The patient's history included an episode of hunting in the forest three days before the onset of signs. Finally, serology led to the diagnosis of tularaemia. Combined levofloxacin and doxycycline resulted in regression of the scalp lesion and lymph node disorder.
DISCUSSION: The existence of alopecia and location on the scalp did not initially suggest a diagnosis of tularaemia to us. The clinical presentation was highly suggestive of impetigo with satellite lymphadenopathies. However, resistance to antibiotics and the absence of inflammation militated against this diagnosis, and other possible diagnoses such as a tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), borreliosis and tularaemia were discussed. The most common clinical presentation of tularaemia is ulceroglandular tularaemia, which predominates in 80% of cases. The inoculation chancre at the point of initial infection is most often located in the upper limbs.
CONCLUSION: An inflammatory plaque on the scalp with alopecia may reveal tularaemia, a potentially fatal disease resulting from inoculation.","['Berton M', 'Nojavan H', 'Bens G', 'Estève E']",2012,139,4,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Berton M, et al.

22453587,Treatment of impetigo: oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin disease that is frequently seen in children. While data support the use of topical antibiotics for treatment, the medications actually prescribed in practice are not well documented.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prescribing pattern of dermatologists and nondermatologists when treating impetigo and the demographics of the patients treated.
METHODS: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data on office visits for impetigo were analyzed from 1997 to 2007. Patient demographics and the treatments for impetigo were recorded.
RESULTS: During this 10-year period, dermatologists managed an estimated 274,815 impetigo visits and nondermatologists an estimated 3,722,462 visits. Both dermatologists and nondermatologists most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics to treat impetigo. Topical antibiotics were second most common, and a variety of combination treatments were used.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral antibiotics are the most common class of medications used to treat impetigo. There is an opportunity for physicians to take advantage of the equally efficacious topical antibiotics for treating impetigo. A shift towards topical antibiotics would likely decrease morbidity (resulting from adverse effects) associated with use of oral agents.","['Bolaji RS', 'Dabade TS', 'Gustafson CJ', 'Davis SA', 'Krowchuk DP', 'Feldman SR']",2012,11,4,J Drugs Dermatol,"Bolaji RS, et al.

Susceptibility tests to determine MICs and analysis of the presence of erythromycin-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermA) and emm gene typing were performed on 466 S. pyogenes isolates from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen. Superantigen genes (speA and speC) were examined by performing PCR on isolates with the most prevalent emm genotype. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin, cefradine and ofloxacin. The highest rate of resistance was against clarithromycin (98.1 %), followed by erythromycin (97.6 %), azithromycin and clindamycin (both 97.2 %), and tetracycline (94.0 %).

22435428,Dermatophyte infections mimicking other skin diseases: a 154-person case survey of tinea atypica in the district of Cagliari (Italy).,"BACKGROUND: Although usually simple, the diagnosis of dermatophyte infection is sometimes neglected. An observational study has been realized to evaluate the role of corticosteroid exposure (tinea incognito) and of other primary characteristics of the dermatophytosis that from onset mimic other diseases and mislead an unexperienced physician.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2009, all cases of atypical dermatophytosis mimicking other skin diseases were collected from the more general number of dermatophyte infections diagnosed at the Dermatology Department of Cagliari University, Italy.
RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty-four cases (71 male/83 female, 2-81 years old) were studied, with a median of 7 cases/year. The most observed clinical forms were those mimicking impetigo, eczematous dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, polymorphous light eruption, psoriasis, and rosacea. The identified dermatophytes were: Microsporum canis (70 cases), Trichophyton rubrum (43 cases), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes (29 cases), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (six cases), Microsporum gypseum (three cases), Epidermophyton floccosum (two cases), and Trichophyton verrucosum (one case). Diagnostic difficulties are discussed, with special attention to the origin of the pathomorphosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, clinical atypia is not a mere consequence of corticosteroid therapy but present at the very onset of the illness, due to the variable dermatophyte invasive capacity, the site of invasion, physiological individual, and/or acquired condition, such as excessive washing or sun exposure. Therefore, we suggest using the term ""tinea atypica"" rather than ""tinea incognito"" to include all forms of dermatophytosis that do not present the classic features for both primary and secondary pathomorphosis.","['Atzori L', 'Pau M', 'Aste N', 'Aste N']",2012,51,4,Int J Dermatol,"Atzori L, et al.

22435423,Dermatoses secondary to Asian cultural practices.,"Although Asian cultural practices, such as acupuncture and threading, are widely used, there is limited medical literature describing their cutaneous effects and complications. This review briefly describes therapeutic cultural practices (traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, coining, Ayurveda, and aromatherapy) and cosmetic cultural practices (hair oils, henna, bindis, saris, and threading), with particular attention to dermatoses secondary to these practices. Traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda may cause heavy metal toxicity, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and contact dermatitis. Cupping, moxibustion, and coining lead to dermatoses that may be mistaken for abuse by people unfamiliar with the practices. Hair oils may cause contact dermatitis and folliculitis. Paraphenylenediamine in black henna and bindi dyes and adhesives can cause severe allergic contact dermatitis. The drawstring in saris causes frictional irritation, which can lead to tinea corporis, koebnerization, and even squamous cell carcinoma. Threading may cause folliculitis, impetigo, and verrucae. The increasing prevalence of Asian cultural practices, which are performed inside and outside of Asia in this era of globalization, demands that dermatologists be familiar with the secondary dermatoses that may develop.","['Lilly E', 'Kundu RV']",2012,51,4,Int J Dermatol,Lilly E and Kundu RV.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of dermatoses in neonates, stress the importance of simple noninvasive diagnostic procedures with perspective to actual need of active intervention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty four neonates with vesicobullous lesions in departments of dermatology and pediatrics were evaluated with respect to diagnosis, required treatments and follow ups.
RESULTS: Out of total 44 neonates, 29 were males and 15 females. Iinfectious dermatoses accounted for: 9% - staphylococcal pyoderma, 4,5% - Group A Streptococcal impetigo, 4,5% - neonatal tinea faciei, 2,3% - neonatal candidiasis, 2,3% - neonatal varicella/chickenpox and 2,3% - scabies.

As with other bacterial infections, there is considerable interest in characterizing the contribution of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) responses to protective immunity. We here show significant il17a up-regulation by quantitative real-time PCR in secondary lymphoid organs, correlating with increased protein levels in the serum within a short time of S. pyogenes infection. However, our data offer an important caveat to studies of IL-17A responsiveness following antigen inoculation, because enhanced levels of IL-17A were also detected in the serum of sham-infected mice, indicating that inoculation trauma alone can stimulate the production of this cytokine. This highlights the potency and speed of innate IL-17A immune responses after inoculation and the importance of proper and appropriate controls in comparative analysis of immune responses observed during microbial infection.","['Chong DL', 'Ingram RJ', 'Lowther DE', 'Muir R', 'Sriskandan S', 'Altmann DM']",2012,136,3,Immunology,"Chong DL, et al.

22336310,[Clinical features and molecular analysis of 2 Chinese children with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by CYBA mutations].,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize clinical and molecular features of two children with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by CYBA mutations.
METHOD: The clinical records and CYBA mutations were reviewed for analysis of infections and inflammatory complications.
RESULT: The first case was a girl diagnosed with ""liver and spleen abscess"" in our hospital when she was 2.9 years old, with past history of neonatal impetigo and recurrent purulent lymphadenitis and positive family history. The results of DHR123 flow-cytometry showed that positive phagocytes after phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation was 84.63%. CYBA mutation analysis showed that she had heterozygous 35C > T, Q3X and IVS-2A > G. The second case was a boy diagnosed with ""sepsis (salmonella D)"" when he was 4 years old with a past history of impetigo, sepsis, perianal abscess, skin infection and positive family history. The results of flow cytometry showed that positive phagocytes after PMA stimulation was 96.13%. CYBA mutation analysis showed that he had homozygous 35C > T, Q3X and his parents were all carriers. All of them had BCG related axillary lymphnode calcification.
CONCLUSION: A22CGD cases had recurrent purulent infections (skin, lymphnode, liver and spleen, lung, blood), DHR123 flow cytometric analysis helped the diagnosis of CGD, CYBA mutation analysis ascertained the diagnosis of A22CGD.","['He JX', 'Zhao SY', 'Xu BP', 'Hu YH', 'Shen KL', 'Jiang ZF']",2011,49,11,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,"He JX, et al.

22327467,Streptococcal skin infection and rheumatic heart disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In resource-limited tropical settings, both impetigo and rheumatic disease are endemic. The major cause of impetigo in these regions is the group A streptococcus and there is a growing body of opinion implicating impetigo in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). This potentially has major implications for control of these neglected diseases, which account for at least 350  000 deaths worldwide, annually. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal skin disease and examine evidence for the relationship between group A streptococcal skin disease and rheumatic fever.
RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed epidemiologic studies of impetigo, particularly among indigenous communities in the Pacific among whom rheumatic fever is endemic, find the disease remarkably prevalent. In contrast, group A streptococcal pharyngitis occurs no more frequently than in regions wherein rheumatic fever is now rare. Studies of molecular epidemiology reveal that overall there is a greater diversity of group A streptococcal strains in tropical regions, and skin-associated strains appear predominant. These skin strains may move between skin and throat, and there is increasing evidence of skin-associated strains being linked to cases of rheumatic fever.
SUMMARY: The available data support the hypothesis that group A streptococcal impetigo plays a role in the pathogenesis of RHD. There is considerable scope to investigate this question through studies of pathogenesis, employing advances in both human and bacterial genetics, molecular immunology, and carefully designed trials aimed at control of impetigo.","['Parks T', 'Smeesters PR', 'Steer AC']",2012,25,2,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Parks T, et al.

22299710,Bacterial resistance and impetigo treatment trends: a review.,"Impetigo is a common cutaneous infection that is especially prevalent in children. The prevalence of colonization and infection with resistant strains is continually increasing, forcing clinicians to reevaluate treatment strategies. Newer topical agents are effective in treating infections with resistant strains and may help minimize resistance and adverse effects from systemic agents. Use of topical disinfectants to decrease colonization is an important adjunctive measure. Physicians should be aware of local resistance patterns in impetigo to help guide therapy.","['Bangert S', 'Levy M', 'Hebert AA']",2012,29,3,Pediatr Dermatol,"Bangert S, et al.

22290345,Spread of the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC) in general practice patients in the south of The Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the susceptibility to fusidic acid, mupirocin and retapamulin of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from nasal and wound swabs.
METHODS: The susceptibility to the three agents of S. aureus isolated from general patients in the south of The Netherlands with a skin or soft tissue infection was determined between January 2007 and December 2008. Fusidic acid-resistant isolates were tested for the presence of fusidic acid-resistant genes and compared with the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC).
RESULTS: Fusidic acid resistance was found in 23% of the nasal and 35% of the wound isolates, the majority (~90%) being fusB positive. Most of the isolates belonged to spa type t171 and were isolated from younger patients. One isolate was retapamulin resistant (MIC 8 mg/L) and two were mupirocin resistant.
CONCLUSIONS: The EEFIC clone was relatively highly prevalent among the isolated S. aureus. The usefulness of fusidic acid as first-line agent for the treatment of impetigo is questionable. As mupirocin is used in The Netherlands for eradication of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, it is not an alternative; retapamulin might be useful, but further in vivo studies are warranted.","['Rijnders MI', 'Wolffs PF', 'Hopstaken RM', 'den Heyer M', 'Bruggeman CA', 'Stobberingh EE']",2012,67,5,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Rijnders MI, et al.

22264139,A case of recurrent impetigo herpetiformis treated with systemic corticosteroids and narrowband UVB.,"Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular eruption with usual onset during the third trimester of pregnancy. The disease tends to remit after delivery, but may recur in subsequent pregnancies. Here we present a recurrent case of impetigo herpetiformis with earlier onset and poor response to corticosteroids in the subsequent pregnancy. She had widespread, erythematosquamous patches with tiny superficial pustules in the third trimester of her first pregnancy. Histopathological and clinical findings were consistent with impetigo herpetiformis. She was treated with systemic prednisolone and had a healthy baby without any complication. Three years later, the patient presented with impetigo herpetiformis again in the second trimester of her second pregnancy. After six weeks of oral prednisolone treatment, the lesions improved, but there were still new pustule formations and narrowband ultraviolet B treatment was added. Skin eruption cleared and she had a healthy baby in the 38th week of her second pregnancy. The corticosteroid dose was tapered gradually and stopped after delivery. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial in impetigo herpetiformis because of the risk of maternal and fetal complications. When prednisolone is not enough to control the eruption alone, narrowband UVB can safely be added to the treatment.","['Bozdag K', 'Ozturk S', 'Ermete M']",2012,31,1,Cutan Ocul Toxicol,"Bozdag K, et al.

22258953,Interventions for impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.
SEARCH METHODS: We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this.For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors.Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11).In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08).There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32).The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference.Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.","['Koning S', 'van der Sande R', 'Verhagen AP', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Morris AD', 'Butler CC', 'Berger M', 'van der Wouden JC']",2012,1,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Koning S, et al.

22206254,Knowing is half the battle: targeting virulence factors of group A Streptococcus for vaccine and therapeutics.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading human pathogen that causes a multitude of diseases from pharyngitis, and impetigo, to more severe outcomes such as rheumatoid arthritis and necrotizing fasciitis. GAS remains a global burden as currently no vaccine exists that is completely effective. In this review we highlight recent studies on the virulence of GAS and present several approaches that have extended those findings into aims at combating GAS disease. These and other studies such as recent genome-wide efforts into host-pathogen relationships of GAS disease will likely reveal new targets of intervention. Given the recent rise in GAS strains that have acquired resistance to several types of antibiotics, it is crucial that we continue to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying GAS disease.","['Thomas CL', 'Lee SW']",2012,13,3,Curr Drug Targets,Thomas CL and Lee SW.

22189787,Desmoglein as a target in skin disease and beyond.,"Much of the original research on desmosomes and their biochemical components was through analysis of skin and mucous membranes. The identification of desmogleins 1 and 3, desmosomal adhesion glycoproteins, as targets in pemphigus, a fatal autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes, provided the first link between desmosomes, desmogleins, and human diseases. The clinical and histological similarities of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or bullous impetigo and pemphigus foliaceus led us to identify desmoglein 1 as the proteolytic target of staphylococcal exfoliative toxins. Genetic analysis of striate palmoplantar keratoderma and hypotrichosis identified their responsible genes as desmogleins 1 and 4, respectively. More recently, these fundamental findings in cutaneous biology were extended beyond the skin. Desmoglein 2, which is expressed earliest among the four isoforms of desmoglein in development and found in all desmosome-bearing epithelial cells, was found to be mutated in arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and has also been identified as a receptor for a subset of adenoviruses that cause respiratory and urinary tract infections. The story of desmoglein research illuminates how dermatological research, originally focused on one skin disease, pemphigus, has contributed to understanding the biology and pathophysiology of many seemingly unrelated tissues and diseases.","['Amagai M', 'Stanley JR']",2012,132,3 Pt 2,J Invest Dermatol,Amagai M and Stanley JR.

22189527,Effect of antenatal zinc supplementation on impetigo in infants in Bangladesh.,"We sought to determine the effects of maternal zinc supplementation on skin infections among infants in poor urban areas of Dhaka, Bangladesh. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted among 199 and 221 Bangladeshi infants whose mothers were administered 30 mg daily of zinc or placebo, respectively. The mothers received zinc supplementation from 12-16 weeks' gestation until delivery, and the infants were followed up until 6 months of age. Among the infants of mothers who received zinc supplementation during the antenatal period, 10.6% had at least 1 episode of impetigo compared with 19.6% of the infants of mothers in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Infants in the treatment group had a 54% reduction in incidence rate of episodes of impetigo when compared with infants in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The effect of zinc supplementation was more pronounced among male infants (64% reduction) and intrauterine growth restricted and low birth weight infants (73% reduction) and among infants of mothers with increased parity (60% reduction) or decreased socioeconomic status (71% reduction).","['Darmstadt GL', 'Osendarp SJ', 'Ahmed S', 'Feldman C', 'Van Raaij JM', 'Baqui AH', 'Hautvast JG', 'Fuchs GJ']",2012,31,4,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Darmstadt GL, et al.

22187567,Predominant Dissemination of PVL-Negative CC89 MRSA with SCCmec Type II in Children with Impetigo in Japan.,"Background. The ratio of CA-MRSA in children with impetigo has been increasing in Japan. Methods. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of 136 S. aureus isolates from children with impetigo were studied. Furthermore, molecular epidemiological analysis and virulence gene analysis were performed. Results. Of the 136 S. aureus isolates, 122 (89.7%) were MSSA and 14 (10.3%) were MRSA. Of the 14 MRSA strains, 11 belonged to CC89 (ST89, ST91, and ST2117) and carried diverse types of SCCmec: type II (IIb: 3 strains; unknown subtype: 4 strains), type IVa (2 strains), and unknown type (2 strains). The remaining three strains exhibited CC8 (ST-8)-SCCmec type VIa, CC121 (ST121)-SCCmec type V, and CC5 (ST5)-nontypeable SCCmec element, respectively. None were lukS-PV-lukF-PV gene positive. Gentamicin- and clarithromycin-resistant strains were frequently found in both MRSA and MSSA. Conclusions. PVL-negative CC89-SCCmec type II strains are the most predominant strains among the CA-MRSA strains circulating in the community in Japan.","['Kikuta H', 'Shibata M', 'Nakata S', 'Yamanaka T', 'Sakata H', 'Akizawa K', 'Kobayashi K']",2011,2011,,Int J Pediatr,"Kikuta H, et al.

22070701,Skin disease in the first two years of life in Aboriginal children in East Arnhem Land.,"BACKGROUND: The most common skin infections affecting children in remote Aboriginal communities are scabies and impetigo. Group A streptococcal skin infections are linked to the high rates of heart and renal disease occurring in Aboriginal Australians.
METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted in a primary health care centre in the East Arnhem region of the Northern Territory. Data was collected from all presentations to the clinic in the first 2 years of life for 99 children born between 2001 and 2005 as a component of the East Arnhem Regional Healthy Skin Project.
RESULTS: The median number of presentations to the clinic in the first 2 years of life was 32. Skin disease was recorded in 22% of all presentations. By 1 year of age 82% of children had presented to the clinic with their first episode of impetigo and 68% with their first episode of scabies. Antibiotics were administered to 49% of children with impetigo.
CONCLUSION: Skin infections are a major reason for presentation to primary health clinics and contribute to the high disease burden experienced by children in the first 2 years of life. This high frequency of presentation provides multiple opportunities for intervention and monitoring.","['McMeniman E', 'Holden L', 'Kearns T', 'Clucas DB', 'Carapetis JR', 'Currie BJ', 'Connors C', 'Andrews RM']",2011,52,4,Australas J Dermatol,"McMeniman E, et al.

22050223,Cysteine proteinase SpeB from Streptococcus pyogenes - a potent modifier of immunologically important host and bacterial proteins.,"Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is an exclusively human pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from pharyngitis, to impetigo, to toxic shock, to necrotizing fasciitis. The diversity of these disease states necessitates that S. pyogenes possess the ability to modulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. SpeB, a cysteine proteinase, is the predominant secreted protein from S. pyogenes. Because of its relatively indiscriminant specificity, this enzyme has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix, cytokines, chemokines, complement components, immunoglobulins, and serum protease inhibitors, to name but a few of the known substrates. Additionally, SpeB regulates other streptococcal proteins by degrading them or releasing them from the bacterial surface. Despite the wealth of literature on putative SpeB functions, there remains much controversy about this enzyme because many of reported activities would produce contradictory physiological results. Here we review all known host and bacterial protein substrates for SpeB, their cleavage sites, and discuss the role of this enzyme in streptococcal pathogenesis based on the current literature.","['Nelson DC', 'Garbe J', 'Collin M']",2011,392,12,Biol Chem,"Nelson DC, et al.

22041881,Ritodrine-induced pustular eruptions distinctly resembling impetigo herpetiformis.,"A 27-year-old nulligravida woman without a history of dermatosis was hospitalized for threatened preterm labor at 29 weeks' gestation; therefore, continuous infusion of ritodrine hydrochloride was started. At 31 weeks' gestation, erythematous plaques appeared and spread over the body surface; therefore, a topical steroid preparation was applied. At 32 weeks' gestation, the eruptions developed into irregular annular areas of erythema with multiple pustules accompanied by severe itching, and oral prednisolone treatment was started. Bacterial cultures of the pustules were negative, and a crural cutaneous biopsy revealed Kogoj's spongiform pustules. Based on the clinicopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis was impetigo herpetiformis, which causes cutaneous symptoms closely resembling pustular psoriasis in pregnant females without a history of psoriasis. To rule out ritodrine-induced pustular eruptions, the ritodrine infusion was stopped and treatment with an MgSO(4) preparation was started at 33 weeks' 3 days' gestation; however, the uterine contractions could not be suppressed. Because of the patient's highly edematous, severely painful feet, a cesarean section was performed the same day. Within several days of delivery, the eruptions began to resolve, and no recurrence was observed after treatment with oral prednisolone was stopped 31 days after delivery. On the basis of a positive patch test for ritodrine, we diagnosed pustular drug eruptions caused by ritodrine hydrochloride. Although ritodrine-induced pathognomonic cutaneous eruptions are rare, we would like to emphasize that ritodrine can cause drug-induced pustular eruptions distinctly resembling life-threatening impetigo herpetiformis.","['Kuwabara Y', 'Sato A', 'Abe H', 'Abe S', 'Kawai N', 'Takeshita T']",2011,78,5,J Nippon Med Sch,"Kuwabara Y, et al.

22037857,Incidence of Vesicobullous and Erosive Disorders of Neonates: Where and How Much to Worry?,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of dermatoses in neonates, stress the importance of simple noninvasive diagnostic procedures with perspective to actual need of active intervention.
METHODS: Forty four neonates with vesicobullous lesions in Departments of Dermatology and Pediatrics were evaluated with respect to diagnosis, required treatments and follow ups.
RESULTS: Of the total 44 neonates, 29 were boys and 15 girls. Low birth weight (weight at birth less than 2,500 g as per WHO criteria) was seen in 19 neonates. Of the infectious dermatoses, most common were pyodermas. Four cases (9%) were diagnosed to be of staphylococcal pyoderma and impetigo and two cases each of Group A Streptococcal impetigo and neonatal tinea faciei (4.5% each), one case each of neonatal candidiasis, neonatal varicella/chickenpox and scabies (2.3% each) were seen. Of the transient skin lesions, erythema toxicum neonatorum was commonest of all, being seen in 18 neonates (41%), followed by four cases (9%) of miliaria crystallina, three cases of neonatal acne (6.8%) and two cases of sucking blisters (4.5%) and one case each of transient neonatal pustular melanosis, epidermolysis bullosa simplex, incontinentia pigmentii, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, pemphigus vulgaris and neonatal herpes simplex (2.3% each) were enrolled in this study (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Piechart showing percentage and number of neonates with different diagnostic profiles in the study CONCLUSIONS: Certain specific considerations have to be born in mind while evaluating and managing neonatal dermatoses. Care has to be instituted to identify accurately infectious diseases and distinguish them from benign transient neonatal dermatoses. Some disorders first manifesting during the neonatal period may also represent harbingers of potential problems during adulthood. Finally, treatment modalities are instituted taking in account the actual diagnosis and judging if the treatment really is required or not.","['Goyal T', 'Varshney A', 'Bakshi SK']",2021,88,6,Indian J Pediatr,"Goyal T, et al.

22037070,"Prevalence of dermatological lesions in hospitalized children at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.","OBJECTIVE: Skin disorders constitute a significant proportion of consultations in children's clinics; however, there is a paucity of data on the prevalence of dermatological lesions in hospitalized children in Nigeria. This study determines the prevalence of dermatological lesions in hospitalized children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 402 children aged three months to twelve years admitted in the Pediatric wards of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, were enrolled over a six-month period. Examination of the skin and its appendages was done for each patient. Data on the socioeconomic status, hygiene, and health-related factors were also obtained using a structured questionnaire.
RESULTS: Over 96% of the children had at least one identifiable skin lesion. The five leading skin lesions were post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (49.5%), BCG scar (28.4%), Mongolian spots (27.1%), junctional melanocytic nevi (20.1%), and cafι-au-lait macules (18.4%). The leading infectious skin disease was pyoderma (13.4%), followed by tinea capitis (6.7%).

Microsporum canis infection in tinea faciei has not been widely documented. To review cases of tinea faciei due to M. canis in children diagnosed at the Dermatology Clinic, University of Cagliari. Between 1990 and 2009, all children with dermatophyte infections of the facial skin were recruited for the study after parental consent. Diagnosis was made through direct microscopic and cultural examination. Age, sex, clinical form, illness duration, identified dermatophyte, source of infection, and treatment were recorded. Forty-six cases of tinea faciei due to M. canis in children aged 11 months to 15 years (29 male/17 female) were diagnosed. In 42 (91.3%) children, the illness was the result of contact with pets, and 4 (8.7%) cases resulted from contact with children affected by tinea capitis due to M. canis. Clinical manifestations were typical ringworm in 34 (74%) patients, whereas in 12 (26%) cases, atypical forms mimicking atopic dermatitis, impetigo, lupus erythematosus, and periorificial dermatitis were observed. In 18 (39%) cases, involvement of the vellus hair follicle was documented as ectothrix invasion. Topical or systemic antifungal therapy was effective in all patients. Tinea faciei shows a complex spectrum of differential diagnosis and age-related variations with respect to other superficial dermatophytosis. M. canis is the main organism responsible in children residing in Cagliari, capitol city of Sardinia, Italy. Close collaboration with veterinary and educational programs within infant communities are required for adequate prevention.","['Atzori L', 'Aste N', 'Aste N', 'Pau M']",2012,29,4,Pediatr Dermatol,"Atzori L, et al.

21904634,NVC-422 topical gel for the treatment of impetigo.,"Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection affecting children worldwide that is caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both. Staphylococcus species can quickly develop drug resistance rendering mupirocin, fusidic acid, and erythromycin ineffective. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that NVC-422 (N, N-dichloro-2, 2-dimethyltaurine) rapidly kills pathogens without the development of drug resistance. 129 patients with clinically diagnosed impetigo were randomized to three dose groups (0.1, 0.5, or 1.5% NVC-422 topical gel) in a study conducted at 2 centers; 125 patients (97%) had microbiologically confirmed infection. Treatment was administered three times a day (TID) for 7 days to all randomized subjects. Response was measured at the completion of treatment (Day 8) and 1 week post treatment (Day 15) by the Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) and by microbiological response. A total of 120 subjects (96%) completed all 7 days of treatment and were assessed at end of treatment (EOT). Clinical response rate at EOT in the PPC population was excellent in each of the dose groups (84.6%, 87.2%, and 92.3% in the 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% dose groups respectively). The majority of the infections were caused by S. aureus, alone (106/125, 85%) of which approximately 10% were MRSA. There were no clinical recurrences in any treatment groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events were seen in 5.4% of the subjects (7/129) and were mild to moderate and resolved. NVC-422 topical gel administered TID was well tolerated, with high rates of clinical and microbiological responses for treating impetigo.","['Iovino SM', 'Krantz KD', 'Blanco DM', 'Fernández JA', 'Ocampo N', 'Najafi A', 'Memarzadeh B', 'Celeri C', 'Debabov D', 'Khosrovi B', 'Anderson M']",2011,4,6,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,"Iovino SM, et al.

21895848,Topical antibiotic trends from 1993 to 2007: use of topical antibiotics for non-evidence-based indications.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic antibiotic use has become more conservative with the emergence of drug resistance. Topical antibiotics are employed for a variety of indications, although there are only a few evidence-based indications.
OBJECTIVE: To examine topical antibiotics use in the outpatient setting.
METHODS: Topical antibiotic use was characterized using data from the 1993 to 2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Visits were identified at which a topical antibiotic was used and analyzed according to patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, concomitant medications, and provider specialty. Topical antibiotic use over time was analyzed using linear regression.
RESULTS: The most frequent diagnoses associated with topical antibiotic use were benign or malignant neoplasm of skin, impetigo, insect bite, and cellulitis. Data revealed a significant downward trend in topical antibiotics associated with dermatologic surgery (p<.001) and a nonsignificant downward trend in use in conjunction with skin biopsies (p=.09). Topical antibiotic use by dermatologists was noted to be decreasing over time, whereas among non dermatologists, it was noted to be increasing, although neither of these trends was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Topical antibiotics continue to be used for non-evidence-based indications, despite data that suggest that such use may be detrimental for patients and represents significant costs to the health care system. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.","['Lapolla WJ', 'Levender MM', 'Davis SA', 'Yentzer BA', 'Williford PM', 'Feldman SR']",2011,37,10,Dermatol Surg,"Lapolla WJ, et al.

21858724,Modelling of the outcome of non-inferiority trials by integration of historical data.,"The approval and differentiation of new compounds in clinical development often demands non-inferiority trials, in which the test drug is compared against a reference treatment. However, non-inferiority trials impose major operational burden with serious ethical and scientific implications for the development of new medicines. Traditional approaches make limited use of historical information on placebo and neglect inter-trial variability, relying on the constancy assumption that the control-to-placebo effect size is maintained across trials. We propose a model-based approach that overcomes such limitations and may be used as a tool to explore differentiation during clinical development. Parameter distributions are introduced which reflect the heterogeneity of trials. The method is illustrated using data from impetigo trials. Based on simulation scenarios, this Bayesian technique yields a definitive, consistent increase in the statistical power over two accepted statistical methods, allowing lower sample size requirements for the assessment of non-inferiority.","['Russu A', 'van Zwet E', 'De Nicolao G', 'Della Pasqua O']",2011,38,5,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,"Russu A, et al.

21779755,[Inflammatory dermatoses].,"The seven basic patterns of inflammatory dermatoses according to Ackerman can be applied to infectious dermatoses. However, it should be borne in mind that infection caused by one agent may induce differing patterns according to the stage of disease. Dermatophytosis and the arthropod reaction belong to perivascular dermatoses with spongiosis. Secondary syphilis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans regularly show a lichenoid infiltrate with interface dermatitis, whereas epidermal involvement is typically absent in erythema migrans, virus exanthema and bacillary angiomatosis. Lupus vulgaris, atypic mycobacteriosis, lepra, actinomycosis, cutaneous leishmaniosis and erysipelas belong to the nodular and diffuse dermatoses. In the group of vasculitides, septic vasculitis is induced by a biological agent, and the pattern of vesicular dermatitis is reflected by infections with herpes viruses, impetigo contagiosa and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. Follicular dermatitis shows a pattern of furuncles and carbuncles which are mainly caused by bacteria or fungi.","['Schacht V', 'Kapp A']",2011,32,5,Pathologe,Schacht V and Kapp A.

21762381,Acrodermatitis enteropathica: an uncommon differential diagnosis in childhood - first description of a new sequence variant.,"An 11-month-old boy was brought to our clinic with superinfected, sharply-defined, symmetrical, erythematous macules and vesicles, some with yellowish-brownish crusts, on the cheeks, fingers, and in the diaper region. The suspected impetigo contagiosa had failed to respond to both topical antiseptic therapy and systemic antibiotics. Because of the unusual clinical picture and course, we measured the serum zinc level. A significantly reduced level of 2 μmol/l (normal range 9.2-18.4 μmol/l) was identified. Initial skin lesions had appeared one week after weaning (5th week after birth). Since the age of 8 months the infant had also had recurrent diarrhea. Two weeks after zinc-histidine substitution, the diarrhea ceased and skin lesions slowly disappeared. Molecular genetic testing for the SLC39A4 (zinc transporter) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for the previously unidentified mutations c.1465_1474+4del (p.?) and c.295G>A (p.Ala99Thr). The parents are healthy heterozygous gene carriers. The same compound heterozygosity was later detected in the newborn brother of our patient shortly after birth. A zinc deficiency could therefore be identified and treated before symptoms occurred. The inherited autosomal recessive zinc transporter deficiency is termed acrodermatitis enteropathica. Lifelong zinc substitution is recommended. A differential diagnosis can be difficult because bacterial and fungal superinfection is common in zinc deficiency. Precise diagnosis requires testing family members for the gene.","['Jung AG', 'Mathony UA', 'Behre B', 'Küry S', 'Schmitt S', 'Zouboulis CC', 'Lippert U']",2011,9,12,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Jung AG, et al.

The development of new genomic microbiological techniques has revealed that the bacterial ecology of human skin is far more complex than previously imagined and includes many fastidious or noncultivable bacterial species which are found on both normal and diseased skin. In nature, the predominant bacterial phenotype on epithelial surfaces is that of organisms organized within a biofilm. This contrasts with the widely held belief that bacteria are planktonic, i.e. free-floating single cells. Biofilms are sessile bacterial communities encased in an extracellular matrix that have a well-developed communication system and can regulate bacterial growth and metabolism, confer resistance to antimicrobials and to host inflammatory cells, and alter host metabolism. Biofilms have been observed on healthy skin and in a number of dermatological conditions, including some that were previously thought not to have an infectious aetiology.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study including 90 cases of skin infection observed in dermatological outpatients at the teaching Hospital of Lomé was carried out from 1st June 2003 to 30th May 2005. A bacteriological sample with antibiograms was obtained from all patients.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 21 years (extremes, 6 months to 78 years). The male-to- female ratio was 0.84. Infection was primary in 80% of cases including impetigo in 42.2%, follicular infection in 28.9%, and abscess in 8.9% and secondary in 20% of cases including eczema in 8.9%, mycosis in 3.3%, and other in 7.8%.

From early infancy, the patient showed repeated episodes of refractory chronic eczema accompanied by impetigo vulgaris with cicatrization, as well as otitis media. Serum IgE was markedly increased (from 4,000 to 25,000 IU/ml). The nephrotic syndrome (NS) frequently relapsed, and was alternately responsive and resistant to corticosteroids. The STAT3 mutation was heterozygous, located in exon 23 of the transactivation domain and causing A744V substitution. Presently treated with mycophenolate mofetil, the patient has less frequent MCNS recurrences. Increases in circulating Th2 cytokines and IgE combined with suppression of the Th1 cytokine interferon-γ caused by the STAT3 abnormality, presumably caused MCNS by altering the Th1/Th2 balance among T-lymphocytes.

An exi gene was isolated from chromosomal DNA of an S. pseudintermedius strain obtained from a pustule of a dog with impetigo, and was used to produce a recombinant EXI by Escherichia coli expression. When purified recombinant EXI was injected intradermally into normal dogs, it caused the development of vesicles or erosions with superficial epidermal splitting. In addition, the EXI abolished immunofluorescence for Dsg1, but not for Dsg3, at the injection sites. Moreover, the EXI directly degraded baculovirus-secreted recombinant extracellular domains of canine Dsg1, but not that of canine Dsg3, in vitro. The EXI also degraded mouse Dsg1α and swine Dsg1, but not human Dsg1, mouse Dsg1β and Dsg1γ. Conversely, recombinant SIET, previously designated as S. intermedius exfoliative toxin, did not cause intraepidermal splitting or degradation of any Dsgs. These findings indicate that EXI has a proteolytic activity that digests canine Dsg1, and this characteristic might be involved in the pathogenesis of intraepidermal splitting in canine impetigo.","['Iyori K', 'Futagawa-Saito K', 'Hisatsune J', 'Yamamoto M', 'Sekiguchi M', 'Ide K', 'Son WG', 'Olivry T', 'Sugai M', 'Fukuyasu T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Nishifuji K']",2011,22,4,Vet Dermatol,"Iyori K, et al.

21402986,Common features of periocular tinea.,"OBJECTIVE: To present the common features of periocular tinea to aid physicians in future diagnosis and therapy of this condition, because superficial fungal infections on the face are often misdiagnosed owing to the diverse morphologies that they manifest. This is especially true of dermatophytoses involving the periocular region.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with a diagnosis of periocular tinea who were seen between January 2003 and September 2009 in the pediatric dermatology clinic at St. Louis Children's Hospital.
RESULTS: Ten cases of periocular tinea were identified (6 male patients and 4 female patients). Common features included prolonged misdiagnosis (all 10 cases), a normal ophthalmologic examination (all 10 cases), and inappropriate corticosteroid application (7 cases). Loss of the eyelashes occurred in all 10 patients. No cases had evidence of other tinea infections on examination. Only 2 cases had the central clearing classically associated with tinea corporis. Seven patients had a potassium hydroxide preparation and/or culture positive for fungal elements. Lesions improved with topical and oral antifungal treatment in all cases, and patients were able to regrow their eyelashes.
CONCLUSION: Periocular tinea should be considered in the differential diagnosis for periocular inflammation, especially in those patients refractory to therapy for more common conditions. Loss of the eyelashes is characteristic of these fungal infections, similar to the hair loss that occurs in kerions associated with tinea capitis.","['Basak SA', 'Berk DR', 'Lueder GT', 'Bayliss SJ']",2011,129,3,Arch Ophthalmol,"Basak SA, et al.

21393202,"Impetigo in a population over 8.5 years: incidence, fusidic acid resistance and molecular characteristics.","OBJECTIVES: From around year 2000, impetigo caused by fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed in countries of Northern Europe. The bacteria were found to represent a clone, the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC). This study reports longitudinal data on the incidence and bacteriology of impetigo in a Norwegian island community during the years 2001-09.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All encounters with general practitioners regarding impetigo were registered. Bacterial swabs were taken in a high percentage of cases. Annual incidence was calculated. Phenotypic characteristics of the bacteria were determined for the whole period, and in 2008 and 2009 we also performed PFGE and spa typing.
RESULTS: Outbreaks of impetigo were observed in 2002, 2003 and 2004, but since then the incidence decreased greatly. S. aureus was cultured from the impetigo site in the majority of cases. The proportion of S. aureus isolates resistant to fusidic acid decreased from 80% in 2002-04 to 45% in 2008-09. For 28 S. aureus isolates analysed by molecular methods in 2008-09, we found that nearly all cases of fusidic acid resistance were due to the presence of the EEFIC.
CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus resistance to fusidic acid in relation to impetigo is now less frequent in this population than at the start of the century. At present, most S. aureus bacteria resistant to fusidic acid in impetigo belong to the EEFIC.","['Rørtveit S', 'Skutlaberg DH', 'Langeland N', 'Rortveit G']",2011,66,6,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Rørtveit S, et al.

21349691,Effect of manuka honey on the expression of universal stress protein A in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that can cause many problems, from impetigo to endocarditis. With its continued resistance to multiple antibiotics, S. aureus remains a serious health threat. Honey has been used to eradicate meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains from wounds, but its mode of action is not yet understood. Proteomics provides a potent group of techniques that can be used to analyse differences in protein expression between untreated bacterial cells and those treated with inhibitory concentrations of manuka honey. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis was combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to determine the identities of proteins whose levels of expression were changed at least two-fold following treatment with manuka honey. Protein extracts were obtained from cells grown in tryptone soy broth (with or without manuka honey) by mechanical disruption and were separated on 2D polyacrylamide gels. A protein was isolated in gels prepared from untreated cell extract that was absent from gels made using honey-treated cell extract. Using MALDI-TOF MS, the protein was identified as universal stress protein A (UspA). Downregulation of this protein was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which showed a 16-fold downregulation in honey-treated cells compared with untreated samples. This protein is involved in the stress stamina response and its downregulation could help to explain the inhibition of MRSA by manuka honey.","['Jenkins R', 'Burton N', 'Cooper R']",2011,37,4,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"Jenkins R, et al.

21327935,Dissemination of multiple MRSA clones among community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections from Japanese children with impetigo.,"The proportion of MRSA strains that cause skin and soft infections has recently increased. In 3 months we have characterized 17 MRSA strains isolated from children with impetigo at a Japanese hospital. Seventeen MRSA strains belonged to 7 clones defined by clonal complex (CC) in MLST genotype and type of SCCmec, which were rarely identified among healthcare-associated MRSA: CC 91-SCCmecIIb (4 strains); CC91-SCCmecIIn (2 strains); CC91-SCCmecIVa (2 strains); CC91-SCCmecV (4 strains); CC88-SCCmecIVg (3 strains); CC1-SCCmecIVc (1 strain); and CC5-SCCmecIVn (1 strain). Although one strain belonged to CC5, which has been commonly identified in healthcare-associated MRSA, it did not carry type II SCCmec, but carried type IV SCCmec. Fourteen of the 17 strains carried exfoliative toxin a or b gene, and none carried Panton-Valentine leukocidine gene. Furthermore, we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of two type V SCCmec elements carried by strains JCSC5952, a CC91 strain, and TSGH17, a Taiwanese CC59 strain. The structure of SCCmecJCSC5952 was more than 99% homologous in nucleotide identity with those of Taiwanese PVL-positive ST59 MRSA strains TSGH17 and PM1, which were designated as type V (5C2&5). Identification of multiple MRSA clones distinct from those disseminating at the hospital suggests that MRSA strains might be emerging in the community from MSSA strains by acquiring SCCmec elements on various occasions. Carriage of the similar type V(5C2&5) SCCmec element by strains of distinct genetic backgrounds, CC91 and CC59, suggested horizontal transfer of the SCCmec element.","['Hisata K', 'Ito T', 'Matsunaga N', 'Komatsu M', 'Jin J', 'Li S', 'Watanabe S', 'Shimizu T', 'Hiramatsu K']",2011,17,5,J Infect Chemother,"Hisata K, et al.

21282415,Regulatory mechanism for exfoliative toxin production in Staphylococcus aureus.,"The exfoliative toxin (ET) is a major virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus that causes bullous impetigo and its disseminated form, staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS). ET selectively digests one of the intracellular adhesion molecules, desmoglein 1, of epidermal keratinocytes and causes blisters due to intraepidermal cell-cell dissociation. Most S. aureus strains that cause blistering disease produce either ETA or ETB. They are serologically distinct molecules, where ETA is encoded on a phage genome and ETB is enocded on a large plasmid. ETA-producing S. aureus strains are frequently isolated from impetigo patients, and ETB-producing S. aureus strains are isolated from SSSS. ET-induced blister formation can be reproduced with the neonatal mouse. To determine the regulatory mechanism of ET production, we investigated the role of the two-component systems and global regulators for eta or etb expression in vitro and in vivo with the mouse model. Western blot and transcription analyses using a series of mutants demonstrate ETA production was downregulated by sigB, sarS, and sarA, while ETB production was downregulated by sigB and sarA but not by sarS. Production of both toxins is upregulated by saeRS, arlRS, and agrCA. Furthermore, by the in vivo neonatal mouse model, sigB and sarS but not sarA negatively regulate the exfoliation activity of the ETA-producing strain, while sarA negatively regulates the ETB-producing strain. In both strains, saeRS, arlRS, and agrCA positively regulate the exfoliation activity in vivo. The data illustrate similar but distinct regulatory mechanisms for ETA and ETB production in S. aureus in vitro as well as in vivo.","['Kato F', 'Kadomoto N', 'Iwamoto Y', 'Bunai K', 'Komatsuzawa H', 'Sugai M']",2011,79,4,Infect Immun,"Kato F, et al.

To ascertain secular trends of S. aureus infections in primary healthcare in Denmark, we conducted this register-based study in the North Denmark region, during the period 1997-2008. We identified all skin and mucosa specimens obtained by general practitioners and all prescriptions for the preferred oral anti-staphylococcal antibiotic, dicloxacillin. Repeat observations within a 12-month period were excluded prior to the calculation of age and gender standardised incidence rates per 100,000 person-years. We included 108,758 specimens, of which 42,778 (39%) yielded S. aureus. The annual incidence rate of specimens doubled during the study period, reaching 2,399 in 2008. The overall rate of S. aureus isolates increased 2-fold to a stable rate at about 850, but for isolates from children and for impetigo specimens, the increase was steeper, with a peak in 2002. A total of 156,462 dicloxacillin prescriptions had been redeemed and the annual prescription rate increased 2.5-fold, peaking at 3,714 in 2007. In conclusion, the annual rates of specimens, S. aureus infections and dicloxacillin prescriptions more than doubled in primary healthcare during the 12-year study period. A major impetigo epidemic and calls for antibiotic stewardship with increased utilisation of specimens were contributing factors.","['Dalager-Pedersen M', 'Søgaard M', 'Schønheyder HC']",2011,30,8,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Dalager-Pedersen M, et al.

In this case report we discuss a 28-year-old pregnant woman, G3P1011, with a history of impetigo herpetiformis in the first pregnancy, who presented with generalized pustular lesions at 30 weeks' gestation. Her disease responded poorly to corticosteroids and was more severe than in the previous pregnancy. She delivered prematurely at 34 weeks' gestation and then received aggressive postpartum treatment with methotrexate, resulting in a dramatic response. This case supports the current understanding that recurrent impetigo herpetiformis in subsequent pregnancy tends to be more severe and to have an earlier onset.

There were a total of 390 boys and 310 girls. The majority of skin conditions in newborns are transient. The most common dermatoses found were of infectious etiology (38.43%) in which impetigo (11.13%) and pyoderma (8.9%) were the most common. In infectious etiology, incidence of scabies was 5.32%. Viral warts were the most common viral infections followed by molluscum contagiosum. Incidence of eczema, atopic dermatitis, and sweat gland disorders were 6.64%, 0.83%, and 8.86%, respectively. The study shows various unique features of tropical pediatric dermatology in a developing country, such as high frequency of infections and infectious, nutritional, and environmentally associated disorders.

While some authors highlight the existence of premises allowing several skin disorders to be re-grouped within broader disease concepts, others underline the absence of clear, undisputed etiopathogenetic data that could support such classifications. This review exhaustively analyzes the various pregnancy dermatoses (pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, and the papular dermatoses of pregnancy [prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and the new classification, atopic eruption of pregnancy]) in an attempt to shed light over this confusing and disputed domain, while subsequently offering an algorithmic approach to their diagnosis and management. While for pemphigus gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and impetigo herpetiformis, specific diagnostic tests such as histopathology, immunofluorescence, or laboratory investigations will confirm the diagnosis, the identification of the other types of pregnancy dermatoses is based only on clinical criteria. In this context, the review argues for the inclusion of the whole group represented by the papular dermatoses of pregnancy within the broad spectrum of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, separating each of these entities by focusing on their onset: early-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (comprising prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and atopic eruption of pregnancy) and late-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.

The dominant Th2-response characteristic for pregnancy may explain why atopic eczema or lupus erythematosus may deteriorate while psoriasis vulgaris may improve. In contrast, impetigo herpetiformis frequently shows a severe course. Lupus erythematosus and other autoantibody-triggered dermatoses like pemphigus vulgaris pose an increased risk for the child because of placental transfer of autoantibodies with specific skin changes or systemic manifestations of the disease as well as placental insufficiency, growth retardation and premature birth. Such risks are not associated with linear IgA dermatosis. A severe pityriasis rosea during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of abortion or premature delivery.

21075858,Plakoglobin rescues adhesive defects induced by ectodomain truncation of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 1: implications for exfoliative toxin-mediated skin blistering.,"Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) is a desmosomal cadherin that is essential to epidermal integrity. In the blistering diseases bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, pathogenesis depends on cleavage of Dsg1 by a bacterial protease, exfoliative toxin A, which removes residues 1 to 381 of the Dsg1 ectodomain. However, the cellular responses to Dsg1 cleavage that precipitate keratinocyte separation to induce blister formation are unknown. Here, we show that ectodomain-deleted Dsg1 (Δ381-Dsg1) mimics the toxin-cleaved cadherin, disrupts desmosomes, and reduces the mechanical integrity of keratinocyte sheets. In addition, we demonstrate that truncated Dsg1 remains associated with its catenin partner, plakoglobin, and causes a reduction in the levels of endogenous desmosomal cadherins in a dose-dependent manner, leading us to hypothesize that plakoglobin sequestration by truncated Dsg1 destabilizes other cadherins. Accordingly, a triple-point mutant of the ectodomain-deleted cadherin, which is uncoupled from plakoglobin, does not impair adhesion, indicating that this interaction is essential to the pathogenic potential of truncated Dsg1. Moreover, we demonstrate that increasing plakoglobin levels rescues cadherin expression, desmosome organization, and functional adhesion in cells expressing Δ381-Dsg1 or treated with exfoliative toxin A. Finally, we report that histone deacetylase inhibition up-regulates desmosomal cadherins and prevents the loss of adhesion induced by Dsg1 truncation. These findings further our understanding of the mechanism of exfoliative toxin-induced pathology and suggest novel strategies to suppress blistering in bulbous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome.","['Simpson CL', 'Kojima S', 'Cooper-Whitehair V', 'Getsios S', 'Green KJ']",2010,177,6,Am J Pathol,"Simpson CL, et al.

Of the 72 patients with ≥3 months of follow-up (mean, 29 months), 22% achieved complete recovery, 44% had persistent renal dysfunction, and 33% progressed to ESRD. The presence of diabetes, higher creatinine at biopsy, dialysis at presentation, the presence of diabetic glomerulosclerosis, and greater tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis predicted ESRD. In summary, the epidemiology of PIGN is shifting as the population ages. Older men and patients with diabetes or malignancy are particularly at risk, and the sites of infection and causative organisms differ from the typical childhood disease. Prognosis for these older patients is poor, with fewer than 25% recovering full renal function.","['Nasr SH', 'Fidler ME', 'Valeri AM', 'Cornell LD', 'Sethi S', 'Zoller A', 'Stokes MB', 'Markowitz GS', ""D'Agati VD""]",2011,22,1,J Am Soc Nephrol,"Nasr SH, et al.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of childhood AD with these infections by conducting a population-based cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 1117 children aged 0-6 years old attending nursery schools in Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Physical examination was performed by dermatologists, and a questionnaire was completed on each child's history of allergic diseases including AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and egg allergy, and that of skin infections including IC, MC and HI, as well as familial history of AD.
RESULTS: In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher in AD children than in non-AD children. Meanwhile, a history of MC was significantly correlated to the male gender, but not to a personal history of AD. As for HI, we found no correlated factors in this study.

20941943,Retapamulin: an antibacterial with a novel mode of action in an age of emerging resistance to Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.","['Weinberg JM', 'Tyring SK']",2010,9,10,J Drugs Dermatol,Weinberg JM and Tyring SK.

Recently, an exfoliative toxin gene (exi) was identified in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from canine pyoderma. The aim of this study was to identify novel exfoliative toxin genes in S. pseudintermedius. Here, we describe a novel orf in the genome of S. pseudintermedius isolated from canine impetigo, whose deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to that of the SHETB exfoliative toxin from Staphylococcus hyicus (70.4%). The ORF recombinant protein caused skin exfoliation and abolished cell surface staining of Dsg1 in canine skin. Moreover, the ORF protein degraded the recombinant extracellular domains of canine Dsg1, but not Dsg3, in vitro. PCR analysis revealed that the orf was present in 23.2% (23/99) of S. pseudintermedius isolates from dogs with superficial pyoderma exhibiting various clinical phenotypes, while the occurrence in S. pseudintermedius isolates from healthy dogs was 6.1% (3/49). In summary, this newly found orf in S. pseudintermedius encodes a novel exfoliative toxin, which targets a cell-cell adhesion molecule in canine epidermis and might be involved in a broad spectrum of canine pyoderma.","['Iyori K', 'Hisatsune J', 'Kawakami T', 'Shibata S', 'Murayama N', 'Ide K', 'Nagata M', 'Fukata T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Oshima K', 'Hattori M', 'Sugai M', 'Nishifuji K']",2010,312,2,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Iyori K, et al.

20831651,Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in an extremely low-birth-weight neonate: molecular characterization and rapid detection by multiplex and real-time PCR of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"BACKGROUND:   Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) producing exfoliative toxin (ET), is a life-threatening infection for neonates in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). SSSS in extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) neonates is rare. A new class of MRSA (community-acquired MRSA, CA-MRSA) has been emerging in the community. The aim of this study was to characterize MRSA from an ELBW neonate with SSSS, and to develop rapid detection methods for SSSS-associated and emerging pediatric MRSA.
METHODS:   An ELBW infant in the NICU developed SSSS on day 16 after birth. Isolated MRSA was genetically characterized and compared with CA-MRSA from bullous impetigo (biCA-MRSA), which is positive for the ET and collagen-adhesin (CNA) genes in many cases, and the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) gene rarely. Specific primers and probes for five virulence genes (for ETA, ETB, ETD, PVL, CNA) were designed for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR.
RESULTS:   MRSA strain H5 from SSSS exhibited the genotype (ST91, spa416[t375], agr3, SCCmecIVa, CoaI), and possessed the ETB and CNA genes, similar to ST91 biCA-MRSA (albeit with a divergence). Multiplex PCR detected the ETB and CNA genes of strain H5, and real-time PCR detected strain H5 at as low as 10(2)  CFU/mL. The assays were 100% specific and 100% sensitive, for the five virulence genes.
CONCLUSION:   ETB-positive ST91 MRSA, which was very similar to ST91 biCA-MRSA, was isolated from an ELBW infant with SSSS. The multiplex and real-time PCR assays specifically or quantitatively detected SSSS-associated and emerging pediatric MRSA.","['Shi D', 'Ishii S', 'Sato T', 'Yamazaki H', 'Matsunaga M', 'Higuchi W', 'Takano T', 'Yabe S', 'Tanaka K', 'Yamamoto T']",2011,53,2,Pediatr Int,"Shi D, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients with different clinical forms of chronic pyoderma (furunculosis, hydradenitis, chronic ulcerative and ulcerative-vegetans pyoderma, folliculitis, impetigo etc.) were studied. Fifty-nine patients received immunotherapy with Immunovac vaccine together with basic therapy and 36 patients comprised control group treated only with basic therapy. Studied immunologic parameters were as follows: assessment of functional activity of lymphocytes, determination of lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry, total immunoglobulins classes A, G, M by radial immunoduffusion, affinity of antibodies by enzyme immunoassay, levels of IFNalpha and IFNgamma.
RESULTS: Use of Immunovac vaccine in complex treatment of patients with chronic forms of pyoderma enhanced clinical effect of basic therapy, which expressed in decrease of severity and frequency of disease relapses irrespective to clinical form and severity of pyoderma. Therapeutic effect during use of Immunovac vaccine amounted 84.7%, whereas in control group it was 41.6% after 12 months of follow-up. Increase of functional activity of neutrophils, subpopulation of lymphocytes with markers CD4+, CD8+, CD72+, affinity of antibodies as well as induced production of IFNalpha and IFNgamma was revealed.

20728315,Removal of amino-terminal extracellular domains of desmoglein 1 by staphylococcal exfoliative toxin is sufficient to initiate epidermal blister formation.,"BACKGROUND: In both bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), exfoliative toxins (ETs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus cause superficial intraepidermal blisters. ETs are known to cleave specifically a single peptide bond in the extracellular domains 3 and 4 of desmoglein (Dsg) 1. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ET-induced epidermal blister formation remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cleavage of Dsg1 by an ET is sufficient to induce blister formation in vivo or if the subsequent internalization of cleaved Dsg1 or other desmosomal components is required.
METHODS: Skin samples obtained from neonatal mice injected with ETA were analyzed by time-lapse immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy for desmosomal components.
RESULTS: Epidermal blister formation was observed as early as 60 min after ETA treatment. At this time, the amino-terminal extracellular domains of Dsg1 disappeared from the surface of keratinocytes, while the cleaved carboxy-terminal domain of Dsg1 (Dsg1-C) as well as the extracellular domains of desmocollin 1 (Dsc1-N) remained on the cell surface. Half-split desmosomes with intracytoplasmic dense plaques and attached tonofilaments were recognized ultrastructurally on the split surface of keratinocytes at 60 min. Subsequent to this, Dsg1-C and Dsc1-N gradually disappeared from the surface layer of keratinocytes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the removal of amino-terminal extracellular domains of Dsg1 by ETs is sufficient to initiate epidermal blister formation in bullous impetigo and SSSS.","['Nishifuji K', 'Shimizu A', 'Ishiko A', 'Iwasaki T', 'Amagai M']",2010,59,3,J Dermatol Sci,"Nishifuji K, et al.

20571861,Characterization of transcription within sdr region of Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infections in humans and animals. It causes localized and systemic infections, such as abscesses, impetigo, cellulitis, sepsis, endocarditis, bone infections, and meningitis. S. aureus virulence factors responsible for the initial contact with host cells (MSCRAMMs-microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) include three Sdr proteins. The presence of particular sdr genes is correlated with putative tissue specificity. The transcriptional organization of the sdr region remains unclear. We tested expression of the sdrC, sdrD, or sdrE genes in various in vitro conditions, as well as after contact with human blood. In this work, we present data suggesting a separation of the sdr region into three transcriptional units, based on their differential reactions to the environment. Differential reaction of the sdrD transcript to environmental conditions and blood suggests dissimilar functions of the sdr genes. SdrE has been previously proposed to play role in bone infections, whilst our results can indicate that sdrD plays a role in the interactions between the pathogen and human immune system, serum or specifically reacts to nutrients/other factors present in human blood.","['Sitkiewicz I', 'Babiak I', 'Hryniewicz W']",2011,99,2,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,"Sitkiewicz I, et al.

Therefore, clinicians should keep scabies in mind in their differential diagnosis in a child who presents with severe pruritic, polymorphic skin lesions. Regarding the treatment of scabies, the reported clinical experience with gamma benzene hexachloride (lindane) in young children is quite limited because of its neurotoxicity. However, a recent review suggests that lindane is an excellent alternative drug with minimal risk. We report the case of a 2-month-old male infant with pruritic, erythematous macules, papules, nodules, vesicles, and pustules from the top of the head to the tip of the toes. Initially, he was thought to have impetigo and antibiotics were prescribed. After obtaining a careful history and with the use of skin scraping, he was diagnosed with scabies.

20494994,Variation in Streptococcus pyogenes NAD+ glycohydrolase is associated with tissue tropism.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important pathogen that causes a variety of diseases. The most common infections involve the throat (pharyngitis) or skin (impetigo); however, the factors that determine tissue tropism and severity are incompletely understood. The S. pyogenes NAD(+) glycohydrolase (SPN) is a virulence factor that has been implicated in contributing to the pathogenesis of severe infections. However, the role of SPN in determining the bacterium's tissue tropism has not been evaluated. In this report, we examine the sequences of spn and its endogenous inhibitor ifs from a worldwide collection of S. pyogenes strains. Analysis of average pairwise nucleotide diversity, average number of nucleotide differences, and ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions revealed significant diversity in spn and ifs. Application of established models of molecular evolution shows that SPN is evolving under positive selection and diverging into NAD(+) glycohydrolase (NADase)-active and -inactive subtypes. Additionally, the NADase-inactive SPN subtypes maintain the characteristics of a functional gene while ifs becomes a pseudogene. Thus, NADase-inactive SPN continues to evolve under functional constraint. Furthermore, NADase activity did not correlate with invasive disease in our collection but was associated with tissue tropism. The ability to cause infection at both the pharynx and the skin (""generalist"" strains) is correlated with NADase-active SPN, while the preference for causing infection at either the throat or the skin (""specialist"" strains) is associated with NADase-inactive SPN. These findings suggest that SPN has a NADase-independent function and prompt a reevaluation of the role of SPN in streptococcal pathogenesis.","['Riddle DJ', 'Bessen DE', 'Caparon MG']",2010,192,14,J Bacteriol,"Riddle DJ, et al.

SETTING: Primary healthcare clinics and participant homes in Grahamstown, South Africa.
METHOD: The REALM test, a US-developed test, was administered via an interpreter to 125 Xhosa-speaking, English second language participants from a range of educational backgrounds. Participants were asked to read all 66 words (three lists of 22 words each), and pronunciation was assessed. In a deviation from the standard method, an explanation for each word was requested to evaluate comprehension. Results were classified into four categories: adequately pronounced and comprehended; neither adequately pronounced nor comprehended; adequately pronounced but not comprehended; not adequately pronounced but comprehended. The first two categories were rated as ""applicable"". The percentage of ""applicable"" cases of the total of 8250 cases (125 participants; 66 words each) was calculated. The association between education and both pronunciation and comprehension was investigated using chi-square tests, with a significance level of P < 0.05.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average grade-equivalent reading level; number of words adequately pronounced and comprehended; applicability of the REALM to individual words.
RESULTS: Average grade-equivalent reading level of the study population according to the REALM test was grade 7-8. An average of 46 of 66 words were adequately pronounced, whereas less than half this number (20) were adequately comprehended. Comprehension ability was 57% lower than the ability to adequately pronounce the words, a finding that highlights the inability of pronunciation data to predict comprehension of a health-related text. Examples of poor comprehension include antibiotics (16.0%), fatigue (6.4%), nausea (8.0%), anaemia (2.4%), osteoporosis (0.8%), hepatitis (0.8%), haemorrhoids (0%), impetigo (0%) and colitis (0%). Both pronunciation (P = 0.016) and comprehension (P = 0.001) were significantly influenced by education. Applicability of the REALM to individual words ranged from 20.8 to 96.0%, with an average of 59.1%. Given that the REALM was deemed inapplicable for an average of four out of every 10 words, it appears to be unsuitable for use in its current form for assessing health literacy of the study population.","['Dowse R', 'Lecoko L', 'Ehlers MS']",2010,32,4,Pharm World Sci,"Dowse R, et al.

20470914,[Cutaneous infections in bullous pemphigoid patients treated with topical corticosteroids].,"BACKGROUND: Potent topical corticosteroids (TCS), such as clobetasol propionate are more efficacious than systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of bullous pemphigoid (BP) and in reducing the rate of systemic infectious complications. However, TCS can have cutaneous side effects, such as atrophy and purpura. The risk of cutaneous infections due to TCS in BP is known but has never been studied, despite prolonged use of high doses. Since we noted three cases of fatal necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in patients treated with TCS for BP over a one-year period in our institution, we decided to analyse the frequency of cutaneous infections in all BP patients hospitalized in our department.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre study, all files of patients presenting BP treated with TCS and hospitalized between April 2008 and April 2009 were reviewed. When the clinical file indicated a cutaneous infectious problem, bacteriological data were requested from the bacteriology laboratory. For each patient, clinical data, history, ongoing treatment, type of cutaneous infectious complication, general symptoms and details of outcome were collected.
RESULTS: In the 30 files studied, we found ten cutaneous infections in nine patients: minor complication (three cases of impetiginisation), moderate complications (two erysipelas, one lymphangitis with sepsis, one flexor tendon phlegmon with cutaneous fistula), and severe complications with a fatal course (three NF, one of which had involved erysipelas of favourable outcome a few months earlier). These cutaneous complications occurred after various treatment times (ten days to two years) and various dosages of TCS (two-three tubes/day to two tubes every two days). Three of the nine patients with cutaneous infections had diabetes, in particular two of the three patients with FN. In contrast, four of the 21 patients without cutaneous complications had diabetes. Patients with cutaneous infections did not have more extensive BP or receive more TCS than the others. In two of three patients with NF, an immunosuppressant drug (methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil) had been recently initiated (inferior to one month). The offending organism was Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases (methicillin-resistant in three cases) and Streptococcus A in five cases (three NF, one lymphangitis and one impetiginisation). The outcome was fatal in the three cases of NF but was favourable with local and/or systemic antibiotic therapy in the remaining cases.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we noted cutaneous superinfection in nine of 30 (30%) patients receiving topical corticosteroids for bullous pemphigoid, among which were three cases of fatal NF due to streptococcus A (10%). The infectious risks associated with TCS must not be neglected, particularly since treated patients are old and fragile, and frequently have multiple well-known risk factors for NF (e.g. extensive lesions, diabetes, etc.). In the event of signs of cutaneous superinfection, especially in cases of diabetes and prolonged TCS treatment, bacteriological analysis should be conducted. Adequate treatment should be initiated without delay, especially in cases of beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection.","['Boughrara Z', 'Ingen-Housz-Oro S', 'Legrand P', 'Duong TA', 'Roujeau JC']",2010,137,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Boughrara Z, et al.

20467217,Autoimmune and infectious skin diseases that target desmogleins.,"Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions of epithelial cells that contain two major transmembrane components, the desmogleins (Dsg) and desmocollins (Dsc), which are cadherin-type cell-cell adhesion molecules and are anchored to intermediate filaments of keratin through interactions with plakoglobin and desmoplakin. Desmosomes play an important role in maintaining the proper structure and barrier function of the epidermis and mucous epithelia. Four Dsg isoforms have been identified to date, Dsg1-Dsg4, and are involved in several skin and heart diseases. Dsg1 and Dsg3 are the two major Dsg isoforms in the skin and mucous membranes, and are targeted by IgG autoantibodies in pemphigus, an autoimmune disease of the skin and mucous membranes. Dsg1 is also targeted by exfoliative toxin (ET) released by Staphylococcus aureus in the infectious skin diseases bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). ET is a unique serine protease that shows lock and key specificity to Dsg1. Dsg2 is expressed in all tissues possessing desmosomes, including simple epithelia and myocardia, and mutations in this gene are responsible for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia. Dsg4 plays an important adhesive role mainly in hair follicles, and Dsg4 mutations cause abnormal hair development. Recently, an active disease model for pemphigus was generated by a unique approach using autoantigen-deficient mice that do not acquire tolerance against the defective autoantigen. Adoptive transfer of Dsg3(-/-) lymphocytes into mice expressing Dsg3 induces stable anti-Dsg3 IgG production with development of the pemphigus phenotype. This mouse model is a valuable tool with which to investigate immunological mechanisms of harmful IgG autoantibody production in pemphigus. Further investigation of desmoglein molecules will continue to provide insight into the unsolved pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases and aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies with minimal side effects.",['Amagai M'],2010,86,5,Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,Amagai M.

20461293,[Molecular characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes from invasive disease and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome episodes].,"Streptococcus pyogenes causes a variety of common human diseases, including pharyngitis, scarlet fever and impetigo. Nevertheless, the past decades have witnessed a worldwide resurgence in invasive disease and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The objective of the present study is to evaluate the genetic diversity, virulence gene distribution (spe, sme and ssa genes) and susceptibility pattern of 10 S. pyogenes isolates causing invasive disease and STSS. The isolates were recovered from blood cultures of hospitalized patients at Hospital Santamarina and Nueva Clínica Chacabuco, Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina between 12/2000-04/2005. Two pulse field gel electrophoretic patterns predominated. The most frequent one included 5 characteristic isolates of emm1-T1 type, toxin gene profile speA, speB, speF, speG and smeZ. The second pattern included 2 characteristic isolates of emm3-TNT type (speB, speF, speG). The other 3 isolates corresponded to types emm49-TNT (speB, speC, speF, speG), emm75-T25 (speB, speF, speG) and emm83-TNT (speB, speF, speG, ssa, smeZ). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and rifampicin. The data from the present study demonstrated genetic diversity among the strains. Types emm1 and emm3 were prevalent in invasive disease. The empirical treatment with the combination of penicillin and clindamicin is still valid.","['Traverso F', 'Sparo M', 'Rubio V', 'Sáez Nieto JA']",2010,42,1,Rev Argent Microbiol,"Traverso F, et al.

22069631,Exfoliative toxins of Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen of humans and livestock. It causes a diverse array of diseases, ranging from relatively harmless localized skin infections to life-threatening systemic conditions. Among multiple virulence factors, staphylococci secrete several exotoxins directly associated with particular disease symptoms. These include toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), enterotoxins, and exfoliative toxins (ETs). The latter are particularly interesting as the sole agents responsible for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), a disease predominantly affecting infants and characterized by the loss of superficial skin layers, dehydration, and secondary infections. The molecular basis of the clinical symptoms of SSSS is well understood. ETs are serine proteases with high substrate specificity, which selectively recognize and hydrolyze desmosomal proteins in the skin. The fascinating road leading to the discovery of ETs as the agents responsible for SSSS and the characterization of the molecular mechanism of their action, including recent advances in the field, are reviewed in this article.","['Bukowski M', 'Wladyka B', 'Dubin G']",2010,2,5,Toxins (Basel),"Bukowski M, et al.

20418977,Seasonal variation in pediatric dermatoses.,"INTRODUCTION: The under-five population is a unique and vulnerable component of our society that always demands special attention.
AIMS: Our present work aimed to study the seasonal variation, age-wise variation and distribution of lesions of common dermatoses of this age group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We clinically studied all fresh cases attending the skin OPD of our hospital for one month each from summer, rainy season and winter. Total number of patients was 879.
RESULTS: The top six skin diseases in our study were impetigo, miliaria, scabies, furunculosis, seborrheic dermatitis and papular urticaria. On statistical analysis, scabies and seborrheic dermatitis were more prevalent during winter while impetigo, furunculosis and miliaria were more during summer and rainy season. Papular urticaria was more frequent in the rainy season. Seborrheic dermatitis predominantly affected the infants while impetigo, furunculosis, miliaria and popular urticaria were commoner in older age groups.
CONCLUSION: Distribution of lesions of common dermatoses will help diagnose difficult cases and extensive evaluation of the body parts which, by virtue of being commonly affected, are must-examine sites in under-five children.","['Banerjee S', 'Gangopadhyay DN', 'Jana S', 'Chanda M']",2010,55,1,Indian J Dermatol,"Banerjee S, et al.

20386450,Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin infections.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become increasingly important as a cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), particularly abscesses, in patients seen in the emergency department setting. The antibiotic sensitivity profile of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from SSTIs has changed over time in many geographic locations. Whether antibiotics are needed in the management of skin abscesses, and, if so, when, is controversial.
RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have looked at antibiotic therapy in conjunction with incision and drainage in managing abscesses. Factors evaluated were resolution of infection, need for change in antibiotic therapy, hospitalization after initial outpatient management, need for an additional drainage procedure, and recurrence of infection within 30 days after the initial incision and drainage procedure. For abscesses, clinical failure was associated with lack of adequate incision and drainage and not antibiotic use, regardless of the size of the abscess or the choice of antibiotic therapy. For other soft tissue infections, when antibiotic susceptibility data were available for the infection (impetigo or cellulitis with purulent drainage but no abscess), there was no difference in clinical resolution of MRSA infection even if the infecting organism was resistant to the antibiotic chosen for therapy.
SUMMARY: CA-MRSA has become an important cause of SSTIs. Current data suggest that most abscesses can be treated successfully with incision and drainage alone. Antibiotic choice is more crucial for management of cellulitis and should be guided by the prevalence of CA-MRSA in the community and its antibiotic susceptibility profile.",['Odell CA'],2010,22,3,Curr Opin Pediatr,Odell CA.

Three induced phages designated as ph iB531, phi B557 and phi B122 were found to be capable of transferring the eta gene into the prophageless non-toxigenic S. aureus strain and converting it into an ETA producer. Comparisons of the phage sequences derived from 12 selected genes and 2 genomic segments (polymorphic P2 and conserved C4) revealed that phi B531 and phi B557 were identical each other, but phi B122 differed from them in 5 gene sequences, the xis gene content and the virion protein profile. Thus, phi B122 represents a new type of still undescribed ETA-converting phage. This study highlights not only the conclusive genomic diversity of eta gene-positive phages, but also their virulence implications in impetigo S. aureus strains.","['Holochová P', 'Růzicková V', 'Pantůcek R', 'Petrás P', 'Janisch R', 'Doskar J']",2010,161,4,Res Microbiol,"Holochová P, et al.

20349679,Impetigo update: new challenges in the era of methicillin resistance.,"Impetigo is a bacterial infection of the superficial epidermis most commonly seen in infants and children. It is clinically characterized by crusted erosions or ulcers that may arise as a primary infection in which bacterial invasion occurs through minor breaks in the cutaneous surface or a secondary infection of a preexisting dermatosis or infestation. Impetigo occurs in 2 forms: bullous and nonbullous. Staphylococcus aureus currently is the most common overall cause of impetigo, but Streptococcus pyogenes remains an important cause in developing nations. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus (CA-MRSA) poses a challenge because of its enhanced virulence and increasing prevalence in children. For limited uncomplicated impetigo, either topical mupirocin or fusidic acid is as effective if not more effective than systemic antibiotics. For extensive or complicated impetigo, systemic antibiotics may be warranted, but beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided if methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) is suspected.","['Geria AN', 'Schwartz RA']",2010,85,2,Cutis,Geria AN and Schwartz RA.

20226042,Preferences for health outcomes associated with Group A Streptococcal disease and vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: A 26-valent Group A Streptococcus (GAS) vaccine candidate has been developed that may provide protection against pharyngitis, invasive disease and rheumatic fever. However, recommendations for the use of a new vaccine must be informed by a range of considerations, including parents' preferences for different relevant health outcomes. Our objectives were to: (1) describe parent preferences for GAS disease and vaccination using willingness-to-pay (WTP) and time trade-off (TTO) methods; and (2) understand how parents' implied WTP for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained might vary depending on the particular health outcome considered (e.g. averted GAS disease vs. vaccine adverse events).
METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with parents of children diagnosed with GAS pharyngitis at 2 pediatric practice sites in the Boston metropolitan area. WTP and TTO (trading parental longevity for child's health) questions for 2 vaccine and 4 disease-associated health states were asked using a randomly selected opening bid, followed by a 2nd bid and a final open-ended question about the amount willing to pay or trade. Descriptive analyses included medians and interquartile ranges for WTP and TTO estimates. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences in WTP/QALY values for vaccine adverse events vs. disease states.
RESULTS: Of 119 respondents, 100 (84%) and 96 (81%) provided a complete set of responses for WTP and TTO questions, respectively. The median WTP and discounted (at 3% per year) TTO values to avoid each health state were as follows: local reaction, $30, 0.12 days; systemic reaction, $50, 0.22 days; impetigo, $75, 1.25 days; strep throat, $75, 2.5 days; septic arthritis, $1,000, 6.6 days; and toxic shock syndrome, $3,000, 31.0 days. The median WTP/QALY was significantly higher for vaccine adverse events (approximately $60,000/QALY) compared to disease states ($18,000 to $36,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Parents strongly prefer to prevent GAS disease in children compared to vaccine adverse events. However, implied WTP/QALY ratios were higher for the prevention of vaccine adverse events. Regret for errors of commission vs. omission may differ and should be considered by vaccine policymakers.","['Lee GM', 'Salomon JA', 'Gay C', 'Hammitt JK']",2010,8,,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Lee GM, et al.

20107726,Fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in impetigo contagiosa and secondarily infected atopic dermatitis.,"Fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FRSA) has been identified as a causative agent in outbreaks of impetigo and its emergence has been associated with increased use of topical fusidic acid. The frequency of FRSA in atopic dermatitis (AD) has been less extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial spectrum and frequency of FRSA in patients with impetigo or secondarily infected AD. A prospective study in our clinic in 2004 to 2008 included 38 patients with impetigo and 37 with secondarily infected AD. S. aureus was the predominant finding in all groups (bullous impetigo 92% (12/13), impetigo 76% (19/25) and secondarily infected AD 89% (33/37)). Seventy-five percent of S. aureus were fusidic acid resistant in bullous impetigo, 32% in impetigo and 6.1% in secondarily infected AD (bullous impetigo vs. AD p < 0.0001, impetigo vs. AD p < 0.05). We then performed a retrospective patient record review including all patients with impetigo or secondarily infected AD seen at the clinic during the first and last year of the prospective study. In the first year 33% (19/58) of the S. aureus isolates were fusidic acid-resistant in impetigo and 12% (5/43) in secondarily infected AD (p < 0.05). In the last year corresponding values were 24% (6/25) for impetigo and 2.2% (1/45) for AD (p < 0.01). In summary, the prospective study and the patient record review both showed higher FRSA levels in impetigo than in AD. FRSA levels were persistently low in AD. Continued restrictive use of topical fusidic acid is advised to limit an increase in FRSA levels in dermatology patients.","['Alsterholm M', 'Flytström I', 'Bergbrant IM', 'Faergemann J']",2010,90,1,Acta Derm Venereol,"Alsterholm M, et al.

Epidemiological picture of streptococcal infection in India is not complete. Hence, disease burden due to GAS in 5-15 yr old school children in northern India was studied and emm typing of GAS isolates was carried out to help in designing prevention strategies.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 4249 school children (5-15 yr) from Raipur Rani Block of Panchkula district in Haryana during 2000-2002; 334 children were followed up fortnightly for one year. Standard clinical and microbiological procedures were used for collection of swabs from throat and skin and confirmation of GAS and its emm types.
RESULTS: Of the 4249 children studied, 658 (15.5%) had pharyngitis; 579 of them could be swabbed, of which 2.8 per cent had GAS. From 3591 children without pharyngitis, 3385 who could be swabbed, GAS was found in 1.3 per cent of them. Impetigo was rare (0.7%), but 7.1 per cent (2/28) children had GAS. In the followup study, 17.4 per cent (776/4447 child-contacts) had pharyngitis, 761 could be swabbed and 2.4 per cent had GAS; among those without pharyngitis, 2016 swabs could be taken and GAS was found in 1.3 per cent; whereas only 2.6 per cent (2/75) of skin sores had GAS. Three children had GAS pharyngitis twice during follow up. Fourteen different GAS emm types were found. emm 71, 77 and 81 constituted 69 per cent of the pharyngeal isolates. GAS pharyngitis and impetigo were more common in winters and summers respectively.

20055778,Skin and soft tissue infections caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus among children in China.,"AIM: To investigate the characteristic of community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) among children in China.
METHODS: Forty-seven children with CA-MRSA SSTIs were enrolled in this study. Clinical information was collected and analysed. The strains from the children were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and spa typing. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was also detected.
RESULTS: The majority of the 47 cases were impetigo (20; 42.6%) and abscesses (14; 29.8%). The rest was cellulites, infected wounds, omphalitis, paronychia and conjunctivitis combined folliculitis. Thirty-two of the isolates (68.1%) were PVL-positive, and the abscesses infected with PVL-positive strains usually required incision and drainage (87.5% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.026). Most of the isolates belonged to ST type 59, which accounted for 46.8%, followed by ST1 (7/47, 14.9%) and ST910 (5/47, 10.6%). The clone of ST59-MRSA-IV with t437 was the most prevalent one. The multiresistant rate of these strains was 93.6%.
CONCLUSION: The most common disease of CA-MRSA SSTIs was impetigo, and PVL-positive abscess was associated with incision and drainage. ST59-MRSA-IV with t437 was the most prevalent clone, and the multiresistant rate was high in Chinese children.","['Geng W', 'Yang Y', 'Wang C', 'Deng L', 'Zheng Y', 'Shen X']",2010,99,4,Acta Paediatr,"Geng W, et al.

20007058,Fusidic acid in dermatology: an updated review.,"Studies on the clinical efficacy of fusidic acid in skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), notably those due to Staphylococcus aureus, are reviewed. Oral fusidic acid (tablets dosed at 250 mg twice daily, or a suspension for paediatric use at 20 mg/kg/day given as two daily doses) has shown good efficacy and tolerability. Similarly, plain fusidic acid cream or ointment used two or three times daily in SSTIs such as impetigo are clinically and bacteriologically effective, with minimal adverse events. Combination formulations of fusidic acid with 1% hydrocortisone or 0.1% betamethasone achieve excellent results in infected eczema by addressing both inflammation and infection. A new lipid-rich combination formulation provides an extra moisturizing effect. Development of resistance to fusidic acid has remained generally low or short-lived and can be minimized by restricting therapy to no more than 14 days at a time.","['Schöfer H', 'Simonsen L']",2010,20,1,Eur J Dermatol,Schöfer H and Simonsen L.

It is the most common dermatophyte infection in children under 12 years of age, with a predominance in those of sub-Saharan African descent. Common signs include hair loss, scaling, erythema and impetigo-like plaques. Adults may also be affected, but to a lesser degree. The causative species are from the Microsporum and Trichophyton genera.

19947304,[Streptococcus pyogenes--much more than the aetiological agent of scarlet fever].,"The grampositive bacterium S. pyogenes (beta-haemolytic group A Streptococcus) is a natural colonizer of the human oropharynx mucous membrane and one of the most common agents of infectious diseases in humans. S. pyogenes causes the widest range of disease in humans among all bacterial pathogens. It is responsible for various skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa and erysipelas, and localized mucous membrane infections of the oropharynx (e. g. tonsillitis and pharyngitis). Betahaemolytic group A Streptococcus causes also invasive diseases such as sepses including puerperal sepsis. Additionally, S. pyogenes induces toxin-mediated syndromes, i. e. scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). STSS and NF are severe, frequently fatal diseases that have emerged in Europe and Northern America during the last two decades. Finally, some immunpathological diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis also result from S. pyogenes infections. Most scientists recommend penicillins (benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicllin) as drugs of first choice for treatment of Streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever. Erysipelas and some other skin infections should be treated with benzylpenicillin. Intensive care measurements are needed for treatment of severe toxin-mediated S. pyogenes diseases. These measurements include the elimination of internal bacterial foci, concomitant application of clindamycin and benzylpenicillin and suitable treatment of shock symptoms. Management of immunpathological diseases requires antiphlogistical therapy. Because of the wide distribution of S. pyogenes in the general population and the lack of an effective vaccine, possibilities for prevention allowing a suitable protection for diseases due to S. pyogenes are very limited.",['Stock I'],2009,32,11,Med Monatsschr Pharm,Stock I.

19940453,Treatment of psoriasis with anti-TNF drugs during pregnancy: case report and review of the literature.,"Published experiences of TNF-alpha inhibition during pregnancy consist of a limited number of case reports, series and ongoing registry data in patients with arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. A 28-year-old woman - with psoriasis vulgaris since she was 8 years of age and generalized pustular psoriasis during her first pregnancy (partially controlled with ciclosporin, oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids, when lupus anticoagulant was detected at another hospital) - presented 4 months after delivery with severe psoriasis (PASI = 15.4) that did not respond to ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day). Ten days after the first infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg), when the patient became aware that she was pregnant again, there was PASI75 response, and the patient wished to continue this treatment after being fully informed. Complete blanching was achieved by week 6 of treatment, and was maintained thereafter until the moment of writing (19 months after the start of treatment). She gave birth by caesarean delivery to a healthy female baby, who was breastfed for 1 month and has developed normally. The current report extends the available evidence on successful infliximab treatment in pregnant women, with the first case of a patient with psoriasis who presented impetigo herpetiformis during her previous pregnancy. No detectable adverse effects were detected in the neonate, despite potential exposure to infliximab throughout gestation and breastfeeding. Even though absolute safety is difficult to prove, available data suggest that women who become pregnant while taking infliximab or other anti-TNFalpha agents can be reassured regarding the continuation of pregnancy.","['Puig L', 'Barco D', 'Alomar A']",2010,220,1,Dermatology,"Puig L, et al.

19754868,Antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from children with impetigo in China from 2003 to 2007 shows community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to be uncommon and heterogeneous.,"BACKGROUND: The number of patients with impetigo caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been increasing.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus causing impetigo in children in China from 2003 to 2007 and further characterize isolates of CA-MRSA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 984 S. aureus isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials using the agar dilution method. CA-MRSA isolates were analysed for Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) genes, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was performed.
RESULTS: The largest proportion (94.5%) of strains were resistant to penicillin, followed by erythromycin (86.2%) and clindamycin (69.6%). In total 772 of 984 (78.5%) S. aureus strains were multiresistant. The incidence of CA-MRSA was 1.1%, with a high rate of resistance to clindamycin (90.9%) and tetracycline (72.7%), but all were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The susceptibility profiles of MRSA to other antimicrobial agents were similar to those of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). None of the S. aureus strains were resistant to vancomycin and fusidic acid; moreover, only one strain was resistant to mupirocin. Typing of the SCCmec showed that 54.5% were type IV, 18.2% were type V and 9.1% were type VI. All the PVL-positive CA-MRSA carried SCCmec type IV.
CONCLUSIONS: CA-MRSA is still relatively uncommon and heterogeneous in children in China. Penicillin and erythromycin are no longer appropriate agents. Effective antibiotic agents for patients with impetigo are mupirocin and fusidic acid.","['Liu Y', 'Kong F', 'Zhang X', 'Brown M', 'Ma L', 'Yang Y']",2009,161,6,Br J Dermatol,"Liu Y, et al.

19675670,Emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus associated with pediatric infection in Cambodia.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection is rising in the developed world but appears to be rare in developing countries. One explanation for this difference is that resource poor countries lack the diagnostic microbiology facilities necessary to detect the presence of CA-MRSA carriage and infection.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed diagnostic microbiology capabilities at the Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, western Cambodia in January 2006 and in the same month identified a child with severe community-acquired impetigo caused by CA-MRSA. A study was undertaken to identify and describe additional cases presenting between January 2006 and December 2007. Bacterial isolates underwent molecular characterization using multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, and PCR for the presence of the genes encoding Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Seventeen children were identified with CA-MRSA infection, of which 11 had skin and soft tissue infection and 6 had invasive disease. The majority of cases were unrelated in time or place. Molecular characterization identified two independent MRSA clones; fifteen isolates were sequence type (ST) 834, SCCmec type IV, PVL gene-negative, and two isolates were ST 121, SCCmec type V, PVL gene-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first ever report of MRSA in Cambodia, spread of which would pose a significant threat to public health. The finding that cases were mostly unrelated in time or place suggests that these were sporadic infections in persons who were CA-MRSA carriers or contacts of carriers, rather than arising in the context of an outbreak.","['Chheng K', 'Tarquinio S', 'Wuthiekanun V', 'Sin L', 'Thaipadungpanit J', 'Amornchai P', 'Chanpheaktra N', 'Tumapa S', 'Putchhat H', 'Day NP', 'Peacock SJ']",2009,4,8,PLoS One,"Chheng K, et al.

19547749,High burden of impetigo and scabies in a tropical country.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo and scabies are endemic diseases in many tropical countries; however the epidemiology of these diseases is poorly understood in many areas, particularly in the Pacific.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted three epidemiological studies in 2006 and 2007 to determine the burden of disease due to impetigo and scabies in children in Fiji using simple and easily reproducible methodology. Two studies were performed in primary school children (one study was a cross-sectional study and the other a prospective cohort study over ten months) and one study was performed in infants (cross-sectional). The prevalence of active impetigo was 25.6% (95% CI 24.1-27.1) in primary school children and 12.2% (95% CI 9.3-15.6) in infants. The prevalence of scabies was 18.5% (95% CI 17.2-19.8) in primary school children and 14.0% (95% CI 10.8-17.2) in infants. The incidence density of active impetigo, group A streptococcal (GAS) impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus impetigo and scabies was 122, 80, 64 and 51 cases per 100 child-years respectively. Impetigo was strongly associated with scabies infestation (odds ratio, OR, 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.7) and was more common in Indigenous Fijian children when compared with children of other ethnicities (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.7-4.7). The majority of cases of active impetigo in the children in our study were caused by GAS. S. aureus was also a common cause (57.4% in school aged children and 69% in infants).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that the impetigo and scabies disease burden in children in Fiji has been underestimated, and possibly other tropical developing countries in the Pacific. These diseases are more than benign nuisance diseases and consideration needs to be given to expanded public health initiatives to improve their control.","['Steer AC', 'Jenney AW', 'Kado J', 'Batzloff MR', 'La Vincente S', 'Waqatakirewa L', 'Mulholland EK', 'Carapetis JR']",2009,3,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Steer AC, et al.

19538380,Acupuncture in dermatology: an historical perspective.,"Classical acupuncture focuses primarily on treating the person, and secondarily treating the illness. The ""symptoms"" are regarded as ""branch"" expressions of a ""root"" (constitutional) imbalance. Different root imbalances can produce the same symptoms. Five patients with eczema, for example, may reveal five distinct root imbalances and would all be treated very differently. Because acupuncture treats the whole person, it has something to offer almost every condition. In many cases, acupuncture aims to bring about a complete cure; in others, it aims to manage the problem. Acupuncture remains a substantial part of the traditional Chinese medicine, which is used to treat many conditions including acne, alopecia, dermatitis, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, systemic lupus erythematosus, urticaria, herpes zoster, chicken pox, impetigo, leprosy, vitiligo, and tinea. This review introduces the historical context of acupuncture within Chinese medicine and how it relates to skin disease.

When such patients develop infection, some have extensive impetiginized dermatitis with high fever. To clarify the risk factors for severe impetiginized AD and its microbiological features, we reviewed clinical and microbiological data of 14 patients with impetiginized AD who were admitted to our hospital between the years 1999 and 2006. All patients had poorly controlled AD with eczematous lesions on the extensive body surface. The mean age was 28.2 years (range 18-35). Cultures of the lesional skin yielded both Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in 12 patients. S. pyogenes alone was isolated in two cases. These observations suggest that poorly controlled AD in adults is a risk factor for severe impetiginized AD and that S. pyogenes might play an important role in the development of severe clinical symptoms.","['Hayakawa K', 'Hirahara K', 'Fukuda T', 'Okazaki M', 'Shiohara T']",2009,34,5,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Hayakawa K, et al.

19436611,Topical retapamulin in the management of infected traumatic skin lesions.,"Retapamulin is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic specifically designed for use as a topical agent. The unique mode of action by which retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis differentiates it from other nonpleuromutilin antibacterial agents that target the ribosome or ribosomal factors, minimizing the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterial classes in current use. In vitro studies show that retapamulin has high potency against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) commonly found in skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs), including S. aureus strains with resistance to agents such as macrolides, fusidic acid, or mupirocin, and other less common organisms associated with SSSIs, anaerobes, and common respiratory tract pathogens. Clinical studies have shown that twice-daily topical retapamulin for 5 days is comparable to 10 days of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions. A 1% concentration of retapamulin ointment has been approved for clinical use as an easily applied treatment with a short, convenient dosing regimen for impetigo. Given the novel mode of action, low potential for cross-resistance with established antibacterial agents, and high in vitro potency against many bacterial pathogens commonly recovered from SSSIs, retapamulin is a valuable enhancement over existing therapeutic options.","['Shawar R', 'Scangarella-Oman N', 'Dalessandro M', 'Breton J', 'Twynholm M', 'Li G', 'Garges H']",2009,5,1,Ther Clin Risk Manag,"Shawar R, et al.

19396517,"Genotypes, intrafamilial transmission, and virulence potential of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from children in the community.","Pediatric outpatients and healthy children in the community were examined for nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Japan. MRSA isolation frequencies were 0.7% (3/426) and 3.7% (5/136), respectively, in pediatric outpatients and healthy children in the community (overall frequency, 1.4%). The frequency of MRSA isolation was higher in children 5-9 years of age compared with the other age groups. All eight MRSA strains isolated were Panton-Valentine leukocidin-negative. Of these, three with the genotype multilocus sequence type (ST) 8/spa606/SCCmecIV (2 cases) and ST88/spa999/SCCmecIV/exfoliative toxin A gene (eta) were identical or similar to MRSA from bullous impetigo, determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. One strain with ST764 (ST5 variant)/spa2/SCCmecII/staphylococcal enterotoxin B gene seb2 (seb variant) was similar to MRSA from bacteremia, and one with ST5/spa2/SCCmecII was the Pandemic New York/Japan clone. The remaining three strains, with ST22/spa998/SCCmecI, ST380/spa799/SCCmecIV, and ST857/spa416/SCCmecII, have not been identified. All MRSA strains were resistant to one or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics, and the ST5 and ST764 strains were multidrug-resistant. Family analysis demonstrated parent-to-child transmission (for ST8 and ST764), as well as acquisition from outside the family (for ST8 and ST380). The data suggest that young school-age children have a higher carriage rate of nasal MRSA than children of other ages, and that not only community-acquired MRSA strains but also MRSA strains with characteristics of hospital-acquired MRSA are spreading in the community.","['Ozaki K', 'Takano M', 'Higuchi W', 'Takano T', 'Yabe S', 'Nitahara Y', 'Nishiyama A', 'Yamamoto T']",2009,15,2,J Infect Chemother,"Ozaki K, et al.

Staphylococcus aureus sequence type (ST) 93 is a singleton, Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive clone unique to Australia. A high-resolution melting-based method for the identification of ST93 was developed, and a similar approach was used to reveal diversity within the spa locus of this lineage. Statistical and graphical methods that account for instrumental and operator-dependent variation in high-resolution melting curves were developed, to allow greater confidence and reproducibility in deciding whether another curve is truly different from the baseline curve of an amplicon with known sequence. The data support a very early acquisition, or multiple independent acquisitions, of SCCmec by ST93 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and the coexistence of MSSA and methicillin-resistant S. aureus versions of the same lineage within northern Australia.","['Tong SY', 'Lilliebridge RA', 'Holt DC', 'McDonald MI', 'Currie BJ', 'Giffard PM']",2009,15,12,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Tong SY, et al.

Binding of the complement regulatory proteins factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), C4b-binding protein (C4BP), or CD46 is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of these infections. M protein is the GAS protein that generally mediates these interactions. However, a detailed analysis of the reports that have investigated the binding of complement regulatory components to GAS indicates that this microorganism has evolved alternative mechanisms for the recruitment of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface.

Microsponges containing mupirocin were prepared by an emulsion solvent diffusion method. The effect of formulation and process variables such as internal phase volume and stirring speed on the physical characteristics of microsponges were examined on optimized drug/polymer ratio by 3(2) factorial design. The optimized microsponges were incorporated into an emulgel base. In vitro drug release, ex vivo drug deposition, and in vivo antibacterial activity of mupirocin-loaded formulations were studied. Developed microsponges were spherical and porous, and there was no interaction between drug and polymer molecules. Emulgels containing microsponges showed desired physical properties. Drug release through cellulose dialysis membrane showed diffusion-controlled release pattern and drug deposition studies using rat abdominal skin exhibited significant retention of active in skin from microsponge-based formulations by 24 h. The optimized formulations were stable and nonirritant to skin as demonstrated by Draize patch test. Microsponges-based emulgel formulations showed prolonged efficacy in mouse surgical wound model infected with S. aureus. Mupirocin was stable in topical emulgel formulations and showed enhanced retention in the skin indicating better potential of the delivery system for treatment of primary and secondary skin infections, such as impetigo, eczema, and atopic dermatitis.","['Amrutiya N', 'Bajaj A', 'Madan M']",2009,10,2,AAPS PharmSciTech,"Amrutiya N, et al.

Histopathology of the skin lesions present in BADAS is described in the literature as identical to that of Sweet syndrome. We present a patient whose clinical history and physical exam were consistent with the diagnosis of BADAS.

The histologic differential included subcorneal pustular dermatosis, bullous impetigo, or IgA pemphigus. The histology in BADAS may not necessarily be identical to Sweet syndrome, and the clinical picture alone plays an important role in diagnosis.

19377712,Validation of an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithm for managing common skin conditions in Fiji.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity of an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm to detect common skin conditions in children in Fiji.
METHODS: We collected data from the assessments of children aged between 2 months and 5 years who presented to one of two health clinics. Every child was assessed by a nurse trained in the use of the IMCI algorithm and also an expert paediatrician. We used a kappa statistic to measure agreement between the nurse/algorithm assessment method and the paediatrician's diagnosis.
FINDINGS: High sensitivity for identifying skin problems (sensitivity: 98.7%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 95.5-99.9) was found for the algorithm applied by IMCI-trained nurses, who were able to identify the one child with a severe skin infection and all three children with periorbital cellulitis. Sensitivity was high for the classification of abscess/cellulitis (sensitivity: 95%; 95% CI: 75.1-99.9) and infected scabies (sensitivity: 89.1%; 95% CI: 77.8-95.9), but lower for identification of impetigo, fungal infection and, in particular, non-infected scabies.
CONCLUSION: The IMCI skin algorithm is a robust tool that should be incorporated into the IMCI after some modifications relating to scabies and impetigo. Its use by primary health-care workers will reduce the burden of skin diseases in children in Fiji through improved case identification and management. The algorithm should be considered in other countries where skin diseases in children are a priority, particularly in the Pacific region.","['Steer AC', 'Tikoduadua LV', 'Manalac EM', 'Colquhoun S', 'Carapetis JR', 'Maclennan C']",2009,87,3,Bull World Health Organ,"Steer AC, et al.

19368906,Determinants of regional differences in the incidence of impetigo.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Impetigo is a common contagious skin infection, mostly seen in children and caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or group A B-hemolytic Streptococcus. Two surveys performed in general practice showed a strong geographical gradient in the incidence rates among children in the Netherlands. The incidence in the south was approximately twice as high as in the rest of the Netherlands. We hypothesized that this difference could be explained by differences in the presence of animal farms and differences in temperature. This study examined whether there is a relationship with the numbers of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature, which could explain the observed regional gradient in the incidence of impetigo.
DESIGN AND SETTING: In this ecological study, data on the incidence of impetigo in children 0-17 years of age from the second Dutch national survey were linked to data on the density of farm animals from Statistics Netherlands and temperature data from the Dutch Metereological Service. Using logistic regression allowing for overdispersion, we tested the significance of the effect of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature on the incidence of impetigo, correcting for known risk factors.
RESULTS: Only the number of sheep at the (COROP) regional level was significant; however, this effect could not explain the regional differences.
CONCLUSION: The regional differences in the incidence of impetigo in children cannot be explained by the variation in the presence of farm animals or differences in temperature.","['Razmjou RG', 'Willemsen SP', 'Koning S', 'Oranje AP', 'Schellevis F', 'van der Wouden JC']",2009,109,5,Environ Res,"Razmjou RG, et al.

19317048,[Homology of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from skin lesions and nose of patients with impetigo].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the homology of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strains isolated from nose and skin lesions of impetigo children.
METHODS: Totally 263 outpatients aged 3 months to 14 years who were seen by the Department of Dermatology of Beijing Children's Hospital between August 2005 and March 2006 were enrolled in this study. The isolations from nose and skin lesions of 58 impetigo children who were randomly selected from these 263 children with spa sequence were typed. The sequence results of SA were analyzed using special websites.
RESULTS: There were 106 impetigo patients in these 263 children. The isolation rate of SA was 78.3% in the nose of 106 impetigo patients and was 21.0% in that of the rest 157 patients (P < 0.01). The age of all nasal carriers was concentrated in 1-6 years. Among the 106 impetigo patients, 30 patients had their primary lesions on the face (including 28 cases of SA nose isolates) and 76 patients had their primary lesions on the other parts of body (including 56 cases of SA nose isolates) (P < 0.01). The spa typing showed that 26 of the 30 impetigo patients had the same type pairs of nose and skin.
CONCLUSIONS: SA isolated from the skin lesions and nose of impetigo patients has remarkably homology.

OBJECTIVES: A molecular epidemiological analysis of an impetigo bullosa outbreak in a neonatal ward was performed in order to determine a potential source of the infection and possible routes of subsequent spreading of the epidemic strain.
METHODS: The genetic relatedness of S. aureus strains isolated from 6 neonates with epidermal lesions and from 21 staff members was verified by the pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. Additionally, detection of eta and etb genes of S. aureus strains using PCR was performed.
RESULTS: None of the infected newborns' mothers was a carrier. Seven strains, 6 isolated from the newborns and 1 taken from a midwife, showed the same restriction pattern, i.e. type A. In the other 20 health care workers colonized with S. aureus, 3 genetic types could be distinguished, i.e. B (2), C (7) and D (2), as well as 9 strains with unique PFGE patterns. The eta gene detected in 7 strains belonged to the genetic type A; there was no etb gene in any of the 27 S. aureus isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the same genetic type A of S. aureus in the infected newborns is a factor which indicates that the impetigo bullosa was a hospital infection. A probable source of the infection was a midwife who was colonized with the same S. aureus type. She was present at the birth of the first infected newborn. Today, molecular methods are essential for prompt recognition of an epidemic and implementation of appropriate infection control strategies.","['Jursa-Kulesza J', 'Kordek A', 'Kopron K', 'Wojciuk B', 'Giedrys-Kalemba S']",2009,96,1,Neonatology,"Jursa-Kulesza J, et al.

An epidemiological investigation based on phenotyping and genotyping methods was performed. All neonates involved in the outbreak, their mothers and 15 staff members were screened for carriage of Staphylococcus aureus by nasal swabs. Isolated strains were compared with strains cultured from affected skin and purulent conjunctiva of infected newborns. Isolates were analyzed for the presence of the etA and etB genes using polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and coa gene polymorphism. The analyzed S. aureus strains were methicillin-sensitive and could be divided into two groups according to antibiotyping, phage typing, coa polymorphism and PFGE pattern. The first group consisted of etA and etB negative strains, and the second one involved only the etB positive ones. Our results have shown that there were two different clusters of infection caused by two populations of S. aureus strains. Among the 15 medical staff members screened we have found seven carriers. However, phage typing revealed that distinct strains unrelated to the outbreak isolates were carried. Although we have not been able to establish the source of bacteria involved in the outbreak, our results suggest that for both groups, mothers could be the source of the infecting strains.","['Kurlenda J', 'Grinholc M', 'Krzysztoń-Russjan J', 'Wiśniewska K']",2009,95,4,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,"Kurlenda J, et al.

In order to extract secondary metabolites from roots of Stemona sp., various organic solvents with different polarities were employed. Optimal solvents for the extraction of effective ingredients from root were determined. The results showed that in most cases the yields of crude extract were highest by using parallel technique rather than serial technique. The highest yields of crude extract by using both techniques were obtained with acetone, followed by water, ethanol, methanol, dichloromethane and hexane, respectively. Furthermore it was found that the L-a-b value and the total soluble solid (TSS) value in terms of degree Brix of crude extracts were different depending on choice of organic solvents. In particular, dichloromethane extracted more total soluble solid from plant material with both techniques, followed by hexane, ethanol, acetone, water and methanol, respectively. The biological activities of different crude extracts from S. tuberosa against Spodoptera exigua were experimentally determined. It was observed that the crude extract with highest toxicity to Larvae was obtained with high polarity solvents such as water, methanol and ethanol. The results suggested that water extract tested under high concentration could promote higher mortality. On the other hand, hexane extract caused approximately 30 % mortality with highest concentration at 15% w/w. Dichloromethane and acetone extract could be considered of similar efficiency.","['Sanguanpong U', 'Hummel HE']",2008,73,3,Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci,Sanguanpong U and Hummel HE.

He complained of pruritus and pain in his scalp, which displayed redness, alopecia and painful cysts and eventually discharged pus and scabbed. Several erythema on his face and abdomen were also presented. He was diagnosed as having impetigo but antibacterial agents were not effective and his clinical condition did not improve. Several days later, his parents also developed facial erythema and scaling. The development of a kerion in the boy and tinea corporis in his parents were diagnosed based on the positive KOH examination. Morphologic and biochemical characteristics confirmed that their infections were caused by the zoophilic Trichophyton mentagrophytes, while sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1/4 polymerase chain reaction products, amplified from primary culture isolates, established its Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii lineage. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis indicated these isolates might be the same strain and that infection cruciata occurred in this family. Semi-quantitative analysis of these strains indicated multiple and main enzymatic activities of alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosaccharase. The boy was cured through treatment with itraconazole 100 mg/day orally in combination with topical washes with 2% ketoconazole shampoo, and his parents were successfully treated by topical application of terbinafine cream.","['Zhang H', 'Ran Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang R', 'Lin X', 'Yan W', 'Dai Y']",2009,47,5,Med Mycol,"Zhang H, et al.

19070529,Efficacy and safety of TNFalpha antagonist therapy in patients with juvenile spondyloarthropathies.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNFalpha antagonist therapy in patients with juvenile spondyloarthropathies refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical charts of 20 patients (16 males and 4 females) with a mean age of 11.6 years at diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to initiation of TNFalpha antagonist therapy was 41 months. Escape phenomenon developed in 3 patients, who were switched to another TNFalpha antagonist. Etanercept was used for 19/23 treatments, infliximab for 3/23 treatments, and adalimumab for 1 treatment. The efficacy criteria were morning stiffness duration; nocturnal awakenings; tender and swollen joint counts; entheseal count; back, buttock, and hip pain; percentage of patients on NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoid therapy; and mean and median values of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and hemoglobin level. A remission was defined as resolution of the axial and peripheral pain, joint swelling, and laboratory evidence of inflammation, with or without continued NSAID therapy.
RESULTS: TNFalpha antagonist therapy was associated with clinical and laboratory improvements after 3 months, and the benefits were sustained after 1 year. Axial pain required 6 months to improve. A remission was achieved in 59% of patients after 3 months and 70% after 6 and 12 months. Median time to remission under treatment was 3 months. The interval between the TNFalpha antagonist injections was increased for 12/18 treatments and the treatment was stopped in 7 cases. However, treatment discontinuation was consistently followed by a relapse, after a median time of 2.5 months. Two serious adverse events occurred, namely, acute bacterial pneumonia and recurrent impetigo; in both cases the outcome was promptly favorable after a brief interruption of the TNFalpha antagonist.
CONCLUSION: TNFalpha antagonist therapy seems safe and rapidly effective in patients with juvenile spondyloarthropathies refractory to NSAIDs, in keeping with data from adults. However, prospective studies in larger patient populations are needed.","['Sulpice M', 'Deslandre CJ', 'Quartier P']",2009,76,1,Joint Bone Spine,"Sulpice M, et al.

19052157,Normal ranges of streptococcal antibody titers are similar whether streptococci are endemic to the setting or not.,"Group A streptococcal (GAS) serology is used for the diagnosis of post-streptococcal diseases, such as acute rheumatic fever, and occasionally for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Experts recommend that the upper limits of normal for streptococcal serology be determined for individual populations because of differences in the epidemiology of GAS between populations. Therefore, we performed a study to determine the values of the upper limit of normal for anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and anti-DNase B (ADB) titers in Fiji. Participants with a history of GAS disease, including pharyngitis or impetigo, were excluded. A total of 424 serum samples from people of all ages (with a sample enriched for school-aged children) were tested for their ASO and ADB titers. Reference values, including titers that were 80% of the upper limit of normal, were obtained by regression analysis by use of a curve-fitting method instead of the traditional nonparametric approach. Normal values for both the ASO titer and the ADB titer rose sharply during early childhood and then declined gradually with age. The estimated titers that were 80% of the upper limit or normal at age 10 years were 276 IU/ml for ASO and 499 IU/ml for ADB. Data from our study are similar to those found in countries with temperate climates, suggesting that a uniform upper limit of normal for streptococcal serology may be able to be applied globally.","['Steer AC', 'Vidmar S', 'Ritika R', 'Kado J', 'Batzloff M', 'Jenney AW', 'Carlin JB', 'Carapetis JR']",2009,16,2,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Steer AC, et al.

19042682,Blistering eruption in a Latino migrant farmworker.,"Skin rashes are among the most common problems seen by those providing health care to agricultural workers. We present a case report of a migrant farmworker patient with a painful, blistering eruption of the axilla and adjacent skin developing after an insect bite. The possibility of infection was not initially considered, and teledermatology was helpful in making the diagnosis of bullous impetigo. This was important because initial culture confirmation was not obtained and antibiotic treatment had not been initiated. After the consultation, the impetigo was treated by empiric antibiotic coverage. The environmental conditions of migrant farmworkers raise special issues for infectious skin diseases like bullous impetigo. Crowded living conditions, lack of proper sanitary facilities, and poor accessibility to health care increase the risk of occurrence and spread of this disease. With the recent emergence of multi-drug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community settings, this case report should serve to reinforce the need to recognize the possibility of infection and to obtain culture specimens at the initial visit to better treat and control this infectious skin condition.","['Feldman SR', 'Vallejos QM', 'Whalley LE', 'Quandt SA', 'Brooks T', 'Cabral G', 'Earp P', 'Bischoff W', 'Arcury TA']",2007,12,4,J Agromedicine,"Feldman SR, et al.

19042681,Common skin disorders seen in the migrant farmworker health care clinic setting.,"BACKGROUND: Skin diseases are common occupational illnesses for farmworkers. Migrant farmworkers commonly access rural health clinics for diagnosis and treatment of skin disease.
PURPOSE: To assess common skin conditions of migrant farmworkers treated in rural clinics and to describe effective and economic management of these conditions.
METHODS: Seventy-nine farmworkers with a skin condition were seen as patients at 4 clinics in eastern North Carolina. A list of the most common conditions encountered was compiled and treatment methods were found in the literature.
RESULTS: Twenty-three common conditions were identified. The most common conditions were contact dermatitis, melasma, tinea, seborrheic keratoses, and impetigo. A table of treatment recommendations was composed that can be used by clinicians in this setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the most common skin conditions seen in the migrant farmworker population in eastern North Carolina are similar to conditions found in the general population.","['Hinckley M', 'Feldman SR', 'Fleischer AB', 'Vallejos QM', 'Whalley LE', 'Quandt SA', 'Heck J', 'Cabral G', 'Brooks T', 'Schulz MR', 'Arcury TA']",2007,12,4,J Agromedicine,"Hinckley M, et al.

19000857,[Managing children skin and soft tissue infections].,"The skin infections are common in pediatrics, ranging from furonculosis or impetigo to the severe forms of necrotizing dermohypodermitis. The general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. Two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. The two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. Soon, a third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these. For uncomplicated superficial skin infections justifying an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate offers the best guarantee of efficiency. Poor pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic must lead to not prescribe oral M penicillins. In case of allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin, a macrolide (if the susceptibility of the strain was checked) or pristinamycine (after 6 years of age) are acceptable alternatives. For dermohypodermitis bacterial antibiotic of choice remains amoxicillin-clavulanate through IV route, to be active against S. pyogenes but also S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The IV route is maintained until regression general signs and a relay orally by the same drug is then possible. For toxinic syndromes and necrozing fascitis clindamycin should be added to a beta-lactam because of its action on protein synthesis in particular reducing the toxins production.","['Moulin F', 'Quinet B', 'Raymond J', 'Gillet Y', 'Cohen R']",2008,15 Suppl 2,,Arch Pediatr,"Moulin F, et al.

Bacterial skin infections are subdivided into superficial and deep infections; the former are often treated locally while the latter may require systemic antibiotics or surgical intervention. The rate of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community is relatively low in The Netherlands, but the guideline provides recommendations, such as the restricted use of mupirocin ointment, to facilitate future MRSA control measures. Clinical distinction between erysipelas and cellulitis is often impossible; therefore, the term cellulitis is used throughout the guideline and refers to both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The first line of therapy for cellulitis remains a small spectrum, beta-lactamase resistant penicillin, such as flucloxacillin for 10 days. There are no conclusive studies on the prevention of recurrent cellulitis, so recommendations are based on expert opinion and pathophysiological considerations. The lack of rigorous and controlled studies often precludes making clear evidence-based recommendations. However, this guideline succeeds remarkably well in combining the available evidence and formulating sound practical management advice for bacterial skin infections in primary care in The Netherlands. It deserves widespread implementation among general practitioners.","['Sanders CJ', 'Bruijnzeel-Koomen CA']",2008,152,29,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Sanders CJ and Bruijnzeel-Koomen CA.

In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cephalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.","['Yang LP', 'Keam SJ']",2008,9,6,Am J Clin Dermatol,Yang LP and Keam SJ.

18935945,Building integrated mental health and medical programs for vulnerable populations post-disaster: connecting children and families to a medical home.,"INTRODUCTION: Hurricane Katrina, a Category 3 hurricane, made landfall in August 2005. Approximately 1,500 deaths have been directly attributed to the hurricane, primarily in Louisiana and Mississippi. In New Orleans, Louisiana, most of the healthcare infrastructure was destroyed by flooding, and > 200,000 residents became homeless. Many of these internally displaced persons received transitional housing in trailer parks (""villages"") under the auspices of the [US] Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
PROBLEM: The FEMA villages are isolated from residential communities, lack access to healthcare services, and have become unsafe environments. The trailers that house families have been found to be contaminated with formaldehyde.
METHODS: The Children's Health Fund, in partnership with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, began a program (""Operation Assist"") to provide health and mental health services within a medical home model. This program includes the Baton Rouge Children's Health Project (BRCHP), which consists of two mobile medical units (one medical and one mental health). Licensed professionals at the FEMA villages and other isolated communities provide care on these mobile units. Medical and psychiatric diagnoses from the BRCHP are summarized and case vignettes presented.
RESULTS: Immediately after the hurricane, prescription medications were difficult to obtain. Complaints of headache, nosebleeds, and stomachache were observed at an unusually frequent degree for young children, and were potentially attributable to formaldehyde exposure. Dermatological conditions included eczema, impetigo, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) abscesses, and tinea corporis and capitis. These were especially difficult to treat because of unhygienic conditions in the trailers and ongoing formaldehyde exposure. Signs of pediatric under-nutrition included anemia, failure to thrive, and obesity. Utilization of initial mental health services was low due to pressing survival needs and concern about stigma. Once the mental health service became trusted in the community, frequent diagnoses for school-age children included disruptive behavior disorders and learning problems, with underlying depression, anxiety, and stress disorders. Mood and anxiety disorders and substance abuse were prevalent among the adolescents and adults, including parents.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a critical and long-term need for medical and mental health services among affected populations following a disaster due to natural hazards. Most patients required both medical and mental health care, which underscores the value of co-locating these services.","['Madrid PA', 'Sinclair H', 'Bankston AQ', 'Overholt S', 'Brito A', 'Domnitz R', 'Grant R']",2008,23,4,Prehosp Disaster Med,"Madrid PA, et al.

18929431,"The value of Tzanck smear test in diagnosis of erosive, vesicular, bullous, and pustular skin lesions.","BACKGROUND: Tzanck smear is generally used for the diagnosis of the pemphigus group of autoimmune bullous diseases and mucocutaneous herpesvirus infections. There are only a few studies in the literature investigating its diagnostic value.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate Tzanck smear findings and to determine the diagnostic value of this test in moist (erosive, vesicular, bullous, and pustular) skin lesions. We also aimed to develop an algorithmic approach for the diagnosis of these types of skin lesions according to the Tzanck smear findings.
METHODS: Samples were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa and evaluated by the same dermatologist. In some patients, methylene blue and Gram staining or direct immunofluorescence examinations were additionally performed. In all of the study cases, after the evaluation of clinical and laboratory findings (including, when appropriate, potassium hydroxide examination; viral serology; bacterial and fungal cultures; histopathology; direct and indirect immunofluorescence; patch testing), the definite diagnosis was established. We also determined the sensitivity and the specificity of certain Tzanck smear findings.
RESULTS: Tzanck smear was performed in a total of 400 patients with moist skin lesions. The sensitivities of multinucleated giant cells and acantholytic cells in herpetic infections, dyskeratotic acantholytic cells and cocci in bullous impetigo, pseudohyphae in candidiasis, acantholytic cells in pemphigus and more than 10 tadpole cells (magnification x100) in spongiotic dermatitis were 84.7%, 92%, 100%, 100%, and 81.5%, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: Because Tzanck smears were evaluated by the same dermatologist, no comment could be made regarding the interobserver reliability of this test and how the level of experience with this technique might affect the results. Also, the sensitivity and the specificity of Tzanck smear test findings for certain diseases could not be calculated because of an insufficient number of patients.
CONCLUSION: The Tzanck smear test is an inexpensive, useful, and an easy diagnostic tool for certain skin diseases.","['Durdu M', 'Baba M', 'Seçkin D']",2008,59,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Durdu M, et al.

The mecA gene was detected in 74 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 23 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. All isolates with the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec were classified into type IV (92.8%, 90/97) or V (7.2%, 7/97). The ET-encoding gene etb was found primarily in strains with mecA (87.7%, 71/81), whilst eta (86.6%, 161/186) was detected mainly in strains without mecA. The chromosomal enterotoxin-encoding gene cluster egc was found in 83.0% of strains with eta, whilst no enterotoxin-encoding gene was detected in strains with only etb. PFGE showed that each strain carrying eta, etb and etd could be classified into distinct groups. The susceptibility profiles of MRSA to antimicrobial agents excluding beta-lactams were similar to those of MSSA. Gentamicin- and clarithromycin-resistant strains were frequently found for both MRSA and MSSA. The aminoglycoside-resistance gene aacA-aphD was detected in 97.3% of MRSA and 85.4% of MSSA. Additionally, the macrolide-resistance gene ermA or ermC was detected in 67.6% of MRSA and 71.4% of MSSA. Therefore, these results suggest that SCCmec types IV or V have spread, particularly in MSSA carrying etb in the community.","['Nakaminami H', 'Noguchi N', 'Ikeda M', 'Hasui M', 'Sato M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Yoshida T', 'Asano T', 'Senoue M', 'Sasatsu M']",2008,57,Pt 10,J Med Microbiol,"Nakaminami H, et al.

18787690,"Listeriolysin S, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes.","Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Although it has long been thought that SLS and related peptides are produced by GAS and related streptococci only, there is evidence to suggest that a number of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. The distribution of the L. monocytogenes cluster is particularly noteworthy in that it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains; i.e., those responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, designated Listeriolysin S, which contributes to virulence of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. Thus, in the process of establishing the existence of an extended family of SLS-like modified virulence peptides (MVPs), the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage I L. monocytogenes may have been revealed.","['Cotter PD', 'Draper LA', 'Lawton EM', 'Daly KM', 'Groeger DS', 'Casey PG', 'Ross RP', 'Hill C']",2008,4,9,PLoS Pathog,"Cotter PD, et al.

18705828,Prevalence of skin diseases among pediatric patients in Turkey.,"The pediatric population is composed of persons under 16 years of age, and few studies are available on the dermatological diseases of this group. In the present study, data on a total of 6300 pediatric patients admitted between the years 2004-2006 were analyzed. Hospital-based patient registry records were used for data collection. The data were analyzed according to age, sex and time of admittance. A female preponderance (53%) was observed, and adolescents (12-16 years old) constituted the largest group within the patient population (47.6%). A total of 125 dermatoses were recorded. Acne vulgaris was the most prevalent dermatosis (12.4%), followed by atopic dermatitis (11.8%), contact dermatitis (11.3%), warts (9.5%), seborrheic dermatitis (4.3%) and impetigo (4.1%). Atopic dermatitis was the most frequently seen dermatosis in both infants and preschool-age children, whereas contact dermatitis was more prevalent in school-age children, and acne vulgaris was more prevalent in the adolescent group. The frequencies of some diseases showed seasonal variations. Acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, xerosis and alopecia areata were more common in winter. In contrast, insect bites, vitiligo, dyshidrotic eczema, impetigo and tinea corporis were more common in summer. Studies of the pediatric population, which constitutes the cornerstone of the community, can play an important role in determining the policies of protective medicine and public health.

18700109,A case of mucous membrane plasmacytosis successfully treated with cryotherapy.,"Mucous membrane plasmacytosis is a rare, often idiopathic, inflammatory disorder that frequently presents as an erythematous, velvety, or lobulated plaque on a mucosal surface. While mucous membrane plasmacytosis often runs a benign course, plaques are known to erode, ulcerate, and bleed. Moreover, according to a recent review of mucous membrane plasmacytosis, treatments of this disorder are inconsistently successful. We report a case of erosive, hemorrhagic mucous-membrane plasmacytosis of the lips treated successfully with cryotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the second case of mucous membrane plasmacytosis successfully treated with cryotherapy. The long term response of our patient's condition to cryotherapy with no functional side effects may warrant further study of this technique for severe erosive mucous membrane plasmacytosis.","['Najarian DJ', 'Rao BK', 'Pappert AS']",2008,14,2,Dermatol Online J,"Najarian DJ, et al.

18670189,[Effect of the admixture of tetracycline and nadifloxacin ointments on their stability and their antibacterial activity].,"Impetigo contagiosa staphylogenes is commonly treated by administering a combination of nadifloxacin and tetracycline ointments. However, it is not clear whether nadifloxacin and tetracycline are stable after mixing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of these agents in combination. We also evaluated changes in antibacterial activity after mixing. Mixing the two ointments caused tetracycline to change from yellow to brown in the admixture. Furthermore, the tetracycline content in the ointment decreased in a time-dependent manner, to about 40% at 288 h after mixing. In addition, the nadifloxacin content in the ointment did not change 288 h after mixing. In an alkaline environment (pH 9.0 and 11.0), the tetracycline content decreased and the color of tetracycline changed to brown. These results suggest that sodium hydroxide, which is an additive in nadifloxacin ointment, influences the content of tetracycline. We evaluated the chemical sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus using disk tests. Nadifloxacin and tetracycline ointment showed the largest radius of inhibition circle, followed by the admixture 0 h after mixing and the admixture 72 h after mixing. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity is inhibited by the admixture. We propose that pharmacists should avoid mixing nadifloxacin with tetracycline ointment in the treatment of impetigo contagiosa staphylogenes and should take care to avoid interactions caused by additives in the ointments.","['Kawamoto T', 'Tayama Y', 'Sawa A', 'Monde T', 'Sashima S', 'Yoshioka M', 'Miyake K', 'Morita S', 'Kihira K']",2008,128,8,Yakugaku Zasshi,"Kawamoto T, et al.

Awareness of child abuse has been increasing since the 1960s. Although most victims of child abuse present with cutaneous lesions, many genuine skin diseases may appear as non-accidental injuries which, if not recognized, may lead to misdiagnosis of child abuse.

18657371,[Impetigo herpetiformis (two cases)].,"UNLABELLED: The hepetiformis impetigo is a pustulosis dermatosis. It is rare and specific to pregnancy. It can menace the prognostic of the mother and the child. This entity is actually considered as a pustulor psoriasis. We report two cases.
CASES REPORTS: Two patients, respectively, aged 24 and 21, presented erythematous, pustular and extensive plaques for which the diagnosis of hepetiformis impetigo was clinically and histologically posed. For the first patient, the lesions appeared in the two pregnancies and were more severe and foetal repercussions (oligoamnios and hypotrophy) during the second pregnancy. For the second patient, the pregnancy was complicated with premature interruption of the membrane, giving birth to a deed fetus and causing an aggravation of the cutaneous lesions. The treatment was oral steroid followed by acitretin for the first patient, however, for the second patient; the treatment was by local steroid associated with UVB during the pregnancy. Then, acitrétine was used and was efficient.
CONCLUSION: Our two cases show the importance of gynaecological control in order to avoid complications which can be sometimes fatal. They also show the importance of local steroid associated with UVB which constitute another therapeutic alternative in the treatment of hepetiformis impetigo.","['Masmoudi A', 'Abdelmaksoud W', 'Ghorbel S', 'Amouri H', 'Mseddi M', 'Bouassida S', 'Zahaf A', 'Guermazi M', 'Boudaya S', 'Turki H']",2008,37,8,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris),"Masmoudi A, et al.

18629692,999 abuse: do mothers know what they are using?,"Many parents purchase topical applications without knowing what they contain, and apply them liberally to their children with dermatological disorders. In one such case, an infant developed fever, diarrhea and a small ulcer near the right labia majora which was treated with a topical cream called '999' containing dexamethasone acetate. The infant subsequently developed extensive necrotizing fasciitis. She required prolonged intravenous antibiotic use and underwent multiple surgical procedures for debridement and reconstruction. Another mother was concerned about therapeutic corticosteroids prescribed to her 11-year old daughter with eczema. She acquired the 999 cream from the Chinese mainland and applied it liberally as an emollient to her daughter's back. When assessed at the clinic, her daughter appeared cushingoid with accelerated growth velocity in BMI and weight but decelerated growth in height. Furthermore, one mother applied a large quantity of 999 on her daughter with mild eczema and another mother applied it on her son with impetigo. None of these mothers knew that they were using potent topical corticosteroids. This report serves to alert the public to avoid applying unknown topical medication on children with skin diseases. The physician caring for patients with skin disease should be aware that even steroidophobic parents might indeed be unknowingly using potent corticosteroids.","['Hon KL', 'Burd A']",2008,19,4,J Dermatolog Treat,Hon KL and Burd A. 999 abuse: do mothers know what they are using?. 999 abuse: do mothers know what they are using?. 2008; 19:241-5. doi: 10.1080/09546630701691251,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18629692/
18614960,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in collegiate football players.,"PURPOSE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been recognized as a serious skin infection in the athletic population. Literature in reference to football players has been sparse. We sought to better elucidate circumstances surrounding such infections in collegiate football players.
METHODS: Data from three Division-I collegiate football programs were consolidated and analyzed. Variables included presence of MRSA infection, timing of occurrence, body location involved, lesion morphology, need for surgical treatment, and antibiotic route. Data were analyzed statistically to evaluate player position, body location, and timing of occurrences.
RESULTS: Of the 491 collegiate football players, 33 (6.7%) were diagnosed with MRSA infections. Cutaneous manifestations included abscess (70%), cellulitis (16%), folliculitis, impetigo, and necrotizing fasciitis. Of the infections, 90% underwent surgical drainage, whereas 27% received intravenous antibiotics. Extremity infections (n = 30) greatly exceeded truncal infections (n = 7); the most common locations were the elbow (n = 11), knee (n = 6), leg (n = 4), and forearm (n = 4). There was no difference in occurrence by player position. Infections occurred predominantly in the first third of the season (P < 0.001, chi-square test) and significantly decreased as the season progressed.
CONCLUSION: MRSA infections involving football players are becoming more common. This study documents player positions involved, timing of occurrence in the season, location and type of infections, and required treatment. Exposed extremities may predispose to infection due to risk for minor trauma and direct contact with bacteria. As infection risk seems to be independent of position, all players should observe protective measures. Although most infections occur earlier in the season, physicians should remain alert for infection occurrences throughout the season.","['Bowers AL', 'Huffman GR', 'Sennett BJ']",2008,40,8,Med Sci Sports Exerc,"Bowers AL, et al.

Clinically it is characterized by erythematous plaques surrounded by sterile pustules associated with fever, diarrhea, sweating and increasing risk of stillbirth for placental insufficiency. We describe a case of developed erythematous plaques surrounded by pustules localised initially to the trunk of a 35-year-old woman at the 34th week of gestation after 5 days of treatment with N-Butyl-Scopolammonium, and which later involved the upper and lower limbs. Skin histology confirmed the diagnosis of generalised pregnancy pustular psoriasis (impetigo herpetiformis). IH is reported to be associated with hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, use of oral contraceptives and bacterial infections. This is the first report suggesting the potential role of drugs other than oral contraceptives in the pathogenetic mechanism of this disease. In this case an adverse cutaneous reaction to BB could be the cause of the development of Koebner isomorphism.","['Guerriero C', 'Lanza Silveri S', 'Sisto T', 'Rosati D', 'De Simone C', 'Fossati B', 'Pomini F', 'Rotoli M', 'Amerio P', 'Capizzi R']",2008,22,2,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Guerriero C, et al.

She was treated for both presumed impetigo and a flare of her underlying AD with cephalexin, bacitracin ointment, topical steroids, and diphenhydramine. Her condition worsened, and she was seen 3 days later by her primary care physician, who recognized the superimposition of a herpetic infection on her underlying AD and revised the diagnosis to EH. An oral regimen of acyclovir led to prompt resolution of the patient's rash and symptoms.

Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) is strongly associated with the severity of disease. SPE B is a cysteine protease and matures itself by autocatalysis. We found that SPE B was directly associated with human S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase), an essential factor for a delayed-type immune response. AdoHcyase protein levels and enzymatic activities were significantly higher in human cells infected with the Streptococcus pyogenes SW510 speB mutant strain than in cells infected with the NZ131 wild-type strain. SPE B also inactivated AdoHcyase, shown by a decrease in homocysteine, the main product of AdoHcyase. We found that in vivo and in vitro, SPE B induced hypermethioninemia, which is caused by an AdoHcyase defect. We also found that AdoHcyase is a substrate of SPE B cysteine protease. SPE B, therefore, potentially causes immunosuppression by cleaving AdoHcyase.","['Hsu JF', 'Chuang WJ', 'Shiesh SC', 'Lin YS', 'Liu CC', 'Wang CC', 'Fu TF', 'Tsai JH', 'Tsai WL', 'Huang YJ', 'Hsieh YH', 'Wu JJ', 'Lin MT', 'Huang W']",2008,198,3,J Infect Dis,"Hsu JF, et al.

18465601,MSI-78 Magainin Pharmaceuticals.,"Magainin is developing MSI-78, a 22-amino acid peptide, based on compounds discovered in frog skin, as a topical anti-infective. It has broad-spectrum activity, covering Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and Candida albicans. The compound also has potential for the treatment of impetigo and healing wounds with various infections. In July 1998, Magainin filed an NDA with the US FDA for the treatment of infections in diabetic foot ulcers [292671]. It expects to launch the drug during the second quarter of 1999 [275844]. A completed pivotal, 584 patient, phase III trial demonstrated statistical equivalence between MSI-78 and orally-administered ofloxacin, for the treatment of infection in diabetic foot ulcers. MSI-78 was comparable to ofloxacin with respect to the primary endpoint of clinical response of infection at day ten of treatment, and at subsequent time points through to day 28, and at follow-up [220339]. These data were confirmed by the company's second phase III trial for the same indication, for which successful results were announced in March 1997 [239274]. Additional data from this second trial, presented at the 37th Annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), demonstrated that both drugs were comparable in terms of eradication rate of individual organisms and wound healing [264410]. Between 10% and 15% of wounds in patients treated with a combination of both drugs reached closure within four weeks. After six weeks, the closure rate increased to between 18% and 30%. This suggested that additional studies should be performed to evaluate the wound-healing effects further [275279]. The side-effects of both treatments were well-tolerated, although treatment with ofloxacin was associated with a significant excess of insomnia compared to MSI-78 [275844]. Further phase III trials are planned for treatment of surgical wounds, decubitus ulcers, venous stasis ulcers and infections associated with burns [173293]. The primary clinical endpoint is the cure of the infection and the secondary endpoint is the eradication of the organism. The first study has enrolled approximately 400 patients [195065]. The drug was also being developed for impetigo, but proved no better than placebo in phase III trials for the treatmentprimarily because 75% of controls showed clinical improvement as a result of better hygiene [293751]. Magainin is attempting to develop a recombinant process for commercial synthesis of MSI-78 to allow it to compete on price with conventional antibiotics [174944], [176153]. Magainin has a contract with Abbott for the manufacture of the drug [174944]. In February 1997, Magainin entered into a development, supply and distribution agreement in North America with SmithKline Beecham (SB) for Cytolex [234035]. Magainin has retained all rights to the drug outside of North America [275844], although it has also signed an agreement with Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (ASE) to commercialize MSI-78 (as Cytolex) in India [274544], [275556]. Analysts estimate the potential revenues of this compound, including off-label usage is between $200 and $250 million in the US and up to half as much again outside the US [191231].","['Islam K', 'Hawser SP']",1998,1,5,IDrugs,Islam K and Hawser SP.

In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cefalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both paediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity.

18405369,Relationships between emm and multilocus sequence types within a global collection of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"BACKGROUND: The M type-specific surface protein antigens encoded by the 5' end of emm genes are targets of protective host immunity and attractive vaccine candidates against infection by Streptococcus pyogenes, a global human pathogen. A history of genetic change in emm was evaluated for a worldwide collection of > 500 S. pyogenes isolates that were defined for genetic background by multilocus sequence typing of housekeeping genes.
RESULTS: Organisms were categorized by genotypes that roughly correspond to throat specialists, skin specialists, and generalists often recovered from infections at either tissue site. Recovery of distant clones sharing the same emm type was approximately 4-fold higher for skin specialists and generalists, as compared to throat specialists. Importantly, emm type was often a poor marker for clone. Recovery of clones that underwent recombinational replacement with a new emm type was most evident for the throat and skin specialists. The average ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was 4.9, 1.5 and 1.3 for emm types of the throat specialist, skin specialist and generalist groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Data indicate that the relationships between emm type and genetic background differ among the three host tissue-related groups, and that the selection pressures acting on emm appear to be strongest for the throat specialists. Since positive selection is likely due in part to a protective host immune response, the findings may have important implications for vaccine design and vaccination strategies.","['Bessen DE', 'McGregor KF', 'Whatmore AM']",2008,8,,BMC Microbiol,"Bessen DE, et al.

It is important to understand the diagnosis, treatment, and implications of these disorders in order to avert unnecessary discomfort and complications.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the specific dermatoses of pregnancy according to an established classification system.
DATA SOURCES: Reports identified from PubMed and textbook searches using relevant terms pertaining to the stated questions.
CONCLUSION: The dermatoses of pregnancy represent a unique group of disease processes caused or exacerbated by the gravid state. This includes gestational pemphigoid (GP), pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), prurigo of pregnancy (PP), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), and impetigo herpetiformis (IH). GP, ICP, and IH may result in serious complications, whereas PUPPP and PP are generally benign processes. Early recognition of these disorders will possibly reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.","['Thurston A', 'Grau RH']",2008,101,1,J Okla State Med Assoc,Thurston A and Grau RH.

18389088,Retapamulin: a new topical antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections.,"Retapamulin is the first agent in the new pleuromutilin class of antibacterials to become commercially available for clinical use in humans. Retapamulin acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis and has a unique mode of antibiotic action. To date, retapamulin has not demonstrated any clinically relevant, target-specific crossresistance with other antibiotic classes, and has shown a low potential for resistance selection in vitro. In preclinical studies, retapamulin demonstrated pronounced in vitro activity against staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobic Gram-positive clinical isolates associated with skin and skin structure infections. Clinical pharmacology studies showed low systemic exposure with topical use of retapamulin, and a favorable tolerability profile. In clinical efficacy trials involving pediatric and adult patients who received retapamulin twice daily for five days, retapamulin was highly effective in the treatment of impetigo, secondarily infected traumatic lesions and secondarily infected dermatitis. Further, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of retapamulin was comparable to that of commonly used oral and topical antibiotics. Retapamulin was also clinically effective against isolates resistant to existing therapies. As a 1% ointment, retapamulin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of impetigo and in Europe for the shortterm treatment of impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions and sutured wounds.","['Parish LC', 'Parish JL']",2008,44,2,Drugs Today (Barc),Parish LC and Parish JL.

18373105,Changing epidemiology of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in Northeast Florida: a comparative study.,"The objective of this study was to review the epidemiological patterns of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) in a pediatric population. We compared incidence, pathogenesis, clinical presentation and outcomes in two APSGN pediatric patient cohorts in northeastern Florida. Retrospective medical records were reviewed of children who were admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of APSGN. Patients admitted between 1999 and 2006 (recent cohort) were compared with a previously reported cohort of patients admitted between 1957 and 1973 (earlier cohort). The recent cohort comprised 45 children with APSGN of whom 87% were male and 13% were female; the median age was 7 years, and there was an average incidence of 6.4 patients per year. The earlier cohort comprised 153 children with APSGN of whom 62% were male and 38% were female; the median age 4.25 years, and there was an average incidence of 10.9 patients per year. The recent cohort was predominantly White-American (62%) and the earlier cohort predominately African American (87%). In the recent cohort, 64% of patients had antecedent pharyngitis, and in the earlier cohort, 66% of patients had antecedent pyoderma. In the recent cohort, 11% of APSGN cases occurred between August to October, and in the earlier cohort, 50% occurred during these months. In the recent cohort, symptoms of APSGN at presentation were milder and all cases recovered, but in the earlier cohort two deaths (1.3% mortality) were reported. In conclusion, there has been a decline in the incidence and severity of APSGN at our institute in recent decades. Pharyngitis has replaced impetigo as the predominant cause of APSGN. The etiological agent for impetigo has changed over the last decade, which has impacted the incidence, racial distribution, seasonal variation and severity of APSGN.","['Ilyas M', 'Tolaymat A']",2008,23,7,Pediatr Nephrol,Ilyas M and Tolaymat A.

18342068,[Antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus strains responsible for community-acquired skin infections].,"BACKGROUND: The appearance and worldwide spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections warrant new studies of antibiotic resistance among strains of S. aureus responsible for cutaneous infections seen in general practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicentre study was performed from December 2003 to August 2004 in outpatients of both sexes presenting with a common bacterial skin infection presumed due to S. aureus (primary or secondary impetigo, ecthyma, paronychia, folliculitis, furunculosis). The investigators (n=50) were GPs from seven French regions. Clinical data (history, previous hospitalisation, type of infection, site, previous treatment, etc.) were collected using a standard questionnaire. A bacteriological sample was taken in attempt to isolate S. aureus after which antibiograms were prepared and minimal inhibiting concentrations determined (11 antibiotics).
RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty patients of mean age 42 years (range: 2-94 years) were included. S. aureus was isolated from cultures in 205 of 477 samples, i.e. in 197 patients (eight had two strains of S. aureus). Patients with S. aureus had a primary skin infection in 104/197 cases (53%) (24 impetigo, 20 paronychia, 45 folliculitis or furunculosis) and a secondary infection in 93/197 cases (47%), with 4.9% patients being hospitalized within the preceding six months (median: 10 days). Percentages of resistant S. aureus strains were as follows: penicillin: 86%, erythromycin: 32%, ciprofloxacin: 9.3%, tetracycline: 5.8%, oxacillin: 5.8% (representing MRSA strains), fusidic acid: 4.4%, clindamycin: 3.4%, mupirocin: 1% and gentamicin: 0.5%. All S. aureus strains were sensitive to vancomycin and rifampicin. Except for one strain also resistant to tetracycline and fusidic acid, all MRSA strains were also resistant to ciprofloxacin.
DISCUSSION: Multiresistant bacterial strains could become a concern in the community in France in the near future. In our study, only 14/197 (6.8%) S. aureus strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, whereas 21/197 (10.7%) were resistant to at least three of them. Compared to a French study performed in private practice in 2000, the level of MRSA is growing only slowly (5.8% versus 3.9%), whereas the percentage of strains of Peni-R/Oxa-S S. aureus are stable (80.5%).
CONCLUSION: Common bacterial infections of the skin due to MRSA or to multiresistant S. aureus are not rare in France and have tended to increase slowly in recent years.","['Bernard P', 'Jarlier V', 'Santerre-Henriksen A']",2008,135,1,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Bernard P, et al.

18341664,Efficacy and safety of retapamulin ointment as treatment of impetigo: randomized double-blind multicentre placebo-controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common skin infection, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and mainly occurring in children. It is usually treated topically with antibiotics to achieve a quick cure and prevent spread of the infection. Worldwide, resistance rates of S. aureus against commonly used antibiotics are rising. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the treatment of primary impetigo.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs. 52.1%; P<0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and 1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that topical retapamulin is effective and safe in the treatment of primary impetigo, offering a new treatment option.","['Koning S', 'van der Wouden JC', 'Chosidow O', 'Twynholm M', 'Singh KP', 'Scangarella N', 'Oranje AP']",2008,158,5,Br J Dermatol,"Koning S, et al.

18317033,Management of common bacterial infections of the skin.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bacterial skin infections commonly encountered in the community include impetigo, folliculitis/furunculosis, simple abscesses, erysipelas and other nonnecrotizing cellulitis. The review focuses on recent epidemiological, bacteriological and therapeutic advances.
RECENT FINDINGS: Impetigo and erysipelas occur in about 20 and 1 person/1000/year, respectively. Main risk factors for erysipelas are toe-web intertrigo and lymphedema. The true incidence of furunculosis is unknown, whereas outbreaks in small communities are reported worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen for impetigo and furunculosis, and methicillin-resistant strains play a growing role in both diseases. Erysipelas are mainly caused by streptococci, whereas local complications (i.e. abscesses or blisters) may be due to staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains in involved geographic areas. Recent trends for treating impetigo and furunculosis predate community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. For outbreaks of furunculosis, stringent decolonization measures are showing promise, whereas there is no validated therapeutic regimen for chronic furunculosis. Current trends for erysipelas involve ambulatory treatments and reduced duration of antibiotics.
SUMMARY: Despite better epidemiological or bacteriological knowledge of common bacterial skin infections, the exact role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci needs regular surveys in involved geographic areas. Antibiotic treatment must be active on staphylococci and, to a lesser degree, on streptococci.",['Bernard P'],2008,21,2,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Bernard P.

We describe recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema in 11 children and outline the differences between recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema and Kawasaki disease in this age range.
OBSERVATIONS: Eleven children (7 male and 4 female) presented with the sudden appearance of asymptomatic erythema, which was salmonlike in color and rapidly desquamating, involving the perineum in 10 patients and extending to the perianal area in 1 patient. At the onset of the rash, all patients were in good health, although 9 had mild fever for 1 to 2 days before its appearance. Physical examination also revealed an erythema of the hands and feet in 4 patients and strawberry tongue in 7. Two patients had a facial impetigo, and another showed a perianal streptococcal dermatitis. A group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was isolated from the throat in 10 cases and from a perianal culture in 1 case. In 8 cases, resolution was spontaneous, but all patients were treated with systemic antimicrobial therapy for 10 days. Three patients had a personal history of cutaneous rashes on the perineal area during the last years before consultation. Rash recurrence was observed in 3 of the 11 patients at the follow-up examination. Conclusion Recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema can be observed not only in young adults but also in childhood.","['Patrizi A', 'Raone B', 'Savoia F', 'Ricci G', 'Neri I']",2008,144,2,Arch Dermatol,"Patrizi A, et al.

METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus belonging to biotype C (bovine origin) were isolated from nares and hands of workers on six dairy farms of Assam and Meghalaya. The cows on the farms had a high rate of prevalence of mastitis caused by the same biotype of S. aureus. Three strains of S. aureus biotype A (human origin) were isolated from mastitis milk samples from cows on one of these farms, in which one of the workers was having cuteneous lesions (crusty abscess) and one strain of S. aureus biotype A was isolated from a swab sample collected from an abscess on the skin of the worker.
RESULTS: It has been revealed that all the members of the workers family were suffering from a similar type of cuteneous infection, indicating that it was a case of impetigo. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of all the three biotype A strains from bovine origin was identical to that of the biotype A strains isolated from the worker. The percentage of resistance to 12 commonly used therapeutic antimicrobial agents was higher among the biotype C strains from human origin than the biotype C strains from bovine origin. Several strains from cattle and human origins showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against the tested agents.","['Tiwari JG', 'Tiwari HK']",2007,51,2,Indian J Public Health,Tiwari JG and Tiwari HK.

RESULTS: Susceptibility results were similar in the UK and Ireland, but differed in France. The largest difference between countries was observed for erythromycin and fusidic acid. In France, 67.8% of isolates were susceptible to erythromycin when compared with 88.6% in Ireland and 92.8% in the UK. However, 93.7% of French isolates were susceptible to fusidic acid, compared with 68.6% in Ireland and 75.6% in the UK.

METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six S. aureus isolates with an MIC of fusidic acid above 1 mg/L were isolated during the EPISA study from patients more than 2 years old attending their general practitioners for SSTIs. All isolates were related to clonal complex by a combination of PFGE, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing. The presence of toxin genes and of the fusB determinant was monitored to characterize each represented clonal complex.
RESULTS: Eight different clonal complexes were identified. CC121 constituted the majority of the isolates from Ireland and the UK but was not represented in France. Among the other clonal complexes, CC8 and CC5 were the most common in the three countries, although the number of French isolates was limited. CC121 was the only clonal complex significantly associated with a skin infection, namely impetigo (P < 0.05). Toxin genes were present in CC121 and CC80. The fusB determinant was also detected in the same clonal complexes. Enterotoxins were found in four clonal complexes (CC1, CC5, CC8 and CC22).
CONCLUSIONS: The impetigo clone (CC121: ST123) was present in the majority of S. aureus isolates from the UK and Ireland but was not detected in France. This strain was associated with impetigo, exfoliative toxins and the fusB determinant.

18222564,"Increased US emergency department visits for skin and soft tissue infections, and changes in antibiotic choices, during the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: Test the hypotheses that emergency department (ED) visits for skin and soft tissue infections became more frequent during the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and that antibiotics typically active against community-associated MRSA were chosen increasingly.
METHODS: From merged National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for 1993-2005, we identified ED visits with diagnosis of cellulitis, abscess, felon, impetigo, hidradenitis, folliculitis, infective mastitis, nonpurulent mastitis, breast abscess, or carbuncle and furuncle. Main outcomes were change over time in rate of ED visits with such a diagnosis and proportion of antibiotic regimens including an agent typically active against community-associated MRSA. We report national estimates derived from sample weights. We tested trends with least squares linear regression.
RESULTS: In 1993, infections of interest were diagnosed at 1.2 million visits (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.5 million) versus 3.4 million in 2005 (95% CI 2.8 to 4.1 million; P for trend <.001). As a proportion of all ED visits, such infections were diagnosed at 1.35% in 1993 (95% CI 1.07% to 1.64%) versus 2.98% in 2005 (95% CI 2.40% to 3.56%; P for trend <.001). When antibiotics were prescribed at such visits, an antibiotic typically active against community-associated MRSA was chosen rarely from 1993 to 2001 but increasingly thereafter, reaching 38% in 2005 (95% CI 30% to 45%; P for trend <.001). In 2005, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used in 51% of regimens active against community-associated MRSA.
CONCLUSION: US ED visits for skin and soft tissue infections increased markedly from 1993 to 2005, contemporaneously with the emergence of community-associated MRSA. ED clinicians prescribed more antibiotics typically active against community-associated MRSA, especially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

18204285,Anaphylaxis to polyvinylpyrrolidone in povidone-iodine for impetigo contagiosum in a boy with atopic dermatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is widely used in antiseptic agents. Immediate allergic reaction to PVP-I preparations is very rare and often overlooked, as it is difficult to diagnose. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is thought to play a role in the underlying mechanism. We examined the usefulness of the histamine release test (HRT) for definite diagnosis of PVP allergy.
METHOD: A 9-year-old boy with eosinophilia (1,500/microl) and elevated total IgE (1,376 IU/ml) was suspected clinically of having a PVP allergy, as he had anaphylaxis twice when he was administered a PVP-I solution for impetigo contagiosum. Skin prick tests (SPTs) were performed with a PVP-I solution, PVP (K30), gentamicin sulfate and 2 other medicines containing PVP. HRT was assessed using peripheral blood basophils.
RESULTS: SPTs to PVP-I solution, PVP-K30 and other medicines were all negative. Histamine release was observed on stimulation by PVP in the presence of autologous serum, although it was not observed in the absence of autologous serum.
CONCLUSIONS: This observation was in line with the clinical findings that anaphylaxis had not developed despite the long use of PVP-I solution, but developed only when he received PVP-I solution treatment where basophils could contact PVP-I in the presence of serum, which was probably due to a broken skin and vessel condition. Furthermore, our results suggest the usefulness of HRT in the diagnosis of PVP allergy, and the possibility that negative SPT does not entirely rule out PVP allergy.","['Yoshida K', 'Sakurai Y', 'Kawahara S', 'Takeda T', 'Ishikawa T', 'Murakami T', 'Yoshioka A']",2008,146,2,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,"Yoshida K, et al.

Less than 520 (20%) of inmates knew all the routes of HIV transmission. A post-presentation test showed that 96% became aware of HIV/AIDS transmission and can better protect themselves. Skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aereus were reported and manifested clinically as pustules, cellulites, boils, carbuncles or impetigo. Though no systemic infection was involved, staphylococcal infections suggest lowered immunity, an indicator to undiagnosed HIV.

Complications included pharyngitis and impetigo, both caused by the same organisms. In addition to being isolated from stools, Streptococcus pyogenes was also isolated from skin lesions. Furthermore, a rapid group A streptococcal antigen test by throat swab was also positive. Hemorrhagic colitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is extremely rare, and much rarer are its complications with pharyngitis and impetigo. Compared with findings in reports of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal proctitis and perianal and perineal diseases, this case suggests a distinct pathogenesis for hemorrhagic colitis.","['Isozaki A', 'Matsubara K', 'Yui T', 'Kobayashi K', 'Kawano Y']",2007,13,6,J Infect Chemother,"Isozaki A, et al.

Most common manifestations are self-inflicted cuts to the skin, especially the skin of the forearms. Manifestations of self-destructive behaviour involving the nasal area are rather rare. A series of cases is presented in which nasal diseases were initially misinterpreted, but could finally be identified as factitious disorders. Presented symptoms were foreign body insertions, hemodynamically relevant epistaxis and impetiginous inflammations of the paravestibular skin of the nose. Factitious disorders of the nose should be identified as such for the following reasons: avoiding unnecessary operations, adequate symptomatic rhinologic therapy and the initiation of psychiatric consultation.","['Rudolph S', 'Schu U', 'Herrmann-Lingen C', 'Werner JA', 'Folz BJ']",2007,45,4,Rhinology,"Rudolph S, et al.

A 1% ointment formulation has been developed for clinical use, and a placebo-controlled trial of impetigo in 210 patients produced significantly higher rates of clinical and microbiological success compared with placebo - 85.6 versus 52.1% and 91.2 versus 50.9%, respectively. Additional comparative studies in over 1900 patients showed noninferiority to topical fusidic acid and oral cephalexin and a low frequency of adverse events.

17966176,Novel antibacterial activity of monolaurin compared with conventional antibiotics against organisms from skin infections: an in vitro study.,"OBJECTIVE: A cross-sectional laboratory study to determine the in vitro sensitivity and resistance of organisms in culture isolates from skin infections and mechanisms of action of monolaurin, a coconut lauric acid derivative, compared with 6 common antibiotics: penicillin, oxacillin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, erythromycin, and vancomycin.
METHODS: Skin culture samples were taken from newborn to 18-year-old pediatric patients with primary and secondarily infected dermatoses. Samples were collected and identified following standard guidelines, then sent to the laboratory for sensitivity testing against the 6 selected antibiotics and monolaurin.
RESULTS: Sensitivity rates of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Gram-negative E. vulneris, Enterobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. to 20 mg/ml monolaurin was 100% and of Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis was 92.31%. Escherichia coli had progressively less dense colony growths at increasing monolaurin concentrations, and at 20 mg/ml was less dense than the control. Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus spp. did not exhibit any resistance to monolaurin and had statistically significant (P <.05) differences in resistance rates to these antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Monolaurin has statistically significant in vitro broad-spectrum sensitivity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates from superficial skin infections. Most of the bacteria did not exhibit resistance to it. Monolaurin needs further pharmacokinetic studies to better understand its novel mechanisms of action, toxicity, drug interactions, and proper dosing in order to proceed to in vivo clinical studies.","['Carpo BG', 'Verallo-Rowell VM', 'Kabara J']",2007,6,10,J Drugs Dermatol,"Carpo BG, et al.

17956643,Skin infections among Indigenous Australians in an urban setting in far North Queensland.,"Skin infections are highly prevalent in many Australian Aboriginal communities. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of group A streptococcus (GAS) and Staphylococcus aureus in skin sores of Indigenous people living in an urban setting. We undertook a cross-sectional study of 173 children and youths attending the Wuchopperen Clinic (Cairns) for treatment of skin infections. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, and a skin lesion swab obtained. The median age was 5.3 years, with 42% identifying themselves as Torres Strait Islanders and 34% as Aboriginal. Impetigo (65%) was the most frequent diagnosis reported followed by scabies (19%); 79% of the lesions had erythema and 70% had exudate. Of 118 lesions, 114 were positive for pathogenic bacteria, with GAS isolated in 84 cases and S. aureus in 92; both these species were recovered from 63 lesions. Significant diversity of emm-types of GAS was associated with skin lesions in Indigenous patients (22 emm-types identified). Fifteen of the 92 S. aureus isolates were suggestive of being community-acquired on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibility profile and nine of these strains were co-cultured from nine lesions. These results have implications for future changes of antibiotic policies for the treatment of skin infections in this population.","['Valery PC', 'Wenitong M', 'Clements V', 'Sheel M', 'McMillan D', 'Stirling J', 'Sriprakash KS', 'Batzloff M', 'Vohra R', 'McCarthy JS']",2008,136,8,Epidemiol Infect,"Valery PC, et al.

The skin lesions were due to epidermolytic toxin A-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Infection control measures were implemented and a retrospective case-control study performed. Contact with an auxiliary nurse was the only risk factor for cases of bullous impetigo (P<0.01). The nurse cared for all seven cases and was an asymptomatic nasal carrier of the epidemic strain.

17944722,Tuberculids as sentinel lesions of tuberculous epididymo-orchitis.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculids are rarely associated with male genital tract tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis (TBEO) has been associated rarely with papulonecrotic tuberculid (PNT) but not with erythema induratum (EI) or the simultaneous occurrence of different tuberculids.
METHODS: A retrospective assessment of tuberculids that occurred with underlying TBEO was carried out.
RESULTS: Five patients, four with one and one with two skin biopsies, with clinical diagnoses of PNT (two), EI (one), impetigo (two) and calf ulcer (one), formed the study cohort. Histopathological evaluation confirmed PNT and EI in four and two skin biopsies, respectively. Two patients who returned for follow-up were commenced on anti-tuberculous therapy. All patients sought medical attention 3-34 months later for tender right-sided (two) and left-sided (three) testicular masses. Orchidectomy was undertaken following a poor clinical response to empirical treatment with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Pathological examination of the testis and epididymis confirmed TBEO. The patients were initiated on anti-tuberculous therapy. There was dramatic healing of the skin lesions.
CONCLUSION: Tuberculids are a sentinel cutaneous manifestation of visceral TB and a valuable external audit of treatment compliance and response. Heightened recognition of and more rigorous genitourinary tract investigation are necessary to identify occult or asymptomatic TBEO as the underlying cause of tuberculids.","['Ramdial PK', 'Calonje E', 'Sydney C', 'Subrayen S', 'Meyiwa PS', 'Aboobaker J']",2007,34,11,J Cutan Pathol,"Ramdial PK, et al.

17919209,Some Nigerian plants of dermatologic importance.,"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the world's population uses medicinal plants in the treatment of diseases and, in African countries, this rate is much higher. In recent years, however, medicinal plants have represented a primary health source for the pharmaceutical industry. No less than 400 compounds derived from plants are currently used in the preparation of drugs, such as vincristine and vinblastine used in the treatment of cancer. Nigerians still depend largely on crude herbal remedies or traditional medicine. They also use wild plants for cosmetics and perfumery. Some of these herbal remedies have been observed to be effective in certain skin diseases.
METHODS: The data were obtained from history questionnaires completed by patients at the Dermatology Clinic, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria, and from oral interviews with vendors and prescribers of herbal preparations at major markets at Lagos and Ijebu-Ode in south-west Nigeria, between July 2004 and July 2006. Photographs of plants were taken at private residences at Lagos, Ibadan, and Ijebu-Ode in south-west Nigeria. A literature search was conducted on 38 of the plants. The data are presented in tabular form.
RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of patients had applied some form of herbal remedy before attending our clinic. The reasons for consultation included relapses, unsustained relief, incomplete resolution, and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Lesions for which herbs were successfully applied included infantile eczema and seborrhoiec dermatitis, atopic eczema, impetigo, impetiginized eczema, tinea capitis, scabies, erythema multiforme, leg ulcers, localized vitiligo, and sexually transmitted diseases. Partial relief was achieved in dermatophytoses, ichthyosis, leprosy, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Some forms of alopecia, onychomycosis, and vitiligo, as well as allergic dermatoses, were not improved by herbal medicines. The preparation of the remedies was mostly by heating and boiling, infusion, and maceration. In most cases, mixtures of plants or other substances were used. The preparations were applied as poultices, ointments, baths, soaks and soaps, and oral fluids. The plants used included Adansonia digitata, Aframomum melegueta, Aloe species, Azadirachta indica, Cassia alata, Alstonia boonei, Ficus asperifolia, Cocos nucifera, Jatropha gossypyfolia, Ocimum gratissimum, Ricinus communis. A literature search on 38 of the plants used by herbal prescribers revealed the presence of established antimicrobial agents, immune modulating agents, antioxidants, other vitamins and minerals, volatile oils and emollients, and anti-inflammatory agents. Some of the plants may be contaminated by mycotoxins because of poor storage.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be clinical, scientific, and pharmacologic basis for the use of herbal preparations. Nigeria needs to provide effective coordination of the practice of herbal medicine to ensure safety, standardization, and preservation of the flora.",['Ajose FO'],2007,46 Suppl 1,,Int J Dermatol,Ajose FO.

17916211,Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus toxins and nasal carriage in furuncles and impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: The precise role of Staphylococcus aureus toxins and nasal carriage in common skin infections remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To seek correlations between toxin expression, S. aureus nasal carriage and clinical manifestations in patients with community-acquired furuncles and impetigo.
METHODS: From November 2004 to August 2005, we studied clinical data and bacteriological samples prospectively collected from 121 patients presenting with furuncles or impetigo.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (31 with furuncles and 33 with impetigo) had S. aureus-positive skin culture. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were present in 13 of 31 (42%) isolates from furuncles and were associated with epidemic furunculosis. Exfoliative toxin genes were present in 10 of 10 (100%) and 12 of 21 (57%) bullous and nonbullous impetigo isolates, respectively. Nasal carriage of S. aureus was found in 58% of patients overall. It was strongly associated with chronic furunculosis but not with simple furuncles (88% vs. 29%, P < 0.007). Skin and nose isolates from a given patient always had identical characteristics. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for four of 64 (6%) positive skin cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: PVL is not involved in all types of furuncles but is associated with epidemic furunculosis. Both bullous and nonbullous forms of impetigo are associated with exfoliative toxins. Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is associated with the chronicity of furuncles.","['Durupt F', 'Mayor L', 'Bes M', 'Reverdy ME', 'Vandenesch F', 'Thomas L', 'Etienne J']",2007,157,6,Br J Dermatol,"Durupt F, et al.

17902728,Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infections: implications for patients and practitioners.,"Dermatologists and other healthcare providers need to be aware of the epidemiology, clinical features, management, and prevention of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA) infection. Currently, infection caused by CAMRSA is considered to represent a worldwide epidemic and infectious skin lesions are a frequent occurrence. Athletes, certain ethnic populations, children, homeless persons, homosexual men, household members of infected people, HIV-infected patients, intravenous drug abusers, military personnel, newborns, pregnant and postpartum women, tattoo recipients, and urban dwellers of lower socioeconomic status in crowded living conditions are individuals at increased risk of developing CAMRSA infection. Although the observed incidence of cutaneous CAMRSA lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis or other conditions that are characterized by a non-intact skin barrier is less than that reported in other groups of people at risk for this skin infection, close surveillance for the emergence of CAMRSA skin infection in children and adults with atopic dermatitis and other patients whose skin barrier is disrupted is justified since colonization by S. aureus in these individuals represents a potential reservoir for CAMRSA. It is also important to note that infection-associated risk factors are absent in many individuals who develop cutaneous CAMRSA infection. CAMRSA skin lesions are pleomorphic. The most common presentations of CAMRSA infection are abscess, cellulitis, or both. These infectious lesions are not uncommonly misinterpreted by the patient as spider bites or insect bites. Other manifestations of cutaneous CAMRSA infection are impetigo, folliculitis, and paronychia. Incision and drainage of abscesses, systemic antibacterial therapy, and adjunctive topical antibacterial treatment are the essential components of management of CAMRSA skin infections. At the initial visit, a bacterial culture of the infectious lesion is recommended to confirm identification of the pathogen and to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. Subsequently, based upon the reported antibacterial sensitivity, alteration (if necessary) of the patient's empiric systemic antimicrobial treatment can be initiated. Direct skin-to-skin transmission of the causative bacteria, damage to the skin's surface, sharing of personal items, and a humid environment are potential mechanisms for the acquisition and transmission of CAMRSA skin infection. The spread of cutaneous CAMRSA infection can potentially be prevented by incorporating personal, environmental, and healthcare measures that strive to eliminate the causes of acquisition and transmission of the bacteria.",['Cohen PR'],2007,8,5,Am J Clin Dermatol,Cohen PR.

18093494,[Primary cutaneous infections due to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus].,"Pyodermitis constitutes a very important chapter in dermatological practice. Its pathogenesis, in special the one caused by S. aureus, has improved due to the knowledge of the role developed by the host defensins, quorum-sensing signaling and the Panton-Valentine leucocidin gene among others. As well, exfoliative toxins and enterotoxins responsible for the staphylococal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and toxic shock syndrome, respectively, have been cloned. Also, it has been seen that bullous impetigo, SSSS and pemphigus foliaceus share a common target: desmoglein-1. The Panton-Valentine leucocidin gene has been related to the appearance of abscesses, necrotic cutaneous lesions and furuncles in young persons caused by meticillin resistant S. aureus, with its epidemiological implications.

17727750,Skin infections and antibiotic prescribing: a comparison of surveillance and prescribing data.,"BACKGROUND: Reductions in the number of dispensed antibiotics and the incidence of respiratory infections presented to GPs and have been reported. Whether this trend applies to skin infections requires further investigation.
AIM: To examine trends in the incidence of skin infections in relation to trends in dispensed prescriptions for flucloxacillin, topical fusidic acid, mupirocin, and corticosteroids with fusidic acid.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Population-based analysis of patients presenting to GPs (1999-2005) contrasted with national prescribing data.
SETTING: A sentinel practice network covering a population of 700,000 in England and Wales.
METHOD: Quarterly incidence rates of skin infections and of impetigo reported over the years 1999-2005 were compared with quarterly data on dispensed prescriptions reported by the Prescription Pricing Authority for England.
RESULTS: In children (aged 0-14 years) the incidence of skin infections decreased slightly between 1999 and 2003 and more sharply from 2004 to 2005. In adults (aged > or =15 years) incidence was reasonably constant from year to year. In every year examined, and in both age groups, there were autumnal incidence peaks. There were annual increases in dispensed prescriptions for flucloxacillin capsules, but there was little change in the use of flucloxacillin syrups and topical antibiotic prescriptions. All prescribing data sets showed increases in the third quarter: topical corticosteroids with fusidic acid were prescribed more frequently in summer than winter.
CONCLUSION: In spite of slight reductions in the incidence of skin infections, flucloxacillin capsule-dispensed prescriptions have increased, suggesting that doctors have not limited their antibiotic prescribing behaviour for skin conditions.","['Fleming DM', 'Elliot AJ', 'Kendall H']",2007,57,540,Br J Gen Pract,"Fleming DM, et al.

17720643,Microbiology and management of soft tissue and muscle infections.,"This review summarizes the microbiological aspects and management of soft tissue and muscle infections. The infections presented are: impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncles, cellulitis, erysipelas, infectious gangrene (includes necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal gangrene, gas gangrene or clostridium myonecrosis, anaerobic cellulites, progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene, synergistic necrotizing cellulitis or perineal phlegmon, gangrenous balanitis, and gangrenous cellulitis in the immunocompromised patient), secondary bacterial infections complication skin lesions, diabetic and other chronic superficial skin ulcers and subcutaneous abscesses and myositis. These infections often occur in body sites or in those that have been compromised or injured by foreign body, trauma, ischemia, malignancy or surgery. In addition to Group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, the indigenous aerobic and anaerobic cutaneous and mucous membranes local microflora usually is responsible for polymicrobial infections. These infections may occasionally lead to serious potentially life-threatening local and systemic complications.

17666795,Transduction of the plasmid encoding antiseptic resistance gene qacB in Staphylococcus aureus.,"The plasmid-borne qacA and qacB genes encode a multidrug efflux protein. The proteins encoded by qacA and qacB mediate efflux of cationic antiseptic agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), qacA and qacB are widely prevalent and decrease antiseptic susceptibility. However, it is difficult to find the plasmids encoding qacA or qacB in community-associated MRSA (C-MRSA) isolated from patients with impetigo. Most MRSA, the strains causative of impetigo, carry the plasmid-borne exfoliative toxin-producing gene etb. To find the reason for the paucity of qacA or qacB in MRSA isolated from patients with impetigo, we performed transfer experiments of the plasmid pTZ2162qacB encoding qacB. The pTZ2162qacB was transferred to S. aureus strain RN4220 by transduction, although no pTZ2162qacB was transferred by conjugation. Additionally, pTZ2162qacB was transduced to MRSA carrying etb, and was coexistence with the plasmid encoding etb. Our results showed that pTZ2162qacB was horizontally transferred by transduction and was compatible with the plasmid encoding etb. Consequently, there will be risk of the emergence of C-MRSA with decreased antiseptic susceptibility among patients with impetigo.","['Nakaminami H', 'Noguchi N', 'Nishijima S', 'Kurokawa I', 'So H', 'Sasatsu M']",2007,30,8,Biol Pharm Bull,"Nakaminami H, et al.

Desmoglein 1 is the target adhesion molecule of severe blistering skin diseases such as pemphigus or bullous impetigo. However, despite this enormous pathological relevance, the molecular binding properties of desmoglein 1 are largely unknown. Using atomic force microscopic imaging, we found that desmoglein 1 molecules displayed Ca(2+)-dependent conformational changes of the extracellular domains. By single-molecule force-distance cycles, we provide evidence that desmoglein 1 undergoes Ca(2+)-dependent (K (d) = 0.8 mM Ca(2+)) homophilic trans-interaction, which is highly relevant for the contribution of desmoglein 1 homophilic binding to keratinocyte cohesion in distinct epidermal layers. Moreover, while the single-unit unbinding force is comparable to other cadherins (approximately 40 pN at retrace velocity of 300 nm/s), apparent differences with respect to multivalency of interaction and lifetime of single bonds (0.17 s) were observed. Thus, besides the biophysical characterization of desmoglein 1, a main outcome of the study is that desmoglein 1 differs from other members of the cadherin family in terms of some molecular binding properties.","['Waschke J', 'Menendez-Castro C', 'Bruggeman P', 'Koob R', 'Amagai M', 'Gruber HJ', 'Drenckhahn D', 'Baumgartner W']",2007,216,2-3,J Membr Biol,"Waschke J, et al.

Manifestations of bathing-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infections can be seen in many organ systems. The most common of these, Pseudomonas folliculitis, is a self-limiting disease in otherwise healthy people, and does not require antibiotic treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a local outbreak involving 6 people who had used the same hot whirlpool. The disease manifestations were different, and were initially confused with impetigo and mastitis/mammary tumour.
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Signs and symptoms are described, documented with photos and discussed in relation to knowledge about Pseudomonas infection and its manifestations. After suspecting the hot tub as a source of infection, diagnosis was made highly probable by bacteriological specimens from the tub. Hot tub-associated infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are probably more common than previously anticipated, and can easily be confused with conditions of different aetiology. They indicate unsatisfactory routines in tub maintenance. Improved guidelines for hot-tub-owners and the use of dip-slide cultures to secure routines are likely to prevent bathing-associated Pseudomonas infections.","['Malterud K', 'Thesen J']",2007,127,13,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,Malterud K and Thesen J.

Virulent strains of the bacteria produce exfoliative toxins (ETs) that cause the loss of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion in the superficial epidermis. Recent studies have indicated that the three isoforms of ETs, i.e., ETA, ETB, and ETD, are glutamate-specific serine proteases that specifically and efficiently cleave a single peptide bond in the extracellular region of human and mouse desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a desmosomal intercellular adhesion molecule. In addition, four isoforms of S. hyicus exfoliative toxin, ExhA, ExhB, ExhC, and ExhD, cleave swine Dsg1, resulting in skin exfoliation similar to that observed in pigs with exudative epidermitis. In this review, we describe recent advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of staphylococcal exfoliative toxins, which act as ""molecular scissors"" to facilitate percutaneous bacterial invasion of mammalian skin by cleavage of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion molecules.

17553056,Impetigo in epidemic and nonepidemic phases: an incidence study over 4(1/2) years in a general population.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about incidence and natural variation of impetigo in general populations.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the natural course of impetigo in a well-defined population, and to study the resistance pattern of the causal bacteria over time.
METHODS: This is a population-based incidence study in Austevoll, an island community of 4457 inhabitants in Norway, in the years 2001-2005. Incidence rates are given as events per person-year. Epidemic periods were identified by statistical process-control analyses.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of impetigo for the whole study period was 0.017 events per person-year, corresponding to a total of 334 cases. The incidence rates were 0.009, 0.026, 0.019, 0.016 and 0.009 in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Three epidemics were identified, starting in August of 2002, 2003 and 2004, lasting for 11, 11 and 5 weeks, respectively. Incidence rates in these epidemic periods were 0.099, 0.045 and 0.074, respectively. In epidemic periods, Staphylococcus aureus was the causal bacterium in 89% (117/132) of cases, while this proportion was 68% (84/123) in nonepidemic periods (P < 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to fusidic acid in 84% (98/117) and 64% (54/84) of impetigo cases in epidemic and nonepidemic periods, respectively (P < 0.01). When investigating all types of infections caused by S. aureus in the study period, the proportion of fusidic acid resistance in impetigo cases (152/201, 76%) differed significantly from fusidic acid resistance in other infections (18/116, 16%) (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Distinctive epidemic outbreaks occurred during the summer of three of the five follow-up years.

17390597,Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo.,"Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e., impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. The diagnosis usually is made clinically, but rarely a culture may be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve the discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of an organism that may cause other illnesses (e.g., glomerulonephritis). There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. The topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease. Oral penicillin V is seldom effective; otherwise there is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, although resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.","['Cole C', 'Gazewood J']",2007,75,6,Am Fam Physician,Cole C and Gazewood J. Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo.

OBSERVATION: A 15 year-old girl was receiving treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% (Protopic) for an episode of atopic dermatitis. On reduction of applications of tacrolimus, a vesicular-pustular rash appeared and was treated with pristinamycin and valaciclovir. At the end of antibiotic and antiviral therapy, the vesicular-pustular rash recurred while the goal was receiving treatment once more with tacrolimus ointment 0.1%. The bacteriological and virological skin samples revealed B-haemolytic streptococcus group A. The negative results for cutaneous virological samples ruled out Kaposi-Juliusberg syndrome and a diagnosis of staphylococcal impetigo was made. The intrinsic imputability of tacrolimus was I3 (C3 S2).
DISCUSSION: The most obvious specific feature of this impetigo was its limitation to areas of eczema treated by application of tacrolimus. In prospective studies in large patient cohorts, tacrolimus ointment has been associated with two types of adverse effect: local irritations and skin infections chiefly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. To date, there have been no reports in the literature of impetigo due to haemolytic B streptococcus following application of tacrolimus. Because of its immunodepressant effect, tacrolimus ointment may result in increased incidence of skin infections even though a number of studies have shown a reduction in such infections.","['Reynaert G', 'Rey AC', 'Graveriau C', 'Hesse S', 'Denoeux JP']",2007,134,3 Pt 1,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Reynaert G, et al.

BDD was first linked to infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus in children, but has more recently linked to Staphylococcus aureus and noted in adults. BDD most commonly occurs as bullae on the volar fat pads of the fingers but can occur on the proximal phalangeal and palmar areas of the hands and can manifest as multiple bullae. The bullae can evolve into erosions over the course of several days. BDD can coexist with and may be secondary to clinically imperceptible infections of the nasopharynx, conjunctiva or anus, which underlines the need for systemic antibiotic therapy. Multiple bullae appear to be a predictor that S. aureus is the causative agent of a case of BDD. When BDD is suspected, treatment involves: (i) incision and drainage of bullae, (ii) wet to dry compresses to dry the eroded areas, and (iii) a course of a beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics, necessary because S. aureus, now found to be a common cause of BDD, is usually resistant to penicillin.

Isolates produced identical PFGE patterns regardless of their invasiveness and/or tetracycline resistance. Multilocus sequence typing classified all isolates as ST340. An ST5 (emm83) isolate, a potential ancestor of ST340, was isolated in the Czech Republic from an impetigo patient in 1988. The Czech emm53/ST340 isolates shared only three of seven alleles with the original Lancefield emm53/ST11 isolate.","['Strakova L', 'Motlova J', 'Jakubu V', 'Urbaskova P', 'Kriz P']",2007,13,4,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Strakova L, et al.

17344365,Characterization of the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone of Staphylococcus aureus.,"Resistance to the antibiotic fusidic acid in European strains of Staphylococcus aureus causing impetigo has increased in recent years. This increase appears to have resulted from clonal expansion of a strain we have designated the epidemic European fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC), which carries the fusidic acid resistance determinant fusB on its chromosome. To understand better the properties of the EEFIC responsible for its success, we have performed detailed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of this clone. Molecular typing revealed the EEFIC to be ST123, spa type t171, and agr type IV and therefore unrelated to earlier prevalent fusB(+) strains found in the United Kingdom. EEFIC strains exhibited resistance to fusidic acid, penicillin, and, in some cases, erythromycin, which are all used in the treatment of impetigo. PCR analysis of the EEFIC and complete DNA sequencing of the 39.3 Kb plasmid it harbors identified genes encoding several toxins previously implicated in impetigo (exfoliative toxins A and B and EDIN-C). The location of fusB was mapped on the chromosome and found to be associated with a novel 16.6-kb genomic island integrated downstream of groEL. Although this element is related to classical staphylococcal pathogenicity islands, it does not encode any known virulence factors and consequently has been designated SaRI(fusB) (for ""S. aureus resistance island carrying fusB"").","[""O'Neill AJ"", 'Larsen AR', 'Skov R', 'Henriksen AS', 'Chopra I']",2007,45,5,J Clin Microbiol,"O'Neill AJ, et al.

The neonate with bullous impetigo was treated with antibiotics; the remaining neonates were not treated. The neonate with transient neonatal pustular melanosis developed hyperpigmentation, whereas the other neonates recovered without sequelae. Skin lesions in neonates are common and frequently cause parental concern. Most causes of neonatal pustular and vesicular skin eruptions are benign and transient. However, some skin lesions must be recognised and treated rapidly. Therefore it is important to identify these neonatal skin eruptions based on a thorough history of the mother and child and clinical presentation. Skin culture may be helpful in some cases.","['van Emmen E', 'Roord ST', 'Brouwer AF', 'Kuiters GR', 'Bekhof J']",2007,151,5,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"van Emmen E, et al.

17312668,Dermatologic correlates of selected metabolic events.,"Various metabolic events may lead to dermatologic pathology. Three illustrative examples are glucagonoma syndrome, uremic pruritus, and zinc deficiency. The glucagonoma syndrome, resulting from a glucagon secreting-tumor, is characterized by a distinctive dermatitis, necrolytic migratory erythema. This skin rash is a generalized, pruritic eruption which first appears as erythematous patches, then progresses to form superficial vesicles and bullae. Uremic pruritus is a clinical phenomenon seen in patients with chronic renal failure; it provokes vigorous scratching and may lead to numerous cutaneous lesions including extensive excoriations, lichen simplex chronicus, prurigo nodularis, keratotic papules, or secondary impetigo. Zinc deficiency may be evident as an inherited disease called acrodermatitis enteropathica, which presents clinically with a predominately acral and periorificial rash of sharply demarcated erythematous, exfoliative, and exudative patches. It may also result from an acquired defect with similar clinical findings. A brief review concerning the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are given for glucagonoma syndrome, uremic pruritus, and zinc deficiency. Any pathophysiologic dysfunction that results in a loss of metabolic control of homeostasis in the body may demonstrate cutaneous manifestations. These skin findings may be of great clinical significance and may aid in the diagnosis or even be the first sign of a disease process. The glucagonoma syndrome, uremic pruritus, and zinc deficiency are three examples of dermatologic correlates of metabolic events.","['Cohen JB', 'Janniger CK', 'Piela Z', 'Szepietowski JC', 'Samady JA', 'Schwartz RA']",1999,30,3-4,J Med,"Cohen JB, et al.

17292581,Oral beta-lactams applied to uncomplicated infections of skin and skin structures.,"Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) include impetigo, erysipelas, folliculitis, simple abscesses, and cellulitis. Their common bacterial causative agents include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Current guidelines predate the widespread occurrences of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as a community-acquired pathogen and include dicloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, all orally, or mupirocin ointment applied topically, for impetigo. For other uSSSI, recommendations are based on the probability of the infection being caused by MRSA. If methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) are known or suspected, the oral agents recommended include clindamycin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). For MRSA, recommended oral agents are linezolid, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and SXT. Because community-acquired MRSA infections now predominate in patients with abscesses in the United States, agents recommended for MRSA should be used for this indication. Local susceptibility patterns should guide empiric therapy. However, no placebo-controlled trials of uSSSI are available, and the evidence used to generate these recommendations is based on comparative noninferiority studies, often with wide noninferiority margins and confidence intervals. The evidence used in developing current guidelines therefore has significant limitations. Further studies, such as superiority outcome studies, placebo-controlled studies, measurement of time to resolution, or other novel approaches, are needed to resolve these treatment dilemmas. Until such studies are performed, the best surrogate available for predicting clinical outcome is application of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles; these describe in vivo drug behavior and allow determination of susceptibility breakpoints for predicting in vivo antimicrobial efficacy via attainment of antimicrobial targets.","['Jacobs MR', 'Jones RN', 'Giordano PA']",2007,57,3 Suppl,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Jacobs MR, et al.

17263216,Common skin conditions during pregnancy.,"Common skin conditions during pregnancy generally can be separated into three categories: hormone-related, preexisting, and pregnancy-specific. Normal hormone changes during pregnancy may cause benign skin conditions including striae gravidarum (stretch marks); hyperpigmentation (e.g., melasma); and hair, nail, and vascular changes. Preexisting skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infections, cutaneous tumors) may change during pregnancy. Pregnancy-specific skin conditions include pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, impetigo herpetiformis, and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy are the most common of these disorders. Most skin conditions resolve postpartum and only require symptomatic treatment. However, there are specific treatments for some conditions (e.g., melasma, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy). Antepartum surveillance is recommended for patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, and pemphigoid gestationis.","['Tunzi M', 'Gray GR']",2007,75,2,Am Fam Physician,Tunzi M and Gray GR.

A number of 411 wrestlers were randomly selected from wrestling clubs in Tehran employing cluster sample setting method. The participants were interviewed using a specially designed and validated questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants (44%) had ""cauliflower ears"". Only 23% of these participants had received any kind of treatment for their acute ear haematomas that are known to result in ""cauliflower ears"". The prevalence of reported hearing loss among participants with cauliflower ears (11.5%, 95%CI: 6.9 to 16.2) was significantly more than this prevalence among those participants without cauliflower ears (1.8%, 95%CI: 0.1 to 3.5) (p < 0.05).

17183632,Differences between Belgian and Brazilian group A Streptococcus epidemiologic landscape.,"BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) clinical and molecular epidemiology varies with location and time. These differences are not or are poorly understood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively studied the epidemiology of GAS infections among children in outpatient hospital clinics in Brussels (Belgium) and Brasília (Brazil). Clinical questionnaires were filled out and microbiological sampling was performed. GAS isolates were emm-typed according to the Center for Disease Control protocol. emm pattern was predicted for each isolate. 334 GAS isolates were recovered from 706 children. Skin infections were frequent in Brasília (48% of the GAS infections), whereas pharyngitis were predominant (88%) in Brussels. The mean age of children with GAS pharyngitis in Brussels was lower than in Brasília (65/92 months, p<0.001). emm-typing revealed striking differences between Brazilian and Belgian GAS isolates. While 20 distinct emm-types were identified among 200 Belgian isolates, 48 were found among 128 Brazilian isolates. Belgian isolates belong mainly to emm pattern A-C (55%) and E (42.5%) while emm pattern E (51.5%) and D (36%) were predominant in Brasília. In Brasília, emm pattern D isolates were recovered from 18.5% of the pharyngitis, although this emm pattern is supposed to have a skin tropism. By contrast, A-C pattern isolates were infrequently recovered in a region where rheumatic fever is still highly prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic features of GAS from a pediatric population were very different in an industrialised country and a low incomes region, not only in term of clinical presentation, but also in terms of genetic diversity and distribution of emm patterns. These differences should be taken into account for designing treatment guidelines and vaccine strategies.","['Smeesters PR', 'Vergison A', 'Campos D', 'de Aguiar E', 'Miendje Deyi VY', 'Van Melderen L']",2006,1,1,PLoS One,"Smeesters PR, et al.

17118289,Skin and soft tissue infections.,"Primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. Although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle.

Exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcal aureus, which causes Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) and bullous impetigo, specifically digest Dsg1. A subset of patients with SSSS develop a low titer of anti-Dsg1 IgG autoantibodies. A mutation in DSG1 gene causes striate palmoplantar keratoderma and a mutation in DSG4 gene causes inherited hypotrichosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate dermatological findings presented by 30 members of a Brazilian family, half of whom are infected with HTLV-1 (as confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot).
METHODS: The subjects underwent dermatologic examination and laboratory assessment, which included the search for the HTLV-1 genome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by qualitative and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in skin samples by nested qualitative PCR and immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: We found that cases of xerotic dermatological alterations, including 3 cases of acquired ichthyosis, were more frequent among the infected patients (7 cases vs. none among the uninfected individuals; P=.0063). Other lesions observed in this group included impetigo, scabies, epidermal nevus, herpes zoster scar, rosacea, and juvenile acne. One HTLV-1-infected individual presented with concurrently acquired ichthyosis, impetigo, scabies, dermatophytosis, and seborrheic dermatitis. The PCR performed on PBMCs and skin samples from 24 patients confirmed the serological results in all cases. Additionally, the HTLV-1 proviral load was higher in patients with >1 skin lesion. Finally, HTLV-1 could be identified in the skin by immunofluorescence assay, which, by use of PCR as the gold standard, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 61.5% and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these clinical and laboratory findings point to an HTLV-1 tropism toward the skin, even in HTLV-1 carriers without adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and/or tropical spastic paraparesis.","['Nobre V', 'Guedes AC', 'Martins ML', 'Barbosa-Stancioli EF', 'Serufo JC', 'Proietti FA', 'Ribas JG', 'Ferreira CE', 'Lambertucci JR', 'GIPH Interdisciplinary Group on HTLV-1/2 Research']",2006,43,10,Clin Infect Dis,"Nobre V, et al.

16960696,Zinc-deficiency dermatitis in breast-fed infants.,"We report ten infants (mean gestational age: 30 weeks; range: 25 to 40 weeks) with zinc deficiency dermatitis who developed erosive, impetiginized periorificial dermatitis at 10 weeks of age (corresponding to a mean gestational age of 41.4 weeks, with a range of 36-44 weeks), but who were otherwise well. Cutaneous symptoms were initially misdiagnosed as eczema or impetigo in 8/10 (80%) children who received either topical (4/8) and/or systemic (6/8) antibiotics. Topical corticosteroids were applied in 4/10 infants for a mean time of 4 weeks (range: 2 to 5 weeks) before the correct diagnosis was established by decreased serum zinc levels; skin atrophy (telangiectasia, thinning) as a complication of topical steroid treatment (class II steroids) was observed in two infants. All children responded to oral therapy with zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate (1.5-4 mg/kg/d). Skin lesions started to clear within 24 h after the initiation of therapy and had completely cleared in all infants after 14 days of therapy (range: 3-14 days). We conclude that nutritional zinc deficiency is a frequently misdiagnosed problem in thriving, fully breast-fed preterm babies. It is attributable to the decreased zinc content of human milk as compared to cow's milk, and the increased demand of zinc in rapidly thriving preterm infants. It seems advisable to routinely check serum zinc levels in fully breast-fed preterm infants who do not receive regular oral zinc supplementation once they reach a gestational age of 40 weeks.","['Kienast A', 'Roth B', 'Bossier C', 'Hojabri C', 'Hoeger PH']",2007,166,3,Eur J Pediatr,"Kienast A, et al.

HHV-6 has a tendency of neurovirulence, which can destroy the blood-brain barrier and facilitate the easy invasion of agents inside the brain. Although autoimmune neutropenia of infancy is benign and self limiting, it must be emphasized that severe bacterial infection will be induced by concurrent viral infection in this specific disorder.","['Tokushima-Imayoshi M', 'Onoue T', 'Matsuo M', 'Yoshida N', 'Sato T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Ishii E']",2006,84,2,Int J Hematol,"Tokushima-Imayoshi M, et al.

This is a retrospective study of the agents, clinical aspects, sources of infection of 200 cases (98 males, 102 females, mean age 42 years) of tinea incognito, observed in Siena and Milan, Italy, in the period 1987-2002. In order of decreasing frequency, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton violaceum and Trichophyton erinacei were isolated. The clinical appearance of the infection was lupus erythematosus discoid-like, eczema-like, rosacea-like, especially on the face, impetigo-like and eczema-like on trunk and limbs. Less often the dermatophytosis resembled psoriasis, purpura, seborrhoic dermatitis and lichen planus. There was folliculitis in 9% of cases and dermatophytid in 3% of cases. Antimycotic therapy brought about clinical and mycological recovery in all patients except one, who had iatrogenic immunodepression.","['Romano C', 'Maritati E', 'Gianni C']",2006,49,5,Mycoses,"Romano C, et al.

16873392,"The association between impetigo, insect bites and air temperature: a retrospective 5-year study (1999-2003) using morbidity data collected from a sentinel general practice network database.","BACKGROUND: Impetigo is one of the commonest childhood skin infections. Insect bites are commonly implicated in the development of impetigo. There are, however, very few data available to describe the seasonal incidences and association between the two conditions.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the seasonal incidence of impetigo in England and Wales and to investigate the reported association with insect bites.
METHODS: Clinical diagnoses of impetigo and insect bites were recorded from a sentinel GP network over the years 1999-2003.
RESULTS: The highest mean weekly rates of impetigo were in children aged 0-4 years (84 per 100 000) and in those aged 5-14 years (54 per 100 000). In contrast, the incidence of insect bite only varied between 3 and 5 per 100 000 for males and between 5 and 9 per 100 000 for females. The relative risk (RR) for females consulting over males with impetigo was similar in children [RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.02)] and adults [RR 1.20 (1.16-1.25)]; the RR of insect bite was similar in children [RR 1.21 (1.09-1.34)] but almost twice as likely in adults [RR 2.13 (2.02-2.25)]. Insect bite peaked almost coincidentally with temperature whereas there was a lag of one-to-two 4-week periods between impetigo and temperature.
CONCLUSION: There is suggestion of some degree of association between impetigo and insect bites. The improved management of patients consulting with insect bites and better use of antiseptic treatments might provide the basis for reducing the incidence of impetigo in the community.","['Elliot AJ', 'Cross KW', 'Smith GE', 'Burgess IF', 'Fleming DM']",2006,23,5,Fam Pract,"Elliot AJ, et al.

16765209,An outbreak of noninvasive group A streptococcal disease in a facility for the developmentally disabled.,"BACKGROUND: Reports of outbreaks of group A streptococcal disease in long-term care facilities are uncommon.
METHODS: An outbreak of noninvasive group A streptococcal disease was investigated in a large facility for the developmentally disabled. The antistreptolysin O test was used to supplement the case finding.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven cases of streptococcal pharyngitis were diagnosed among residents and staff of the facility. Interventions based on enhanced infection control practices were effective, but maintaining them for several months was challenging because of the large number of staff, cognitive deficits of the residents, inconveniently placed areas for hand sanitation for the staff, and occurrence of a simultaneous outbreak of impetigo in the same population. After 4 months, the outbreak was successfully managed without chemoprophylaxis of the entire residential population and staff.
CONCLUSION: Outbreaks of group A streptococcal disease in centers for persons with developmental disabilities have unique challenges superimposed on routine outbreak response measures.","['Dworkin MS', 'Park L', 'Barringer J', 'Curtis R']",2006,34,5,Am J Infect Control,"Dworkin MS, et al.

16757615,Genetically diverse group A streptococci from children in far-western Nepal share high genetic relatedness with isolates from other countries.,"The genetic diversity of group A streptococci (GAS) throughout much of the world has not been adequately explored. To assess genetic variation among GAS in western Nepal, 120 noninvasive GAS, collected from eight different villages, were genetically characterized using emm typing, sof sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A high level of genetic diversity was observed among these isolates, with 51 genotypes based upon 51 multilocus sequence types (STs), 45 emm sequence types, and 28 sof sequence types. On the basis of shared ST-emm and sof-emm associations, 40 of the 51 genotypes were identical or highly related to genotypes characterized from locations outside of Nepal, even though most of the emm sequence and clonal types are rare among GAS within the United States. When analyzing all known STs highly related to Nepal STs, only one example of similar STs shared between a sof PCR-positive strain and a sof PCR-negative strain was observed. Since previous data indicate free exchange of MLST loci between sof-positive and sof-negative strains, there is possibly selection against the expansion of subclones resulting from horizontal transfers of sof or emm genes between sof-positive and sof-negative strains. All 45 emm types encountered in Nepal have also been documented from other countries. These data, together with data encompassing the past decade of emm type surveillance, support the possibility that most existing GAS emm types have been discovered. Similarly, since most (40/51) strain types were highly related to strains found elsewhere, it is likely that a major fraction of the existing GAS clonal complexes have been discovered.","['Sakota V', 'Fry AM', 'Lietman TM', 'Facklam RR', 'Li Z', 'Beall B']",2006,44,6,J Clin Microbiol,"Sakota V, et al.

The data of MRSA strains that are causative agents of impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) were compared with those of MRSA strains isolated from patients with other diseases. The susceptibilities to antiseptic agents in MRSA isolates from patients with impetigo and SSSS were higher than those in MRSA isolates from patients with other diseases. The distribution of the qacA/B genes in MRSA strains isolated from patients with impetigo and SSSS (1.3%, 1/76) was remarkably lower than that in MRSA strains isolated from patients with other diseases (45.9%, 95/207). Epidemiologic typings of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that MRSA strains isolated from patients with impetigo and SSSS had type IV SCCmec (75/76), except for one strain, and 64.5% (49/76) of the strains had different PFGE types. In addition, the patterns of restriction digestion of all tested qacA/B plasmid in MRSA isolates having different PFGE types were identical. The results showed that a specific MRSA clone carrying qacA/B was not prevalent, but qacA/B was spread among health care-associated MRSA strains. Therefore, it was concluded that the lower distribution rate of qacA/B resulted in higher susceptibilities to cationic antiseptic agents in MRSA isolated from patients with impetigo and SSSS.","['Noguchi N', 'Nakaminami H', 'Nishijima S', 'Kurokawa I', 'So H', 'Sasatsu M']",2006,44,6,J Clin Microbiol,"Noguchi N, et al.

16687865,Evaluation of simplified DNA extraction methods for emm typing of group A streptococci.,"Simplified methods of DNA extraction for amplification and sequencing for emm typing of group A streptococci (GAS) can save valuable time and cost in resource crunch situations. To evaluate this, we compared two methods of DNA extraction directly from colonies with the standard CDC cell lysate method for emm typing of 50 GAS strains isolated from children with pharyngitis and impetigo. For this, GAS colonies were transferred into two sets of PCR tubes. One set was preheated at 94 degrees C for two minutes in the thermal cycler and cooled while the other set was frozen overnight at -20 degrees C and then thawed before adding the PCR mix. For the cell lysate method, cells were treated with mutanolysin and hyaluronidase before heating at 100 degrees C for 10 minutes and cooling immediately as recommended in the CDC method. All 50 strains could be typed by sequencing the hyper variable region of the emm gene after amplification. The quality of sequences and the emm types identified were also identical. Our study shows that the two simplified DNA extraction methods directly from colonies can conveniently be used for typing a large number of GAS strains easily in relatively short time.","['Jose JJ', 'Brahmadathan KN']",2006,24,2,Indian J Med Microbiol,Jose JJ and Brahmadathan KN.

16679003,"Staphylococcal cutaneous infections: invasion, evasion and aggression.","Staphylococcal infections cause a variety of cutaneous and systemic infections, including impetigo, furuncle, subcutaneous abscess, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and neonatal toxic shock syndrome-like exanthematous disease (NTED), in association with microbial virulence factors. The virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus aureus have a wide array of biological properties, including disruption of the epithelial barrier, inhibition of opsonization by antibody and complement, interference with neutrophil chemotaxis, cytolysis of neutrophils, and inactivation of antimicrobial peptides. Exfoliative toxins (ETs) induce the 'acantholytic' infection of S. aureus due to the disruption of cell-to-cell cohesion, which allows the pathogenic organisms to spread within the epithelium. Furthermore, S. aureus expresses exotoxins with biological properties of superantigens that induce T-cell activation with subsequent anergy and immunosuppression. Of the S. aureus leukotoxins, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is involved in the development of multiple furuncles with more intense erythema, particularly in healthy young adults. TSS is an acute life-threatening illness caused by TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) and is usually classified into two categories; menstrual TSS, originally described in association with tampon use, and nonmenstrual TSS with a variety of clinical settings. NTED is a neonatal disease induced by TSST-1 although clinical symptoms are much milder than those of TSS. In TSS and NTED, the expansion of TSST-1-reactive Vbeta2-positive T cells is observed. The production of pathogenic S. aureus exotoxins and biofilm formation is regulated by the accessory gene regulator (agr) locus in the quorum-sensing signaling pathway. There is no doubt that targeting the quorum-sensing signaling pathway or anti-toxin therapy is a promising therapeutic approach supportive of primary antibiotic therapy.","['Iwatsuki K', 'Yamasaki O', 'Morizane S', 'Oono T']",2006,42,3,J Dermatol Sci,"Iwatsuki K, et al.

16638387,Scabies presenting with bullous pemphigoid-like lesions.,"A wide range of clinical manifestations may be seen in scabies, from classic pruritic papules and burrows to secondary features such as impetigo. Bullus lesions are a less frequent. Twenty cases of scabies presenting with bullae have been reported so far in the medical literature. Differentiating this subtype of scabies from the immunobullous disease bullus pemphigoid is a diagnostic challenge. A 42-year-old man was referred to our dermatology outpatient clinic with 3-month history of severe pruritus and tense blisters affecting mainly the lower trunk, arms and legs. An initial biopsy was suggestive for bullous pemphigoid. Close physical examination revealed small excoriated papules and a few burrows on borders of the hands and wrists. Skin scraping of the lesions on wrists was positive for Sarcoptes scabiei. Another biopsy specimen from a recent blister revealed subepidermal bullae with fibrin and inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence exam was negative. The patient was treated with lindane lotion followed by crotamiton cream with near complete resolution of the lesions. Scabies must be considered in patients presenting with recent onset of unexplained pruritic bullous lesions. Biopsy and immunofluorescence studies together with skin scrapings for Sarcoptes scabiei could help to differentiate these cases from bullous pemphigoid.

16608371,Children hospitalized with skin and soft tissue infections: a guide to antibacterial selection and treatment.,"Skin and soft tissue infections in children are an important cause for hospitalization. A thorough history and physical examination can provide clues to the pathogens involved. Collection of purulent discharge from lesions should be completed prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy, and results of bacteriologic studies (Gram stain and culture) should guide therapeutic decisions. The main pathogens involved in these infections are Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, but enteric organisms also play a role especially in nosocomial infections. Increasing antibacterial resistance is becoming a major problem in the treatment of these infections worldwide. Specifically, the rise of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and glycopeptide-resistant S. aureus pose challenges for the future. Infections of the skin and soft tissues can be broadly classified based on the extent of tissue involvement. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, cellulitis, bullous impetigo, bite infections, and periorbital cellulitis may require hospitalization and parenteral antibacterials. Deeper infections such as orbital cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pyomyositis require surgical intervention as well as parenteral antibacterial therapy. Surgery plays a key role in the treatment of abscesses and for the debridement of necrotic tissue in deep infections. Intravenous immunoglobulin, as an adjunctive therapy, can be helpful in treating necrotizing fasciitis. For most infections an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam antibacterial is first-line therapy. Third-generation cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibacterials as well as clindamycin or metronidazole are often required to provide broad-spectrum coverage for polymicrobial infections.Special populations, such as immunocompromised children, those with an allergy to penicillins, and those that acquire infections in hospitals, require specific antibacterial strategies. These usually involve broader antimicrobial coverage with increased Gram-negative (including antipseudomonal) and anerobic coverage. In patients with a true allergy to penicillins, clindamycin and vancomycin play an important role in treating Gram-positive infections. Newer antibacterial agents, such as linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin, are increasingly being studied in children for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. These agents hold promise for the future especially in the treatment of highly resistant, Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.","['Vayalumkal JV', 'Jadavji T']",2006,8,2,Paediatr Drugs,Vayalumkal JV and Jadavji T.

16551358,Increasing incidence of skin disorders in children? A comparison between 1987 and 2001.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing proportion of skin diseases encountered in general practice represents a substantial part of morbidity in children. Only limited information is available about the frequency of specific skin diseases. We aimed to compare incidence rates of skin diseases in children in general practice between 1987 and 2001.
METHODS: We used data on all children aged 0-17 years derived from two consecutive surveys performed in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001. Both surveys concerned a longitudinal registration of GP consultations over 12 months. Each disease episode was coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care. Incidence rates of separate skin diseases were calculated by dividing all new episodes for each distinct ICPC code by the average study population at risk. Data were stratified for socio-demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of all skin diseases combined in general practice decreased between 1987 and 2001. Among infants the incidence rate increased. Girls presented more skin diseases to the GP. In the southern part of the Netherlands children consulted their GP more often for skin diseases compared to the northern part. Children of non-Western immigrants presented relatively more skin diseases to the GP. In general practice incidence rates of specific skin diseases such as impetigo, dermatophytosis and atopic dermatitis increased in 2001, whereas warts, contact dermatitis and skin injuries decreased.
CONCLUSION: The overall incidence rate of all skin diseases combined in general practice decreased whereas the incidence rates of bacterial, mycotic and atopic skin diseases increased.","['Mohammedamin RS', 'van der Wouden JC', 'Koning S', 'van der Linden MW', 'Schellevis FG', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Koes BW']",2006,6,,BMC Dermatol,"Mohammedamin RS, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of (1) topical povidone-iodine with and (2) without compression bandages, (3) to compare the efficacy of systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial agents to prevent the progression of superficial skin ulcers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 63 patients presenting ulcerated stasis dermatitis due to deep venous refluxes were included in the study. The clinical stage of all patients was homogeneous determined by clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathological classification. They were examined by taking a bacteriological swab from their ulcer area. Compression bandages were used in a total of 42 patients. Twenty-one patients with superficial infected (Staphylococcus aureus) ulcers were treated locally with povidone-iodine (Betadine), and 21 patients were treated with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin). Twenty-one patients were treated locally with Betadine but did not use compression. The end point was the time of ulcus healing. The healing process of the ulcers was related to the impact of bacterial colonization and clinical signs of infection.
RESULTS: Compression increases the ulcer healing rate compared with no compression. Using the same local povidone-iodine (Betadine) treatment with compression bandages is more effective (82%) for ulcus healing than without compression therapy (62%). The healing rate of ulcers treated with systemic antibiotics was not significantly better (85%) than that of the Betadine group. Using systemic antibiotics, the relapse rate of superficial bacterial infections (impetigo, folliculitis) was significantly higher (32%) than in patients with local disinfection (11%).
CONCLUSION: Compression is essential in the mobilization of the interstitial lymphatic fluid from the region of stasis dermatitis. Topical disinfection and appropriate wound dressings are important to prevent wound infection. Systemic antibiotics are necessary only in systemic infections (fever, lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, erysipelas).",['Daróczy J'],2006,212 Suppl 1,,Dermatology,Daróczy J.

16487882,Impetigo herpetiformis.,"Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular disorder that occurs primarily in pregnancy and is often associated with hypocalcemia. The onset commonly presents in the last trimester of pregnancy; the condition may persist until delivery and it rarely continues in the postpartum period. There is an increase in morbidity and mortality for the mother and the fetus. As a result, immediate diagnosis and treatment is crucial. The purpose of this article is to delineate the clinical picture of this disease, its treatment, and the effect on the mother and the fetus.","['Oumeish OY', 'Parish JL']",2006,24,2,Clin Dermatol,Oumeish OY and Parish JL.

16484729,Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Switzerland: first surveillance report.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging community pathogen. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has been associated with virulent strains producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and a variety of other exotoxins. In Geneva, PVL-producing CA-MRSA was first reported in 2002 and a surveillance system based on voluntary reporting was set up. Each MRSA-positive culture result with an antibiotic resistance profile different from the endemic strain prevailing in the Geneva healthcare setting diagnosed in a patient without a history of hospital admission in the previous 12 months was notified to the local health department. A questionnaire was completed by the attending physician with demographic, clinical and exposure information. From January 2002 until December 2004, data on 58 cases were reported, including 26 cases grouped in 13 distinct transmission clusters. Most were family related and for two of them, colonisation persisted over a 12 month period despite treatment. Thirty three patients (57%) were male. Median age was 32 years, 22% being younger than 10 years. Forty one cases (71%) were infected and 17 (29%) colonised. Symptomatic skin lesions such as furunculosis, impetigo or abscess were present in 40 (97%) of the 41 infected cases. Most cases had no underlying disease. Thirty eight cases (65%) had travelled abroad. Forty (69%) of 58 isolates carried the PVL toxin. CA-MRSA infections in Geneva appear to be an emerging problem in the canton. Surveillance should continue and should possibly be extended to other parts of the country to better describe transmission patterns and the spread of this pathogen. Prevention and control of CA-MRSA infections represent a challenge for the future, requiring contact tracing, education and treatment of infected and colonised contacts.","['Aramburu C', 'Harbarth S', 'Liassine N', 'Girard M', 'Gervaix A', 'Scherenzel J', 'Renzi G', 'Sudre P']",2006,11,1,Euro Surveill,"Aramburu C, et al.

Seventy-one percent were female and 29% male, aged 2-66 years (median 9). Four hundred-fifteen (77%) had at least one skin lesion. Tinea capitis was diagnosed in 138/155 males (89%) as compared to 214/384 females (40%) (p < 0.05). T. capitis was diagnosed in 69% of the 374 children. Fingernails were affected in 132/145 (91%) of onychomycosis, 118 (90%) of these patients were females and 14 males (p < 0.05). Tinea corporis was observed in 45, and other types of tinea in 12 patients. Thirty-six percent of all patients had also other skin lesions, mostly impetigo. Of 490 cultured samples 364 (74%) grew dermatophytes: Trichophyton violaceum in 84%, Trichophyton verrucosum in 9.6%, Trichophyton tonsurans in 1.4% and T. rubrum in 0.5%. Additionally, 15 isolates were identified as white variants of T. violaceum, in 3 cases confirmed by sequencing of the rDNA ITS 2 region. T. capitis in young males and T. unguium of fingernails in females were the most common manifestations of dermatophytosis in Addis Ababa, usually caused by T.violaceum.","['Woldeamanuel Y', 'Leekassa R', 'Chryssanthou E', 'Mengistu Y', 'Petrini B']",2006,161,3,Mycopathologia,"Woldeamanuel Y, et al.

Herein we report two cases of cutaneous adverse events in uveitis patients treated with infliximab. In one patient, the primary outbreak of pustular psoriasis was observed after her third infusion. A second patient developed impetigo contagiosa induced by Staphylococcus aureus. Thus patients undergoing treatment with infliximab should be monitored carefully since dermal infections and pustular psoriasis, which may be triggered by streptococcal infection, may occur under this regime.","['Wegscheider BJ', 'El-Shabrawi L', 'Weger M', 'Ardjomand N', 'Hermann J', 'Aberer E', 'El-Shabrawi Y']",2007,21,4,Eye (Lond),"Wegscheider BJ, et al.

16450826,Impetigo in soldiers after hand-to-hand combat training.,"Bacterial skin infections are very common and trigger destruction of the skin integrity. Impetigo is a consequence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus infection. The clinical presentation in general is very typical and empiric treatment is usually successful. In cases of close contacts such as between classmates, athletes, or soldiers, the prompt recognition and appropriate treatment of the infection may stop an epidemic. We report a group of six soldiers who shared the same military equipment (physical shields) during hand-to-hand combat training. All of the soldiers had skin lesions and two of them suffered from systemic symptoms. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and S. aureus were cultured from the impetiginous lesions. All patients recovered after systemic and/or local antibiotic treatments. These cases emphasize the need for the maintenance of proper hygiene throughout the training program to prevent spread of the disease and the importance of rapid diagnosis by bacteriological identification.","['Lejbkowicz F', 'Samet L', 'Belavsky L', 'Bitterman-Deutsch O']",2005,170,11,Mil Med,"Lejbkowicz F, et al.

16448769,Infection in acute burn wounds following the Bali bombings: a comparative prospective audit.,"INTRODUCTION: Bacterial colonisation and invasive bacterial infection remain the major causes of mortality and morbidity following severe burn thus ongoing surveillance of patients and monitoring of infection facilitates early intervention to minimise the risk of sepsis. The circumstances of the Bali bombings in October 2002, provided an opportunity to analyse the ramifications of lengthy transfer times, delayed resuscitation and topical treatment, on the primary incidence of burn wound infection (BWI).
METHOD: This prospective clinical audit investigated the primary incidence of BWI between the usual burn patients admitted to the Burn Unit at Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia, and a number of survivors from the Bali bombings during a 3-month audit period in 2002. BWI was identified using the Peck et al. proposed definitions for the surveillance of burn wound infections. These include impetigo, surgical wound related infection, cellulitis and invasive infection of unexcised wounds.
RESULTS: The incidence of primary BWI in the Bali-tourist group (68.2%) compared with the standard WA group (18.2%) was significant (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Sensitive assessment criteria allowed for early identification of wound infection. A clinically significant difference in the Bali-tourist group is probably related to the circumstances of their injury.","['Silla RC', 'Fong J', 'Wright J', 'Wood F']",2006,32,2,Burns,"Silla RC, et al.

16445719,Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: current perspectives.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a worldwide problem, although its prevalence varies considerably among countries. The epidemiology of MRSA is now changing; infections are no longer confined to the hospital setting, but also appear in healthy community-dwelling individuals without established risk factors for the acquisition of MRSA. Reported prevalence rates of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) vary widely among studies-largely because of the different definitions employed and different settings in which the studies have been performed. At present, molecular epidemiological definitions, based on staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and phylogenetic analyses of the MRSA isolates, are considered the most reliable means by which to distinguish between hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA has been isolated predominantly from skin and soft tissue infections, such as abscesses, cellulitis, folliculitis and impetigo. Although CA-MRSA infections are usually mild, they may also be severe, and can result in hospitalisation and even death. CA-MRSA strains differ from the major pandemic clones of MRSA that account for the majority of epidemic HA-MRSA strains. Differences are found in SCCmec types, bacterial growth rate, and the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and toxin genes. Mathematical models have shown that CA-MRSA has a high potential to become endemic in the community, and this will impact significantly on the control of MRSA in the hospital setting. Well-designed, community-based studies with adequate risk factor analysis are required to further elucidate the epidemiology of CA-MRSA and to improve strategies to control MRSA in both the community and hospital settings.","['Kluytmans-Vandenbergh MF', 'Kluytmans JA']",2006,12 Suppl 1,,Clin Microbiol Infect,Kluytmans-Vandenbergh MF and Kluytmans JA.

16433791,Impetigo: incidence and treatment in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001--results from two national surveys.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common skin infection in children. The epidemiology is relatively unknown, and the choice of treatment is subject to debate.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine the incidence and treatment of impetigo in Dutch general practice, and to assess trends between 1987 and 2001.
METHODS: We used data from the first (1987) and second (2001) Dutch national surveys of general practice. All diagnoses, prescriptions and referrals were registered by the participating general practitioners (GPs), 161 and 195, respectively.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of impetigo increased from 16.5 (1987) to 20.6 (2001) per 1000 person years under 18 years old (P < 0.01). In both years, the incidence was significantly higher in summer, in rural areas and in the southern region of the Netherlands, compared with winter, urban areas and northern region, respectively. Socioeconomic status was not associated with the incidence rate. From 1987 to 2001, there was a trend towards treatment with a topical antibiotic (from 43% to 64%), especially fusidic acid cream and mupirocin cream. Treatment with oral antibiotics (from 31% to 14%) and antiseptics (from 11% to 3%) was prescribed less often.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown an increased incidence of impetigo in the past decade, which may be the result of an increased tendency to seek help, or increased antibiotic resistance and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Further microbiological research on the marked regional difference in incidence may contribute to understanding the factors that determine the spread of impetigo. Trends in prescribing for impetigo generally follow evidence-based knowledge on the effectiveness of different therapies, rather than the national practice guideline.","['Koning S', 'Mohammedamin RS', 'van der Wouden JC', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Schellevis FG', 'Thomas S']",2006,154,2,Br J Dermatol,"Koning S, et al.

Studies conducted in Miami show that during the early 1980s, the predominant pathogen associated with impetigo in pediatric patients shifted from Streptococcus pyogenes to Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequent reports revealed a trend of increasing resistance of S. aureus to penicillins. By regular monitoring of local sensitivity patterns physicians are more likely to select the appropriate antibiotic. The current recommendation for the treatment of pediatric skin disease is cephalosporins due to their low likelihood of resistance by S. aureus.",['Schachner LA'],2005,4,6 Suppl,J Drugs Dermatol,Schachner LA.

16300224,Update on treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.,"Dermatologists treat a variety of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) such as folliculitis, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, furuncles, carbuncles, and non-perirectal abscesses. Most uSSSIs are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The new extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime) offer efficacy against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Despite recently published guidelines, many physicians do not prescribe cephalosporins for uSSSIs out of concern that these agents will produce a hypersensitivity reaction in patients allergic to penicillin. Although the rate of cephalosporin reaction in penicillin-allergic patients is often quoted as up to 10%, this rate does not take into account the 1% to 3% risk for allergy to cephalosporin alone and the nonspecific increased risk of penicillin-allergic patients to develop hypersensitivity to other drugs. When these additional risks are considered, the likelihood of a reaction in known penicillin-allergic patients, especially to most third-generation and extended spectrum cephalosporins, becomes less than 1%. Cephalosporins with side chains unlike those of penicillin or ampicillin side chains are less likely to result in an allergic reaction in penicillin or ampicillin-allergic patients than cephalosporins with similar side chains. Although both cefdinir and cefpodoxime are considered to carry a very low risk of cross reactivity with penicillin or ampicillin, the former demonstrates better activity against S. aureus.

16299278,"Active and passive intranasal immunizations with streptococcal surface protein C5a peptidase prevent infection of murine nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, a functional homologue of human tonsils.","C5a peptidase, also called SCPA (surface-bound C5a peptidase), is a surface-bound protein on group A streptococci (GAS), etiologic agents for a variety of human diseases including pharyngitis, impetigo, toxic shock, and necrotizing fasciitis, as well as the postinfection sequelae rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This protein is highly conserved among different serotypes and is also expressed in human isolates of group B, C, and G streptococci. Human tonsils are the primary reservoirs for GAS, maintaining endemic disease across the globe. We recently reported that GAS preferentially target nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) in mice, a tissue functionally analogous to human tonsils. Experiments using a C5a peptidase loss-of-function mutant and an intranasal infection model showed that this protease is required for efficient colonization of NALT. An effective vaccine should prevent infection of this secondary lymphoid tissue; therefore, the potential of anti-SCPA antibodies to protect against streptococcal infection of NALT was investigated. Experiments showed that GAS colonization of NALT was significantly reduced following intranasal immunization of mice with recombinant SCPA protein administered alone or with cholera toxin, whereas a high degree of GAS colonization of NALT was observed in control mice immunized with phosphate-buffered saline only. Moreover, administration of anti-SCPA serum by the intranasal route protected mice against streptococcal infection. These results suggest that intranasal immunization with SCPA would prevent colonization and infection of human tonsils, thereby eliminating potential reservoirs that maintain endemic disease.","['Park HS', 'Cleary PP']",2005,73,12,Infect Immun,"Park HS and Cleary PP.

CLINICAL PICTURE: Her condition was complicated by preterm labour, requiring an emergency caesarean section delivery. A diagnosis of impetigo herpetiformis was made on clinicopathological grounds.
TREATMENT: Initial treatment with topical and systemic corticosteroids failed and oral methotrexate was added.
OUTCOME: She responded well to this therapy and required only 2 doses of weekly methotrexate.

16282759,Chronic granulomatous disease: two members of a single family with different dermatologic manifestations.,"Case 1: A 33-year-old man with a 14-year history of localized skin disease on the face and scalp was evaluated at the department of dermatology. The physical examination revealed plaques with papules, pustules, and a golden yellow crusting on the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, and chin (Figure 1). The scalp presented fine, whitish scales. At the beginning of his disease, the patient presented large red and painful purulent boils. The 14-year clinical course of these lesions was characterized by partial remissions and recurrences, but he did not specify any treatment related to improvement. The clinical diagnosis given for the scalp lesions was seborrheic dermatitis. For the facial lesions, many differential diagnoses were considered, among them: seborrheic dermatitis, acneiform dermatitis, impetigo, folliculitis, seborrheic pemphigus, and demodicidosis. The histopathologic study of a biopsy taken from the cheek (Figure 2) showed superficial spongiform dermatitis with neutrophils and folliculitis that are compatible with the diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis. Both Gram and periodic acid-Schiff stains were negative. Follow-up of the patient was not possible since he did not come back. The disease in this patient initially manifested at age five by the presence of recurrent ganglionic abscesses. At age 15, he presented a pulmonary abscess of a left lobule that was surgically removed; at this point the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease was established. At age 28, an exploratory laparotomy was performed due to peritonitis and multiple hepatic abscesses. At that time, he was treated with antibiotics (mainly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and interferon-g. The patient had two brothers who died due to complications of chronic granulomatous disease. In addition, both his mother and sister presented a history of discoid lupus-like lesions. Case 2: Coincidentally, his 27-year-old sister was seen in our department of dermatology 5 years before, presenting infiltrated and erythematous plaques with fine scales (Figure 3) on the right side of the nose and the left annular finger. No other cutaneous or mucous lesions were seen. She referred onset in childhood with similar lesions on sun-exposed areas that disappeared without scarring. A biopsy was performed and the results were compatible with the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus (Figure 4). Direct immunofluorescence was not available. At that time, she did not mention the family history of chronic granulomatous disease. Clinical follow-up was not possible, but his brother referred that she afforded complete remission only with sun protection.","['Luis-Montoya P', 'Sáez-de Ocariz Mdel M', 'Vega-Memije ME']",2005,4,5,Skinmed,"Luis-Montoya P, et al.

Prolonged stay in these countries significantly increases the risk of contracting rarely seen dermatoses such as leishmaniasis, larva migrans and myiasis. The bites of various flies may provoke itching and excoriations that may be infected with Staphylococcus aureus and/or hemolytic streptococci, resulting in impetigo, furunculosis or erysipelas. Elderly persons spending weeks in the tropical sun may develop drug-induced phototoxic or photoallergic rash due to concomitant medication for cardiovascular or rheumatic diseases. Acute sunburn is considered a short-lasting problem, but in children it increases the risk of malignant melanoma in later years. Also of concern is chronic UV exposure, which increases the risk of premalignant and malignant skin tumors.

Here we report that Group A Streptococcus (GAS), a Gram-positive human-specific pathogen that causes pharyngitis, impetigo, invasive disease, necrotizing fasciitis, and autoimmune sequelae has long, surface-exposed, pilus-like structures composed of members of a family of extracellular matrix-binding proteins. We describe four variant pili and show that each is recognized by a specific serum of the Lancefield T-typing system, which has been used for over five decades to characterize GAS isolates. Furthermore, we show that immunization of mice with a combination of recombinant pilus proteins confers protection against mucosal challenge with virulent GAS bacteria. The data indicate that induction of a protective immune response against these structures may be a useful strategy for development of a vaccine against disease caused by GAS infection.","['Mora M', 'Bensi G', 'Capo S', 'Falugi F', 'Zingaretti C', 'Manetti AG', 'Maggi T', 'Taddei AR', 'Grandi G', 'Telford JL']",2005,102,43,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Mora M, et al.

16218899,Bacterial diseases of the skin.,"When considering common bacterial diseases of the skin, rather distinct clinical responses to a variety of bacterial infections have been identified. In these cases, it is the specific site of infection and the attendant inflammatory responses that provide the characteristic clinical picture. When the pyoderma extends just below the stratum corneum, it is called impetigo. Nonbullous impetigo is the most common pediatric skin infection. It usually starts in a traumatized area. The typical lesion begins as an erythematous papule, after which it becomes a unilocular vesicle. When the subcorneal vesicle becomes pustular, it ruptures and eventually becomes a yellow, golden crust that is a hallmark of the disease process. Bullous impetigo is a less common form of impetigo, accounting for fewer than 30% of all impetigo cases. It occurs in infants and is characterized by rapid progression of vesicles to the formation of bullae measuring larger than 5 mm in diameter in previously untraumatized skin. Treatment of nonbullous impetigo must include intervention against the pathogen as well as improvements in the hygiene and living conditions of the patient. A fundamental tenet is to debride the crust (scab) from the wound surface using poloxamer 188. If the lesions are not widespread, topical mupirocin is the treatment of choice. Treatment of bullous impetigo is similar, except that the local cleansing and topical antibiotic must be complemented by systemic antibiotics if there is evidence of disseminating infections. Ecthyma is usually a consequence of failure to treat effectively impetigo. The untreated infection extends deep into the tissue in shallow ulcerations that often heal without scar. Treatment for ecthyma usually requires systemic antibiotics against either staphylococcus or streptococcus. Folliculitis is a pyoderma located within a hair follicle, secondary to follicular occlusion by keratin, overhydration, or either bacterial or fungal infection. Folliculitis may be divided into either a deep or a superficial type. In the superficial type, the pustule is located at the opening of the hair follicle. In the deep form, the infection may extend beyond the confines of the hair follicle, becoming a furuncle or boil. Carbuncles are aggregates of interconnected furuncles that drain through multiple openings of the skin. Treatment of folliculitis must include searching for and avoiding any factors predisposing to infection. If topical antibiotic therapy is ineffective in controlling the infection, surgical drainage of the infected skin abscess will be necessary. Paronychia is the most common bacterial infection of the hand, which often requires surgical incisional drainage. Similarly, a felon that is an infection of the distal pulp of a finger usually requires surgical drainage. Finally, cellulitis is an acute inflammatory reaction involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue. It usually starts as erysipelas and may advance to lymphangitis, lymphadenitis, or gangrene,which will respond to life-saving interventions in the hospital that usually include systemic antibiotic treatment as well as surgical intervention.","['Edlich RF', 'Winters KL', 'Britt LD', 'Long WB']",2005,15,5,J Long Term Eff Med Implants,"Edlich RF, et al.

16218885,Current options for the treatment of impetigo in children.,"Impetigo contagiosa is a common, superficial, bacterial infection of the skin characterised by an inflamed and infected epidermis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or both. The less common bullous impetigo is characterised by fragile fluid-filled vesicles and flaccid blisters, and is invariably caused by pathogenic strains of S. aureus. In bullous impetigo, exfoliative toxins are produced, although these are restricted to the area of infection and bacteria can be cultured from the blister contents. In the rare variant, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, the exfoliative toxins are spread haematogenously from a localised source causing widespread epidermal damage at distant sites.","['Sladden MJ', 'Johnston GA']",2005,6,13,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Sladden MJ and Johnston GA.

16179184,Bacterial infections: uncommon presentations.,"The essence of dermatology is morphology. The most important instrument in the practice of dermatology has always been, and still is, the naked eye; however, ""We see only what we are ready to see, what we have been taught to see"" (Jean Martin Charcot). Although most practitioners will easily correctly diagnose common bacterial skin diseases (such as cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, etc), only a trained and updated dermatologist will recognize the unusual forms and rare variants of these diseases. Bacterial skin diseases are sometimes acute and life-threatening. The mortality rates from necrotizing fasciitis range from 20% to 40%, to name just one example. It is not unreasonable to expect that dermatologists, whether in clinical practice or in referral centers, will be the first physicians to be confronted with unusual variants of bacterial skin diseases that have been unrecognized by non-dermatologists. Some of these cases might even be life-threatening, and only prompt and early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can make the difference between losing and saving a patient's life. In short, we dermatologists should hone our clinical diagnostic skills and expand our knowledge of the rare forms and unusual and atypical variants of skin diseases: the textbook variants will probably be recognized and treated by general practitioners.","['Matz H', 'Orion E', 'Wolf R']",2005,23,5,Clin Dermatol,"Matz H, et al.

CASE REPORT: A first pregnancy, 26 year-old woman developed at 8 months a widespread skin lesion involving the medial side of the thighs, abdomen and intertriginous areas, with a severe systemic toxic condition and fever. Diagnosis of impetigo herpetiformis was made and corticosteroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine were unsuccessful. Isotretinoine rapidly improved the patient with good control of the disease. The full term baby had an Ondine curse.
DISCUSSION: Our case is typical of impetigo herpetiformis. Maternal and infant complication may be life threatening and we report a real Ondine curse the etiology of which remains unknown. Moreover, this observation is unusual because the lesions did not clear despite delivery and good treatment. In our opinion, the great improvement with isotretinoine would suggest it could be used as first line treatment.","['Doebelin B', 'Estival JL', 'Nau A', 'Dupin M', 'Combemale P']",2005,132,6-7 Pt 1,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Doebelin B, et al.

16083689,Bacteriological skin and subcutaneous infections in injecting heroin users-relevance for custody.,"Forensic medical examiners, custody nurses and police not infrequently come into physical contact with injecting heroin users whose injection sites maybe infected. Karch evaluated published reports on bacteriological findings at infected injection sites in drug users in 1996. Studies were then 10 years out of date. Recent concern has been about unexplained deaths in injecting heroin users, partly attributed to toxins produced by Clostridium novyii, Clostridium perfringens (welchii) and Clostridium botulinum. In response to this epidemic Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Health Authority (London, UK) urged investigation and treatment of injection site infection in heroin users within their area; circularising police stations and general practices with an official notice. In response, I followed up and treated in general practice 35 injecting heroin users with injection site infection presenting as detainees at two South London police stations. All swabs taken had a 48 hour incubation for anaerobic bacteria. At audit, no spore forming anaerobes were found. Just under 25% had non spore forming anaerobes such as bacteroides. Just over 50% had staphylococci in the injection site infection. Just under 20% had streptococci, half of which were beta haemolytic, a possible contact risk of infection being erysipelas, cellulitis, impetigo or conjunctivitis. No comparable studies were found but a study in New York in 1984 tabulated bacteriological findings of soft tissue infections in 29 hospitalised parenteral drug users. They found similar proportions of staphylococci, far more with streptococci, hardly any with non spore forming anaerobes and one case of spore forming anaerobic clostridium perfringens.",['Lettington W'],2002,9,2,J Clin Forensic Med,Lettington W.

The number of impetigo cases was always higher in late summer than in winter, and furthermore, increased year on year. These changes could not be accounted for by variation in total patient numbers seen in A&E, and suggest a correlation between impetigo frequency and climatic temperature.

We undertook a randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of handwashing promotion with soap on the incidence of acute respiratory infection, impetigo, and diarrhoea.
METHODS: In adjoining squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan, we randomly assigned 25 neighbourhoods to handwashing promotion; 11 neighbourhoods (306 households) were randomised as controls. In neighbourhoods with handwashing promotion, 300 households each were assigned to antibacterial soap containing 1.2% triclocarban and to plain soap. Fieldworkers visited households weekly for 1 year to encourage handwashing by residents in soap households and to record symptoms in all households. Primary study outcomes were diarrhoea, impetigo, and acute respiratory-tract infections (ie, the number of new episodes of illness per person-weeks at risk). Pneumonia was defined according to the WHO clinical case definition. Analysis was by intention to treat.
FINDINGS: Children younger than 5 years in households that received plain soap and handwashing promotion had a 50% lower incidence of pneumonia than controls (95% CI (-65% to -34%). Also compared with controls, children younger than 15 years in households with plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhoea (-65% to -41%) and a 34% lower incidence of impetigo (-52% to -16%). Incidence of disease did not differ significantly between households given plain soap compared with those given antibacterial soap.
INTERPRETATION: Handwashing with soap prevents the two clinical syndromes that cause the largest number of childhood deaths globally-namely, diarrhoea and acute lower respiratory infections. Handwashing with daily bathing also prevents impetigo.","['Luby SP', 'Agboatwalla M', 'Feikin DR', 'Painter J', 'Billhimer W', 'Altaf A', 'Hoekstra RM']",2005,366,9481,Lancet,"Luby SP, et al.

METHODS: Schoolchildren from five villages on Taveuni Island were examined and had their haemoglobin concentration measured on a finger-prick blood sample. In addition, they had a faecal sample examined for the presence of helminth ova.
RESULTS: 258 children aged 5-15 years were surveyed. The overall prevalence of infection was: hookworm 14%, ascaris 33%, trichuris 17%, scabies 32%, and impetigo 2%. Eight percent of children were anaemic, while 8% and 6% of children were on or below the third centile for weight and height respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low overall prevalence of hookworm infection and of anaemia suggests that regular anthelminthic treatment of schoolchildren would only provide modest health benefits.

15871629,Staphylococcal skin infections in children: rational drug therapy recommendations.,"Staphylococcus aureus remains one of the most common and troublesome of bacteria causing disease in humans, despite the development of effective antibacterials and improvement in hygiene. The organism is responsible for over 70% of all skin and soft tissue infections in children and accounts for up to one-fifth of all visits to pediatric clinics. Skin and soft tissue infections that are predominantly caused by S. aureus include bullous and non-bullous impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbunculosis, cellulitis, surgical and traumatic wound infections, mastitis, and neonatal omphalitis. Other skin and soft tissue infections may also be caused by S. aureus but are often polymicrobial in origin and require special consideration. These include burns, decubitus ulcers (particularly in the perianal region), puncture wounds of the foot, as well as human and mammalian bites. Treatment of staphylococcal skin infections varies from topical antiseptics to prolonged intravenous antibacterials, depending on severity of the lesions and the health of the child. The treatment of choice for oral antibacterials remains the penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as flucloxacillin. Cefalexin and erythromycin are suitable cost-effective alternatives with broader cover, although care must be taken with the use of macrolides because of development of resistance to multiple families of antibacterials, particularly the lincosamides. Other cephalosporins such as cefadroxil and cefprozil are also effective, can be given once daily and have a better tolerability profile -- while azithromycin has a further advantage of a 3-day course. However, all of these agents are more expensive. Although the antibacterials have been given for 10 days in most clinical trials, there is no evidence that this duration is more effective than a 7-day course. In children requiring intravenous therapy, ceftriaxone has a major advantage over other antibacterials such as sulbactam/ampicillin and cefuroxime in that it can be given once daily and may, therefore, be suitable for outpatient treatment of moderate-to-severe skin infections. Newer-generation cephalosporins and loracarbef are also effective and have a broader spectrum of activity, but do not offer any added benefit and are significantly more expensive. Skin and soft tissue infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are still relatively uncommon in children. Well children with community-acquired MRSA infections can be treated with clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), but must be observed closely for potentially severe adverse effects. In severe infections, vancomycin remains the treatment of choice, while intravenous teicoplanin and clindamycin are suitable alternatives. Linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin are currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections. While the choice of antibacterial is important, supportive management, including removal of any infected foreign bodies, surgical drainage of walled-off lesions, and regular wound cleaning, play a vital role in ensuring cure.","['Ladhani S', 'Garbash M']",2005,7,2,Paediatr Drugs,Ladhani S and Garbash M.

15841059,Changing morbidity patterns in children in Dutch general practice: 1987-2001.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the presentation and pattern of childhood morbidity in general practice compared with 14 years ago.
METHODS: We used data of all children aged 0-17 years from two cross-sectional surveys performed in 1987 and 2001 in general practice in the Netherlands. The total number of children in the practices participating in these surveys were 86,577 children in 1987 and 82,053 children in 2001. First of all, we compared consultation rates of children in general practice. Secondly, childhood morbidity was assessed by episodes of disease, coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). We compared childhood morbidity in 1987 and 2001 by assessing the distribution of episodes among ICPC chapters stratified by ethnicity, and by comparing incidence rates of most frequently presented diseases.
RESULTS: Childhood consultation rates have decreased from 2.7 visits a year per child in 1987 to 2.1 in 2001. The distribution of episodes among ICPC chapters had also changed. Respiratory problems are still the most frequently presented health problem in children but the proportion has decreased from 25.5% in 1987 to 23.3% in 2001. Skin problems were presented more often (23.0% in 2001 versus 17.8 in 1987), and Western children more often presented with skin problems than with respiratory problems in 2001. Incidence rates of most respiratory diseases have decreased and specific skin diseases (dermatomycosis, impetigo and eczema) were diagnosed more often.
CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, childhood morbidity has changed. Skin diseases have become more important in general practice and respiratory problems are declining.","['Otters HB', 'van der Wouden JC', 'Schellevis FG', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Koes BW']",2005,11,1,Eur J Gen Pract,"Otters HB, et al.

15815014,Clinical manifestations of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome depend on serotypes of exfoliative toxins.,"We sought a possible correlation between the clinical manifestations of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS) and the serotype of exfoliative toxins (ET) by PCR screening of the eta and etb genes in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from 103 patients with generalized SSSS and 95 patients with bullous impetigo. The eta gene and the etb gene were detected in, respectively, 31 (30%) and 20 (19%) episodes of generalized SSSS and 57 (60%) and 5 (5%) episodes of bullous impetigo. Both genes were detected in 52 (50%) episodes of generalized SSS and 33 (35%) episodes of bullous impetigo. To explain this link between etb and generalized SSSS, we examined the distribution of ETA- and ETB-specific antibodies in the healthy population (n = 175) and found that the anti-ETB antibody titer was lower than the anti-ETA titer. Thus, ETA is associated with bullous impetigo and ETB is associated with generalized SSSS, possibly owing to a lower titer of anti-ETB neutralizing antibodies in the general population.","['Yamasaki O', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Sugai M', 'Chapuis-Cellier C', 'Arnaud F', 'Vandenesch F', 'Etienne J', 'Lina G']",2005,43,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Yamasaki O, et al.

20704901,Not all Staphylococcus aureus strains are equally pathogenic.,"Extract: Members of the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus are considered important human pathogens by all microbiologists and infectious disease specialists. A significant number of humans are persistently colonized in the nose with S. aureus strains, and long term colonization, up to years, has been observed. For 80% of all severe staphylococcal infections, the source seems to be endogenous, so ecological balance during colonization seems to be a key concept. During lifetime, many of the colonized individuals may suffer from mild infections, usually limited to the skin. The occasional furuncle is not a life-threatening disease, neither is impetigo or eczema (related to S. aureus carriage). However, once a person becomes severely ill and hospitalized, the opportunities for the Staphylococcus to manifest itself as a dangerous and invasive threat to human life are greater. It has been demonstrated recently that bacteremia (bacteria entered the blood circulation) caused by S. aureus is more frequent among nasal carriers than among non-carriers. The risk for the staphylococcal carriers increases threefold. In contrast, the risk of dying from an S. aureus bacteremic period is significantly higher in non-carriers. So carriage predisposes individuals to the development of infections but the sequels of these infections are less severe than in the case of infection in a non-carrier.","['van Belkum A', 'Melles DC']",2005,5,26,Discov Med,van Belkum A and Melles DC.

15756884,Spread of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST80-IV clone in a Danish community.,"OBJECTIVE: We report a community cluster of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Denmark with emphasis on routes of transmission and infection control measures. The objective is to extend knowledge of MRSA in a community setting where a nosocomial link could effectively be ruled out.
DESIGN: Population-based observational study from November 1997 until June 2003.
SETTING: North Jutland County, with approximately 495,000 inhabitants.
SUBJECTS: The cluster encompassed 46 individuals and 26 households.
INTERVENTIONS: Infection control measures included repeated visits to affected households by an infection control nurse who undertook screening for carriage among all household members and provided a program for decolonization.
RESULTS: The causal strain was identical to a newly described international clone, ST80; SSCmec type IV; and Panton-Valentine leukocidin positive. Plausible routes of transmission included household contact and contact at work, kindergarten, and school. We did not detect a nosocomial source or any secondary cases in hospitals. Transmission by healthcare contact outside the hospital was plausible for three cases. We found evidence that the clone was introduced on more than one occasion to immigrant families from the Middle East. A 5-day decolonization program was successful at first attempt in 15 of 16 households that could be evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the described infection control measures, we continued to see new cases, underlining a need for a national policy to contain MRSA in the community.","['Urth T', 'Juul G', 'Skov R', 'Schønheyder HC']",2005,26,2,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Urth T, et al.

Epidermolysin A (ETA), ETB and, possibly, ETD are responsible for these diseases, which may appear as epidemics in pediatric patients. We tested the reliability of a flow cytometry-assisted multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Plex system) for the detection of ETA and ETB. The Bio-Plex system was found to be highly specific and highly sensitive for toxin concentrations of between 2 and 80,000 pg/ml. The results of this assay were 100% identical to the results of a PCR-based method. We demonstrated that this test did not generate any cross-reactions with ETD-producing isolates. The level of detection of ETB by this test differed according to culture conditions and from isolate to isolate; these results must be taken into account for diagnostic purposes.","['Joubert O', 'Keller D', 'Pinck A', 'Monteil H', 'Prévost G']",2005,43,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Joubert O, et al.

15671483,Mechanisms of blister formation by staphylococcal toxins.,"Many children suffer from the bacterial skin diseases bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Staphylococcus aureus, which produces exfoliative toxins (ETs), causes these diseases. Recently, it was proven that ETs cleave the cell adhesion molecule desmoglein (Dsg) 1, which plays an important role in maintaining the proper structure and barrier function of the epidermis. Surprisingly, Dsg1 is also the antibody target in the autoimmune disease pemphigus foliaceus. Skin biopsies from pemphigus foliaceus patients show the same pathology as those from bullous impetigo and SSSS patients. The crystal structure of ET suggests that it is a serine protease with an inactive catalytic site, which may become activated when ET binds a specific receptor. This receptor binding is thought to cause a change in conformation that exposes the catalytic site. It has recently been shown that Dsg1 specifically binds and activates ET, which in turn cleaves the bound Dsg1 at only one peptide bond. This process is absolutely dependent on the calcium-dependent conformation of Dsg1. These data suggest that ETs have a very high specificity for human Dsg1, and that S. aureus uses ETs to disrupt the barrier of the human epidermis in order to survive and proliferate on the human body.","['Hanakawa Y', 'Stanley JR']",2004,136,6,J Biochem,Hanakawa Y and Stanley JR.

15599398,Natural population dynamics and expansion of pathogenic clones of Staphylococcus aureus.,"The population structure of Staphylococcus aureus carried by healthy humans was determined using a large strain collection of nonclinical origin (n = 829). High-throughput amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis revealed 3 major and 2 minor genetic clusters of S. aureus, which were corroborated by multilocus sequence typing. Major AFLP cluster I comprised 44.4% of the carriage isolates and showed additional heterogeneity whereas major AFLP groups II and III presented 2 homogeneous clusters, including 47.3% of all carriage isolates. Coanalysis of invasive S. aureus strains and epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) revealed that all major clusters contained invasive and multiresistant isolates. However, clusters and subclusters with overrepresentation of invasive isolates were also identified. Bacteremia in elderly adults, for instance, was caused by a IVa cluster-derived strain significantly more often than by strains from other AFLP clusters. Furthermore, expansion of multiresistant clones or clones associated with skin disease (impetigo) was detected, which suggests that epidemic potential is present in pathogenic strains of S. aureus. In addition, the virulence gene encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin was significantly enriched in S. aureus strains causing abscesses and arthritis in comparison with the carriage group. We provide evidence that essentially any S. aureus genotype carried by humans can transform into a life-threatening human pathogen but that certain clones are more virulent than others.","['Melles DC', 'Gorkink RF', 'Boelens HA', 'Snijders SV', 'Peeters JK', 'Moorhouse MJ', 'van der Spek PJ', 'van Leeuwen WB', 'Simons G', 'Verbrugh HA', 'van Belkum A']",2004,114,12,J Clin Invest,"Melles DC, et al.

Moreover, S. pyogenes was responsible for the classical example of a nosocomial infection, the epidemics of puerperal fever (childbed fever) that caused the death of numerous women in earlier centuries. The most extensively studied virulence factor of S. pyogenes is the surface M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis and shows antigenic variation. Recent data indicate that many M proteins confer phagocytosis resistance because the variable N-terminal region has non-overlapping sites that specifically bind two components of the human immune system, the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and IgA-Fc. Concerning puerperal fever, molecular and epidemiological analysis suggests that the S. pyogenes surface protein R28 may have played a pathogenetic role in these epidemics.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and define dermatological conditions following acute traumatic spinal cord injury (ATSCI) during inpatient rehabilitation.
SETTING: Spinal Cord Injury Unit, The Department of Neurological Rehabilitation, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Israel.
METHODS: During a 1-year study, all patients following ATSCI were prospectively studied for new dermatological findings during their inpatient rehabilitation. Every new dermatological finding was defined concerning its location with regard to the patient's neurological level, the time from injury to appearance and the exact dermatological diagnosis.
RESULTS: During the study year, 46 ATSCI patients were hospitalized in our department, of whom were 38 (82.6%) males and eight (17.4%) females (mean age 30.2 years). A total of 21 (45.6%) patients were tetraplegic and 25 (54.3%) paraplegic. Of the patients, 28 (60.9%) had complete neurological injuries and 18 (39.1%) incomplete. In all, 14 (30.4%) patients developed a dermatological condition. There was no significant age or sex correlation to the development of these complications. There was a greater likelihood of paraplegia (48 versus 9.5%, P=0.005) and being neurologically complete (42.9 versus 11.1%, P=0.02). The dermatological findings appeared on an average of 80.3 days after the initial neurological insult. There were a total of 22 different dermatological findings: 11 (50%) were local fungal infections, two (9.1%) psoriatic lesions, two (9.1%) hyperkeratotic lesions, two (9.1%) bacterial infections (one folliculitis, one impetigo) and single cases of seborrheic dermatitis, acne, alopecia, scabies and allergic reaction. Of the findings, 14 (63.6%) were below the neurological level, including all of the fungal infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Dermatological findings are common during rehabilitation of ATSCI. The clinical impact of these findings is low, but nevertheless, they are troublesome to the patient. The most common dermatological disorder was a local fungal infection below the neurological level. Paraplegic patients are more susceptible to the development of this condition. Patient and staff education regarding proper skin care may reduce these infections.","['Rubin-Asher D', 'Zeilig G', 'Klieger M', 'Adunsky A', 'Weingarden H']",2005,43,3,Spinal Cord,"Rubin-Asher D, et al.

15559440,[Non bullous impetigo: streptococcal or staphylococcal?].,"Non bullous impetigo is very common among the pediatric population. It is caused by bacteria. For twenty years, Staphylococcus aureus has been the most frequently isolated organism (present in 80 % of non bullous impetigo lesions, it is the only pathogen cultured in 50 % of patients). The group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus is at the moment isolated alone in 3% of lesions and in association with S. Aureus in 30 % of patients. An epidemiologic change seems to have occurred. Until the early 1980s, group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus was indeed the most predominant etiologic agent causing non bullous impetigo. Unfortunately, the rate of resistance among staphylococci responsible of non bullous impetigo is increasing. As serious complications can follow this skin infection, an appropriate treatment is necessary combining local care, topical antibiotics and sometimes adjunction of systemic antibiotics.","['Henno A', 'de la Brassinne M']",2004,59,9,Rev Med Liege,Henno A and de la Brassinne M.

15555874,Antimicrobial peptides: premises and promises.,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an important component of the natural defences of most living organisms against invading pathogens. These are relatively small (< 10kDa), cationic and amphipathic peptides of variable length, sequence and structure. During the past two decades several AMPs have been isolated from a wide variety of animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, and plants as well as from bacteria and fungi. Most of these peptides are obtained from different sources like macrophages, neutrophils, epithelial cells, haemocytes, fat body, reproductive tract, etc. These peptides exhibit broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, yeast, fungi and viruses. A few peptides have also been found to be cytotoxic to sperm and tumour cells. AMPs are classified based on the three dimensional structural studies carried out with the help of NMR. The peptides are broadly classified into five major groups namely (a) peptides that form alpha-helical structures, (b) peptides rich in cysteine residues, (c) peptides that form beta-sheet, (d) peptides rich in regular amino acids namely histatin, arginine and proline and (e) peptides composed of rare and modified amino acids. Most of these peptides are believed to act by disrupting the plasma membrane leading to the lysis of the cell. AMPs have been found to be excellent candidates for developing novel antimicrobial agents and a few of these peptides show antimicrobial activity against pathogens causing sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV/HSV. Peptides, namely magainin and nisin have been shown to demonstrate contraceptive properties in vitro and in vivo. A few peptides have already entered clinical trials for the treatment of impetigo, diabetic foot ulcers and gastric helicobacter infections. In this review, we discuss the source, structures and mode of action with special reference to therapeutic considerations of various AMPs.","['Reddy KV', 'Yedery RD', 'Aranha C']",2004,24,6,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"Reddy KV, et al.

15520339,Safety of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine among children: a population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there are no published population-based studies on the safety of the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine among children.
OBJECTIVE: To screen a large population of children for evidence of increased medical visits in the 2 weeks after influenza vaccination compared with 2 control periods. Secondary analyses included shorter risk periods and restricted age categories.
DESIGN: Self-control screening analysis. Children vaccinated from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1999, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. In group 1, risks of outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient visits during the 14 days after vaccination were compared with the risks of visits in 2 control periods. Significant plausible medically attended events identified in group 1 were then analyzed in group 2, using the same 2 control periods. Medically attended events significant in both groups were considered potentially associated with vaccination and were assessed by medical record review.
SETTING: Five managed care organizations in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Children younger than 18 years who received an influenza vaccination in one of the managed care settings (N = 251 600).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Among vaccinated children seen for a medically attended event, the odds of the visit occurring in the 2 weeks after vaccination vs during 1 of the 2 control periods.
RESULTS: Study participants incurred 1165, 230, and 489 different diagnoses during the 14 days after vaccination according to the outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient data, respectively. Four diagnoses were positively associated with the vaccine in both groups 1 and 2: impetigo, dermatitis, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, and ureteral disorder not otherwise specified. After medical record review, impetigo (9 cases) in children 6 to 23 months old remained significantly associated with vaccination.
CONCLUSION: This large screening safety study did not reveal any evidence of important medically attended events associated with pediatric influenza vaccination.","['France EK', 'Glanz JM', 'Xu S', 'Davis RL', 'Black SB', 'Shinefield HR', 'Zangwill KM', 'Marcy SM', 'Mullooly JP', 'Jackson LA', 'Chen R']",2004,158,11,Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med,"France EK, et al.

15505740,[Autosomal chronic granulomatous disease: case report and mutation analysis of two Brazilian siblings].,"OBJECTIVE: To report the case of two siblings with chronic granulomatous disease. Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by abnormal microbicidal activity. Mutations in the p47-phox gene (NCF-1) are present in about 30% of the patients with chronic granulomatous disease; this group presents a better prognosis and later onset of recurrent infections as compared with the X-linked variant, present in about 56% of patients.
DESCRIPTION: Case 1 is a female presenting repeat infections since age 10, starting with impetigo followed by severe pneumonia six months later. The severity of the lung infection associated with liver abscess and the patient's resistance to treatment prompted laboratory investigation for immunodeficiency. The results of the nitroblue tetrazolium and superoxide release tests were consistent with a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. The parents and siblings were assessed, revealing the presence of granulomatous disease in a brother (Case 2). He also presented repeat infections with impetigo at age 10, followed by pneumonia six months later, however in a non severe form. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis detected abnormal electrophoretic mobility of exon 2 of the NCF-1 gene. Sequence DNA analysis revealed a dinucleotide GT deletion in exon 2.
COMMENTS: It is important to evaluate the relatives of chronic granulomatous disease patients, even in the absence of typical clinical signs. Defining the mutation and its correlation with phenotype is important to provide appropriate genetic counseling and clinical prognosis.","['Prando-Andrade C', 'Agudelo-Florez P', 'Lopez JA', 'Paiva MA', 'Costa-Carvalho BT', 'Condino-Neto A']",2004,80,5,J Pediatr (Rio J),"Prando-Andrade C, et al.

15482221,Treatment of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.,"Humans are a natural reservoir for Staphylococcal aureus. Colonization begins soon after birth and predisposes to infection. S. aureus is one of the most common causes of skin infection, giving rise to folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, ecthyma, impetigo, cellulitis and abscesses. In addition, S. aureus may cause a number of toxin-mediated life-threatening diseases, including staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Epidermolytic toxins released by certain S. aureus strains cause SSSS by cleaving the epidermal cell adhesion molecule, desmogelin-1, resulting in superficial skin erosion. Recent experiments have revealed similarities in the pathophysiology of SSSS and pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by antibodies targeting the same epidermal attachment protein. SSSS typically affects neonates and infants but may also occur in predisposed adults. It is painful and distressing for the patient and parents, although most cases respond to antibiotic treatment. Mortality is low in infants but can be as high as 67% in adults, and is dependent on the extent of skin involvement and the comorbid state. Thus, the management of adults who develop SSSS remains a major therapeutic challenge. The antibody response against the toxins neutralizes their effect and prevents recurrence or limits the effects to the area of infection, which is known as bullous impetigo.",['Patel GK'],2004,2,4,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,Patel GK.

15482208,Treatment of bullous impetigo and the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in infants.,"Impetigo is a common, superficial, bacterial infection of the skin characterized by an inflamed and infected epidermis. The rarer variant, bullous impetigo, is characterized by fragile fluid-filled vesicles and flaccid blisters and is invariably caused by pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Bullous impetigo is at the mild end of a spectrum of blistering skin diseases caused by a staphylococcal exfoliative toxin that, at the other extreme, is represented by widespread painful blistering and superficial denudation (the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome). In bullous impetigo, the exfoliative toxins are restricted to the area of infection, and bacteria can be cultured from the blister contents. In staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome the exfoliative toxins are spread hematogenously from a localized source causing widespread epidermal damage at distant sites. Both occur more commonly in children under 5 years of age and particularly in neonates. It is important to swab the skin for bacteriological confirmation and antibiotic sensitivities and, in the case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, to identify the primary focus of infection. Topical therapy should constitute either fusidic acid (Fucidin, Leo Pharma Ltd) as a first-line treatment, or mupirocin (Bactroban, GlaxoSmithKline) in proven cases of bacterial resistance. First-line systemic therapy is oral or intravenous flucloxacillin (Floxapen, GlaxoSmithKline). Nasal swabs from the patient and immediate relatives should be performed to identify asymptomatic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of outbreaks on wards and in nurseries, healthcare professionals should also be swabbed.",['Johnston GA'],2004,2,3,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,Johnston GA.

15480480,Antibacterial photodynamic therapy in dermatology.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) appears to be endowed with several favourable features for the treatment of localized microbial infections, especially after the advent of cationic photosensitising agents (phenothiazines, meso-substituted porphyrins, polylysine-bound chlorins) which properly interact with the outer wall at the surface of several types of bacterial and yeast cells, increase their permeability, and allow significant amounts of photosensitizer to be accumulated at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane. These photosensitisers are characterized by a broad spectrum of activity, being effective toward both wild strain and antibiotic-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In general, extensive eradication of pathogens can be achieved under mild irradiation conditions, such as short incubation times and low fluence-rates, which guarantees a high degree of selectivity in comparison with the main constituents of host tissues, such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Moreover, the photosensitised inactivation of microorganisms is typically a multi-target process; as a consequence, the selection of photoresistant microbial strains is very unlikely and has not been experimentally observed so far. Possible initial targets of antimicrobial PDT applications include periodontal diseases, impetigo, atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, infected wounds, and superinfected posriatic plaques.","['Maisch T', 'Szeimies RM', 'Jori G', 'Abels C']",2004,3,10,Photochem Photobiol Sci,"Maisch T, et al.

15474726,Immunization with C5a peptidase from either group A or B streptococci enhances clearance of group A streptococci from intranasally infected mice.,"Group A streptococci (S. pyogenes) are responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo and several more serious diseases. Emergence of toxic shock, and necrotizing fasciitis, associated with this pathogen over the past 10 years, has generated interest in development of a vaccine, which would prevent infections and potential serious complications. The highly conserved C5a peptidase that is expressed on the surface of group A streptococcus and other streptococcal species, associated with human infections, is a prime vaccine candidate. Here, we report construction of an inactive form of the peptidase and test its potential to induce protection in mice from intranasal challenge with either serotype M1 and M49 strains of streptococci. Mice were immunized by subcutaneous administration of recombinant proteins, mixed with Alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants. Control mice were vaccinated with tetanus toxoid in the same adjuvants. Preparations of SCPA protein were highly immunogenic in mice. Antibody directed against protein from either group A (SCPAw) or group B (SCPBw) streptococci neutralized activity associated with both enzymes. Streptococci were cleared from the oral-nasal mucosa of mice immunized with vaccine protein more rapidly than those immunized with tetanus toxoid. Moreover, immunization with either protein enhanced clearance of group A streptococci from the lung. These results suggest that parenteral vaccination with SCPBw protein will provide protection against infection by either group A or B streptococci.","['Cleary PP', 'Matsuka YV', 'Huynh T', 'Lam H', 'Olmsted SB']",2004,22,31-32,Vaccine,"Cleary PP, et al.

All strains originated from bacterial-infected skin disease and were isolated from patients with impetigo, secondary infected wounds, folliculitis and sycosis vulgaris, and impetiginized dermatitis. In vitro susceptibility of all clinical isolates was tested by agar dilution procedure and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined.
RESULTS: Nadifloxacin was active against all aerobic and anaerobic isolates. MIC(90) (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited) was 0.1 microg/ml for S. aureus, 0.78 microg/ml for both Streptococcus spp. and CNS, and 0.39 microg/ml for Propionibacterium spp. On the other hand, resistant strains with MICs exceeding 12.5 mug/ml were found in tests with the other antibiotics. For both CNS and Propionibacterium acnes, MIC(90) values > or =100 microg/ml were demonstrated for erythromycin. Ofloxacin, cefotiam, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamicin exhibited MIC(90) values < or =1 microg/ml for some bacterial species tested. Both oxacillin and flucloxacillin were active against all investigated bacterial species with MIC(90) values < or =1 microg/ml.
CONCLUSION: In summary, nadifloxacin, a topical fluoroquinolone, was found to be highly active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with infected skin disease, and seems to be a new alternative for topical antibiotic treatment in bacterial skin infections.","['Nenoff P', 'Haustein UF', 'Hittel N']",2004,50,4,Chemotherapy,"Nenoff P, et al.

Experiments exploiting the production of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic antidesmoglein antibodies in pemphigus patients' sera have afforded data that make an invaluable contribution towards identifying the functional domains of the desmogleins involved in intercellular adhesion. Conformational epitopes of antidesmoglein autoantibodies in pemphigus patients' sera and the specific cleavage site of desmoglein 1 by exfoliative toxin have been identified, implicating the N-terminal extracellular domains of the desmogleins as critical regions for controlling intercellular adhesion. Furthermore, the development of active autoimmune mouse models for pemphigus allows in vivo characterization of the disease and its pathogenesis. These studies offer new insight into the potential mechanisms of acantholysis in pemphigus and staphylococcal-associated blistering disease, with implications for the role of desmogleins in desmosomal structure and function.","['Payne AS', 'Hanakawa Y', 'Amagai M', 'Stanley JR']",2004,16,5,Curr Opin Cell Biol,"Payne AS, et al.

It mainly occurs along with dermatoses but rarely with systemic diseases such as renal and liver failure or with genetic disorders. Mostly, it appears in the setting of atopic dermatitis (AD). Other frequent differential diagnoses comprise e.g. scabies, impetigo, varicella, tinea, urticaria, mastocytosis and psoriasis. In children, pruritus is most often associated with severe scratching leading to artefacts. This group of patients requires a therapeutical regimen of its own. The use of topical and systemic treatments depends on the underlying aetiology of pruritus and the stage and status of the skin. The physician has to consider that topically applied drugs may cause intoxication due to the different body volume/body surface proportion, especially in newborns and infants. The dosages of systemic drugs need to be adapted in children and UV phototherapy should be performed with caution due to possible longterm photo damage of the skin. Physicians feel more insecurity treating pruritus in children, especially when systemic treatments are taken into consideration.

It is well known that exotoxin A produced by M1 or M3 serotypes of the organisms plays a crucial role in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). We conclude that in this patient, close contacts of persons with GAS appear to be at risk for colonization with identical strains of STSS-causing GAS such as M1 or M3 serotypes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Datastore records of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Wales, UK were reviewed in conjunction with information concerning the prescribing of fusidic acid.
RESULTS: During the 5 year study period (1997-2001), a rise in the incidence of fusidic acid resistance was noted, particularly among paediatric patients presenting with infected eczema and impetigo, which may be related to the observed increase in prescriptions of topical fusidic acid. Extended phenotypic and genotypic characterization of a limited number (n=31) of isolates from 2002 showed that fusidic acid-resistant strains of S. aureus were typically from patients with impetigo and isolates fell into a single clonal group. Conversely, isolates from other skin disease (eczema, dermatitis and abscesses) were usually susceptible to fusidic acid and proved a diverse group.
CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable data on the prevalence of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus, the genetic background of the strains, and their association with clinical disease in both the healthcare environment and community setting in the catchment area served by the Laboratory.","['El-Zimaity D', 'Kearns AM', 'Dawson SJ', 'Price S', 'Harrison GA']",2004,54,2,J Antimicrob Chemother,"El-Zimaity D, et al.

15141417,[Vasectomy: study of 300 interventions. Review of the national literature and of its complications].,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this paper are: 1. To study the demand and reasons why of the vasectomy in area 12 of Valencian Community. 2. To analyse the adverse effects of our series and the predictable risk factors. 3. To review the adverse effects in the national series. 4. To review the adverse effects referred to in international publications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was made of 300 patients who had submitted themselves to a vasectomy between january 1992 and december 2000. All the clinical dossiers were reviewed according to 10 pre-established variables. age, number of offspring, reasons why, pre-vasectomy anticontraceptives; date of operation, type of anaesthesia used, pathologic anatomy, semen analysis after vasectomy, adverse effects and their possible causes (risk factors). The basic statistic study was done using a data base of Microsoft Access and the interpretations of the different variables using a table of Excel.
RESULTS: The demand for contraceptive attention (vasectomy) is the 8th cause for external urological consulting and the 4th for urological local ambulatory surgery of our area. 300 operations were done during that period. The average age of the patients was 37.5 years old (ranging from 25 to 51). The number of offspring ranged from 1 to 7, with a promedia of 2.41 children/patient. The reasons why were: voluntary family planning (86%), medical illnesses of the female which contraindicated gestation (9%), genetic reasons (4.33%) and social-sanitary problems (0.66%). Contraceptive methods used by 71.63% are known: The widest-used method being IUD (49.74%) and the preservative (25.88%). 30 patients (10%) had adverse effects, 29 patients having light adverse effects. The most frequent were: 12 orchiepididymitis (4%), 5 spermatic granulomas (1.66%), 3 chronic scrotal pain (1%), 2 scrotal haematoma (0.66%) and 2 bleeding (0.66%). There was one serious complications and of all the cases mentioned above only one needed hospitalization (impetigo-sepsis) and another needed surgery due to a spermatic granuloma. There were no pregnancies or post-vasectomy court cases. 81% of the patients had been declared azoospermic within 45 to 60 days after the vasectomy in one or two consecutive semen analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The vasectomy is a safe and simple way for male sterilization. It's the most widely done urologic operation in Spain. The technique isn't extent of adverse effects (0 to 18%) and its seriousness varies from a simple ecchymosis to Fournier's gangrene, endocarditis or sepsis. A doctor would be considered negligent if he/she didn't inform the patient about the remote possibility of a spontaneous recanalisation of the vas deferens leading to renewed fertility (failure of the vasectomy). It is imperative to give post-vasectomy information where the patient must continue using his habitual anticonceptive method until the azoospermia shown in 2 semen analysis confirm the sterility of the patient so that the urologist has no legal problem.","['Romero Pérez P', 'Merenciano Cortina FJ', 'Rafie Mazketli W', 'Amat Cecilia M', 'Martínez Hernández MC']",2004,28,3,Actas Urol Esp,"Romero Pérez P, et al.

15106198,Interventions for impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938-1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949-1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.
SIDE EFFECTS: The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.
REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.","['Koning S', 'Verhagen AP', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Morris A', 'Butler CC', 'van der Wouden JC']",2004,,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Koning S, et al.

Their broad spectrum, rapid bactericidal activity, extensive tissue penetration, excellent bioavailability and ease of administration have made these drugs a common choice for many infectious diseases, including skin infections. Extensive research has shown the fluoroquinolones to be as effective as beta-lactam antibiotics in managing a spectrum of diseases including erysipelas, cellulitis, impetigo, surgical wounds and diabetic foot infections. However, resistance to the fluoroquinolones has increased among the staphylococci, streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae and other important Gram-negative bacilli. Resistance has been linked directly to the widespread use of these compounds. Despite their appeal in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated skin infections, the fluoroquinolones should be reserved as alternatives to beta-lactams and other antibiotics or as empirical therapy in complicated infections until pathogens have been identified and drug regimens can be focused.","['Martin SJ', 'Zeigler DG']",2004,5,2,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Martin SJ and Zeigler DG.

Therefore we performed a survey of the pediatric population referred to the hospital of Aarau, Switzerland, between 1998 and 2001. All inpatients and outpatients less than 16 years old with a dermatologic diagnosis were included prospectively in our study. Demographic data (age, mean age, sex distribution), referral method, pattern and frequency of the different diagnoses in various age groups, diagnostic pattern, and therapy were analyzed. A total of 1105 children were included, with a slightly higher proportion of girls (53.8% versus 46.2%). The average age was 6.8 years and infants and school children represented 60% of the study population. Half of the patients (51%) were external referrals, almost one-third (29%) presented spontaneously, and the remaining 20% were sent from other hospital departments. With a frequency of 25.9%, atopic dermatitis was the most frequent diagnosis, followed by pigmented nevi (9.1%) and warts (5.0%). Local therapy was prescribed in 66% of patients and systemic therapy in 18.6%. Other treatments such as curettage, surgery, cryotherapy, ultraviolet therapy, and electrotherapy were rarely performed (2%). We found that atopic dermatitis was the most frequent skin disorder seen in all age groups. As this was a dermatologic subspecialty clinic, higher frequencies of chronic and uncommon dermatoses such as genetic and autoimmune diseases were seen, whereas frequent diagnoses such as diaper rash and miliaria were rarely seen and the frequencies of other common skin disorders such as scabies, pediculosis, impetigo contagiosa, warts, and molluscum contagiosum were expected to be higher compared with the figures in the literature. In our study these dermatoses are underreported, as most patients are treated by general practitioners and pediatricians. Our survey documents the most common skin diseases in childhood primarily seen by pediatricians.

14632104,Acute bacterial skin infections in pediatric medicine: current issues in presentation and treatment.,"Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative débridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.",['Hedrick J'],2003,5 Suppl 1,,Paediatr Drugs,Hedrick J.

14597015,Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions.,"Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo are depicted. Cutaneous growths that are found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of scaling patches and plaques; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids; phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating and, therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic. Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress by age ten; however, there has been recent concern that certain cases may need to be treated. Dermal rashes may be localized or generalized. Treatment of generalized drug eruptions involves elimination of the inciting agent, topical antipruritics, and systemic corticosteroids for severe reactions. Infectious etiologic agents of skin disease include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many sexually transmitted diseases are bacterial or viral in origin and present as a rash or ulcer. Impetigo is a bacterial infection which may present as a bullous eruption or as an erosion with a honey colored crust. Other bacterial infections include erythema chronicum migrans, folliculitis, and cellulitis. Fungal infections include the various forms of tinea and are usually treated with topical antifungals; if the infection is located in a hair-bearing area, systemic antifungals are necessary. Viral infections include warts, varicella, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes. Treatment varies from observation or antivirals for varicella to cryosurgery and topical imiquimod for warts. Finally, scabies and lice are infectious agents that can be treated with permethrin and pyrethrin solutions.","['Sanfilippo AM', 'Barrio V', 'Kulp-Shorten C', 'Callen JP']",2003,16,5,J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol,"Sanfilippo AM, et al.

14576601,[Community-acquired cutaneous infections: causal role of some bacteria and sensitivity to antibiotics].,"OBJECTIVE: Identify the bacteria responsible for cutaneous infections observed in private practice and test their sensitivity to currently used antibiotics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were examined by dermatologists. A bacteriological sample was taken and sent to a central laboratory for identification of the germ and antibiograms were performed and the minimal inhibiting concentrations (MIC) determined.
RESULTS: Folliculitis, impetigo and furuncles were the three most frequent primary infections. Four hundred and forty-three patients were included and 442 samples were placed in culture. Cultures were positive in 265 cases (a single bacterial strain in 231 cases). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 208 cases, streptococci in 11 and enterobacteria in 3; occasionally several germs were present. Eight strains of staphylococci were meti-R (4 p. 100). All the strains were sensitive to pristinamycin and mupirocin and 90 p. 100 were sensitive to fusidic acid.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence and diffusion of resistant strains is a daily concern in hospitals. In general practice, although care must be taken, the problem rarely occurs and the antibiotics used remain effective.","['Lorette G', 'Beaulieu P', 'Bismuth R', 'Duru G', 'Guihard W', 'Lemaitre M', 'Janin N', 'Jarlier V']",2003,130,8-9 Pt 1,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Lorette G, et al.

14524401,Pruritus.,"Pruritus is a common manifestation of dermatologic diseases, including xerotic eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis. Effective treatment of pruritus can prevent scratch-induced complications such as lichen simplex chronicus and impetigo. Patients, particularly elderly adults, with severe pruritus that does not respond to conservative therapy should be evaluated for an underlying systemic disease. Causes of systemic pruritus include uremia, cholestasis, polycythemia vera, Hodgkin's lymphoma, hyperthyroidism, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Skin scraping, biopsy, or culture may be indicated if skin lesions are present. Diagnostic testing is directed by the clinical evaluation and may include a complete blood count and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Chest radiography and testing for HIV infection may be indicated in some patients. Management of nonspecific pruritus is directed mostly at preventing xerosis. Management of disease-specific pruritus has been established for certain systemic conditions, including uremia and cholestasis.",['Moses S'],2003,68,6,Am Fam Physician,Moses S. Pruritus.

14507444,Assessment of Streptococcus pyogenes microcolony formation in infected skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy.,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are often simultaneously detected from many cases of non-bullous impetigo with atopic dermatitis.
OBJECTIVES: Using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), to investigate formation of S. pyogenes microcolonies in skin lesions.
METHODS: The S. pyogenes cells in the stationary growth phase alone were strongly stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A (FITC-ConA), and this staining was reduced by pretreatment with amylase. Although the components of sugars in glycocalyx produced by S. pyogenes cells are unknown, we suggested that the materials stained by FITC-ConA were consistent with the presence of ConA-reactive sugars in glycocalyx produced by S. pyogenes cells.
RESULTS: S. pyogenes cells associated with streptococcal impetigo skin and croton-oil inflamed mouse skin formed microcolonies encircled by materials (glycocalyx) that stained strongly with FITC-ConA, and these findings were consistent with those in biofilms. In croton-oil inflamed mouse skin, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) infiltrated to just below the epidermis in the cefdinir-treated group but only to the middle dermis in the cefdinir-non-treated group. In this case S. pyogenes and S. aureus cells formed separate microcolonies and existed independently in the outer walls of pustule lesions of streptococcal impetigo.
CONCLUSION: In skin infections, S. pyogenes and S. aureus formed aggregates of microcolonies (similar to that in biofilms) encircled by glycocalyx, which can make the infection hard to eradicate using an antimicrobial agent alone. The effect of conventional antimicrobial agents against biofilm is mainly due to the increase of the invasion of PMNs into the biofilm.","['Akiyama H', 'Morizane S', 'Yamasaki O', 'Oono T', 'Iwatsuki K']",2003,32,3,J Dermatol Sci,"Akiyama H, et al.

Cotransfection of a baculovirus transfer vector containing the cDNA for the entire extracellular domain of canine Dsg1 with baculovirus DNA into insect cells resulted in the secretion of soluble canine Dsg1 into insect culture supernatants. Immunoreactivity of 11 human pemphigus foliaceus (PF) sera against the cell surface of canine keratinocytes was completely removed when the sera were preincubated with the canine Dsg1 baculoprotein. This recombinant canine Dsg1 produced by baculovirus shares the major epitopes of the authentic canine Dsg1 recognized by human PF sera, and will be useful in studying the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms in PF and impetigo in canine patients.","['Nishifuji K', 'Amagai M', 'Nishikawa T', 'Iwasaki T']",2003,95,3-4,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,"Nishifuji K, et al.

12939895,A systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for impetigo.,"BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common clinical problem seen in general practice. Uncertainty exists as to the most effective treatment, or indeed if treatment is necessary.
AIM: To determine the most effective treatment for impetigo in a systemically well patient.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHOD: Databases were searched for relevant studies. The Cochrane highly sensitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) search string was employed and combined with the word 'impetigo' as the MeSH term and keyword. The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references. RCTs that were either double- or observer-blind, and involved systemically well patients of any age in either primary or secondary care settings, were included. Studies that selected patients on the basis of skin swab results were excluded, as were studies that were not in English. Cure or improvement of impetigo reported at seven to 14 days from start of treatment was the primary outcome measure. Meta-analysis was performed on homogeneous studies.
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine studies were identified, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 4.86). There is weak evidence for the superiority of topical antibiotics over some oral antibiotics, such as erythromycin (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.23 to 1.00). There is no significant difference between the effects of mupirocin and fusidic acid (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 0.77 to 4.03).
CONCLUSION: This review found limited high-quality evidence to inform the treatment of impetigo. From that which is available, we would recommend the use of a topical antibiotic for a period of seven days in a systemically well patient with limited disease. Further research is needed on the role of flucloxacillin and non-antibiotic treatments for impetigo.","['George A', 'Rubin G']",2003,53,491,Br J Gen Pract,George A and Rubin G.

12880431,Calcium-dependent conformation of desmoglein 1 is required for its cleavage by exfoliative toxin.,"In bullous impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus spreads under the stratum corneum of skin by elaboration of exfoliative toxin, which hydrolyzes only one peptide bond in a highly structured calcium-binding domain of desmoglein 1, resulting in loss of its function. We investigated the basis of this exquisite specificity. Exfoliative toxin cannot cleave desmoglein 1 pretreated at 56 degrees C or higher or at low or high pH, suggesting that the proper conformation of desmoglein 1 is critical for its cleavage. Because cleavage occurs in an area of desmoglein 1 stabilized by calcium, we determined if the conformation necessary for cleavage is calcium-dependent. Depletion of calcium from desmoglein 1 completely inhibited its cleavage by exfoliative toxin, even after calcium was added back. A change in conformation of desmoglein 1 by calcium depletion was shown, with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunoassay, by loss of binding of PF sera, which recognize conformational epitopes. This change in conformation was confirmed by tryptophan fluorometry and circular dichroism, and was irreversible with repletion of calcium. These data suggest that the specificity of exfoliative toxin cleavage of desmoglein 1 resides not only in simple amino acid sequences but also in its calcium-dependent conformation.","['Hanakawa Y', 'Selwood T', 'Woo D', 'Lin C', 'Schechter NM', 'Stanley JR']",2003,121,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Hanakawa Y, et al.

A wide variety of SSSIs exist, with cellulitis, impetigo and folliculitis being the most common. Most SSSIs are caused by aerobic staphylococci and streptococci, with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes being involved in more complicated infections. Systemic therapy with a variety of beta-lactams, macrolides and lincosamides (clindamycin) have been the cornerstone of SSSI therapy for many years. With the exception of mupirocin, topical therapy occupies a small therapeutic niche. Despite the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among the pathogens most commonly associated with SSSIs (for example, Streptococcus pyogenes and macrolides; Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and mupirocin), few treatment failures have been reported. The newest antimicrobials reviewed herein (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin) are not a significant improvement upon older agents in the treatment of SSSIs.

12843036,"Severity of nonbullous Staphylococcus aureus impetigo in children is associated with strains harboring genetic markers for exfoliative toxin B, Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and the multidrug resistance plasmid pSK41.","Nonbullous impetigo is a common skin infection in children and is frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcal toxins and especially exfoliative toxin A are known mediators of bullous impetigo in children. It is not known whether this is also true for nonbullous impetigo. We set out to analyze clonality among clinical isolates of S. aureus from children with nonbullous impetigo living in a restricted geographical area in The Netherlands. We investigated whether staphylococcal nasal carriage and the nature of the staphylococcal strains were associated with the severity and course of impetigo. Bacterial isolates were obtained from the noses and wounds of children suffering from impetigo. Strains were genetically characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-mediated typing and binary typing, which was also used to assess toxin gene content. In addition, a detailed clinical questionnaire was filled in by each of the participating patients. Staphylococcal nasal carriage seems to predispose the patients to the development of impetigo, and 34% of infections diagnosed in the Rotterdam area are caused by one clonal type of S. aureus. The S. aureus strains harbor the exfoliative toxin B (ETB) gene as a specific virulence factor. In particular, the numbers (P = 0.002) and sizes (P < 0.001) of the lesions were increased in patients infected with an ETB-positive strain. Additional predictors of disease severity and development could be identified. The presence of a staphylococcal plasmid encoding multiple antibiotic resistance traits, as detected by binary typing, was associated with a reduction in the cure rate. Our results recognize that a combination of staphylococcal virulence and resistance genes rather than a single gene determines the development and course of nonbullous impetigo. The identification of these microbial genetic markers, which are predictive of the severity and the course of the disease, will facilitate guided individualized antimicrobial therapy in the future.","['Koning S', 'van Belkum A', 'Snijders S', 'van Leeuwen W', 'Verbrugh H', 'Nouwen J', ""Op 't Veld M"", 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'van der Wouden JC', 'Verduin C']",2003,41,7,J Clin Microbiol,"Koning S, et al.

12734438,Staphylococcal epidermolysins.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Staphylococcal epidermolysins are the major causative toxins of bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. This disease is characterized by the splitting of the epidermis between two cell layers resulting in exfoliation. It predominantly affects newborn babies and exposes them to secondary infections. This leads to the risk of epidemics, especially in nurseries. With only an experimental model which consists of skin injections in newborn mice and the recent determination of three-dimensional structures, the essential function of these toxins remained controversial, split between that of specific proteases and that of superantigens.
RECENT FINDINGS: Staphylococcal epidermolysins now constitute a family of toxins, with the recent characterizations of two new serotypes: ETC and ETD. They may be secreted by sensitive or methicillin-resistant strains. Four molecules were also identified in Staphylococcus hyicus responsible for exudative epidermitis in swine. While different observations suggested a proteolytic action to these toxins, the histological parallel made with pemphigus foliaceus greatly helped in the characterization of the targets for epidermolysins ETA, ETB, ETD: desmoglein-1, a desmosome-constitutive protein, and incidentally melanocyte-stimulating hormones, which accounts for the blisters observed clinically.
SUMMARY: The growing complexity in staphylococcal toxins has to be taken into account both for their association with diseases and for diagnosis purposes. Even though cases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in adults are rare, they raise further questions about the pathogenic features of the disease such as individual sensitivity and distribution of the toxins into the body.","['Prévost G', 'Couppié P', 'Monteil H']",2003,16,2,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Prévost G, et al.

12730451,Zinc supplementation and growth of the fetus and low birth weight infant.,"Zinc deficiency limits growth in young children, and in animal models it also affects fetal growth. In animals, the effect of severe zinc deficiency on growth is evident. However, controlled trials of zinc supplementation during pregnancy in humans have not demonstrated consistent effects on weight at birth and/or duration of gestation. Those studies that have identified a positive effect of zinc on fetal growth were performed on low-socioeconomic or migrant groups in industrialized countries or in countries where diet and living conditions are improving. In contrast, in studies conducted either on populations with minimal risk of zinc deficiency or those suffering from multiple and severe nutritional deficiencies, no effects have been found. The potential confounding factors that may help explain the contradictory results include the following: age of pregnant women; presence of digestive diseases, other nutritional deficiencies, phytates or other factors that affect bioavailability; timing and duration of zinc supplementation and compliance with supplements. Few studies of zinc supplementation were conducted on infants that were born small for their gestational age or preterm; in this case, a positive effect on growth was shown. A study of zinc supplementation during pregnancy found reduced risk of diseases (diarrhea or impetigo) in small-for-gestational-age but not preterm infants. A second study demonstrated reduced mortality in small-for-gestational-age infants. We conclude that supplementation trials during human pregnancy do not provide conclusive evidence for a beneficial effect of zinc supplementation despite the experimental evidence that zinc deficiency may retard fetal growth or shorten pregnancy. However, early zinc supplementation in low birth weight or small-for-gestational-age infants reveals an effective improvement in growth, which suggests a prenatal depletion or insufficient zinc intake to support catch-up growth postnatally.","['Castillo-Durán C', 'Weisstaub G']",2003,133,5 Suppl 1,J Nutr,Castillo-Durán C and Weisstaub G.

12656437,Disseminated cutaneous herpes simplex virus type-1 with interstitial pneumonia as a first presentation of AIDS.,"Recognition of cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be difficult because of its atypical prsentations. Pneumonia in AIDS is complex with many possible etiologies. Identification of HSV preceded by atypical cutaneous manifestation and pneumonia is critical, given the poor prognosis when treatment is delayed or not prescribed. We report a 62-year-old patient with undiagnosed HIV infection who presented with disseminated cutaneous lesions resembling impetigo as his first presentation of AIDS. Subsequent confirmation that HSV was responsible led to appropriate treatment of this and the complicating HSV pneumonia. This report emphasizes the importance of the early recognition of atypical cutaneous HSV in patients with AIDS.","['Umar SH', 'Kanth A']",1999,91,8,J Natl Med Assoc,Umar SH and Kanth A.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) may be used to visualize fully hydrated microbial biofilms.
OBJECTIVES: Using CLSM, to analyse glycocalyx production by Staphylococcus aureus cells in skin lesions of bullous impetigo, atopic dermatitis and pemphigus foliaceus. A second objective was to compare numbers of S. aureus cells in tissue sections prepared by different methods for routine light microscopy.
METHODS: S. aureus cells in skin lesions of impetigo, atopic dermatitis and pemphigus were stained with safranin, and positive staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A was considered to indicate the presence of glycocalyx.
RESULTS: All S. aureus cells tested in skin lesions of impetigo, atopic dermatitis and pemphigus were covered with glycocalyx and formed microcolonies. The numbers of S. aureus cells in a routine light microscopy section were significantly lower than those in a frozen section that had not been dehydrated with ethanol.
CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus cells generally produce glycocalyx in skin lesions of bullous impetigo, atopic dermatitis and pemphigus foliaceus, which accounts for the difficulty of removing S. aureus cells from these skin lesions. The glycocalyx may collapse during dehydration and most of the S. aureus cells may be carried away during preparation of routine light microscope sections.","['Akiyama H', 'Hamada T', 'Huh WK', 'Yamasaki O', 'Oono T', 'Fujimoto W', 'Iwatsuki K']",2003,148,3,Br J Dermatol,"Akiyama H, et al.

12627992,Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: diagnosis and management.,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a common disorder that is usually seen in infants and children and rarely seen in adults. SSSS usually presents with a prodrome of sore throat or conjunctivitis. Extremely tender flaccid bullae, which are Nikolsky sign-positive, develop within 48 hours and commonly affect the flexures; occasionally, large areas of the skin may be involved. The bullae enlarge and rupture easily to reveal a moist erythematous base, which gives rise to the scalded appearance. SSSS in adults is a rare disorder, though there are now over 50 documented cases. Usually SSSS occurs in predisposed individuals, but not all adults have an underlying illness. Whereas mortality in childhood SSSS is approximately 4%, the mortality rate in adults is reported to be greater than 60%. SSSS is caused by an infection with a particular strain of Staphylococcus aureus, which leads to blistering of the upper layer of the skin, by the release of a circulating exotoxin. It has recently been demonstrated that the exfoliative exotoxin responsible for SSSS leads to the cleavage of desmoglein 1 complex, an important desmosomal protein. The same toxins that are responsible for causing SSSS also cause bullous impetigo. There appears to be a relationship between the disease extent, the amount of toxin produced and whether the toxin is released locally or systemically. As a result there is likely to be a spectrum of disease and there are likely to be a number of milder cases of adult SSSS that go undiagnosed. Social improvements and hygiene have led to a dramatic fall in the number of cases of SSSS. Treatment is usually straightforward, when there is no coexistent morbidity and the presentation is mild, but can be demanding if the patient is particularly ill. SSSS is still associated with mortality, particularly when it occurs in adults.","['Patel GK', 'Finlay AY']",2003,4,3,Am J Clin Dermatol,Patel GK and Finlay AY.

AIM: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus in impetigo.
METHODS: We measured the antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from impetigo patients between 1994 and 2000.
RESULTS: The MIC50 of gentamicin was always higher than that of other antimicrobial agents until 1999. In isolates obtained since 1996, the MIC90 of gentamicin was over 12.5 micro g/mL, which is markedly higher than that found for other skin infections (folliculitis, furuncles, paronychia, phlegmone, secondary infection of eczema, dermatitis, ulcer and decubitus). There were no strains of S. aureus resistant to vancomycin and fusidic acid. After 2000, we could find only one strain resistant to minocycline and ofloxacin.

METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for controlled clinical trials of antibacterial herbal medicines. Data were extracted and validated in a standardized fashion, according to predefined criteria, by two independent reviewers.
RESULTS: Seven clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. Four of these studies were randomized. Three trials of garlic and cinnamon treatments for Helicobacter pylori infections reported no significant effect. Bacterial infections of skin were treated in four trials. Positive results were reported for an ointment containing tea leaf extract in impetigo contagiosa infections. Two trials of tea tree oil preparations used for acne and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and one trial of Ocimum gratissimum oil for acne, reported results equivalent to conventional treatments.

12480897,Roles of the plasminogen activator streptokinase and the plasminogen-associated M protein in an experimental model for streptococcal impetigo.,"Primary infection by group A streptococci (GAS) takes place at either the throat or skin of the human host, often leading to pharyngitis or impetigo, respectively. Many GAS strains differ in their preference for throat and skin tissue sites. Previous epidemiological findings show that many of the strains displaying strong tropism for the skin have a high-affinity binding site for plasminogen, located within M protein (PAM), a prominent surface fibril. Plasminogen bound by PAM interacts with streptokinase, a plasminogen activator secreted by GAS, to yield bacterial-bound plasmin activity. In this study, PAM and streptokinase were tested for their roles in infection using an experimental model that closely mimics human impetigo. Inactivation of genes encoding either PAM or streptokinase led to a partial, but significant, loss of virulence in vivo, as measured by net growth of the bacteria and pathological alterations. The relative loss in virulence in vivo was greater for the streptokinase mutant than for the PAM mutant. However, the PAM mutant, but not the streptokinase mutant, displayed a partial loss in resistance to phagocytosis in vitro. The combined experimental and epidemiological data provide evidence that PAM and streptokinase play a key role in mediating skin-specific infection by GAS. In addition, secreted cysteine proteinase activity due to SpeB leads to degradation of streptokinase in stationary phase broth cultures. Since SpeB is also a determinant of tissue-specific GAS infection at the skin, direct interactions between these two proteolytic pathways may constitute an important pathogenic mechanism. An integrated model for superficial infection at the skin is presented.","['Svensson MD', 'Sjöbring U', 'Luo F', 'Bessen DE']",2002,148,Pt 12,Microbiology (Reading),"Svensson MD, et al.

METHODS: Fusidic acid-resistant and -susceptible clinical isolates of S. aureus from patients with skin infections in the Norwegian county of Telemark and fusidic acid-resistant isolates from other parts of Scandinavia were compared. MICs of fusidic acid for bacterial isolates and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were investigated. Prevalence data for fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus for the period 1992-2001 were obtained.
RESULTS: The prevalence of fusidic acid resistance in S. aureus increased from 1992 to 2001. Eighty per cent of the resistant isolates investigated shared an identical PFGE pattern. The same pattern was found in fusidic acid-resistant isolates from other parts of Scandinavia. Fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus was typically found in impetigo bullosa-like skin disease in children mostly in the summer months.
CONCLUSIONS: Fusidic acid resistance among S. aureus is increasing in Norway and is predominantly caused by one clone of S. aureus.

12440194,A half-century of streptococcal research: then & now.,"Research on Group A streptococci (GAS) before 1950 paved the way for successful clinical trials to prevent acute rheumatic fever (ARF) by treating the prior streptococcal infection with penicillin. Prevention of ARF has led to almost complete disappearance of rheumatic heart disease in the industrialized world, but has yet to be accomplished in developing countries, where most of the world's populations reside. Twenty years of research beginning in 1918 by Lancefield and others delineated the modern classification of haemolytic streptococci and led to the recognition that only Group A is responsible for the pharyngitis that causes ARF. M-protein, identified as a major virulence factor, is a powerful inhibitor of phagocytosis, and antibodies to it promote type-specific phagocytosis and therefore type-specific immunity. Other virulent properties of GAS include a bulky capsule, as well as extracellular toxins such as streptolysins S and O and streptococcal proteinase. McCarty and others pursued the cell biology of GAS and identified the cellular localization of various antigenic components. The discovery of purified M-protein as a helical coiled-coiled fibrillar protein has sparked development of M-protein vaccine. US, UK, and Trinidad scientists described differences between streptococcal infections of the throat and skin and noted particularly that many of the GAS M-types that cause impetigo are less likely to cause pharyngitis. GAS impetigo may cause acute glomerulonephritis, but such infections do not result in ARF. The changing manifestations of disease over time and the evolution of microbes are common themes in medicine today. These themes are relevant to GAS pharyngitis and ARF, especially the decline in the incidence of severe ARF and the decrease in severity of GAS pharyngitis. Research on GAS bacteriophages led to the discovery of a relationship between lysogenic GAS and production of erythrogenic toxin and has broadened approaches to the molecular epidemiology of GAS virulence. The 21st century begins with determination of the complete genome sequence of M-1, M-18, and M-3 strains of GAS. These studies provide evidence for phage-encoded toxins, high-virulence phenotypes, and clone emergence. This research will reveal genetic processes at the molecular level that control the emergence and decline of streptococcal diseases in different places and times and the shifting patterns in clinical manifestations.",['Krause RM'],2002,115,,Indian J Med Res,Krause RM.

12429994,Differential pathomechanisms of epidermal necrolytic blistering diseases.,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) results from the effect of exfoliative-toxins produced by staphylococcal strains. The disease affects predominantly children, and is rare in adults. We report two cases of the adult type of SSSS. Corticotherapy, chronic alcohol abuse and epilepsy-related immune changes might have been predisposing factors in these patients. The immunopathological characteristics of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in adults SSSS have not been thoroughly explored so far in the literature. Biopsies from 2 patients with bullous SSSS skin were studied by means of immunochemistry using a panel of 10 antibodies directed to FXIIIa, CD15, CD31, CD45R0, CD50, CD54, CD62E, CD95, CD106, and L1-protein, respectively. Cutaneous biopsies from related blistering diseases were compared. They included drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), bullous impetigo and superficial pemphigus. A dense cell infiltrate composed of granulocytes (CD15+), macrophages (L1 protein+) and memory T cells (CD45R0+) and a strong expression of ICAM-3 (CD50) were present in the epidermis. CD95+ keratinocytes were lining the intraepidermal blisters. Type I dermal dendrocytes (Factor XIIIa+) were numerous and plump in the dermis. Bullous impetigo exhibited the same pattern of inflammatory cells, but with a lower density in type I dermal dendrocytes. TEN differed from SSSS by both the absence of CD15+ granulocytes and a stronger expression of the pro-apoptotic CD95 antigen in the epidermis. In superficial pemphigus, CD95 antigen was not expressed, and CD15+ granulocytes, CD45R0+ lymphocytes and L1 protein+ monocytes were much less numerous. It is concluded that the specific binding of SSSS-induced exotoxins to the desmosomes alters the keratinocyte metabolism leading to an inflammatory reaction followed by focal apoptosis. Our findings are in line with the concept that SSSS exotoxins might be superantigens. A common pathomechanism leading to epidermal destruction is likely operative in SSSS and bullous impetigo. The inflammatory cell composition in TEN and superficial pemphigus markedly differs from that in SSSS.","['Paquet P', 'Piérard GE']",2002,10,6,Int J Mol Med,Paquet P and Piérard GE.

12419616,"The fundamental contribution of phages to GAS evolution, genome diversification and strain emergence.","The human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes many different diseases including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, and the post-infection sequelae glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. The frequency and severity of GAS infections increased in the 1980s and 1990s, but the cause of this increase is unknown. Recently, genome sequencing of serotype M1, M3 and M18 strains revealed many new proven or putative virulence factors that are encoded by phages or phage-like elements. Importantly, these genetic elements account for an unexpectedly large proportion of the difference in gene content between the three strains. These new genome-sequencing studies have provided evidence that temporally and geographically distinct epidemics, and the complex array of GAS clinical presentations, might be related in part to the acquisition or evolution of phage-encoded virulence factors. We anticipate that new phage-encoded virulence factors will be identified by sequencing the genomes of additional GAS strains, including organisms non-randomly associated with particular clinical syndromes.","['Banks DJ', 'Beres SB', 'Musser JM']",2002,10,11,Trends Microbiol,"Banks DJ, et al.

12410170,Current issues in the prevention of rheumatic fever.,"Variation in strain virulence helps to account for the wide spectrum of group A streptococcal diseases and for their striking epidemiological variation. Recent studies of the genetic control of the expression of the virulence factors of group A streptococci (GAS) are beginning to illuminate such variation. Although still obscure, the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever (RF) requires primary infection of the throat by highly virulent GAS strains. Those that have clearly caused RF contain large hyaluronate capsules and extended M-protein molecules. The M molecule contains some epitopes cross-reactive with host tissues, and also has superantigenic properties like the secreted GAS erythrogenic toxins. In settings where ARF has become rare, GAS pharyngitis continues to be quite common but is most often caused by relatively attenuated strains. These, however, may colonize the throat avidly, and often stubbornly. GAS ""skin strains"" that cause pyoderma (impetigo) are molecularly distinct from ""throat strains"". Although they may secondarily colonize and infect the throat, the pyoderma strains are generally less virulent and are not rheumatogenic. Some skin strains, however, may cause acute glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of GAS pharyngitis is reviewed in relation to the varying prevalence of RF in different geographical and social settings.",['Stollerman GH'],2002,93,5,Minerva Med,Stollerman GH.

12371644,Pemphigus as a paradigm of autoimmunity and cell adhesion.,"Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases of the skin and mucous membranes that are characterized histologically by intraepidermal blisters due to the loss of cell-cell adhesion of keratinocytes and immunopathologically by the finding of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies directed against the cell surface of keratinocytes. Identification of the target antigens has redefined pemphigus as an autoimmune disease against desmosomal cadherin or desmoglein. The IgG autoantibody-mediated functional inhibition of desmoglein which plays an important role in the cell-cell adhesion of keratinocytes results in blister formation. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus have IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein3 and desmoglein1, respectively. Even complex clinical variations of pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus are now logically explained by the desmoglein compensation theory. As an extension of this theory, the exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which causes staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and bullous impetigo, was found to specifically cleave desmoglein1 and induce the identical histology to pemphigus foliaceus. Another recent innovation has been the development of an active disease mouse-model for pemphigus using autoantigen knockout mice, in which self-tolerance of the defective gene product is not acquired. When splenocytes from desmoglein3 knockout mice are adoptively transferred into mice expressing desmoglein3, anti-desmoglein3 IgG is stably produced in the recipient mice that develop the phenotype of pemphigus vulgaris. This model will be valuable not only for dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms in pathogenic antibody production but also for developing novel therapeutic strategies.",['Amagai M'],2002,51,3,Keio J Med,Amagai M.

12356219,Mupirocin vs terbinafine in impetigo.,"OBJECTIVE: Terbinafine is an antifungal drug known to have also antibacterial activity against certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It seems that antibacterial and antifungal activity of terbinafine may have an advantage in the treatment of mixed fungal and bacterial superficial skin infections. Nevertheless, clinical relevance of the antibacterial part of its action has not been investigated efficiently. To compare the efficacy and safety of terbinafine with those of mupirocin, which has already proven antibacterial action, in the treatment of impetigo.
METHODS: Children clinically diagnosed as having impetigo were treated with topical mupirocin or topical terbinafine in a randomized fashion. Patients' lesions were examined clinically on days 0, 4, 7, 10 and bacteriologic cultures were obtained on days 0 and 10.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. Forty-eight of these patients were eligible for the efficacy and safety analysis. Twenty-five and 23 patients were treated with mupirocin and terbinafine, respectively. The clinical cure rates were 100% for the mupirocin group and 70% for the terbinafine group (p < 0.05). The bacteriological eradication rate for mupirocin-treated children was 100% and that for terbinafine-treated children was 78% (p < 0.05). Presence of bullous lesions appeared to be a factor for poor clinical outcome in the terbinafine group. Mild local adverse effects were noted in a small percentage of patients in each group.
CONCLUSION: Antibacterial activity of terbinafine is not strong enough to be an alternative in the treatment of impertigo. It is advisable that terbinafine could be used in combination with an antibacterial drug for superficial skin infections caused by both fungi and bacteria.","['Ciftci E', 'Guriz H', 'Aysev AD']",2002,69,8,Indian J Pediatr,"Ciftci E, et al.

12228315,"Identification of the Staphylococcus aureus etd pathogenicity island which encodes a novel exfoliative toxin, ETD, and EDIN-B.","We identified a novel pathogenicity island in Staphylococcus aureus which contains open reading frames (ORFs) similar to the exfoliative toxin (ET) gene, glutamyl endopeptidase gene, and edin-B gene in tandem and the phage resistance gene, flanked by hsdM, hsdS (restriction and modification system), and IS256. The protein encoded by the ET-like gene showed 40, 59, and 68% amino acid sequence identities with exfoliative toxin A (ETA), exfoliative toxin B (ETB), and Staphylococcus hyicus ETB (ShETB), respectively. When injected into neonatal mice, the recombinant protein derived from the ET-like gene induced exfoliation of the skin with loss of cell-to-cell adhesion in the upper part of the epidermis as observed in histological examinations, just as was found in neonatal mice injected with ETA or ETB. Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant protein is serologically distinct from ETA and ETB. Therefore, the product encoded by this new ORF is a new ET member produced by S. aureus and is termed ETD. ETD did not induce blisters in 1-day-old chickens. In the skins of mice injected with ETD, cell surface staining of desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a cadherin type cell-to-cell adhesion molecule in desmosomes, was abolished without affecting that of desmoglein 3 (Dsg3). Furthermore, in vitro incubation of the recombinant extracellular domains of Dsg1 and Dsg3 with the recombinant protein demonstrated that both mouse and human Dsg1, but not Dsg3, were directly cleaved in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that ETD and ETA induce blister formation by identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical strains positive for edin-B were suggested to be clonally associated, and all edin-B-positive strains tested were positive for etd. Among 18 etd-positive strains, 12 produced ETD extracellularly. Interestingly, these strains are mainly isolated from other sources of infections and not from patients with bullous impetigo or staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. This strongly suggests that ETD might play a pathogenic role in a broader spectrum of bacterial infections than previously considered.","['Yamaguchi T', 'Nishifuji K', 'Sasaki M', 'Fudaba Y', 'Aepfelbacher M', 'Takata T', 'Ohara M', 'Komatsuzawa H', 'Amagai M', 'Sugai M']",2002,70,10,Infect Immun,"Yamaguchi T, et al.

12174224,Pyoderma among Hajj Pilgrims in Makkah.,"OBJECTIVE: Bacterial skin infections have been considered as a possible health problem of the Hajj pilgrims. Significant increase in the rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics against gram positive organisms has been observed. The present study was planned to obtain the microbiological profile of bacterial skin infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobials.
METHODS: Pyodermas were investigated clinically and bacteriologically by a prospective study conducted on patients attending the dermatology clinic at the King Faisal Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 Hajj periods (2000 - 2001).
RESULTS: Of a total of 80 pyoderma patients, 52.5% were primary and 47.5% secondary. The leading cause of primary pyoderma was found to be impetigo in 28.8% cases, and of secondary pyoderma was infected eczema in 18.8% cases. Positive cultures were found in 87.5% cases. The organisms responsible for primary pyoderma were: Staphylococcus aureus (65.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (28.1%) or both (6.4%) while in secondary pydermas were: Staphylococcus aureus (44.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (15.8%), or both (18.4%), and gram negative bacilli (21.1%). The resistant pattern of antimicrobials against Staphylococcus aureus was as follows: penicillin 80.85%, tetracycline 10.6%, gentamicin 6.4%, erythromycin 4.3% and cotrimoxazole [corrected] 4.3%. Oxacillin and cephalothin were found least resistant (2.1%).
CONCLUSION: Pyoderma appeared as one of the common health hazard of our Hajj pilgrims. Penicillin and tetracycline are found ineffective in treating skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus while oxacillin is recommended as first line of treatment.","['Fatani MI', 'Bukhari SZ', 'Al-Afif KA', 'Karima TM', 'Abdulghani MR', 'Al-Kaltham MI']",2002,23,7,Saudi Med J,"Fatani MI, et al.

12145722,Adverse and beneficial secondary effects of mass treatment with azithromycin to eliminate blindness due to trachoma in Nepal.,"Mass administration of azithromycin to eliminate blindness due to trachoma has raised concerns regarding the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. During 2000, we compared the antimicrobial resistance of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal isolates recovered from and the prevalence of impetigo, respiratory symptoms, and diarrhea among 458 children in Nepal before and after mass administration of azithromycin. No azithromycin-resistant pneumococci were isolated except from 4.3% of children who had received azithromycin during 2 previous mass treatments (P<.001). There were decreases in the prevalence of impetigo (from 14% to 6% of subjects; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.80) and diarrhea (from 32% to 11%; adjusted OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43) 10 days after azithromycin treatment. The absence of macrolide-resistant isolates after 1 mass treatment with azithromycin is encouraging, although the recovery of azithromycin-resistant isolates after 2 mass treatments suggests the need for resistance monitoring when multiple rounds of antimicrobial treatment are given.","['Fry AM', 'Jha HC', 'Lietman TM', 'Chaudhary JS', 'Bhatta RC', 'Elliott J', 'Hyde T', 'Schuchat A', 'Gaynor B', 'Dowell SF']",2002,35,4,Clin Infect Dis,"Fry AM, et al.

12126026,Common bacterial skin infections.,"Family physicians frequently treat bacterial skin infections in the office and in the hospital. Common skin infections include cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, and furuncles and carbuncles. Cellulitis is an infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that has poorly demarcated borders and is usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species. Erysipelas is a superficial form of cellulitis with sharply demarcated borders and is caused almost exclusively by Streptococcus. Impetigo is also caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus and can lead to lifting of the stratum corneum resulting in the commonly seen bullous effect. Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles. When the infection is bacterial rather than mechanical in nature, it is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus. If the infection of the follicle is deeper and involves more follicles, it moves into the furuncle and carbuncle stages and usually requires incision and drainage. All of these infections are typically diagnosed by clinical presentation and treated empirically. If antibiotics are required, one that is active against gram-positive organisms such as penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones should be chosen. Children, patients who have diabetes, or patients who have immunodeficiencies are more susceptible to gram-negative infections and may require treatment with a second- or third-generation cephalosporin.","['Stulberg DL', 'Penrod MA', 'Blatny RA']",2002,66,1,Am Fam Physician,"Stulberg DL, et al.

12093888,Molecular mechanisms of blister formation in bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.,"Bullous impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common bacterial infections of man, and its generalized form, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), is a frequent manifestation of staphylococcal epidemics in neonatal nurseries. Both diseases are mediated by exfoliative toxins (ETs), which show exquisite pathologic specificity in blistering only the superficial epidermis. We show that these toxins act as serine proteases with extremely focused molecular specificity to cleave mouse and human desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) once after glutamic acid residue 381 between extracellular domains 3 and 4. Mutation of the predicted catalytically active serine to alanine completely inhibits cleavage. The mutated ETs bind specifically to Dsg1 by immunofluorescence colocalization and by coimmunoprecipitation. Thus, ETs, through specific recognition and proteolytic cleavage of one structurally critical peptide bond in an adhesion molecule, cause its dysfunction and allow S. aureus to spread under the stratum corneum, the main barrier of the skin, explaining how, although they circulate through the entire body in SSSS, they cause pathology only in the superficial epidermis.","['Hanakawa Y', 'Schechter NM', 'Lin C', 'Garza L', 'Li H', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Fudaba Y', 'Nishifuji K', 'Sugai M', 'Amagai M', 'Stanley JR']",2002,110,1,J Clin Invest,"Hanakawa Y, et al.

12093320,Bacterial skin infections in the elderly: diagnosis and treatment.,"Skin and soft tissue infections are quite common in elderly people. A number of special conditions and circumstances need to be considered in the diagnosis and therapy. It is important to try to establish the causative organism, exclude other cutaneous disorders and identify precipitating factors. Treatment modalities include antiseptics, topical and systemic antibacterials, dressings and biotherapy. Skin infections presenting with erythema, blisters, pustules, and ulcerations or in body folds are described in detail. Cellulitis and infected ulcers are the most commonly encountered cutaneous infections in the elderly. Accurate and quick diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Appropriate antibacterials, antiseptics and dressings are necessary depending on the severity of the clinical presentation and resistance patterns. Laboratory tests, such as skin swabs, to establish the exact pathogen take time and the results might represent colonisation rather than infection of the skin. Cellulitis should be clinically distinguished from erysipelas and necrotising fasciitis. The latter is a life-threatening condition, which in the majority of cases requires surgical debridement of the infected tissue. Blisters and honey-coloured crusts are typical features of impetigo. It is very contagious and close contacts should be examined. Folliculitis is a commonly seen skin infection, which often responds to the use of antiseptics and topical antibacterials. More severe pustular skin eruptions, such as furunculosis and carbunculosis, usually require treatment with systemic antibacterials. Intertrigo and erythrasma have a predilection for the body folds, especially the axillae and groin, and topical therapy is usually sufficient. Secondary skin infections are often the result of persistent pruritus associated with increasing dryness of the aging skin. Emollients and antihistamines are useful measures. Primary cutaneous disorders and systemic diseases should be excluded with the aid of appropriate investigations, such as blood tests and skin biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most common causative organisms of cutaneous infections.","['Laube S', 'Farrell AM']",2002,19,5,Drugs Aging,Laube S and Farrell AM.

12086547,Possible gatifloxacin-induced fulminant hepatic failure.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fulminant hepatic failure associated with the use of gatifloxacin.
CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old white man was found to have an approximate 1-week history of worsening jaundice on the last day of a 10-day course of gatifloxacin for treatment of impetigo while at his skilled nursing facility. Liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and ammonia concentrations were found to be markedly elevated, consistent with hepatocellular necrosis commonly seen with fluoroquinolones. Screening for other causes of hepatotoxicity, including alcoholic or viral hepatitis, obstruction, or autoimmune-mediated processes, were negative. Other potential medication causes were less likely. The patient's liver function steadily declined, eventually resulting in multiple organ failure. The patient died 25 days after completing the course of gatifloxacin.
DISCUSSION: This case of hepatotoxicity was associated with gatifloxacin. Other fluoroquinolones, most notably trovafloxacin, have been observed to cause variable degrees of hepatotoxicity, ranging from asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes to fulminant hepatic failure. Fluoroquinolones are thought to cause hepatocellular necrosis, which results in elevated ALT and AST concentrations with a normal alkaline phosphatase concentration. A variable degree of hyperbilirubinemia is often seen, with the presence and degree of jaundice often correlating to a poorer prognosis. Hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy are also commonly present.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroquinolones, including trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, and, in this case report, gatifloxacin, have been associated with hepatotoxicity. It is important that these medications be considered a possible cause when the patient being treated has liver disease.","['Coleman CI', 'Spencer JV', 'Chung JO', 'Reddy P']",2002,36,7-8,Ann Pharmacother,"Coleman CI, et al.

Clinically, infection with the Paederus species mimics contact dermatitis, herpes zoster, bullous impetigo, and phytophotodermatitis. Definitive diagnosis is made by historical and clinical findings. To determine the main histopathologic features of this infestation, biopsy specimens were obtained from 9 patients and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In most patients, the skin lesions were located on the exposed parts of the body. Clinically, these lesions were linear, vesicular, bullous, and/or pustular on erythematous bases and resembled either phytophotodermatitis, herpes zoster, or impetigo rather than classic insect bites. Pederin, which is released from the Paederus species, may cause these lesions. The number of cases has increased markedly during the last 5 years. In the coming years, we expect this number to increase significantly.","['Uslular C', 'Kavukçu H', 'Alptekïn D', 'Acar MA', 'Denlï YG', 'Memïşioglu HR', 'Kasap H']",2002,69,4,Cutis,"Uslular C, et al.

12047639,Analytical study of pustular eruptions in neonates.,"Pustular eruptions are commonly encountered in neonatal practice. Much confusion exists among clinicians because of the similarity in clinical lesions, paucity of relevant literature, and varied nomenclature used for these diseases. This often results in inappropriate diagnoses and therapies, besides subjecting the neonates to invasive and traumatic investigative procedures. We conducted a comprehensive study of pustular eruptions in 100 neonates, using the clinical examination and simple laboratory tests to arrive at a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this problem. Of the 100 neonates with pustular eruptions, 36% were in the early neonatal period (first week of life). A slight male preponderance with a male:female ratio of 1:0.79 was observed. The majority of the families of these infants had poor socioeconomic status (96%) and were living in slums (71%). A study of their educational status revealed that 54% of the mothers were uneducated. Fifty-seven percent of the neonates were born at home. The clinical pattern of diseases among these neonates was that 58% of them had infections [impetigo (23%), intertrigo (14%), scabies (6%), and viral diseases (6%)]. Noninfectious diseases (42%) included miliaria pustulosa, erythema toxicum neonatorum, epidermolysis bullosa, and contact dermatitis. Simple laboratory investigations helpful in establishing the diagnosis were smears processed with Gram (24%) and Giemsa (39%) stains and wet mounts with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (27%) for direct microscopic examination. More than half (53%) of the patients required no specific treatment except for counseling and medications to alleviate symptoms, while others with an infectious etiology responded to topical and or systemic antibiotics/antifungals. Pustular eruptions in neonates include both infectious and noninfectious diseases. Simple laboratory tests such as Gram- and Giemsa-stained smears, direct microscopy with 10% KOH wet mounts, bacterial and fungal cultures are helpful in establishing the diagnosis and occasionally skin biopsy is needed. A practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this problem is discussed.","['Nanda S', 'Reddy BS', 'Ramji S', 'Pandhi D']",2002,19,3,Pediatr Dermatol,"Nanda S, et al.

11992289,Clonal association of Staphylococcus aureus causing bullous impetigo and the emergence of new methicillin-resistant clonal groups in Kansai district in Japan.,"A molecular epidemiological analysis was performed to reveal the clonal association of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with bullous impetigo. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with cluster analysis, genetic and phenotypic characterizations, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiling of 88 S. aureus strains isolated from outpatients at 4 hospitals in the Kansai district in Japan were undertaken. Three distinct clonal groups were identified: 2 of them carried the exfoliative toxin (ET) A gene (eta), and the other carried the ETB gene (etb). The former groups represent 2 eta-positive clonal groups that have not been described previously. All the strains in the more dominant eta-positive clonal group and some of the strains in the etb-positive clonal group were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) showing borderline-to-moderate resistance to beta-lactams. These MRSA strains appear to be emerging clonal groups that have not been considered in previous epidemiological studies of ET-producing S. aureus in Japan and thus pose a significant threat for future treatment of patients with bullous impetigo and/or staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome.","['Yamaguchi T', 'Yokota Y', 'Terajima J', 'Hayashi T', 'Aepfelbacher M', 'Ohara M', 'Komatsuzawa H', 'Watanabe H', 'Sugai M']",2002,185,10,J Infect Dis,"Yamaguchi T, et al.

11982763,Staphylococcal exfoliative toxin B specifically cleaves desmoglein 1.,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and its localized form, bullous impetigo, show superficial epidermal blister formation caused by exfoliative toxin A or B produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Recently we have demonstrated that exfoliative toxin A specifically cleaves desmoglein 1, a desmosomal adhesion molecule, that when inactivated results in blisters. In this study we determine the target molecule for exfoliative toxin B. Exfoliative toxin B injected in neonatal mice caused superficial epidermal blisters, abolished cell surface staining of desmoglein 1, and degraded desmoglein 1 without affecting desmoglein 3 or E-cadherin. When adenovirus-transduced cultured keratinocytes expressing exogenous mouse desmoglein 1 or desmoglein 3 were incubated with exfoliative toxin B, desmoglein 1, but not desmoglein 3, was cleaved. Furthermore, cell surface staining of desmoglein 1, but not that of desmoglein 3, was abolished when cryosections of normal human skin were incubated with exfoliative toxin B, suggesting that living cells were not necessary for exfoliative toxin B cleavage of desmoglein 1. Finally, in vitro incubation of the recombinant extracellular domains of desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 with exfoliative toxin B demonstrated that both mouse and human desmoglein 1, but not desmoglein 3, were directly cleaved by exfoliative toxin B in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings demonstrate that exfoliative toxin A and exfoliative toxin B cause blister formation in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and bullous impetigo by identical molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms.","['Amagai M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Hanakawa Y', 'Nishifuji K', 'Sugai M', 'Stanley JR']",2002,118,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Amagai M, et al.

11980459,Skin and soft tissue infection.,"Abstract. Normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. The most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). Skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. This article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. Impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by S. aureus and / or Group A streptoccus. In mild and localized impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin should be used. Folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by S. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. These conditions can be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by S. aureus of phase group II. Intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. Erysipelas and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or S. aureus requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. Gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.","['Sharma S', 'Verma KK']",2001,68 Suppl 3,,Indian J Pediatr,Sharma S and Verma KK.

11951129,The use of diphenylcyclopropenone in the treatment of recalcitrant warts.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of recalcitrant palmoplantar and periungual warts using topical immunotherapy with diphenylcyclopropenone (DPC) was reviewed retrospectively over a seven-year period.
METHODS: Two hundred eleven patients were sensitized during this time. The patients consisted of 90 males and 121 females and were between 5 and 78 years old. Twenty-three patients were lost to followup. Of the remaining, 4 were undergoing treatment at the time of evaluation, 1 patient failed sensitization, and 1 patient became pregnant. Four discontinued because of side effects, 3 because of financial reasons, and 18 patients discontinued treatment prior to completing the minimum required applications (defined as 6), producing a dropout rate of 12% (25/211). Three patients had additional treatment during the course of DPC and were not included in the study. The remaining 154 patients were classified as nonresponders or responders.
RESULTS: The responders consisted of 135 individuals (87.7%) that had complete clearance of warts. Reported adverse effects were local and included with pruritus (15.6%), with blistering (7.1%), and with eczematous reactions (14.2%). The majority of the patients tolerated the treatment very well. One patient developed local impetigo. Patients had an average of 5 treatments over a 6-month period.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical immunotherapy using DPC is an effective treatment option for recalcitrant warts. It should be considered as first-line treatment for warts based on its high response rate, absence of scarring, and painless application.","['Upitis JA', 'Krol A']",2002,6,3,J Cutan Med Surg,Upitis JA and Krol A.

11929358,Dermatologic disorders of the athlete.,"The most common injuries afflicting the athlete affect the skin. The list of sports-related dermatoses is vast and includes infections, inflammatory conditions, traumatic entities, environmental encounters, and neoplasms. It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete. Knowledge of the treatment and prevention of various sports-related dermatoses results in prompt and appropriate care of the athlete. Infections probably cause the most disruption to individual and team activities. Herpes gladiatorum, tinea corporis gladiatorum, impetigo, and furunculosis are sometimes found in epidemic proportions in athletes. Vigilant surveillance and early treatment help teams avoid these epidemics. Fortunately, several recent studies suggest that pharmacotherapeutic prevention may be effective for some of these sports-related infections. Inflammatory cutaneous conditions may be banal or potentially life threatening as in the case of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Athletes who develop exercise-induced anaphylaxis may prevent outbreaks by avoiding food before exercise and extreme temperatures while they exercise. Almost all sports enthusiasts are at risk of developing traumatic entities such as nail dystrophies, calluses and blisters. Other more unusual traumatic skin conditions, such as talon noire, jogger's nipples and mogul's palm, occur in specific sports. Several techniques and special clothing exist to help prevent traumatic skin conditions in athletes. Almost all athletes, to some degree, interact with the environment. Winter sport athletes may develop frostbite and swimmers in both fresh and saltwater may develop swimmer's itch or seabather's eruption, respectively. Swimmers with fair skin and light hair may also present with unusual green hair that results from the deposition of copper within the hair. Finally, athletes are at risk of developing both benign and malignant neoplasms. Hockey players, surfers, boxers and football players can develop athlete's nodules. Outdoor sports enthusiasts are at greater risk of developing melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Athletes spend a great deal of time outdoors, typically during peak hours of ultraviolet exposure. The frequent use of sunscreens and protective clothing will decrease the athlete's sun exposure. It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete.

11924823,Skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.,"The skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. Skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. Environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. Resident gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium sp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. In order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. Bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. Epidermal infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. Dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. The pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. Moreover, S. aureus and S. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Bartonella sp., Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and Vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.","['Chiller K', 'Selkin BA', 'Murakawa GJ']",2001,6,3,J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc,"Chiller K, et al.

11895961,Influence of recombination and niche separation on the population genetic structure of the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The throat and skin of the human host are the principal reservoirs for the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. The emm locus encodes structurally heterogeneous surface fibrils that play numerous roles in virulence, depending on the strain. Isolates harboring the emm pattern A-C marker exhibit a strong tendency to cause throat infection, whereas emm pattern D strains are usually recovered from impetigo lesions; as a group, emm pattern E organisms fail to display obvious tissue tropisms. The peak incidence for streptococcal pharyngitis and impetigo varies with season and locale, leading to wide spatial and temporal distances between throat and skin strains. To assess any impact of niche separation on genetic variation, the extent of recombinational exchange between emm pattern A-C, D, and E subpopulations was evaluated. Analysis of nucleotide sequence data for internal portions of seven housekeeping loci from 212 isolates provides evidence of extensive recombination between strains belonging to different emm pattern subpopulations. Furthermore, no fixed nucleotide differences were found between emm pattern A-C and D strains. Thus, despite some niche separation created by distinct epidemiological trends and innate tissue tropisms there is little evidence for neutral gene divergence between throat and skin strains. Maintenance of a relationship between emm pattern and tissue tropism in the face of underlying recombination suggests that tissue tropism is associated with emm or a closely linked gene.","['Kalia A', 'Spratt BG', 'Enright MC', 'Bessen DE']",2002,70,4,Infect Immun,"Kalia A, et al.

11871479,Infections in the homeless.,"Homeless people in developed countries have specific problems predisposing them to infectious diseases. Respiratory infections and outbreaks of tuberculosis and other aerosol transmitted infections have been reported. Homeless intravenous drug users are at an increased risk of contracting HIV, and hepatitis B and C infections. Skin problems are the main reason the homeless seek medical attention, and these commonly include scabies, pediculosis, tinea infections, and impetigo. Many foot disorders are more prevalent in the homeless including ulcers, cellulitis, erysipelas, and gas gangrene. The louse transmitted bacteria Bartonella quintana has recently been found to cause clinical conditions in the homeless such as urban trench fever, bacillary angiomatosis, endocarditis, and chronic afebrile bacteraemia. Treatment of homeless people is complicated by financial constraints, self-neglect, and lack of adherence. Patients with serious and contagious illnesses should be hospitalised. Physicians should be aware of these specific issues to enhance care.","['Raoult D', 'Foucault C', 'Brouqui P']",2001,1,2,Lancet Infect Dis,"Raoult D, et al. Infections in the homeless.

11826464,"[Streptococcus group A infections of skin, soft tissue and blood].","BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus is one of the most common bacterial pathogens causing infections in tissue and organs, most frequently throat and skin. Since the late 1980s there have been reports from Scandinavia and many other countries documenting a resurgence of highly invasive infections such as puerperal fever, necrotizing fasciitis, myositis and sepsis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: On the basis of relevant studies and reviews and a clinical study of 61 patients between 1992 and 1999 with necrotizing fasciitis and myositis at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, we present an overview of the prevalence, pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of group A streptococcal infections in skin, soft tissue and blood.
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: The reason for the increase in severe group A streptococcal infections is unclear. The clinical features depend on the level of infection (superficial skin, subcutis, fascia and muscle): the deeper the initial infection, the more frequent development of bacteraemia and life-threatening disease. Serious infections are associated with shock and multiorgan failure, i.e. streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Early surgical debridement is essential in necrotizing fasciitis and myositis. Penicillin is still the drug of choice for milder infections. The addition of clindamycin is recommended in cases of more invasive infection.","['Chelsom J', 'Halstensen A']",2001,121,28,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Chelsom J and Halstensen A.

11809642,Fusidic acid cream in the treatment of impetigo in general practice: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that fusidic acid would not increase the treatment effect of disinfecting with povidone-iodine alone in children with impetigo.
DESIGN: Randomised placebo controlled trial.
SETTING: General practices in Greater Rotterdam.
PARTICIPANTS: 184 children aged 0-12 years with impetigo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical cure and bacterial cure after one week.
RESULTS: After one week of treatment 55% of the patients in the fusidic acid group were clinically cured compared with 13% in the placebo group (odds ratio 12.6, 95% confidence interval 5.0 to 31.5, number needed to treat 2.3). After two weeks and four weeks the differences in cure rates between the two groups had become smaller. More children in the placebo group were non-compliant (12 v 5) and received extra antibiotic treatment (11 v 3), and more children in the placebo group reported adverse effects (19 v 7). Staphylococcus aureus was found in 96% of the positive cultures; no strains were resistant to fusidic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: Fusidic acid is much more effective than placebo (when both are given in combination with povidone-iodine shampoo) in the treatment of impetigo. Because of the low rate of cure and high rate of adverse events in the placebo group, the value of povidone-iodine in impetigo can be questioned.","['Koning S', 'van Suijlekom-Smit LW', 'Nouwen JL', 'Verduin CM', 'Bernsen RM', 'Oranje AP', 'Thomas S', 'van der Wouden JC']",2002,324,7331,BMJ,"Koning S, et al.

11796592,"Relationships between Staphylococcus aureus genetic background, virulence factors, agr groups (alleles), and human disease.","The expression of most Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors is controlled by the agr locus, which encodes a two-component signaling pathway whose activating ligand is an agr-encoded autoinducing peptide (AIP). A polymorphism in the amino acid sequence of the AIP and of its corresponding receptor divides S. aureus strains into four major groups. Within a given group, each strain produces a peptide that can activate the agr response in the other member strains, whereas the AIPs belonging to different groups are usually mutually inhibitory. We investigated a possible relationship between agr groups and human S. aureus disease by studying 198 S. aureus strains isolated from 14 asymptomatic carriers, 66 patients with suppurative infection, and 114 patients with acute toxemia. The agr group and the distribution of 24 toxin genes were analyzed by PCR, and the genetic background was determined by means of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. The isolates were relatively evenly distributed among the four agrgroups, with 61 strains belonging to agr group I, 49 belonging to group II, 43 belonging to group III, and 45 belonging to group IV. Principal coordinate analysis performed on the AFLP distance matrix divided the 198 strains into three main phylogenetic groups, AF1 corresponding to strains of agr group IV, AF2 corresponding to strains of agr groups I and II, and AF3 corresponding to strains of agr group III. This indicated that the agr type was linked to the genetic background. A relationship between genetic background, agr group, and disease type was observed for several toxin-mediated diseases: for instance, agr group IV strains were associated with generalized exfoliative syndromes, and phylogenetic group AF1 strains with bullous impetigo. Among the suppurative infections, endocarditis strains mainly belonged to phylogenetic group AF2 and agr groups I and II. While these results do not show a direct role of the agr type in the type of human disease caused by S. aureus, the agr group may reflect an ancient evolutionary division of S. aureus in terms of this species' fundamental biology.","['Jarraud S', 'Mougel C', 'Thioulouse J', 'Lina G', 'Meugnier H', 'Forey F', 'Nesme X', 'Etienne J', 'Vandenesch F']",2002,70,2,Infect Immun,"Jarraud S, et al.

11776706,[Current problems posed by staphylococcal infections in pediatric patients].,"A PEDIATRIC PATHOGEN: Staphylococci remain one of the most important pathogenic agents leading to community-acquired infection in children. Over the last decades, there has been an evolution in the localizations of these infections: dramatic pleuropulmonary staphylococcal infection in newborns has almost entirely disappeared in developed countries. Conversely, skin infections and soft tissue infections as well as bone and joint localizations are frequent. The severity of these bone and joint infections has however declined allowing less aggressive therapeutic regimens. One of the current problems is the risk of emergence of meticillin-resistant strains causing community-acquired infections. Such infections have been very rare in France but careful monitoring is nevertheless necessary. NOSOCOMIAL INFECTION: Staphylococci are however the leading cause of nosocomial infections in children, particularly in intensive care units. All localizations are concerned, especially catheter-related septicemia and pneumonia. There has been an increasing trend for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci infections. Most of the strains isolated are meticillin-resistant. TOXINS: Staphylococcus aureus secretes toxins leading to specific diseases: enterotoxins cause food-poisoning and exofoliatines cause generalized exfoliation and bullous impetigo. Staphylococcal scarlatina is related to the shock provoked by staphylococcal toxins: TSST-1 and entrotoxins. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is a relatively new entity more frequently observed in adults but which was initially described in children. The disease may develop during any staphylococcal infection, particularly after superinfection of a skin burn or varicella. MECHANISM OF ACTION OF TOXINS: Staphylococcal toxins act like superantigens, capable of provoking polyclonal activation of a large number of T cells. This leads to the release of an important quantity of cytokines that intervene in the pathogenesis of toxic diseases. This polyclonal activation has been observed in other pediatric diseases of unknown origin but in which the involvement of staphylococcal toxins can be suspected. There is solid evidence in favor of staphylococcal toxins in Kawasaki syndrome. Likewise, these toxins could be implicated in sudden death syndrome in infants and in acute exacerbations of atopic exzema.","['Floret D', 'Gillet Y', 'Lina G']",2001,30,37,Presse Med,"Floret D, et al.

11727576,Children of imprisoned mothers.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the problems faced by children during separation from their imprisoned mothers, and evaluate the health of children who accompanied their mothers into prison.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Welikada Prison, Colombo, Sri Lanka.
METHODS: 200 randomly selected mothers who had left their children at home were interviewed using a questionnaire. During a period of 8 months 30 children living with their mothers in prison underwent physical and developmental examination and tuberculin testing. The living conditions within the prison were evaluated.
RESULTS: During 18 months from January 1999, 4089 women were imprisoned. 88% were remanded, 20% awaited trial for more than one year in prison. 2416 were mothers. 1411 had at least one child under 12 years of age. The 200 mothers interviewed had 262 children under 12 years at home. Their care arrangements were: a relative (69%), father (16%), older sibling (4%), religious organisation (2.7%), neighbour (1.3%). None had received social services support. 70 children accompanied mothers into prison. In the 30 children followed up regularly 23% had scabies, 10% pediculosis, and 7% impetigo. No severe malnutrition was found and screening for tuberculosis was negative. 70% were breastfed. The child-friendly dormitory was inadequate to accommodate all children.
CONCLUSION: Care arrangements and schooling were affected and no counselling services were provided during the imprisoned mothers' absence. The children within the prison enjoyed close bonds with the mothers and their physical needs were met. The child's best interest had not always been considered by court when deciding on custody during the mothers' imprisonment.","['Senanayake MP', 'Arachchi JK', 'Wickremasinghe VP']",2001,46,2,Ceylon Med J,"Senanayake MP, et al.

11724844,Staphylococcus aureus isolated in cases of impetigo produces both epidermolysin A or B and LukE-LukD in 78% of 131 retrospective and prospective cases.,"Clinical symptoms of impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome may not only be expressed as the splitting of cell layers within the epidermis but are often accompanied by some localized inflammation. Toxin patterns of Staphylococcus aureus isolates originating from patients with impetigo and also from those with other primary and secondary skin infections in a retrospective isolate collection in France and a prospective isolate collection in French Guiana revealed a significant association (75% of the cases studied) of impetigo with production of at least one of the epidermolysins A and B and the bicomponent leucotoxin LukE-LukD (P < 0.001). However, most of the isolates were able to produce one of the nonubiquitous enterotoxins. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of genomic DNA hydrolyzed with SmaI showed a polymorphism of the two groups of isolates despite the fact that endemic clones were suspected in French Guiana and France. The combination of toxin patterns with PFGE fingerprinting may provide further discrimination among isolates defined in a given cluster or a given pulsotype and account for a specific virulence. The new association of toxins with a clinical syndrome may reveal principles of the pathological process.","['Gravet A', 'Couppié P', 'Meunier O', 'Clyti E', 'Moreau B', 'Pradinaud R', 'Monteil H', 'Prévost G']",2001,39,12,J Clin Microbiol,"Gravet A, et al.

11705060,A prevalence survey of skin diseases in Nigerian children.,"A prevalence survey of 5001 Nigerian children aged 0-12 years seen at the Urban Comprehensive Health Centre, Ile-Ife, Nigeria between July 1995 and June 1996 revealed that 492 children (9.8%) had dermatological conditions. Tinea (17.1%), scabies (16.5%) and impetigo (15.7%) were the most commonly observed childhood skin diseases and were followed by miliaria (9.8%), eczema (7.1%) and diaper dermatitis (7.0%) respectively. The major predisposing factor to acquiring either tinea infection or scabies or impetigo by any of the affected children was the low socioeconomic conditions of their parents. The high prevalence of eczema in the high social classes could be attributed to the early exposure of the children to artificial milk in infancy. It is hoped that aggressive health educational programmes and improvement of the socioeconomic status of the people will bring about a decline in the prevalence of childhood skin diseases in Nigeria.","['Odueko OM', 'Onayemi O', 'Oyedeji GA']",2001,10,2,Niger J Med,"Odueko OM, et al.

11702365,The antibacterial-corticosteroid combination. What is its role in atopic dermatitis?,"The role of Staphylococcus aureus and therefore the place of combined antistaphylococcal and corticosteroid therapy in atopic dermatitis remains uncertain. While overt secondary infections such as furunculosis and impetigo respond rapidly to antibacterials, there is conflicting evidence as to the effect of antistaphylococcal therapy in atopic dermatitis that is not overtly infected. It is unlikely that antibacterials contribute to the management of mild atopic dermatitis. In more severe cases higher densities of S. aureus colonization are present. Antibacterials, whether topical or systemic, in combination with topical corticosteroids, may produce a more rapid decrease in S. aureus colonization than topical corticosteroids alone. Evidence for an accompanying greater speed in clinical improvement of the dermatitis is, however, mostly lacking. Topical antibacterial-corticosteroid combinations can be useful when treating small areas of skin for a limited period of time but are accompanied by the risk of sensitization and the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria. Systemic antibacterials in combination with topical corticosteroid are more appropriate when larger areas are involved.",['Williams RE'],2000,1,4,Am J Clin Dermatol,Williams RE.

11582925,[Clinical aspects of streptococcal and staphylococcal toxinic diseases].,"Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce a lot of toxins, some of them responsible for specific diseases. Staphylococcal food poisoning is due to ingestion of enterotoxin containing food. Seven toxins have been isolated so far. Generalized exfoliative syndrome is related to exfoliatin. Young children are particularly affected. The disease consists in a cutaneous exfoliation usually limited with a favourable outcome. The mucus membranes are not involved. The nose or pharynx are the most usual portal of entry. Staphylococcus aureus is not grown from the bullae. Severe extensive forms have been observed particularly in neonates (Ritter's disease). Bullous impetigo is also due to exfoliatin. It consists in the presence of a restricted number of cloudy bullae, from which staphylococcus can be grown. It is a mild disease with a favourable outcome within a few days. Scarlet fever is related to the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins. The classic form of the disease is presently rare. This disease may be related to staphylococcus as a complication of arthritis, osteomyelitis or wound super-infection. Bacteremia is usual. Staphylococcal scarlet fever is not related to exfoliatin as previously believed, but to enterotoxins or TSST-1, so it seems to be an abortive form of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is defined as a multi organ failure syndrome with a rapid onset, fever, rash followed by desquamation, vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, conjunctivitis and strawberry tongue. The disease is related to an infection or colonisation with a toxin (TSST-1) producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterotoxins (mainly C) may be involved. The disease may occur in childhood, sometimes after superinfection of varicella. The mortality is low (5%) and mainly due to ARDS or cardiac problems. Erythrogenic toxins produced by Streptococcus pyogenes are involved in a streptococcal form of toxic shock syndrome with a quite similar presentation. In most cases however, a cutaneous or soft tissue infection is at the origin. Necrotizing fasciitis complicating varicella is a classic cause in children. Bacteremia is often observed. The mortality rate is as high as 60%. The streptococcal strains involved in north america use to produce the toxin erythrogenic A, the european cases seem to be more related to strains secreting the B toxin with a dysregulation of the mechanisms which control the secretion of the toxin. Staphylococcus strains producing the Panton and Valentine leucocidin are responsible for chronic or relapsing furonculosis and above all for a very severe necrotizing pneumonia observed in children and young adults presenting as an acute respiratory distress syndrome with leucopenia, hemoptysis and shock carrying a heavy mortality rate. Besides these specific diseases, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins may be involved in some syndromes of unknown origin, in which the intervention of superantigens seems very likely. Kawasaki syndrome is among them as strains producing staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins have been grown from patients with Kawasaki syndrome. In the same way, the intervention of toxins is suspected in the determination of sudden infant death syndrome and atopic eczema.",['Floret D'],2001,8 Suppl 4,,Arch Pediatr,Floret D.

Acute primary peritonitis due to S. pyogenes seems to be a rare clinical event. In order to stimulate physicians' attention to the issue, we decided to describe the case of a child with the primary peritonitis due to S. pyogenes.

11433095,Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome in a very low birth weight premature infant.,"Exfoliative skin diseases are rare in neonates. When caused by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, scalded-skin diseases such as staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), bullous impetigo, and staphylococcal scarlet fever may develop. These diseases might cause significant complications and mortality. SSSS is caused by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins A or B, which split the granular layer of the skin, induce proteolysis, and might exhibit superantigen activities, such as epidermolysis and lymphocyte mitogenicity. We describe a 1378-g premature male infant who was born at 29 weeks' gestation and developed SSSS on day 3 of life, with no clinical signs of neonatal sepsis. After cultures from the lesion and bloodstream were obtained, intravenous cloxacillin therapy was started. Infection control measures were implemented instantly and included isolation of the infected infant, personnel handwashing with hexachlorophene, and placement of exposed neonates into a cohort. The initial lesion expanded and additional lesions appeared, but 12 hours after initiation of antibacterial therapy, the lesions ceased to proliferate. Cultures from scalded-skin lesions grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the bloodstream culture was sterile. The lesions resolved completely within 6 days, and the infant's subsequent course was uneventful. No similar skin lesions were noticed in other infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. We discuss recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of neonatal SSSS, highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, and stress the need for new adjunctive therapies for this disease.","['Makhoul IR', 'Kassis I', 'Hashman N', 'Sujov P']",2001,108,1,Pediatrics,"Makhoul IR, et al.

11428095,[Emergence of drug-resistant gram-positive pathogenic bacteria].,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of soft tissue infection, e.g. impetigo, cellulitis, or wound infection, and causes osteomyelitis, arthritis, bacteremia with metastatic infection, and scalded skin and toxic shock syndromes. Coagulase-negative staphylococci have become increasingly important causes of nosocomial bacteremia associated with invasive monitoring, intravascular catheters and prosthetic heart valves or joints. Most staphylococci produce blactamase and are resistant to penicillin. An increasing proportion of S. aureus have intrinsic resistance to methicillin (MRSA) and present major problems in hospitals for the control of cross infection. The glycopeptides, teicoplanin and vancomycin, are the antibiotics of first choice for treatment of these infections. After the first report describing a Japanese clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), several papers have documented the emergence of these microorganisms. Since the development and spreading of this phenomenon which is perceived as a fearsome threat to the already difficult therapy of nosocomial infections due to the prevalence of heterogeneous vancomycin resistance, we found the incidence of MRSA exceeds 35% in our hospital. Out of 179 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolated during 1997-1998, two strains (1.1%) gave subclones with vancomycin MICs of 8 mg/L. PFGE showed identical restriction patterns for both isolates, suggesting transfer of a single clone between two different patients.","['Marchese A', 'Schito GC', 'Debbia EA']",2000,12 Suppl 2,,J Chemother,"Marchese A, et al.

11369903,Skin diseases in children with organ transplants.,"BACKGROUND: Skin diseases are frequent in organ transplant recipients, but studies concerning children are sparse.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed skin diseases in children who had received organ transplants.
METHODS: A total of 145 children referred to our dermatologic consultation were studied.
RESULTS: Steroid-induced striae distensae and acne occurred only in adolescents; severe cyclosporine-related side effects were more frequent in younger children. The most common findings were warts (53.8%), tinea versicolor (14.5%), herpes simplex/zoster (9.6%), molluscum contagiosum (6.9%), and impetigo contagiosum and folliculitis (6.2%). Other notable disorders included a diffuse hyperpigmentation with a ""dirty"" appearance of the skin, pyogenic granulomas, melanocytic nevi proliferation, and skin tags. Two of 20 further adult patients who received transplants during childhood had squamous cell carcinomas.
CONCLUSION: Children who have received organ transplants frequently present side effects of immunosuppressive drugs and infectious diseases. Most disorders are related to the age of the patients rather than to the length of immunosuppression, whereas others are favored by the reinforcement of immunosuppression. Skin cancers were not encountered, but the risk of carcinomas in early adulthood should be considered.","['Euvrard S', 'Kanitakis J', 'Cochat P', 'Cambazard F', 'Claudy A']",2001,44,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Euvrard S, et al.

11297959,Zinc supplementation during pregnancy and effects on growth and morbidity in low birthweight infants: a randomised placebo controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Infant malnutrition and mortality rates are high in less-developed countries especially in low-birthweight infants. Zinc deficiency is also widely prevalent in these circumstances. We aimed to assess the effect of daily zinc supplements given to pregnant mothers on their infants' growth and morbidity.
METHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial in 199 and 221 Bangladeshi infants whose mothers took 30 mg daily elemental zinc or placebo, respectively, from 12 to 16 weeks' gestation until delivery. Infants were followed up until 6 months of age. We obtained data for morbidity every week by mothers' recall. Infants' anthropometric measurements were done every month, and their serum zinc was assessed at 1 and 6 months of age.
FINDINGS: Infants of mothers who received zinc during pregnancy had at age 6 months reduced risks compared with those in the placebo group for acute diarrhoea (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.72-0.98), dysentery (0.36; 0.25-0.84), and impetigo (0.53; 0.34-0.82). These reductions were seen in low-birthweight infants but not in those with normal birthweight. There were no differences in infant growth or serum zinc concentrations between treatment groups.
INTERPRETATION: Maternal zinc supplementation during pregnancy resulted in a reduction of the health risks in Bangladeshi low-birthweight infants, although this intervention did not improve birthweight. Whether zinc should be added to usual antenatal supplements in regions with high rates of low birthweight should be reviewed.","['Osendarp SJ', 'van Raaij JM', 'Darmstadt GL', 'Baqui AH', 'Hautvast JG', 'Fuchs GJ']",2001,357,9262,Lancet,"Osendarp SJ, et al.

11234487,[Prevalence of cutaneous lesions in Freixo de Espada à Cinta].,"Incidence or prevalence studies on cutaneous lesions in general populations are not available. The community observed by the authors (Freixo de Espada à Cinta, North-Eastern Portugal) is relatively closed. A pre-tested questionnaire for socio-demographic and clinical information was used and a physical observation was conducted in January and February 1994 by the Dermatology Team of Santo António General Hospital, Oporto. The analysis was supported by independent tests (Pearson and Fisher chi 2, Student-t, Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis). The Spearman correlation coefficient was also used. The results indicated that 51.9% of 1000 subjects analysed were in phototype III. Concerning specific pathologies, the following percentages were observed: melanocytic nevi 81.2; hemangiomas 26.5; androgenetic alopecia 20.5; deshydrotic eczema 12.7; seborrheic keratosis 11; solar keratosis 9.6; acne vulgaris 9.5; seborrheic dermatitis 6.9; superficial mycosis 6.4; other dermatitis 5.5; vascular spiders 4.4; vulgar psoriasis 1.9; vulgar warts 1.5; pediculosis and scabiosis 1.2.; herpes simplex 0.9; impetigo 0.7; tumours (neoplasias) 0.7; dysplastic nevi 0.6; urticaria 0.3. More than nine nevi were counted in 50% of the subjects observed. A difference was observed (p < 0.05) concerning the presence of nevi, mycosis, hemangiomas, non-specific dermatitis, vascular spider and solar keratosis according to sex. The females had more nevi in number than males (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.03). According to age there was a difference concerning the presence of nevi, superficial mycosis, deshydrotic eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, tumours, hemangiomas, non-specific dermatitis, vascular spider, solar keratosis (with linear augmentation by age) and seborrheic keratosis. Nevi increased with ageing (Rs = 0.10 p < 0.001) and a greater number were observed in age groups 0-9 and 60 or more years. Acne was observed in 9.4% of the females and 9.7% of the males, 46.2% in the 15-29 year-old age group. This study indicated that the population had a mean of nine nevi. Psoriasis was similar to that mentioned in other studies: about 1% in the United States of America. Atopic dermatitis (5.5%) is below the values for the northern population (> = 15%), but above that indicated for the English and American population. Nevertheless, the values of the present study were higher than those in the latter populations, when children until seven years old were considered. The Freixo de Espada à Cinta population above 60 years had solar keratosis in 30.6%, a value three times higher than the previous decade (10.9%); reference values were not found. Contrary to the literature, an association was not established between phototype and solar keratosis.

11168313,Skin infections in renal transplant recipients.,"BACKGROUND: Skin infection is a frequent complication in renal transplant recipients. The purpose of the study was to acquire long-term, period-specific incidence data on the most commonly occurring skin infections in renal transplant recipients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using medical records of 134 patients, covering a period between 10 and 29 yr. Cumulative incidences of the skin infections were calculated by counting the infections per patient for different time periods and were expressed as a percentage of the total group of patients. The incidence of the skin infections was determined for different post-transplant time periods.
RESULTS: A total of 340 skin infections in 105 out of 134 patients were recorded. Some infections, such as candidal infection, herpes simplex infection, and impetigo were most prominent during the first post-transplant year and did not affect many new patients after the first year. Other infections, such as dermatomycoses, herpes zoster, and folliculitis were also affecting a substantial number of new patients after the first post-transplant year.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that skin infections among renal transplant recipients are very common and that the spectrum of skin infections differs according to the post-transplant time period.","['Hogewoning AA', 'Goettsch W', 'van Loveren H', 'de Fijter JW', 'Vermeer BJ', 'Bouwes Bavinck JN']",2001,15,1,Clin Transplant,"Hogewoning AA, et al.

11154025,Evolution of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive pathogens.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of soft tissue infection, e.g. impetigo, cellulitis, or wound infection, and causes osteomyelitis, arthritis, bacteremia with metastatic infection, and scalded skin and toxic shock syndromes. Coagulase-negative staphylococci have become increasingly important causes of nosocomial bacteremia associated with invasive monitoring, intravascular catheters and prosthetic heart valves or joints. Most staphylococci produce b-lactamase and are resistant to penicillin. An increasing proportion of S. aureus have intrinsic resistance to methicillin (MRSA) and present major problems in hospitals for the control of cross infection. The glycopeptides, teicoplanin and vancomycin, are the antibiotics of first choice for treatment of these infections. After the first report describing a Japanese clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), several papers have documented the emergence of these microorganisms. Since the development and spreading of this phenomenon which is perceived as a fearsome threat to the already difficult therapy of nosocomial infections due to the prevalence of heterogeneous vancomycin resistance, we found the incidence of MRSA exceeds 35% in our hospital. Out of 179 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolated during 1997-1998, two strains (1.1%) gave subclones with vancomycin MICs of 8 mg/L. PFGE showed identical restriction patterns for both isolates, suggesting transfer of a single clone between two different patients.","['Marchese A', 'Schito GC', 'Debbia EA']",2000,12,6,J Chemother,"Marchese A, et al.

11109946,[Perianal streptococcal dermatitis].,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric perianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is a well-defined clinical entity. However, its highly uniform presentation remains surprisingly unrecognized by many practitioners 33 years after its first description.
CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old girl had a three-week history of perianal and vulva redness with well-defined margins. Functional symptoms associated perirectal tenderness and pain during defecation, which was responsible for constipation. At onset she also presented with a sore throat, which resolved spontaneously, and she had been complaining for a few days about a perioral impetigo. She received mycostatin unsuccessfully for an alleged candidiasis. Positive cultures for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci from both perirectal and perioral swabs confirmed the diagnosis of PSD. Therapy with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d) was prescribed for ten days. Perianal lesions were cleared by day 2.
CONCLUSION: Since PSD can masquerade as candidiasis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease or even sexual abuse, it remains an underdiagnosed entity. This situation leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment which in turn might increase the frequency of secondary complications related to streptococcal infections (i.e., post-streptococcal acute nephritis and rheumatism, guttate psoriasis, etc.).","['Souillet AL', 'Truchot F', 'Jullien D', 'Dumas V', 'Faure M', 'Floret D', 'Claudy A']",2000,7,11,Arch Pediatr,"Souillet AL, et al.

Haemoglobinopathies including sickle cell anaemia and talassaemia should also be kept in mind in anaemia. Immigrant children are admitted to hospital approximately twice as frequently as Danish children but with the same diagnoses apart from some increased frequency of psychological and behavioural disturbances and talassaemia.","['Pedersen FK', 'Møller NE']",2000,162,46,Ugeskr Laeger,Pedersen FK and Møller NE.

11098236,[Contagious impetigo--pathogen spectrum and therapeutic consequences].,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to compare the clinical picture of contagious impetigo (C.I.) with the causative organism and to generate data of the susceptibility of bacteria as the basis for adequate therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 126 patients with C.I. (86 children, 66 of them younger than 10 years) bacterial swabs were taken and antibiotic sensitivity testing for isolated organisms was tested.
RESULTS: In all cases in which contents of vesicles or pustules were analysed, Staphylococcus aureus was the only pathogen isolated. In non-bullous variants of C.I. Staphylococcus aureus was the most often isolated organism as well. Both staphylococci and streptococci were isolated in 12 cases, whereas in just 9 cases streptococci were the only pathogen detected. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were sensitive to flucloxacillin and cefotaxime. Erythromycin-resistance amounted to more than 20 percent. The percentage of resistant staphylococci against the predominantly topically applied antibiotics fusidinic acid and mupirocin was 2 and 0 per cent, respectively.
CONCLUSION: For all manifestations of C.I. Staphylococcus aureus is at present the leading organism which has to be taken into consideration for treatment. If oral antibiotic therapy is indicated, penicillinase-stable penicillins or cephalosporins, preferably of the cefalexin-type, are the drugs of choice. Macrolides are no longer recommended for initiating of C.I. treatment.","['Abeck D', 'Mempel M', 'Seidl HP', 'Schnopp C', 'Ring J', 'Heeg K']",2000,125,42,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Abeck D, et al.

Questionnaire information about the cases was collected from parents and general practitioners per telephone. Throat specimens were taken, before and after treatment, for culturing and specific typing of streptococci was performed to determine transmission. Within a period of one month, 21 schoolchildren in a class of 29 pupils, with a mean age of 5 years, presented with symptoms caused by streptococcal infection (attack rate: 72%). Eight had scarlet fever, 5 suffered from impetigo and 8 had pharyngitis. A further 6 children, outside of this class, had complaints of scarlet fever, impetigo or pharyngitis. For 90% (26/29) of the schoolchildren a throat culture was established. Twelve positive cultures of the same strain of beta-haemolytic group A streptococcus, T4M4 exotoxin C gene positive, were found. The advice given was to treat all positive children for 3 days with azithromycin to prevent complications and further spreading of the disease. After two weeks only one child, that had not taken the antibiotics, still had a positive throat culture. No further cases or complications were reported.
DISCUSSION: The pattern of the outbreak was typical of a person-to-person transmission. This was confirmed by typing of the isolates. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of mandatory notification of infectious clusters by institutions, such as schools, as introduced in the new Dutch Infectious Disease Act. On the one hand, the notification gives the municipal health authority the opportunity to analyse source and transmission dynamics and on the other to prevent disease and complications.","['Hoebe CJ', 'Wagenvoort JH', 'Schellekens JF']",2000,144,45,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Hoebe CJ, et al.

11069651,Role for a secreted cysteine proteinase in the establishment of host tissue tropism by group A streptococci.,"Primary infection of the human host by group A streptococci (GAS) most often involves either the epidermis of the skin or the oropharyngeal mucosa. A humanized in vivo model for impetigo was used to investigate the basis for host tissue tropism among GAS. Disruption of the speB gene (encoding for a secreted cysteine proteinase) led to a loss of virulence for two impetigo-derived strains (M-types 33 and 53), as evidenced by a diminution in tissue damage and a lack of reproductive growth. The level of cysteine proteinase activity in overnight cultures was associated with the extent of gross pathological changes induced by strains displaying varied degrees of virulence in the impetigo model. Moreover, high levels of secreted cysteine proteinase activity correlated with a genetic marker for preferred tissue site of infection at the skin (emm pattern D). The addition of exogenous SpeB to a speB mutant (emm pattern D) or to an avirulent throat-like strain (emm pattern A) led to increased bacterial reproduction at the skin. The data provide both experimental and epidemiological evidence for a critical role of a secreted bacterial protease in promoting host tissue-specific infection.","['Svensson MD', 'Scaramuzzino DA', 'Sjöbring U', 'Olsén A', 'Frank C', 'Bessen DE']",2000,38,2,Mol Microbiol,"Svensson MD, et al.

The toxin shows exquisite specificity in causing loss of cell adhesion only in the superficial epidermis. Although exfoliative toxin A has the structure of a serine protease, a target protein has not been identified. Desmoglein (Dsg) 1, a desmosomal cadherin that mediates cell-cell adhesion, may be the target of exfoliative toxin A, because it is the target of autoantibodies in pemphigus foliaceus, in which blisters form with identical tissue specificity and histology. We show here that exfoliative toxin A cleaved mouse and human Dsg1, but not closely related cadherins such as Dsg3. We demonstrate this specific cleavage in cell culture, in neonatal mouse skin and with recombinant Dsg1, and conclude that Dsg1 is the specific receptor for exfoliative toxin A cleavage. This unique proteolytic attack on the desmosome causes a blister just below the stratum corneum, which forms the epidermal barrier, presumably allowing the bacteria in bullous impetigo to proliferate and spread beneath this barrier.","['Amagai M', 'Matsuyoshi N', 'Wang ZH', 'Andl C', 'Stanley JR']",2000,6,11,Nat Med,"Amagai M, et al.

10979907,Contrasting molecular epidemiology of group A streptococci causing tropical and nontropical infections of the skin and throat.,"Disease caused by group A streptococci (GAS) in tropical regions often takes the form of impetigo, whereas pharyngitis tends to predominate in temperate zones. GAS derived from asymptomatic throat infections and pyoderma lesions of rural Aboriginal Australians were evaluated for phylogenetic distant emm genes, which represent ecological markers for tissue site preference. On the basis of the percentage of total isolates from a given tissue, emm pattern A-C organisms exhibited a stronger predilection for the throat, whereas pattern D organisms preferred the skin. Only 16% of isolates collected by active surveillance displayed pattern A-C, which reflects the low incidence of oropharyngeal infection. Importantly, most (70%) pattern A-C organisms were isolated from skin sores, despite their innate tendency to infect the throat. Combined with findings from nontropical populations, analysis of the data supports the hypothesis that GAS tissue preferences are genetically predetermined and that host risk factors for infection strongly influence the differential reproduction of individual clones.","['Bessen DE', 'Carapetis JR', 'Beall B', 'Katz R', 'Hibble M', 'Currie BJ', 'Collingridge T', 'Izzo MW', 'Scaramuzzino DA', 'Sriprakash KS']",2000,182,4,J Infect Dis,"Bessen DE, et al.

10885988,Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.,"Group A streptococci are model extracellular gram-positive pathogens responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. A resurgence of invasive streptococcal diseases and rheumatic fever has appeared in outbreaks over the past 10 years, with a predominant M1 serotype as well as others identified with the outbreaks. emm (M protein) gene sequencing has changed serotyping, and new virulence genes and new virulence regulatory networks have been defined. The emm gene superfamily has expanded to include antiphagocytic molecules and immunoglobulin-binding proteins with common structural features. At least nine superantigens have been characterized, all of which may contribute to toxic streptococcal syndrome. An emerging theme is the dichotomy between skin and throat strains in their epidemiology and genetic makeup. Eleven adhesins have been reported, and surface plasmin-binding proteins have been defined. The strong resistance of the group A streptococcus to phagocytosis is related to factor H and fibrinogen binding by M protein and to disarming complement component C5a by the C5a peptidase. Molecular mimicry appears to play a role in autoimmune mechanisms involved in rheumatic fever, while nephritis strain-associated proteins may lead to immune-mediated acute glomerulonephritis. Vaccine strategies have focused on recombinant M protein and C5a peptidase vaccines, and mucosal vaccine delivery systems are under investigation.",['Cunningham MW'],2000,13,3,Clin Microbiol Rev,Cunningham MW.

10874222,Necrotizing soft-tissue infections.,"Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen, or perineum. Necrotizing fasciitis typically begins with trauma; however, the inciting event may be as seemingly innocuous as a simple contusion, minor burn, or insect bite. Differentiating necrotizing infections from common soft-tissue infections, such as cellulitis and impetigo, is both challenging and critically important. A high degree of suspicion may be the most important aid in early diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis is imperative because necrotizing infections typically spread rapidly and can result in multiple-organ failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Although group A Streptococcus is the most common bacterial isolate, a polymicrobial infection with a variety of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria is more common. Orthopaedic surgeons are often the first physicians to evaluate patients with such infections and therefore need to be familiar with this potentially devastating disease and its management. Prompt diagnosis, immediate administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and emergent aggressive surgical debridement of all compromised tissues are critical to reduce the morbidity and mortality of these rapidly progressing infections.","['Fontes RA', 'Ogilvie CM', 'Miclau T']",2000,8,3,J Am Acad Orthop Surg,"Fontes RA, et al.

10816151,Treatment of cutaneous larva migrans.,"Cutaneous larva migrans caused by the larvae of animal hookworms is the most frequent skin disease among travelers returning from tropical countries. Complications (impetigo and allergic reactions), together with the intense pruritus and the significant duration of the disease, make treatment mandatory. Freezing the leading edge of the skin track rarely works. Topical treatment of the affected area with 10%-15% thiabendazole solution or ointment has limited value for multiple lesions and hookworm folliculitis, and requires applications 3 times a day for at least 15 days. Oral thiabendazole is poorly effective when given as a single dose (cure rate, 68%-84%) and is less well tolerated than either albendazole or ivermectin. Treatment with a single 400-mg oral dose of albendazole gives cure rates of 46%-100%; a single 12-mg oral dose of ivermectin gives cure rates of 81%-100%.",['Caumes E'],2000,30,5,Clin Infect Dis,Caumes E.

10768985,Humanized in vivo model for streptococcal impetigo.,"An in vivo model for group A streptococcal (GAS) impetigo was developed, whereby human neonatal foreskin engrafted onto SCID mice was superficially damaged and bacteria were topically applied. Severe infection, indicated by a purulent exudate, could be induced with as few as 1,000 CFU of a virulent strain. Early findings (48 h) showed a loss of stratum corneum and adherence of short chains of gram-positive cocci to the external surface of granular keratinocytes. This was followed by an increasing infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) of mouse origin, until a thick layer of pus covered an intact epidermis, with massive clumps of cocci accumulated at the outer rim of the pus layer. By 7 days postinoculation, the epidermis was heavily eroded; in some instances, the dermis contained pockets (ulcers) filled with cocci, similar to that observed for ecthyma. Importantly, virulent GAS underwent reproduction, resulting in a net increase in CFU of 20- to 14,000-fold. The majority of emm pattern D strains had a higher gross pathology score than emm pattern A, B, or C (A-C) strains, consistent with epidemiological findings that pattern D strains have a strong tendency to cause impetigo, whereas pattern A-C strains are more likely to cause pharyngitis.","['Scaramuzzino DA', 'McNiff JM', 'Bessen DE']",2000,68,5,Infect Immun,"Scaramuzzino DA, et al.

A total of ninety-seven S. aureus strains was found in the 26 families whose lesions and nasal and pharyngeal samples were examined. There were 39 strains which were different by PFGE, and of these, 24 were found in the lesions. Although 85% of impetigo patients showed nasal colonization and 58% showed pharyngeal colonization, only 54% of the patients had the same PFGE strain in the lesion and in the nose, and 35% in the lesion and the pharynx. In half of the 26 families, at least one member (mother, father, or relative) presented a S. aureus strain identical, by PFGE, to strains isolated in patients' lesions. Nineteen percent of mothers, 15% of fathers, and 19% of the other relatives presented nasal colonization with strains identical to those isolated in the children's lesions.

10699034,Epidemiological analysis of non-M-typeable group A Streptococcus isolates from a Thai population in northern Thailand.,"Infection with group A streptococci (GAS) can lead to the development of severe postinfectious sequelae such as rheumatic fever (RF). In Thailand, RF and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remain important health problems. More than 80% of GAS circulating in this population are non-M antigen typeable by conventional M serotyping methods. In this study, we determine the M protein sequence types of GAS isolates found in northern Thailand. The emm genes from 53 GAS isolates, collected between 1985 and 1995 from individuals with pharyngitis, impetigo, acute RF (ARF), RHD, or meningitis as well as from individuals without infections, were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Thirteen new sequence types that did not show homology to previously published sequences were characterized. Six of these sequence types could be isolated from both skin and throat sites of impetigo and pharyngitis/ARF patients, respectively. In many cases we could not specifically differentiate skin strains or throat strains that could be associated with ARF or acute glomerulonephritis. Antigenic variations in the emm gene of the isolates investigated, compared to published M protein sequences, were predominantly due to point mutations, small deletions, and insertions in the hypervariable region. One group of isolates with homology to M44 exhibited corrected frameshift mutations. A new M type isolated from an RHD patient exhibited nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N terminus of M58 and the C terminus of M25, suggesting that recombination between the two types may have occurred. This study provided epidemiological data relating to GAS endemic to northern Thailand which could be useful for identification of vaccine candidates in a specific region of endemicity.","['Pruksakorn S', 'Sittisombut N', 'Phornphutkul C', 'Pruksachatkunakorn C', 'Good MF', 'Brandt E']",2000,38,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Pruksakorn S, et al.

Normal babies are delivered and very few cases of associated neonatal hyperparathyroidism are reported.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a baby born to a mother suffering unknown hypoparathyroidism. He was delivered prematurely by cesarean section for birth asphyxia. His mother had had recurrent bouts of impetigo herpetiformis for several months. Severe demineralization associated with decreased plasma calcium level were observed at birth. The PTH level was very high (955 ng/mL) in the baby and very low in the mother, leading to the diagnosis. The baby was given intravenous calcium gluconate, oral 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D and mechanical ventilation. Normal plasma calcium level was reached on day 2. PTH level improved by one month of age. Because of impaired respiratory mechanics and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the baby was kept on ventilation for 58 days. By 20 months of age, he was in good health despite a small height for his age.
CONCLUSION: In such cases 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D seems to be very effective but plasma and urinary calcium levels need careful monitoring.","['Daoud P', 'Mirc M', 'Tarazourte MF', 'Pollak M', 'Rousset A', 'Castaing H']",2000,7,1,Arch Pediatr,"Daoud P, et al.

Blistering may occur as a secondary event associated with viral or bacterial infections of the skin, eg, herpes simplex and impetigo, or with local injury of the skin, eg, burns, ischemia, and dermatitis. In other diseases, blistering of the skin occurs as a primary event and is associated with tissue injury and fluid accumulation within a specific layer of the skin: intraepidermal, dermal-epidermal junction, or subepidermal. Blister formation in this latter group of diseases is due to either genetic mutation or an autoimmune response. Genodermatoses associated with blisters are typically manifested in the neonate, whereas the autoimmune blistering disorders are acquired and usually expressed later in life. Recent advances have uncovered the relevance of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton, the desmosome, the hemidesmosome, and extracellular matrix proteins in blister formation.

10518396,[Reactivation of herpes zoster infection by varicella-zoster virus].,"HISTORY: There has been considerable interest in varicella-zoster virus in the middle of the twentieth century. Virus isolation in 1958 had made it possible to find out the complete DNA sequence of the varicella-zoster virus. Molecular identify of the causative agents of varicella and shingles had been proved. ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND HISTOPATHOLOGY: Varicella-zoster virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family. After primary infection which results in varicella, the virus becomes latent in the cerebral or posterior root ganglia. Some of these individuals develop shingles after several decades because of virus reactivation. It is caused by decline of cellular immune response. Circumstances such as old age, hard work, using of steroids or malignancies contribute to the appearance of shingles. Histopathological findings include degenerative changes of epithelial cells such as ballooning, multinucleated giant cells and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions.
EPIDEMIOLOGY: Shingles occur sporadically, mainly among the elderly who have had varicella. There is no seasonal appearance of shingles. Individuals suffering from shingles may be sometimes contagious for susceptible children because of enormous amount of virus particles in vesicle fluid.
CLINICAL FEATURES: Clinically, shingles is characterized at first by pain or discomfort in involved dermatome, usually without constitutional symptoms. Local edema and erythema appear before developing of rash. Maculopapular and vesicular rash evolves into crusts. The most commonly involved ganglia are: lumbar, thoracic, sacral posterior root ganglia, then geniculate ganglion of the VIIth cranial nerve and the trigeminal ganglion. The most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia, may last for as long as two or three weeks, sometimes even one year or more. Other complications that may be seen in shingles, but more rarely, are ocular (keratitis, iridocyclitis, secondary glaucoma, loss of sight), neurological (various motor neuropathies, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome), secondary bacterial infection of vesicles. Immunocompromised patients often develop more severe disease lasting up to two weeks, skin lesions are more numerous and often with hemorrhagic base and there is a high possibility for cutaneous dissemination and visceral involvement including viral pneumonia, encephalitis and hepatitis. Chronic shingles may also be found in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in those with a diagnosis of HIV infection. In patients with HIV infection, shingles is often characterised by radicular pain and itching several days before appearance of skin lesions. Those patients may have two or more dermatomes involved and recurrences of shingles cannot be quite infrequent in those patients. But visceral involvement is rarer than in other immunocompromised patients. Shingles may occur in the second half of pregnancy and usually have a mild course. However, congenital abnormalities has been described in few cases.
DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of shingles is usually made by history and physical examination. Exceptionally, for example in zoster sine herpete and atypical forms of shingles, virus isolation and serological tests must be used.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Some other diseases may cause similar skin lesions and rash (varicella, erysipelas, impetigo, enteroviral infections, herpes simplex infections). These diseases are excluded by using detailed history taking and physical examination, laboratory findings, virus isolation and commercially available serological tests.
THERAPY: The vast majority of immunocompetent persons with shingles should be treated only by symptomatic therapy. Predominantly it is directed toward reduction of fever and avoiding secondary bacterial skin infection in immunocompetent hosts. Acute neuritis and post-herpetic neuralgia require administration of various analgesics, even like amitriptyline hydrochloride and fluphenazine hydrochloride. Acyclovir therapy is limited to ophthal","['Cvjetković D', 'Jovanović J', 'Hrnjaković-Cvjetković I', 'Brkić S', 'Bogdanović M']",1999,52,3-5,Med Pregl,"Cvjetković D, et al.

Streptococcus pyogenes binds preferentially to highly differentiated keratinocytes in vitro, simulating the superficial human skin infection, impetigo, and providing a model system for testing this hypothesis. Exposure of keratinocytes to 10 ng/mL TNF-alpha for 20 h decreased adherence to undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes by 33% and 38%, respectively. Treatment with 1 ng/mL IL-1alpha decreased adherence to undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes by 23% and 18%, respectively. Exposure to both cytokines simultaneously produced an additive 50% reduction in adherence. These data suggest that TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha may play a role in cutaneous host defense by impeding streptococcal adherence and decreasing its ability to form a nidus of infection in the skin.","['Darmstadt GL', 'Fleckman P', 'Rubens CE']",1999,180,5,J Infect Dis,"Darmstadt GL, et al.

10461035,Anticardiolipin antibodies in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and streptococcal impetigo.,"Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies have been described in diverse clinical situations, linked to the risk of thrombosis in different vascular locations. They have been rarely studied in renal diseases, and occasionally they have been associated with glomerular thrombosis. We analyzed the incidence of aCL (isotypes IgG, IgA, and IgM) in samples, taken during the acute phase of the disease, from 27 well-documented patients having acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Twelve cases were positive on IgG testing, 1 case on IgA testing only, and no one was positive on IgM testing. A serological follow-up was performed with a second sample taken about 7 months later, for the patients initially positive on IgG testing showing persistence in 9. Clinical variables during the acute phase and after a follow-up period of 25 (range 6-89) months were analyzed for possible associations with the presence of these antibodies, but non was significantly related. Renal histopathological investigation did not reveal particular findings in the aCL-positive patients, and glomerular thrombosis was not found in any case. In addition, serum samples from 12 streptococcal impetigo patients without renal involvement were analyzed, showing similar incidence (4 positive on IgG testing, 1 of them positive on IgM testing as well, and no one positive on IgA testing) and titers of aCL antibodies. We conclude that the presence of aCL antibodies in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may be a marginal immunological phenomenon unrelated to the glomerular disease, triggered by the streptococcal infection.","['Ardiles L', 'Ramirez P', 'Moya P', 'Caorsi I', 'Mezzano S']",1999,83,1,Nephron,"Ardiles L, et al.

10417156,Selective distribution of a high-affinity plasminogen-binding site among group A streptococci associated with impetigo.,"Group A streptococci can be classified according to their tendency to cause either impetigo, pharyngitis, or both types of infection. Genotypic markers for tissue site preference lie within emm genes, which encode fibrillar surface proteins that play a key role in virulence. emm gene products (M and M-like proteins) display an extensive array of binding activities for tissue and plasma proteins of the human host. In a previous study, a high-affinity binding site for human plasmin(ogen) was mapped to the emm53 gene product. In this report, a structurally similar plasminogen-binding domain is found to be widely and selectively distributed among group A streptococci harboring the emm gene marker for the skin as the preferred tissue site for infection. The findings are highly suggestive of a central role for bacterial modulation of host plasmin(ogen) during localized infection at the epidermis.","['Svensson MD', 'Sjöbring U', 'Bessen DE']",1999,67,8,Infect Immun,"Svensson MD, et al.

20921649,Bacteriological study of pyoderma with special reference to antibiotic susceptibility to newer antibiotics.,"Five hundred and forty-two cases of pyoderma were investigated to study bacterial aetiology and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Of these 65.87% cases were of primary pyoderma and the rest were of secondary pyoderma. Maximum cases were of impetigo (38.78%) followed by folliculitis (12.92%), furunculosis (2.95%), ecthyma (3.5%), carbuncle (1.5%) and sycosis barbae (0.4%). Secondary pyoderma constituted infected trophic ulcer (18.82%), infected pemphigus (7.2%), infected contact dermatitis (6.27%), and infected scabies (1.8%). Single organism was isolated from 46.9% cases and more than one type of organisms in 65.46% of cases. No organism was isolated in 5% of cases. Staphylococcus (67.34%) was the predominant species isolated followed by beta-haemolytic streptococcus (21.77%). Maximum strains of Staph. aureus were susceptible to amikacin (75%), co-trimoxazole (72%), cefotaxime (65%), chloramphenicol (62%), ciprofloxacin (61%) and clindamycin (61%). There was low susceptibility to cephaloridin (11%), gentamicin (12%) and penicillin (21%). Streptococcus betahaemolyticus was highly sensitive to most of the antibiotics and less sensitive to cefotaxime (7%), co-trimoxazole (11%) and penicillin (27%).

10380429,Clinico-bacteriological study of pyodermas in children.,"One hundred cases of pyodermas in children were investigated clinically and bacteriologically. Nasal and throat swabs from all cases were subjected to bacteriological examination. Most of the children (42%) were in the 1-4 year age group. The majority (58%) belonged to lower socio-economic groups with poor standards of hygiene. A history of over-crowding was obtained from 87% of cases, 82% were undernourished. Most of the children (68%) reported during the hot and humid months of June, July, August, and September. Primary pyodermas were observed in 72% of the children, and secondary pyodermas in 28%. Impetigo was the commonest primary pyoderma (48.61%); among secondary pyodermas, infected scabies was noted predominantly (42.86%). The face and legs were more commonly involved. Bacteriological cultures from pyoderma lesions revealed a single microorganism in the majority of the patients (84%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in pure culture from 48% and pure beta-hemolytic streptococci from 36%. A combination of both was obtained from 16%. No other organism was isolated from any case. A similar pattern was also observed in cultures from the nose and throat. Only 46 out of the 64 strains (84.3%) of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pyoderma were typable. The majority (39.1%) showed a mixed pattern of phages; the second commonest was the non-allocated phage type (30.4%). Nasal flora had more of the non-allocated phage type (50%); two out of the three strains (66.6%) isolated from the throat showed a mixed pattern. All the strains of beta hemolytic streptococci, isolated either from lesions of pyoderma, nose, or throat belonged to group A. Staphylococcus aureus and showed a high sensitivity to netilmycin (100%), ofloxacin (98.4%), amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (96.9%), ciprofloxacin (89.1%) and gentamycin (84.4%) but a high resistance to penicillin (85.9%). A greater correlation was noted between nasal flora and organisms causing pyodermas. A change in the pattern of organisms causing pyodermas in children and their antibiotic sensitivities in this part of the globe has been observed in this study. The role of endogenous nasal and throat flora in the causation of pyodermas has also been highlighted.","['Kakar N', 'Kumar V', 'Mehta G', 'Sharma RC', 'Koranne RV']",1999,26,5,J Dermatol,"Kakar N, et al.

10216862,Serum opacity factor is a major fibronectin-binding protein and a virulence determinant of M type 2 Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Serum opacity factor (SOF) is a fibronectin-binding protein of group A streptococci that opacifies mammalian sera and is expressed by some strains that cause impetigo, pharyngitis and acute glomerulonephritis. Although SOF is expressed by approximately 35% of known serotypes, its role in the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections has not been previously investigated. The sof genes from M types 2, 28 and 49 Streptococcus pyogenes were cloned, sequenced, and their deduced amino acid sequences were compared. The gene for FnBA, a fibronectin-binding protein from Streptococcus dysgalactiae, was also cloned and found to express an opacity factor. The leader sequences, the fibronectin-binding domains, and the membrane anchor regions of these proteins were highly conserved. Short spans of conserved sequences were interspersed throughout the remaining parts of the proteins. The sof2 gene was insertionally inactivated in an M type 2 S. pyogenes strain, T2MR. The resultant SOF-negative mutant (YL3) did not express SOF or opacify serum, and exhibited a 71% reduction in binding fibronectin. Complementation of the SOF-negative defect with sof28 in the recombinant strain YL3(pNZ28) fully restored fibronectin-binding activity and the ability to opacify serum. To determine whether sof plays a role in virulence, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with these strains. None of the 10 mice infected with YL3(pNZ28) survived and only 1 out of 15 mice challenged with T2MR survived, whereas 12 out of 15 mice infected with YL3 survived. These data clearly indicate that SOF is a virulence factor, and they provide the first direct evidence that a fibronectin-binding protein contributes to the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections in vivo.","['Courtney HS', 'Hasty DL', 'Li Y', 'Chiang HC', 'Thacker JL', 'Dale JB']",1999,32,1,Mol Microbiol,"Courtney HS, et al.

10103345,Neonatal necrotizing fasciitis: a report of three cases and review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a predominantly adult disorder, with bacterial infection of the soft tissue. In children, it is relatively rare and has a fulminant course with a high mortality rate. In the neonate, most cases of NF are attributable to secondary infection of omphalitis, balanitis, mammitis, postoperative complications, and fetal monitoring. The objective of this communication is to report 3 cases of neonatal NF and provide a literature review of this disorder.
RESULTS: This review yielded 66 cases of neonatal NF. Only 3 cases were premature. There was no sex predilection and the condition rarely recurred. Several underlying conditions were identified that might have contributed to the development of neonatal NF. These included omphalitis in 47, mammitis in 5, balanitis in 4, fetal scalp monitoring in 2, necrotizing enterocolitis, immunodeficiency, bullous impetigo, and maternal mastitis in 1 patient each. The most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall (n = 53), followed by the thorax (n = 7), back (n = 2), scalp (n = 2), and extremity (n = 2). The initial skin presentation ranged from minimal rash to erythema, edema, induration or cellulitis. The lesions subsequently spread rapidly. The overlying skin might later develop a violaceous discoloration, peau d'orange appearance, bullae, or necrosis. Crepitus was uncommon. Fever and tachycardia were frequent but not uniformly present. The leukocyte count of the peripheral blood was usually elevated with a shift to the left. Thrombocytopenia was noted in half of the cases. Hypocalcemia was rarely reported. Of the 53 wound cultures available for bacteriologic evaluation, 39 were polymicrobial, 13 were monomicrobial, and 1 was sterile. Blood culture was positive in only 20 cases (50%). Treatment modalities included the use of antibiotics, supportive care, surgical debridement, and drainage of the affected fascial planes. Two of the 6 cases who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy died. The overall mortality rate was 59% (39/66). In 12 cases, skin grafting was required because of poor granulation formation or large postoperative skin defects among the survivors.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal NF is an uncommon but often fatal bacterial infection of the skin, subcutaneous fat, superficial fascia, and deep fascia. It is characterized by marked tissue edema, rapid spread of inflammation, and signs of systemic toxicity. The wound cultures are predominantly polymicrobial and the location of initial involvement depends on the underlying etiologic factor. High index of suspicion, prompt aggressive surgery, appropriate antibiotics, and supportive care are the mainstays of management in the newborn infant with NF.","['Hsieh WS', 'Yang PH', 'Chao HC', 'Lai JY']",1999,103,4,Pediatrics,"Hsieh WS, et al.

10037217,New evidence that the Tyr-157 and Tyr-159 residues of staphylococcal exfoliative toxin B are essential for its toxicity.,"To determine the active site of exfoliative toxin B (sETB) of Staphylococcus aureus, the etb gene was cloned from an S. aureus SU strain obtained from a patient with impetigo. We prepared a frame shift mutant protein from a recombinant plasmid with a BglII linker inserted into the Tyr-155 codon of the ETB gene (pETB/BglIIL). The recombinant mutant protein (ETB/BglIIL) obtained from Escherichia coli containing pETB/BgIIIL showed no toxicity in neonatal mice and no agglutination activity. The 20-kDa ETB/BglIIL contained 185 amino acid residues. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations at either Tyr-155, Tyr-157, Tyr-159, or Tyr-162. Substitution of any of the Tyr residues decreased exfoliative activity compared with that of native sETB (4,000 EU/ml). Substitution of Tyr-155 with a Phe (ETBYN155) decreased activity 5-fold (800 EU/ml). Substitution of Tyr-157 with Leu (ETB/Y157) decreased activity 80-fold (50 EU/ml) and decreased agglutination titer 5-fold compared with that of native sETB (400,000). Substitution of Tyr-159 with Leu (ETB/Y159)decreased activity 4-fold (1,000 EU/ml). When both Tyr-157 and Tyr-159 were mutated (ETB/Y157-159), both toxicity and antigenicity were completely lost. On an immunodiffusion test, ETBNY157 showed a faint precipitation line, but ETB/BglIIL and ETB/Y157-159 had no activity, showing that the Tyr-157 and Tyr-159 residues are essential for the toxicity and antigenicity of ETB.","['Sakurai S', 'Suzuki H', 'Saito S', 'Konishi Y', 'Machida K', 'Kohno M']",1998,42,12,Microbiol Immunol,"Sakurai S, et al.

Histopathological evaluation of a biopsy revealed typical changes of pustular psoriasis with parakeratosis and abscesses of neutrophils (Kogoj's spongiform pustules). The diagnosis of pustular psoriasis was established by the typical clinical and histopathological findings. Laboratory parameters showed a highly elevated blood sedimentation rate, hypoferric anemia and decreased albumin levels. Serum concentrations of parathormone and its metabolites were normal. After systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids and antibiotics, the lesions improved but did not clear. After delivery of a healthy boy, therapy was switched to retinoid photochemotherapy with isotretinoin and PUVA that resulted in rapid and complete clearing of the eruption. The coincidence of plaque-type psoriasis and a pustular eruption as described previously in impetigo herpetiformis supports the view that this dermatosis of pregnancy is a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis.","['Breier-Maly J', 'Ortel B', 'Breier F', 'Schmidt JB', 'Hönigsmann H']",1999,198,1,Dermatology,"Breier-Maly J, et al.

9990411,Fusidic acid in dermatology.,"Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that belongs to a group of its own, the fusidanes. The molecule has a steroid-like structure but does not possess any steroid activity. The structure is thought to be responsible for the steroid-like high penetration, and for the fact that no cross-resistance or cross-allergy has been seen with other antibiotics in routine clinical use. The anti-microbial activity of fusidic acid is specifically aimed at the most common skin pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, towards which it is one of the most potent antibiotics. The place of fusidic acid in dermatology is in the treatment of mild to moderately severe skin and soft-tissue infections, e.g. impetigo, folicullitis, erythrasma, furunculosis, abscesses and infected traumatic wounds, whereas it is of less use in conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa, chronic leg ulcers, burns and pressure sores. The topical combinations of fusidic acid with either betamethasone or hydrocortisone are extremely useful in the treatment of atopic dermatitis/eczema whenever staphylococcal/secondary infection is suspected, and in more persistent cases of eczema where staphylococcal superantigen may be playing an important exacerbating role.",['Wilkinson JD'],1998,139 Suppl 53,,Br J Dermatol,Wilkinson JD.

9990407,Skin bacteriology and the role of Staphylococcus aureus in infection.,"Many of the staphylococci and coryneforms that inhabit normal human skin do not cause skin disease. Amongst the remainder the mechanisms of pathogenicity vary widely. For Proteus, Pseudomonas and Brevibacterium species proteolysis is a major determinant. The precise role of Corynebacterium minutissimum in erythrasma and the propionibacteria in acne is not known. Staphylococcus aureus, however, produces a wide range of non-specific agents, such as haemolysins and leucocidins as well as highly specific toxins such as the epidermolytic toxins involved in bullous impetigo and scalded skin syndrome. Most of the current attention, however, is devoted to the role of the enterotoxins and toxic shock toxin as superantigens, with emphasis on their role in atopic dermatitis. Molecularly similar toxins in the streptococci play a similar role and may also have a role in the aetiology of psoriasis.",['Noble WC'],1998,139 Suppl 53,,Br J Dermatol,Noble WC.

The speA and speC alleles of organisms harboring the emm marker for a pharyngeal reservoir (pattern A-C) differ from spe alleles that predominate in organisms with the emm marker for impetigo (pattern D). However, organisms that display the emm marker for both tissue sites (pattern E) are not intermediate for the distribution of either speA or speC alleles, but instead resemble pattern A-C isolates for speA and pattern D strains for speC.

In 29 out of 41 cases of infective origin, Staphylococcus aureus strains were simultaneously isolated. Twenty-four out of 28 patients with impetigo were suffering from atopic dermatitis. We confirmed that impetigo lesions where Streptococcus pyogenes was dominant in number always showed thick-walled pustules on an erythematous base; these skin lesions were considered to be an early manifestation of streptococcal impetigo. We further confirmed that thick-crusted lesions in streptococcal impetigo, where S. aureus exceeded S. pyogenes in number, were a late manifestation. Antimicrobial agents such as minocycline, fusidic acid, ofloxacin and tosufloxacin, were more effective against S. aureus strains than against beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains.

After incubation, the colony counts of S. aureus cells in the immature biofilms in plasma containing levofloxacin with 70% sucrose were about one-tenth of those in plasma containing levofloxacin without sucrose. The colony counts of S. aureus cells in the immature biofilms in plasma containing silver sulphadiazine or silver nitrate (at a silver concentration of 0.302%) were over 3000 times lower than those in control plasma without silver after incubation for 24 h. Plasma coagulation by S. aureus cells was not detected in plasma containing 70% sucrose 48 h after inoculation. The immature biofilms were incubated in plasma with and without 70% sucrose, and the immature biofilms were treated with 10% povidone-iodine for 2 min after incubation for 4 and 16 h. In this experiment, the colony counts of S. aureus cells in the immature biofilms incubated with 70% sucrose were about one-tenth of those in plasma without sucrose after incubation for 24 h.

9844495,Bacterial skin infections at a tertiary dermatological centre.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial skin infections are common clinical problems encountered in most fields of clinical medicine. Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci are common invaders of eczematous, traumatised or immunocompromised skin. Advances in pharmacology have introduced a wide array of new antibiotics into the physician's armamentarium, but the rising incidence of bacterial resistance continues to be a problem. A retrospective study was carried out on 331 patients at the National Skin Centre, Singapore, to establish the causes of common primary and secondary pyodermas, as well as to determine the antibiotic sensitivities of the microorganisms responsible.
METHODS: A retrospective study of the medical records of 331 patients seen at the Centre for skin infections between October 1995 and May 1996 was done. Skin cultures and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out and the data analysed. Both primary pyodermas (impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles/carbuncles and cellulitis) and secondary pyodermas (infected ulcers and infected eczemas) were included. The results of bacterial isolation cultures and sensitivity of the organisms isolated to the commonly used antibiotics such as cloxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and the tetracyclines were analysed.
RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism isolated from both primary and secondary pyodermas, accounting for 67% and 46.7% of the organisms isolated, respectively. There was no significant difference in the racial representation in each of the various skin infections, but there was a significantly greater female representation in the infected ulcers. The secondary pyodermas had a significantly higher incidence of gram negative organisms causing infections, as well as culture results showing multiple bacterial pathogens. The methicillin resistant strains of S. aureus were commoner in the secondary pyodermas, and accounted for 4.2% of the total organisms isolated and 7% of the total strains of S. aureus. The S. aureus had a high rate of resistance (89.5%) to penicillin and ampicillin, but was very sensitive (93%) to cloxacillin, cephalexin and cotrimoxazole. The incidence of erythromycin resistance was 18.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary pyodermas, cloxacillin should be the first line antibiotic used, with erythromycin as a useful but less preferred alternative. The favoured combination of ampicillin and cloxacillin has little place in routine treatment of skin infections, except for cellulitis and infected eczemas. A cephalosporin can also be used in these conditions if single drug therapy is desired. The secondarily infected ulcers are difficult to treat and would probably require the use of combination therapy in view of frequent mixed infections.","['Tan HH', 'Tay YK', 'Goh CL']",1998,39,8,Singapore Med J,"Tan HH, et al.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study study was conducted over a 14-month period in the dermatology unit of the Cayenne hospital. Two groups of patients were identified: group 1 included patients with impetigo and group 2 patients with infected skin reactions. Epidemiological, bacteriological, toxinological (exofoliatines, leukocidine) and antibiotic data were recorded.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients with impetigo and 31 patients with infected skin reactions were included. Staphylococcus infection alone was identified in most patients (68 p. 100) in the impetigo group. Exfoliatine-producing strains were strongly associated with Staphylococcus-induced bullous and non-bullous impetigo (93 p. 100) compared with other origins (impetigo with streptococcal infection or infected skin reactions). Resistance to macrolides was high (erythromycin 41 p. 100, fusidic acid 42 p. 100) for all isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSION: A sub-group of patients with impetigo was identified. These patients had pure staphylococcal infections characterized by strong association with exfoliatine production. The rate of resistance to macrolides was particularly high in this sub-group. Resistance to fusidic acid was high for all Staphylococcus strains isolated.","['Couppié P', 'Sainte-Marie D', 'Prévost G', 'Gravet A', 'Clyti E', 'Moreau B', 'Monteil H', 'Pradinaud R']",1998,125,10,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Couppié P, et al.

The authors described a case of 28-year-old male based on histopathological diagnosis. The patient was admitted to the hospital thrice in his life with the diagnosis of arthrogryphosis. Last time he presented with extensive secondary impetigo in extremities and pachydermia, polymalformation syndrome, multiple subcutaneous tumours, gingival hypertrophy, contractures, osteolytic lesions and positive family history. In histology, tumoriform lesions showed a structureless hyaline matrix often with chondroosseous metaplasia and calcium salts. More or less numerous cells in the matrix had a fibroblastoid appearance with eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei and frequently pericytoplasmic halo. Electron microscopy revealed dilated cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum and a hypertrophied Golgi apparatus. Particles representing calcium salts according to their density were rare. Immunohistochemistry of tumour cells showed vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin. The findings concurred with the literature in which, nevertheless, the immunohistochemical picture were not mentioned.","['Adamicová K', 'Fetisovová Z', 'Mellová Y', 'Statelová D', 'Hutka Z']",1998,34,3,Cesk Patol,"Adamicová K, et al.

9745311,Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections.,"GABHS is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillopharyngitis, but this organism also produces acute otitis media; pneumonia; skin and soft-tissue infections; cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic infections; bacteremia; and meningitis. Most children and adolescents who develop a sore throat do not have GABHS as the cause; their infection is viral in etiology. Other bacterial pathogens produce sore throat infrequently (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and when they do, other concomitant clinical illness is present. Classic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis has an acute onset; produces concurrent headache, stomach ache, and dysphagia; and upon examination is characterized by intense tonsillopharyngeal erythema, yellow exudate, and tender/enlarged anterior cervical glands. Unfortunately only about 20% to 30% of patients present with classic disease. Physicians overdiagnose streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis by a wide margin, which almost always leads to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Accordingly, use of throat cultures and/or rapid GABHS detection tests in the office is strongly advocated. Their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. Penicillin currently is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association as first-line therapy for GABHS infections; erythromycin is recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Virtually all patients improve clinically with penicillin and other antibiotics. However, penicillin treatment failures do occur, especially in tonsillopharyngitis in which 5% to 35% of patients do not experience bacteriologic eradication. Penicillin treatment failures are more common among patients who have been treated recently with the drug. Cephalosporins or azithromycin are preferred following penicillin treatment failures in selected patients as first-line therapy, based on a history of penicillin failures or lack of compliance and for impetigo. GABHS remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin in vitro. There are several explanations for penicillin treatment failures, but the possibility of copathogen co-colonization in vivo has received the most attention. Treatment duration with penicillin should be 10 days to optimize cure in GABHS infections. A 5-day regimen is possible and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cefpodoxime (a cephalosporin) and azithromycin (a macrolide). Prevention of rheumatic fever is the primary objective for antibiotic therapy of GABHS infections, but a reduction in contagion and faster clinical improvement also can be achieved. Development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis (""flesh-eating bacteria"") are rising concerns. The portal of entry for these invasive GABHS strains is far more often skin and soft tissue than the tonsillopharynx.",['Pichichero ME'],1998,19,9,Pediatr Rev,Pichichero ME.

9690217,Antibody to streptococcal zymogen in the serum of patients with acute glomerulonephritis: a multicentric study.,"BACKGROUND: Cationic streptococcal proteinase (erythrotoxin B) and its precursor, zymogen, are putative nephritogenic antigens. The present study was designed to test whether serum titers to these antigens were good markers of streptococcal infection associated with glomerulonephritis.
METHODS: We studied 153 patients (male/female = 104/49, age range, 2 to 23 years old) with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) from three countries (Venezuela, Chile and Argentina). The site of the initial infection was the skin in 84 patients, the throat in 55 patients and was unknown in 14 patients. In addition, we studied 23 patients (1 to 24 years old) with streptococcal infection not associated with glomerulonephritis (14 patients with impetigo and 9 patients with pharyngitis). As control group, 93 healthy individuals (54 males, 2 to 19 years old) were studied. Anti-zymogen and anti-proteinase titers were determined in a single laboratory by ELISA, and the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 5.3% and 8.5%, respectively. ASO titers and anti-DNAse B titers were also done.
RESULTS: Anti-zymogen titers of 1:800 to 1:3200 had likelihood ratios (sensitivity/1-specificity) for detection of streptococcal infection in APSGN patients ranging from 2.00 to 44.2 in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. Anti-zymogen titers decreased one to two months after APSGN and they were 1 to 3 log2 dilutions higher that anti-proteinase titers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that anti-zymogen titers were consistently superior to anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNAse B titers as markers for streptococcal infection in APSGN.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased anti-zymogen antibody titers are the best available marker for streptococcal infection associated with acute glomerulonephritis.","['Parra G', 'Rodríguez-Iturbe B', 'Batsford S', 'Vogt A', 'Mezzano S', 'Olavarría F', 'Exeni R', 'Laso M', 'Orta N']",1998,54,2,Kidney Int,"Parra G, et al.

9651828,Increasing incidence of streptococcal impetigo in atopic dermatitis.,"Streptococcal impetigo associated with atopic dermatitis has dramatically increased from 1989 to 1994 in outpatients visiting our hospital, totalling 174 cases. The most frequent causative agents were group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, 70.7%) followed by group G (19.5%) and group B (9.8%). Streptococcus was isolated singly in 28.2% of cases and in concomitant with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 71.8%. Major clinical features of streptococcal impetigo, especially caused by group A streptococci, were non-bullous pustules with thick crusted ceiling. Impetigo caused by group G or B streptococci generally formed smaller sized pustules of fewer numbers. Impetigo was usually present, associated with severe eczematous lesions. Various degrees of fever were noticed in 32.8% (group A, 39.8%; group G, 17.6%; group B, 11.8%) during active stages. The lesions on the face often resembled Kaposi's varicelliform eruption in any group. Systemic antimicrobial agents were administered in 71.3% of cases and the remainder were treated with topical antibiotics (oxytetracycline hydrochloride) or disinfectants (povidone-iodine). Recurrence occurred within a month in 38.0% of cases treated with topical agents only and in 17.7% treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the results of treatment seem to indicate that cephems, as well as penicillins, are the first choice of treatment for streptococcal impetigo.","['Adachi J', 'Endo K', 'Fukuzumi T', 'Tanigawa N', 'Aoki T']",1998,17,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Adachi J, et al.

Streptococcal skin infections include impetigo and erysipelas. Human papillomavirus skin infections present as several different types of warts, depending on the surface infected and its relative moisture, and the patterns of pressure. The many dermatomycoses (skin infections caused by fungi or yeasts) include tinea capitis, tinea barbae, tinea cruris, tinea manus, tinea pedis and tinea unguium (onychomycosis). Candidal infections occur in moist areas, such as the vulva, mouth, penis, skinfolds and diaper area. Wounds caused by wood splinters or thorns may result in sporotrichosis.

9421474,Differentiation of cultured keratinocytes promotes the adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Based on a consideration of the histopathology of nonbullous impetigo that shows localization of Streptococcus pyogenes to highly differentiated, subcorneal keratinocytes, we hypothesized that adherence of an impetigo strain of S. pyogenes would be promoted by terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. An assay was developed in which S. pyogenes adhered via pilus-like projections from the cell wall to the surface of cultured human keratinocytes in a time- and inoculum-dependent manner suggestive of a receptor-mediated process. Terminal differentiation of keratinocytes was induced by increasing the calcium concentration in the growth medium, and was confirmed by morphologic analysis using electron microscopy. Adherence of S. pyogenes was three and fourfold greater to keratinocytes differentiated in 1.0 and 1.5 mM calcium, respectively, compared with undifferentiated keratinocytes in 0.15 mM calcium. The presence of calcium during the adherence assay further enhanced adherence nearly twofold. Adherence occurred preferentially to sites of contact between adjacent keratinocytes, suggesting that the keratinocyte receptor may be a molecule involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. In contrast, nonpathogenic Streptococcus gordonii adhered poorly to keratinocytes regardless of their state of terminal differentiation, and adherence of a pharyngeal strain of S. pyogenes was twofold greater to undifferentiated than differentiated keratinocytes. This is the first report of in vitro adherence of S. pyogenes to keratinocytes in a manner that emulates human impetigo. Adherence of only the impetigo strain, and not the pharyngeal strain of S. pyogenes or the nonpathogenic S. gorgonii isolate, was promoted by keratinocyte differentiation. This result provides a model system for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of streptococcal skin infections.","['Darmstadt GL', 'Fleckman P', 'Jonas M', 'Chi E', 'Rubens CE']",1998,101,1,J Clin Invest,"Darmstadt GL, et al.

All strains isolated from patients with generalized exfoliative syndrome or bullous impetigo produced ETA and/or ETB and caused a Nikolsky's sign when injected subcutaneously into newborn mice. In contrast, exfoliative toxin was detected in an S. aureus strain from only one of 17 case of staphylococcal scarlet fever; the 16 other S. aureus strains produced TSST-1 and/or an enterotoxin.

9451928,Burn wound infections: current status.,"The burn wound represents a susceptible site for opportunistic colonization by organisms of endogenous and exogenous origin. Patient factors such as age, extent of injury, and depth of burn in combination with microbial factors such as type and number of organisms, enzyme and toxin production, and motility determine the likelihood of invasive burn wound infection. Burn wound infections can be classified on the basis of the causative organism, the depth of invasion, and the tissue response. Diagnostic procedures and therapy must be based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of the burn wound and the pathogenesis of the various forms of burn wound infection. The time-related changes in the predominant flora of the burn wound from gram-positive to gram-negative recapitulate the history of burn wound infection. Proper clinical and culture surveillance of the burn wound permits early diagnosis of gram-positive cellulitis, and the stable susceptibility of beta-hemolytic streptococci to penicillin has eliminated the threat of this once common burn wound pathogen. Selection and dissemination of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms increase the probability of burn wound colonization by resistant species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Even so, effective topical antimicrobial chemotherapy and early burn wound excision have significantly reduced the overall occurrence of invasive burn wound infections. Individual patients, usually those with extensive burns in whom wound closure is difficult to achieve, may still develop a variety of bacterial and nonbacterial burn wound infections. Consequently, the entirety of the burn wound must be examined on a daily basis by the attending surgeon. Any change in wound appearance, with or without associated clinical changes, should be evaluated by biopsy. Quantitative cultures of the biopsy sample may identify predominant organisms but are not useful for making the diagnosis of invasive burn wound infection. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen, which permits staging the invasive process, is the only reliable means of differentiating wound colonization from invasive infection. Identification of the histologic changes characteristic of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections facilitates the selection of appropriate therapy. A diagnosis of invasive burn wound infection necessitates change of both local and systemic therapy and, in the case of bacterial and fungal infections, prompt surgical removal of the infected tissue. Even after the wounds of extensively burned patients have healed or been grafted, burn wound impetigo, commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, may occur in the form of multifocal, small superficial abscesses that require surgical debridement. Current techniques of burn wound care have significantly reduced the incidence of invasive burn wound infection, altered the organisms causing the infections that do occur, increased the interval between injury and the onset of infection, reduced the mortality associated with infection, decreased the overall incidence of infection in burn patients, and increased burn patient survival.","['Pruitt BA', 'McManus AT', 'Kim SH', 'Goodwin CW']",1998,22,2,World J Surg,"Pruitt BA, et al.

Attachment of S. aureus cells to a plastic tissue-culture coverslip was more marked in 0-3% fibrinogen/tryptic soy broth (TSB) than in plasma (P < 0.05). The formation of the membranous structure was observed on the plastic tissue-culture coverslip with 0.3% fibrinogen/human serum but not with 0.3% fibrinogen + 5% glucose/TSB. Electron microscopy revealed abundant fibrin around S. aureus cells at 4 h and Ruthenium red-positive materials increased at 24 and 72 h in plasma. Staphylococcus aureus cell attachment to the plastic tissue-culture coverslip in plasma decreased by addition of levofloxacin (LVFX) at 1/2 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and clarithromycin (CAM) at 1/4 MIC. Polysaccharide production of S. aureus cells on the plastic tissue-culture coverslip in plasma decreased with the addition of CAM at 1/4 MIC. Fibrinogen is closely related to initiation of infection but biofilm formation requires the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Thus, attachment of S. aureus cells to the plastic tissue-culture coverslip, conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by coagulase-prothrombin complex, and production of abundant glycocalyx by S. aureus cells are at least required for the production of biofilm in staphylococcal skin infection.","['Akiyama H', 'Ueda M', 'Kanzaki H', 'Tada J', 'Arata J']",1997,16,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Akiyama H, et al.

The present study was undertaken to correlate the various dermatoses with the evolutionary phases of AIDS.
METHODS: We examined 223 HIV-infected patients older than 13 seen at the University of São Paulo, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, from 1989 to 1993. Patients were divided according to the CDC classification and assigned to groups I, II and III (initial stages of AIDS) and to group IV (fully symptomatic stage of AIDS).
RESULTS: The mean frequency of dermatoses detected in patients with AIDS was higher compared to the early phases of HIV infection. The most frequently detected dermatoses were, in decreasing order of occurrence, dermatoses of fungal etiology, and desquamating disorders, such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, xerosis, and viral dermatoses.
CONCLUSIONS: A careful examination of skin and mucosae may be highly useful for the diagnosis of HIV infection. The number of dermatoses tended to increase during the more advanced stages of infection.","['Rosatelli JB', 'Machado AA', 'Roselino AM']",1997,36,10,Int J Dermatol,"Rosatelli JB, et al.

9322743,Two-domain motif for IgG-binding activity by group A streptococcal emm gene products.,"A biological role for the non-immune binding of human IgG by group A streptococci is evidenced by its strong association with a subpopulation of strains giving rise to tissue-specific infection. IgG-binding activity lies within many of the M and M-like surface proteins (encoded by emm genes), and several structurally distinct IgG-binding sites are known to exist. In this report, two adjacent IgG-binding domains, differing in their specificity for human IgG subclasses, are localized within the M-like protein, protein H. The putative coding regions for the two IgG-binding domains were mapped for 82 epidemiologically unrelated strains. Both coding regions are associated with phylogenetically distant emm genes, supporting a role for horizontal transfer and intergenomic recombination in the evolution of emm genes. In most instances, the two coding regions are tightly linked, suggesting that there exist strong selective pressures to maintain a two-domain binding motif. Both coding regions are found among all strains bearing emm gene markers associated with impetigo lesions as the principal tissue reservoir, but are absent from most strains that exhibit markers for a predominant nasopharyngeal reservoir. The data support the hypothesis that the pathogenic potential of an isolate is dictated, at least in part, by its unique array of multifunctional emm gene products.","['Bessen DE', 'Izzo MW', 'McCabe EJ', 'Sotir CM']",1997,196,1-2,Gene,"Bessen DE, et al.

9274639,Extremely low levels of epidermal skin-derived antileucoproteinase/elafin in a patient with impetigo herpetiformis.,"Impetigo herpetiformis (IH) is a rare pustular dermatosis with unknown aetiology, typically occurring during pregnancy. Based upon a similar clinical and histological presentation, i.e. spongiform accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the stratum corneum, several authors consider IH as a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), while others state that IH is a separate entity. Skin-derived antileucoproteinase (SKALP) is a strong and specific inhibitor of human leucocyte elastase (HLE) and proteinase 3, two neutral proteinases that have been implicated in leucocyte migration and tissue destruction. Previously, we reported decreased SKALP activity in pustular forms of psoriasis compared with plaque psoriasis. In this study we present a case study of a patient with IH, where SKALP activity was measured using biochemical and immunochemical techniques. Epidermal scales and sera were collected during the course of the disease. Comparison was made with three patients with GPP and six patients with plaque psoriasis. Initially, anti-HLE activity in epidermal scales of the patient with IH was comparable with values in patients with GPP, i.e. decreased compared with plaque psoriasis. During the course of the disease, anti-elastase activity dropped to undetectable levels, concomitant with the appearance of free elastase activity. This finding suggests a total saturation of epidermal anti-HLE activity. Low levels of SKALP, presumably complexed with HLE, could be measured immunochemically in scale extracts. Serum levels of total SKALP correlated with the disease activity. We suggest that a reduced amount of epidermal SKALP contributes to an imbalance between elastase and its inhibitor, resulting in the formation of epidermal pustules. This mechanism of pustule formation could apply both to GPP and IH, suggesting a final common pathway in the pathogenic mechanisms of IH and GPP.","['Kuijpers AL', 'Schalkwijk J', 'Rulo HF', 'Peperkamp JJ', 'van de Kerkhof PC', 'de Jong EM']",1997,137,1,Br J Dermatol,"Kuijpers AL, et al.

9207364,A genetic-based evaluation of the principal tissue reservoir for group A streptococci isolated from normally sterile sites.,"The primary sites of infection and principal reservoirs for transmission of group A streptococci are the nasopharyngeal mucosa and the impetigo lesion. However, pharyngitis and impetigo are rarely observed prior to invasive disease, and, thus, the origin of invasive strains is largely unknown. As part of an active surveillance program, group A streptococci were obtained from normally sterile tissue sites of Connecticut residents during a 6-month period. Organisms were analyzed for genetic markers that distinguish between strains that use the nasopharynx versus an impetiginous lesion as their primary site for infection. The nasopharyngeal marker was observed for most sterile-site isolates, suggesting that the upper respiratory tract is the principal reservoir from which organisms causing invasive disease are disseminated. Genotypic analyses of sterile-site isolates support the view that additional factors, aside from a recent emergence of a few virulent clones, are important contributors to invasive group A streptococcal disease.","['Fiorentino TR', 'Beall B', 'Mshar P', 'Bessen DE']",1997,176,1,J Infect Dis,"Fiorentino TR, et al.

9192410,Microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.,"Our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (NI) in children. We used a retrospective review of clinical microbiology laboratory and patients' records. Specimens were obtained from 40 patients with NI lesions and showed bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). Sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) (13 isolates), and Escherichia coli (1 isolate). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were S. aureus. S. aureus alone or mixed with GABHS or Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. Mixed flora of Peptostreptococcus spp. with Prevotella spp. or Fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while E. coli mixed with B. fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area.

9082404,[Infections in pediatrics].,"PROBABILITY-BASED ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY: In children, the risk of an unfavorable course of bacterial infections requires careful selection of the initial antibiotic prescription based on the disease state, bacterial epidemiology and the child's age. ACUTE COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: Before the age of 5 years, antibiotics active against Haemophilus influenzae such as amoxicillin or clavulanic acid can be given orally. In children over 5, amoxicillin or a macrolide are effective. SEVERE EAR, NOSE AND THROAT INFECTIONS: For sore throats, clinical and bacterial results of a 4-day antibiotic regimen using a second generation cephalosporin are equivalent (with better compliance) to a 10-day regimen of penicillin V. For acute middle ear infections, a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is usually prescribed as initial treatment. COMMUNITY ACQUIRED BACTERIAL MENINGITIS: The most recent consensus established the indication for cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The increasing number of peni-R pneumococci and the major drop in the frequency of Haemophilus infections have led to new therapeutic propositions currently under investigation. ACUTE SKIN INFECTIONS: For impetigo, general antibiotics-oxacillin or a derivative-are required due to the risk of contagion. BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS: For these urgent situations, in vitro sensitivity and antibiotic penetration into the infected tissue are the determining factors. BACTERIAL DIARRHEA: Antibiotics are not required in case of acute diaarhea with little or no fever. Antibiotics could be discussed for cholera-like diarrhea and are required in case of invasive bacterial diarrhea, shigelosis, cholera, and Clostridium difficile as well as diarrhea with fever and blood loss in infants or salmonella-induced diarrhea with signs of extradigestive complications.

9739895,[Pristinamycin versus oxacillin in the treatment of superficial pyoderma. A multicenter randomized study in 293 outpatients].,"BACKGROUND: Superficial pyoderma occurs frequently. Generally, the benign infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or a group A streptococci. The subject is controversial, but treatment usually is based on narrow-spectrum antibiotics active against both germs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentric, randomized, double-blind, double-placebo study was conducted to compare pristinamycin (1 g b.i.d.) with a reference antibiotic, oxacillin (1 g b.i.d.) for 10 days. Inclusion criteria were: both sexes, age 15-80 years, clinical diagnosis of superficial pyoderma (impetigo, wound infection within the last 15 days, furunculosis, carbuncle, perionyxis), informed consent. The general practitioner investigators (n = 52) were assisted by 9 dermatologist-coordinators. Clinical diagnosis was validated by a committee of experts at the end of the study after analyzes of the photos and bacteriological results obtained on samples taken at the practitioner's office on visit 1 (D0), visit 3 (D14 +/- 3) and visit 4 (D25 +/- 3). Successful treatment was defined by clinical, bacteriological and photographic efficacy at visit 3 (equivalence analysis: one-way 95 p. 100 confidence interval).
RESULTS: There were 293 included patients given pristinamycin (n = 151) or oxacillin (n = 142). Mean age of analyzed patients was 40 +/- 17 years. Diagnosis was confirmed in 255 patients in accordance with the protocol: furunculosis or carbuncle (n = 100), recently superinfected wound (n = 97), impetigo (n = 41), acute perionyxis (n = 17). Thirty-five patients (12 p. 100) were considered to have been wrongly included. The germs most often isolated were: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 126), group A streptococci (n = 13), group B streptococci (n = 5) and P. multocida (n = 3). At visit 3, the two treatments were found to be equivalent with a success rate of 86.7 p. 100 for pristinamycin and 89.8 p. 100 for oxacillin (CI [*9.97]). Tolerance was statistically comparable between the two treatments (27 to 32 percent minor side effects).
DISCUSSION: This study is the first performed in outpatients attended by general practitioners with diagnostic confirmation on both bacteriological and photographic evidence of superficial pyoderma. The results obtained demonstrate the good reliability of such studies although 12 p. 100 of the patients were wrongly included, a factor which should be taken into account for future studies. The efficacy and tolerance of pristinamycin were statistically equivalent to those of oxacillin for all the patients with superficial pyoderma. Nevertheless, the subgroup of patients with folliculitis gave rather heterogeneous bacteriology and therapeutic results.","['Bernard P', 'Vaillant L', 'Martin C', 'Beylot C', 'Quentin R', 'Touron D']",1997,124,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Bernard P, et al.

9331709,Molecular markers for throat and skin isolates of group A streptococci.,"In summary, the emm chromosomal patterns distinguish between the two principal tissue site reservoirs of group A streptococci--the nasopharyngeal mucosa and impetigo lesion. Strains derived from normally sterile tissue sites are probably transmitted to new hosts by respiratory droplets, at least in the Connecticut population. The speA gene provides an example of how genetic exchange between different strains of group A streptococci may be limited to a single tissue site or to a subset of emm chromosomal patterns.","['Bessen DE', 'Fiorentino TR', 'Hollingshead SK']",1997,418,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Bessen DE, et al.

9267729,Producibility of exfoliative toxin and staphylococcal coagulase types of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from skin infections and atopic dermatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Strains of Staphylococcus aureus which cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and bullous impetigo secrete exfoliative toxin (ET). Two antigenically distinct serotypes of ET, ETA and ETB, have been reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-three strains of S. aureus isolated from impetigo, SSSS, furuncles (including furunculosis) and atopic dermatitis were examined in terms of the producibility of ET, ET serotypes and coagulase types. We examined ET production and ET serotypes using the polymerase chain reaction with the oligonucleotide primers for eta and etb.
RESULTS: The incidence of ET producers was 69.4% (100/144) in impetigo, 100% (6/6) in SSSS, 2.8% (3/112) in atopic dermatitis and 0% (0/21) in furuncles. ETA alone was produced by 57 strains from impetigo and by 3 strains from atopic dermatitis. ETB alone was produced by 36 strains from impetigo and by all 6 strains from SSSS. Seven strains from impetigo produced both ETA and ETB. Most ETA producers belonged to coagulase type V and most ETB producers to coagulase type I. Impetigo strains mostly belonged to type I or V. All strains from SSSS were classified as type I. Type IV was most frequent among S. aureus isolates from furuncles.
CONCLUSION: These results add to the epidemiological information as to ET producibility and ET serotypes of S. aureus strains isolated from impetigo, SSSS, furunculosis and atopic dermatitis. We have found that there is a relationship between the ET serotypes and the coagulase types of ET-producing strains.","['Kanzaki H', 'Ueda M', 'Morishita Y', 'Akiyama H', 'Arata J', 'Kanzaki S']",1997,195,1,Dermatology,"Kanzaki H, et al.

The 50% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of the antibacterial agents was 3.13 micrograms/ml or lower, except that of gentamicin with isolates from the impetigo groups (25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90 of gentamicin was 50 micrograms/ml or more for isolates from all four groups. The isolates from the ulcers and decubitus group showed multiple resistance against antibacterial agents. The frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was low, but was highest, at 25%, in the isolates from the ulcers and decubitus group. Few isolates from the atopic dermatitis and eczema group were resistant, and there was little difference in antibacterial resistance between isolates from atopic dermatitis and eczema.","['Nishijima S', 'Namura S', 'Nakagawa M', 'Kurokawa I', 'Kawabata S']",1997,25,1,J Int Med Res,"Nishijima S, et al.

In the group of nephritic patients, ANCA were detected by IIF in 9% (18 out of 210 cases) in an atypical diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (a-ANCA) in 14 cases and in a (p-ANCA) perinuclear staining in the remaining 4 cases. Longitudinal studies performed on six IIF positive patients, showed persistence of the phenomenon for up to six months, without relationship with activity of disease. No patient with streptococcal impetigo showed positivity on the IIF assay. Positive sera were analyzed on ELISA plates for their IgG reactivity against specific purified ANCA antigens: Proteinase-3 (PR3), Myeloperoxidase (MPO). Cathepsin-G and Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein (BPI). Anti-MPO antibodies were present in 4 cases (3 a-ANCA and 1 p-ANCA). No reactivity was identified against PR-3, BPI and Catepsin-G in any of the samples. The presence of ANCA was significantly associated with a more severe glomerular disease as assessed by the serum creatinine and the crescents formation. Further studies are required to identify other antigenic specificities of these autoantibodies. Their absence in the streptococcal impetigo control group might suggest that their presence in APSGN could play some pathogenic role in kidney disease.","['Ardiles LG', 'Valderrama G', 'Moya P', 'Mezzano SA']",1997,47,1,Clin Nephrol,"Ardiles LG, et al.

8944606,Diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis in biopsy specimens by PCR and southern blotting.,"AIMS: To evaluate the use of a gene amplification and hybridisation method for detecting mycobacterial nucleic acid as a possible diagnostic method for cutaneous tuberculosis infection.
METHODS: Biopsy specimens from 20 patients with various skin conditions of possible tuberculous aetiology were studied. Six patients had ulcerative nodules, seven lupiform lesions, two non-necrotic granulomas, one scrofulous lichen, one impetigo, one erythematosus lesions, one warty lesions, and one suspected tuberculous lipoma. Biopsy specimens were stained using Ziehl-Neelsen stain and cultured in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. DNA was extracted and then amplified by PCR using primers specific for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Specificity was confirmed by Southern blotting.
RESULTS: Of the specimens, 30% were positive for mycobacteria on staining with Ziehl-Neelsen stain, 60% were culture positive and 85% PCR positive. Only 35.2% of specimens were positive with all three techniques. A further 32.5% were both culture and PCR positive. All PCR negative samples were also negative when cultured or stained with Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Of the PCR positive specimens, 29.4% were negative when cultured or stained.

The majority of the group A streptococcal isolates from the Northern Territory are not typeable by M typing. We recently developed a novel genotyping method, Vir typing. A preliminary study using this method discriminated all the M-nontypeable (MNT) isolates. Vir typing is based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the 4- to 7-kb Vir regulon of group A streptococci, which contains a number of genes, including emm (the gene for M protein). A total of 407 isolates of group A streptococci obtained from four Aboriginal communities over a 4-year period were typed by this genotyping method. Forty-two distinct genotypes were found among the isolates, including 22 among the MNT isolates. The correlation between Vir type and M type was good. This genotyping method allows the characterization of all group A streptococcal isolates from Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.

8651015,Frequency and activity of IgE-secreting peripheral blood B-cells in atopic eczema.,"Increased immunoglobulin (Ig) E-levels are frequently found in the sera of patients with atopic eczema. To further understand the mechanisms underlying this increase of IgE, like enlarged number of IgE-producing cells, enhanced activity of IgE-producing cells or altered IgE metabolism, we analyzed the frequency and activity of IgE-producing B-lymphocytes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with atopic eczema. By use of a sensitive solid phase enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), IgE-secreting cells could be visualized within peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 14 individuals (12 patients with atopic eczema, one patient with impetigo contagiosa, one patient with allergic contact dermatitis) at a frequency of 10-1,120 IgE-secreting cells/10(5) B-lymphocytes. The number of IgE-secreting cells was markedly correlated with the corresponding serum IgE-level (r = 0.97). Secretory activity was also reflected by in vitro IgE production, which was assessed in parallel 7-day cultures and found to be related with actual serum IgE-levels. The enhanced serum IgE-levels in patients with atopic eczema seem to result primarily from an increased number of circulating IgE-secreting B-cells, which may also be found, however, in patients with elevated serum IgE-levels, showing different skin diseases.","['Thomas P', 'Pfützner W', 'Przybilla B']",1995,75,6,Acta Derm Venereol,"Thomas P, et al.

8609537,Identifying high risk patients for Staphylococcus aureus infections: skin and soft tissue infections.,"Staphylococcus aureus is the causative organism for many skin and soft tissue (SST) infections. Some SST infections have severe systemic complications, such as bacteraemia and sepsis. S. aureus is the cause of 75% of primary pyodermas. Pre-existing conditions, like tissue injury (ulcers, wounds) or tissue inflammation (exudative dermatitis), and also underlying disorders (such as poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or cancer) are some of the risk factors for secondary infection with S. aureus. In S. aureus-infected primary skin disorders (impetigo, recurrent eczema), 2% mupirocin ointment has proved effective in several clinical trials. S. aureus is responsible for 25% of all burn-wound infections, and burn units could be the point of entry and source of spread of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection outbreaks. Mupirocin (2% ointment) has also proven effective for topical treatment of these infections. Pressure sores develop in 6% of all patients admitted to acute and chronic health care institutions. An average of three aerobic species (including S. aureus) plus one anaerobic species are isolated when infected. Infectious complications are responsible for 60-80% of all intravenous drug user (IVDU) hospital admissions, 5-20% being due to S. aureus infective endocarditis (IE). The origin of IE in IVDUs is probably the skin. Data from a Collaborative Spanish Study of IVDU infectious complications (including more than 10,000 episodes) are discussed.","['Trilla A', 'Miro JM']",1995,7 Suppl 3,,J Chemother,Trilla A and Miro JM.

7761149,New antimicrobial agents.,"In any discussion of new antimicrobial agents in the 1990s, a warning and a plea are necessary. The spreading emergence of resistance among bacteria raises concerns for the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are probably of most significance in pediatrics and are increasing in frequency, in part related to the use of antimicrobial therapy in young children to treat such infections as otitis media. New practice guidelines have suggested the more limited use of antimicrobial agents in treating serious otitis media. When pediatricians do treat, they should select effective agents. Limiting therapy to brief courses with effective and narrow-spectrum agents may be helpful also. Treating long enough to ensure eradication in serious infections is equally important. Methicillin-resistant S aureus are also increasing and are increasingly a concern in community-acquired infections and nosocomial infections. Using topical agents, such as mupirocin, to treat impetigo and other superficial skin infections can limit exposure to systemic agents and may delay the spread of resistance. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, an infrequent pediatric problem, are most frightening because no alternative therapies are available. Their occurrence is directly related to use of vancomycin in the communities that are affected. Containing the spread of drug-resistant bacteria will likely require a concerted effort by both physicians and the public. The indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents to treat non-bacterial infections should be contained. The public must be educated to understand that antimicrobial agents are ineffective against viral infections. In the setting of managed care, educating administrators who make practice decisions that cheaper is not always better will be crucial. The issues of day-care infections and spread of potential pathogens must take on increasing attention and methods to decrease infection sought. Curbing inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents will be as important as learning the nuances between new agents.",['Goldfarb J'],1995,42,3,Pediatr Clin North Am,Goldfarb J.

7677266,Use of 0.3% triclosan (Bacti-Stat) to eradicate an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a neonatal nursery.,"BACKGROUND: Once established in an institution, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks have proved difficult to eradicate, despite intensive infection control measures. This report describes the nosocomial infection with MRSA of 22 male infants in a neonatal nursery during a 7-month period and the infection control procedures that effectively brought this outbreak under control and eliminated recurrence for more than 3 1/2 years.
METHODS: After a single index case of bullous impetigo caused by MRSA in a neonate discharged from the nursery 2 weeks previously, an additional 18 cases of MRSA skin infections were clustered in a 7-week period. Aggressive infection control measures were instituted, including changes in umbilical cord care, circumcision procedures, diapers, handwashing, gloves, gowns, linens, disinfection, placement in cohorts of neonates and staff, surveillance, and monitoring.
RESULTS: These measures were not effective in slowing the outbreak. The single additional measure of changing handwashing and bathing soap to a preparation containing 0.3% triclosan (Bacti-Stat) was associated with the immediate termination of the acute phase of the MRSA outbreak.
CONCLUSION: The nursery has remained free of MRSA for more than 3 1/2 years, attesting to the success of our program.","['Zafar AB', 'Butler RC', 'Reese DJ', 'Gaydos LA', 'Mennonna PA']",1995,23,3,Am J Infect Control,"Zafar AB, et al.

7602798,[Immunological investigations on pathogenesis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome].,"Staphylococcal exfoliative toxin (ET) is an extracellular product of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) which includes Ritter's disease, bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scarlet fever, and has been regarded as the causative agent of SSSS. The ET has not only a splitting effect at the granular layer of skin in human and mice but also an immunogenicity to human and mice. Using experimental animals and clinical specimens of patients with or without SSSS, the immunological investigation were performed and following results were obtained. 1) When some inbred and congenic resistant strains of mice were immunized with serotype A ET (ETA), they were divided into the high anti-ETA antibody producers (high responders) and the low responders. The gene controlling antibody response to ETA in mice is located in the I-A subregion in the major histocompatible complex (H-2 complex), and its function seems to be at least related to antigen recognition at the T-lymphocyte level. 2) Neonatal mice are generally susceptible to ETA regardless of their H-2 haplo-type. However, the neonatal mice born to a high-responder mother immunized with ETA were resistant to the subcutaneous challenge of ETA, but those born to an immunized low-responder mother were susceptible to the challenge. 3) The relationship between susceptibility and immune response to ETA in some mammalians could be divided into three groups: the possession of resistant skin and high production of antibody to ETA (rabbits and rats); the possession of resistant skin and low production of antibody to ETA (golden hamsters and guinea pigs); the possession of sensitive skin and various titers of antibody to ETA (humans and mice). 4) The incidence of ET producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus in various clinical specimens obtained from patients without SSSS was 12% (50 out of 418 strains) in our epidemiological investigation. The percentages of antibody to ETA in sera obtained from healthy males and females were 23% and 29%, respectively. Eventually, ET-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus seem to be spread out wider than the microbiological result obtained from clinical specimens. 5) The mitogenic responses of lymphocytes isolated from patients with the first impetigo could be measured by using PHA, and the five-of them were in the low range, whereas lymphocytes from patients with recurrent impetigo were in the normal range on this survey. Maybe this results suggest the T lymphocyte functions of some patients with impetigo are deteriorated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Machida K'],1995,43,6,Rinsho Byori,Machida K.

The patient was a 25-year-old primigravida with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). At 35 weeks' gestation, the patient developed a severely pruritic pustular rash with fever and leukocytosis. The skin of the affected areas was biopsied and showed intraepidermal pustules with a neutrophilic infiltrate. Treatment commenced with intravenous fluids, oral prednisone, and steroid creams. Labor was induced, and a normal delivery of a healthy infant was effected, following which the patient's condition improved rapidly. The clinical and laboratory features were typical of impetigo herpetiformis as described in the literature.

Specimens were taken from 98 patients in our outpatient staff clinic who had clinical signs of superficial skin infections. Patients with erythromycin-resistant S. aureus were contacted by telephone or seen in clinic. The organism was found in 87% of patients. Twenty-two (26%) of the 85 cultures that grew S. aureus were resistant to erythromycin. Treatment failure occurred in one of these patients. We conclude that S. aureus is the most common causative organism in secondary skin infections and impetigo in our patient population.

Significant correction of the platelet 5-HT content (to 1,180 +/- 111 ng/10(9) platelets; p < 0.01) and of the platelet counts (to 309 +/- 21 x 10(3); p < 0.01) were observed in the longitudinal study at least 2 weeks later. Platelet activation, with secretion of granular content and increased consumption, may explain these findings. Additionally, the reduced mean age of the circulating platelets could contribute to their decreased 5-HT levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mezzano S', 'Kunick M', 'Olavarría F', 'Ardiles L', 'Aranda E', 'Mezzano D']",1995,69,2,Nephron,"Mezzano S, et al.

7710314,[Child abuse caused by thermal violence--determination and reconstruction].,"UNLABELLED: Problems in the judgement of child abuse due to thermal violence are discussed by means of two examined cases. In a baby dermal lesions in the course of a bacterial infectious disease (bullous impetigo) were first misinterpreted as heat effects (cigarette, hot instrument). In the case of an infant presenting with marked imprints of a hot iron abuse was to be differentiated versus an accidental causation.
CONCLUSIONS: In the interpretation of possible thermal injuries in children natural preexisting disorders of the skin should be taken into consideration. In cases of doubt an appropriate clinical diagnosis or a subsequent follow-up examination, respectively, is recommended. Thus, the course of events can be observed and an unjustified incrimination of persons having custody is avoided.","['Grellner W', 'Metzner G']",1995,195,1-2,Arch Kriminol,Grellner W and Metzner G.

The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group.

The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities of the drug against 42 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinically isolated in 1993 were compared to those of 13 other drugs mainly composed of beta-lactam preparations. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of SY5555 were below 0.39 micrograms/ml for all strains examined, thus the drug showed an excellent activities against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-resistant strains as well. When the antibacterial effects of individual drugs were compared using MIC50 and MIC90 as indices, SY5555 was the most effective against PCG-sensitive strains and similar to cefazolin (CEZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefuzonam (CZON), amoxicillin (AMPC) and imipenem (IPM). It also showed excellent antibacterial effects against moderately PCG-resistant strains, and the activities were similar to IPM. Activities of SY5555 on highly PCG-resistant strains were similar to those of CTX, CZON and IPM. 2. SY5555 at a dose of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg was administered to 16 pediatric patients in the fasting state or after meal to examine its plasma concentration and urinary excretion rate. The fecal excretion was measured in 5 affected children treated with this drug. When the drug at a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered to 11 older children, 5 with ages 5-12 years and 6 with ages 10-13 years in the fasting state and after meal, respectively. Peak plasma levels were reached at 1 hour after administration in the two groups, and they were 0.93 +/- 0.25 and 2.44 +/- 1.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The plasma levels then decreased gradually with half-lives of 1.95 +/- 1.09 and 0.72 +/- 0.21 hours, respectively.

Both were endemic occurrences of postinfectious glomerulonephritis developed after repeated dirty-skin treatments for atopic dermatitis performed by unauthorized individuals under unsanitary conditions. Of 20 patients who were similarly treated and subsequently admitted to our hospital because of skin infection and fever, 8 (40%) showed urinary abnormalities. Four patients had renal dysfunction with acute nephritic onset. Almost all showed a decrease in CH50 values and an increase in levels of antistreptolysin O and IgE. In the 2 cases presented here, the disease eventually regressed in association with improvement of the skin infection. Although the occurrence of postinfectious glomerulonephritis has recently become uncommon, we must take care to note urinary abnormalities as early as possible in order to prevent the progression of glomerulonephritis.","['Kobayashi S', 'Ikeda T', 'Okada H', 'Suzuki Y', 'Ishii M', 'Ohtake T', 'Oda T', 'Hishida A']",1995,15,4,Am J Nephrol,"Kobayashi S, et al.

7899177,Impetigo: an overview.,"This article reviews in detail the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and management of impetigo in children. Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection of children. Most cases of nonbullous impetigo and all cases of bullous impetigo are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The remainder of cases of nonbullous impetigo are due to group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). GABHS colonize the skin directly by binding to sites on fibronectin that are exposed by trauma. In contrast, S. aureus colonizes the nasal epithelium first; from this reservoir, colonization of the skin occurs. Patients with recurrent impetigo should be evaluated for carriage of S. aureus. Superficial, localized impetigo may be treated successfully in more than 90% of cases with topical application of mupirocin ointment. Impetigo that is widespread or involves deeper tissues should be treated with a beta-lactamase-resistant oral antibiotic. The choice of antibiotics is affected by the local prevalence of resistance to erythromycin among strains of S. aureus, antibiotic cost and availability, and issues of compliance.","['Darmstadt GL', 'Lane AT']",1994,11,4,Pediatr Dermatol,Darmstadt GL and Lane AT.

The trials were performed at 47 centres in three countries, Sweden, Germany and UK, and the results are compiled in the present report. During the course of the 3-week treatment period, 92 patients out of 128 (72%) in the Microcid group were classified as healed, compared to 105 patients out of 128 (82%) in the Fucidin group. This difference was not statistically significant. The reduction in composite sign severity score (the sum of the score for erythema, vesiculation/bullae, weeping and crusting divided by four) in each separate study was 73%, 78% and 84% in the Microcid group and 85%, 85% and 84% in the Fucidin group. No statistically significant differences were found in the separate studies or when compiling the studies in a meta-analysis. When the patients had been classified as healed, beta-haemolytic streptococci were eliminated in all patients treated with Microcid cream. Since treatment started before the result of the bacteriology was known, another 135 patients with negative skin culture were enrolled in the trials, i.e. 391 patients were included in the safety analysis. Out of these, 23 patients reported the occurrence of adverse events, mainly classified as mild.

8161041,Hurricane Andrew and a pediatric emergency department.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Hurricane Andrew on a pediatric emergency department.
DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of ED visits through the use of computerized records and chart review.
SETTING: A children's hospital in South Florida.
TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients presenting to the ED during the control week and the two study weeks after the hurricane.
MEASUREMENTS: Census, diagnoses, admission rate, and patient geographic origin and age.
MAIN RESULTS: During week 1, there was an average daily increase of 40.7% in patient volume (P < .01) and a 3.3% decrease in the admission rate (P < .01). The increased census was due mainly to local patients, rather than those from the most devastated areas. More patients were seen with open wounds, gastroenteritis, and impetigo (all, P < .05); more were more than 18 years old (P < .05). By the second week, both census and admission rate returned to normal; cases of cellulitis (P < .05) and open wounds (P < .001) were increased. Although not statistically significant, a higher percentage of hydrocarbon and/or bleach ingestions was seen for both weeks.
CONCLUSION: Following a hurricane, personnel in a pediatric ED can expect to see an increased census, with more diagnoses of open wounds, gastroenteritis, and skin infections. They may also see hydrocarbon and bleach ingestions. Alerting parents to the potential for injury and accidental poisoning in their children after a hurricane may help prevent the reported morbidity.","['Quinn B', 'Baker R', 'Pratt J']",1994,23,4,Ann Emerg Med,"Quinn B, et al.

18611587,Cefuroxime axetil.,"Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).",['Dellamonica P'],1994,4,1,Int J Antimicrob Agents,Dellamonica P.

8310967,Skin disorders of pregnancy.,"Skin disorders of pregnancy fall into three major groups: disorders due to physiologic changes, specific skin disorders of pregnancy, and skin tumors. Elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone stimulate melanogenesis, which causes hyperpigmentation, including melasma; high levels of circulating hormones also cause vascular changes and alter hair growth cycles. Specific skin disorders of pregnancy range from pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy and pruritus gravidarum, which are fairly common, to pemphigus gestationis and impetigo herpetiformis, which are rare. Common skin tumors in pregnant women include pyogenic granuloma, which occurs primarily in the gingiva, and molluscum fibrosum gravidarum, or skin tags. While the effect of pregnancy on malignant melanoma continues to be disputed, recent studies indicate that long-term survival is close to that in the general population, although the disease-free interval is reduced.","['Errickson CV', 'Matus NR']",1994,49,3,Am Fam Physician,Errickson CV and Matus NR.

7768152,Potential therapeutic applications of magainins and other antimicrobial agents of animal origin.,"Magainins are a family of linear, amphipathic, cationic antimicrobial peptides, 21 to 27 residues in length, found in the skin of Xenopus laevis. They kill microbial targets through disruption of membrane permeability. They exhibit selectivity, on the basis of their affinity for membranes which contain accessible acidic phospholipids, a property characterizing the cytoplasmic membranes of many species of bacteria. Magainins are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents exhibiting cidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and protozoa. In addition these peptides lyse many types of murine and human cancer cells at concentrations 5-10-fold lower than normal human cells. Because of their selectivity, broad spectrum, low degree of bacterial resistance and ease of chemical synthesis, magainins are being developed as human therapeutic agents. The most advanced candidate is MSI-78, a 22-residue magainin analogue. This peptide is currently in human Phase IIb/III clinical trials in studies intended to evaluate its efficacy as a topical agent for the treatment of impetigo. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that analogues of magainin exhibit activity in vivo against malignant melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in mouse models. Intravenous administration of several magainin analogues has been shown to treat effectively systemic Escherichia coli infections in the mouse.","['Jacob L', 'Zasloff M']",1994,186,,Ciba Found Symp,Jacob L and Zasloff M.

Impetigo, ecthyma, and folliculitis are all seen. Recurrences are common due to a nasal carriage rate of 50%. Dermatophytosis usually manifests as tinea pedis or unguium and is caused by Trichophyton rubrum. Oral candidiasis may be the initial evidence of HIV infection, and is predictive of more rapid progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Topical agents are usually effective for oral lesions, but involvement of the esophagus requires oral imidazole therapy. Systemic fungal infections are most commonly caused by cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis. The finding of either of these infectious agents in the skin is pathognomonic of disseminated infection. Cryptococcus presents as umbilicated papules resembling molluscum or as large ulcerations. Histoplasmosis has no specific cutaneous morphology.

8281013,Insertional mutation of the hairless locus on mouse chromosome 14.,"Crosses between heterozygous transgenic mice from line 5053 produced offspring with progressive irreversible hair loss beginning at day 19. With increasing age, the skin of these animals became thicker and plicated in appearance. Histological analysis revealed the complete absence of normal hair follicles and numerous intradermic cystic structures, which enlarged with time and became filled with keratinaceous material. Test crosses demonstrated that the affected animals are homozygous for the transgene insertion. The clinical and histological phenotype of the new mutant closely resembles that of the rhino allele at the hairless locus on Chromosome (Chr) 14. Complementation tests and linkage analysis indicate that the transgene has interrupted the hairless locus. It has been demonstrated previously that mutation at the hr locus is accompanied by a variety of immune deficiencies. Many of the older affected transgenic mice developed an impetigo-like skin eruption which responded to antibiotic ointment and which may reflect impaired immune function. The transgenic allele, hrTgN5053Mm, will be useful for identification of the transcription unit of the hairless locus.","['Jones JM', 'Elder JT', 'Simin K', 'Keller SA', 'Meisler MH']",1993,4,11,Mamm Genome,"Jones JM, et al.

The streptokinase gene (ska) has previously been grouped into nine different polymorphic genotypes of which ska1, ska2, ska6, and ska9 were identified in group A streptococci associated with clinical and experimental APSGN. A total of 53 group A streptococci isolated from Ethiopian children: five from acute rheumatic fever, 18 from APSGN, ten each from tonsillitis, impetigo and healthy carriers, were analyzed for ska gene polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme analysis. The frequency of the nephritis-associated streptokinase genotypes was 83% among the APSGN isolates and 74% in the non-ASPGN isolates. ska2 was the most commonly found genotype with a frequency of 64% among all isolates, 66% among the APSGN isolates, and 63% among the non-APSGN isolates. ska1 was identified in 13% among all isolates and 17% among the APSGN isolates. Seventeen non-APSGN isolates from Scandinavian countries were studied for comparison and all carried either ska1 or ska2. The other nephritis-associated ska6 and ska9 were not detected among the 53 Ethiopian isolates. ska1 was exclusively associated with serum opacity reaction (SOR) producers. ska2 was evenly distributed among SOR-positive and SOR-negative isolates. The other genotypes were detected only among SOR-negative strains. The findings of the present study showed an even distribution of the nephritis-associated streptokinase gene among group A streptococcal isolates with no correlation to disease pattern. Thus additional factors must also be operative in the pathogenesis of APSGN.","['Tewodros W', 'Nordstrand A', 'Kronvall G', 'Holm SE', 'Norgren M']",1993,15,4,Microb Pathog,"Tewodros W, et al.

8228149,Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among hospital employees.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of clinical infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in healthcare workers.
DESIGN: Case series.
SETTING: Two Veterans Affairs hospitals in which methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) is endemic.
PATIENTS: Five employees presenting to employee health or infectious disease clinic.
RESULTS: All employees had had direct exposure to patients colonized with MRSA. Employee infections included cellulitis, impetigo, folliculitis, paronychia, and conjunctivitis. MRSA was isolated from all clinically infected sites and from the anterior nares of two employees. Three employees received a variety of ineffective oral antimicrobials before MRSA was recognized as the causative agent. All infections responded to appropriate therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Employees of hospitals with endemic MRSA may acquire MRSA infection. Presentation in our employees was that of relatively uncomplicated soft tissue infection, but several employees received inappropriate therapy before bacteriologic diagnosis. We recommend that culture and susceptibility testing be obtained prior to institution of therapy when hospital employees present with soft tissue infection.","['Muder RR', 'Brennen C', 'Goetz AM']",1993,14,10,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Muder RR, et al.

This study was conducted to examine the effect of zinc supplementation on phagocytic, fungicidal and metabolic activity of blood monocytes of marasmic infants during nutritional rehabilitation. A controlled, double-blind design was used in which 19 infants fed a zinc-fortified formula were compared with 20 infants fed the same, unfortified formula. Evaluation of phagocytic-fungicidal capacity, growth, zinc, copper and iron status was performed in both groups on admission and after 60 and 105 days of nutritional rehabilitation. Although energy, copper and iron intakes were similar in the two groups, a decrease in the number of infants able to phagocytose one or more Candida buds was observed after 60 days of zinc supplementation compared to admission (p < 0.03). No change in phagocytic ability was detected between admission and 60 days in the control group. The number of infants with depressed fungicidal activity increased significantly after 105 days of nutritional rehabilitation in the zinc-fortified group as compared to controls (p < 0.04). The number and duration of impetigo episodes was significantly greater in the group fed the zinc-fortified formula. These results suggest that zinc supplements at the RDA level may impair monocyte function.","['Schlesinger L', 'Arevalo M', 'Arredondo S', 'Lönnerdal B', 'Stekel A']",1993,82,9,Acta Paediatr,"Schlesinger L, et al.

7909266,Influence of staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid on the frustrated phagocytosis of neutrophils against opsonized corneocytes.,"Stratum corneum (SC) exerts a proinflammatory effect in the presence of complement. When Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) invades the skin through damaged SC, neutrophils accumulate at the subcorneal portion of epidermis to phagocytize the S. aureus as noted in impetigo. Besides the phagocytosis of bacteria, neutrophils interact with opsonized SC in a form of frustrated phagocytosis, increasing a damage of the surrounding tissues. Based on our previous finding that staphylococcal protein A promotes the interaction between SC and neutrophils, we investigated whether lipoteichoic acid (LTA), another cell wall component of S. aureus, also shows similar properties. We found that LTA significantly promoted the binding of neutrophils to opsonized SC, resulting in an increase in SC-induced respiratory burst of neutrophils assessed by chemiluminescence (CL). The binding of neutrophils to the SC was almost completely inhibited by the blocking of CR3 with anti-CD11b antibody, suggesting that the binding between SC and neutrophils is mediated by interaction between C3bi and CR3 (Mac-1). Such enhanced interaction seems to function in the primary host defence mechanism against the invading S. aureus through the skin such as in impetigo.","['Kato T', 'Terui T', 'Zhen YX', 'Tagami H']",1993,2,4,Exp Dermatol,"Kato T, et al.

8241071,Production of staphylococcal impetigo-like lesion on human skin explants in culture.,"We produced a highly reproducible experimental impetigo-like lesion in normal human skin explants in culture. The three Staphylococcus aureus strains we used were an isolate from a human impetigo (E strain), an isolate from a human furunculosis (N strain) and ATCC 29213 strain. E strain was a protein A positive, coagulase type V, producer of exfoliative toxin (ET) and beta-toxin. N strain was a coagulase type IV, ET non-producer and alpha-toxin positive. ATCC 29213 was a coagulase type II, ET non-producer, and alpha-, beta-, and delta-toxin positive. Normal human skin samples were obtained from 8 adult skin surgery patients. One specimen was obtained from human oral mucosa. Small pieces of the samples were slightly abraded on the epidermal surface and cultured on lens paper rafts floating in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fifty microliters of the respective bacterial suspensions were applied to the epidermal surfaces of the explants. The inoculated surfaces were then occluded under sterile plastic plaster. Histologically, the formation of intraepidermal blisters at the granular layer level with acantholytic cells was observed in all 8 of the skin specimens at 10 h after inoculation with E strain. The specimen from an oral mucous membrane did not produce similar changes with any of the three S. aureus strains. Neither N or ATCC strains developed bullae in the epidermis at 6, 10 or 18 h after inoculation. Immunofluorescent examination revealed that the inner surfaces of blisters in the epidermis were lined with anti-ETA antibody. Under the electron microscope, the blisters of the specimens which had been inoculated with strain E contained only a few S. aureus cells. These results suggest that blister formation at the granular layer level with acantholytic cells is mediated by ET action at the granular layer level and occurs without invasion of lymphocytes or neutrophils, or the involvement of any serum components. Therefore, under appropriate conditions, impetigo could develop even in adults.","['Abe Y', 'Akiyama H', 'Arata J']",1993,5,3,J Dermatol Sci,"Abe Y, et al.

For a molecular epidemiological analysis of the gene of erythrogenic toxin type A (speA) we used altogether 497 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes belonging to three groups: a) isolates from patients with scarlet fever, b) isolates from cases with TSLS, c) isolates from patients with other streptococcal infections (like otitis media, tonsillitis, impetigo) (general group). We found that less than 50% of the scarlet fever-associated strains possessed the speA gene as compared to 25% of the general group. Only 5 to 30% of these strains secreted the toxin under experimental conditions in very low quantities. Among strains isolated from TSLS, 67% appeared to contain the speA gene. The amount of ETA secreted into the medium was also extremely low. Southern hybridization patterns proved to be the same with an speA-specific probe in all three groups of streptococcal isolates (HaeIII, HindIII). Increased occurrence of the speA gene among scarlet fever and TSLS-associated strains does not seem to be sufficient to support the hypothesis that ETA may have a causative role in both diseases since a considerable number of strains in these groups did not possess the speA gene.","['Reichardt W', 'Müller-Alouf H', 'Köhler W']",1993,279,2,Zentralbl Bakteriol,"Reichardt W, et al.

Superficial infections such as impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, and subcutaneous bursitis are common and, for the most part, can be easily treated. Because suppurative tenosynovitis has the potential to destroy tendons, consultation with a hand surgeon should be obtained immediately. Mycobacterial and fungal tenosynovitis is usually chronic and patients present with a mass which, when excised and examined with appropriate stain and culture, reveals the unexpected diagnosis. Tropical myositis (muscle abscesses) is seen in temperate climates, primarily as a complication of AIDS. Necrotizing fasciitis and gas gangrene represent the hyperacute end of the spectrum of soft tissue restrictions. Although in most cases a history of trauma is present, spontaneous gas gangrene may arise from occult and colonic cancer. Patients do poorly unless immediate and extensive surgery is performed and appropriate antibiotics are given.","['Canoso JJ', 'Barza M']",1993,19,2,Rheum Dis Clin North Am,Canoso JJ and Barza M.

8323739,Distribution of presumptive pathogenicity factors among beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from Ethiopia.,"Beta-hemolytic streptococci are known to bind several mammalian proteins, which are presumed to be important in pathogenicity. The distribution of such binding structures was examined for mouse albumin, human serum IgA, human IgG, human fibrinogen, and human plasminogen. A total of 218 group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) were studied: 5 isolates from children with acute rheumatic fever (ARF), 18 from acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), 57 from tonsillitis, 52 from skin infections, and 86 from healthy carriers. Sixty-eight Streptococcus equisimilis and 20 group G streptococci were also included. Most of the S. equisimilis (60/68) and group G (14/20) were obtained from apparently healthy carriers. The results were evaluated with respect to T type, serum opacity reaction (SOR), site of isolation, and disease type. No direct correlation was detected between the protein-binding structures studied. There was no apparent correlation between any particular protein-binding structure and specific T type. Albumin-binding and IgA-binding activities were inversely correlated among skin and nephritis GAS isolates. A strong correlation was demonstrated between IgA-binding activity and SOR production, while albumin-binding activity correlated with SOR-negative strains. Albumin-binding levels in isolates from ARF, APSGN and tonsillitis were significantly higher than in isolates from healthy carriers (P < 0.001). A higher albumin-binding capacity was shown in skin isolates from APSGN than in isolates from impetigo (P < 0.001).","['Tewodros W', 'Kronvall G']",1993,101,4,APMIS,Tewodros W and Kronvall G.

We especially examined methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from the point of view of incidence, variety of skin infections with MRSA, coagulase type, phase type, and resistance against antimicrobial agents. The frequency of isolation of MRSA has been increasing. In 1991, the proportion of MRSA isolates among all S. aureus strains isolated from skin infections was 41.5%. MRSA was isolated most often from infectious decubitus. Coagulase type II and phage group NT (not typable) MRSA were most frequently isolated. The resistance of MRSA to OFLX and IMP/CS had remarkably increased. Notably, the resistance to MINO was low before 1991.","['Nishijima S', 'Namura S', 'Mitsuya K', 'Asada Y']",1993,20,4,J Dermatol,"Nishijima S, et al.

8452174,Comparative efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium in skin and soft tissue infections.,"The objective of this open-label, randomized, multicenter study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fleroxacin, 400 mg administered orally once daily, and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (AMX/CP), 500 mg/125 mg administered orally three times daily, for 4-21 days to patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The specific diagnoses in both groups were primarily skin abscess, impetigo, and skin ulcer, as well as wound infection erysipelas, folliculitis, cellulitis, and lymphangitis. A total of 285 patients were randomized to treatment in a 2:1 ratio, 190 in the fleroxacin group and 95 in the AMX/CP group. Adult male or female inpatients or outpatients were included in the trial and were followed up after 3-5 days of therapy and 3-9 days after completion of therapy for assessment of bacteriologic, clinical, and safety parameters. The most frequently isolated pathogen in both treatment groups was Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteriologic cures were observed in 87 (76%) of 115 evaluable patients in the fleroxacin group and in 41 (72%) of 57 evaluable patients in the AMX/CP group. Clinical cure was seen in 86 (75%) of 114 patients in the fleroxacin group and 45 (79%) of 57 patients in the AMX/CP group. Clinical adverse events related to the trial medication were reported by 40 (21%) of 189 patients in the fleroxacin group and by 16 (17%) of 95 patients in the AMX/CP group. In both groups, most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and involved the digestive system (primarily diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting). In the fleroxacin group, adverse events affecting the central nervous system (mainly dizziness, insomnia, somnolence) also were reported. In this study, both fleroxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium were effective and well tolerated in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.",['Tassler H'],1993,94,3A,Am J Med,Tassler H.

8460652,Occipital lesions: a possible cost of cradleboards.,"This examination of a Mimbres-Mogollon pueblo skeletal sample reveals a surprising percentage of individuals with occipital lesions. Each lesion is located in the approximate center of the squama immediately superior to the external occipital protuberance. Notably, no child over the age of 1 year exhibits a lesion that would have been active at the time of death, but a number of older children and adults exhibit evidence of healed lesions in this same area on the occipital. The restricted nature of these lesions, in terms of both their locations and ages of those actively affected, suggests that the use of cradleboards may have been at least a contributing, if not initiatory, factor in their creation. Specifically, this study suggests that the pressure and friction of an infant's head against a cradleboard may have 1) produced ischemic ulcers, 2) produced the conditions favorable for bacterial infections such as impetigo or carbuncles, or 3) complicated the treatment of other infections appearing on the back of the scalp.",['Holliday DY'],1993,90,3,Am J Phys Anthropol,Holliday DY.

8440064,Recurrent impetiginized eczema as a presenting manifestation of cyclic neutropenia.,"A patient is described with a persistent, impetiginized dermatitis that worsened periodically, which was preceded by neutropenic episodes during which her circulating neutrophil count fell to 500-600/ml. Each episode lasted 24 h and had a 7-11 day periodicity. The importance of this case depends on the frequency and brevity of the neutrophil trough levels that made the dermatitis appear to be continuous. Similar cases may be more common than expected as isolated abnormal leukocyte counts may be disregarded as laboratory artefacts. Dermatologists should be cautious in managing patients with persistent atypical impetigo.","['Parodi A', 'Parentini AM', 'Rebora A']",1993,18,1,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Parodi A, et al.

8435912,The staphylococci. Importance of their control in the management of skin disease.,"For skin diseases such as impetigo and furunculosis in which infection with S. aureus is the primary pathologic event, control of that infection is obviously paramount in the management of the clinical situation. The available antistaphylococcal agents are highly effective, and topical mupirocin has been a valuable recent addition. In conditions such as AD the position is less clear. Because the presence of the underlying disease is a prerequisite for the staphylococcal colonization, the exact role of staphylococcal damage is difficult to separate from the underlying disease activity. The definitive experiment, whereby staphylococcal colonization is eradicated over a prolonged period of time by a nonirritant method, remains to be performed. Until that time it is reasonable to pursue a policy of treating S. aureus colonization when it is believed to be of clinical significance and not simply on the basis of bacteriologic findings.","['Williams RE', 'MacKie RM']",1993,11,1,Dermatol Clin,Williams RE and MacKie RM.

8290447,Prevention and control of nosocomial infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a premature infant ward--preventive effect of a povidone-iodine wipe of neonatal skin.,"In early 1983 we experienced a small scale epidemic of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase type IV in the premature infants unit. Children had bacteraemia or impetigo. The microorganism was resistant to methicillin, erythromycin and lincomycin and was susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cefmetazole. The results of coagulase typing and antimicrobial sensitivities indicated that these cases represented nosocomial infection with MRSA. The source and route of the infection were investigated, and measures were taken to prevent bacterial spread from carriers and to keep instruments and environments clean. As the source of infection was not identified, we tried wiping the body surface of the premature infants with a diluted IsodineR solution (10% povidone-iodine; 1:100 dilution) in order to prevent colonization of the microorganism on the body surface. As a result, no additional MRSA infection occurred in the premature infant unit. During the subsequent 6 years of frequent surveys of carriers and wiping the appropriate body surface with diluted IsodineR solution we have had no recurrence of MRSA. None of the premature infants wiped with IsodineR solution showed any objective abnormalities, although laboratory testing disclosed an elevated blood iodine level and a transient mild reduction of T4 in some infants.","['Aihara M', 'Sakai M', 'Iwasaki M', 'Shimakawa K', 'Kozaki S', 'Kubo M', 'Jyohki M', 'Takahasi H', 'Akaishi K', 'Yamamoto I']",1993,69 Suppl 3,,Postgrad Med J,"Aihara M, et al.

1289588,[Clinical studies on cefprozil granules in pediatric skin soft tissues infections].,"Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed cephalosporin in fine granular form, was administered to pediatric patients with skin and soft tissue infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC), cloxacillin (MCIPC) against 53 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from these patients. An inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml was used in the MIC-determinations. CFPZ was given to 73 patients with ages ranging from 6 months to 10 years and 8 months and 71 cases were evaluable for clinical effects as follows; impetigo (65), Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (1), furuncle (1), subcutaneous abscess (3), and periproctal abscess (1). To study clinical efficacy, bacteriological effects and safety of this drug, a mean dose of 8.4 mg/kg with 3-4 daily dosages (57 cases of t.i.d. and 14 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 6 days. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to the 53 isolates of S. aureus, MICs of CFPZ against 52 strains (98.1%) ranged from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. 45 strains (84.9%) were inhibited at 0.78 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CFPZ was 1.56 micrograms/ml, but MIC against 1 strain of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 of CEX and CCL were 6.25 micrograms/ml and MIC of CEX and CCL against 1 MRSA strain were 200 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of ABPC, DMPPC and MCIPC were 6.25, 3.13 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. CFPZ showed the second highest activity after MCIPC against S. aureus. 2. CFPZ showed very good clinical responses and clinical effects in 71 patients all of whom judged by doctors in charge as having ""good"" or better responses. 3. For impetigo patients, the evaluable cases by score 3, 5 and 7 days after administration of the drug were 52, 39 and 20 patients, respectively. The efficacy rates on these days were 90.4, 100 and 100%, respectively. The efficacy rate at a daily dose of 30.1-45.0 mg/kg on day 3 was 17.2% higher than that at 22.5-30.0 mg/kg, and the ""excellent"" response rate of 30.1-45.0 mg/kg group was 45.3% greater. Because of these results, it is expected that good clinical effects can be obtained at a daily dose of 22.5-30.0 mg/kg of CFPZ, but better responses can be expected at 30.1-45.0 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses given for 5 days. 4.

Little is known, however, about the epidemiology of beta-haemolytic streptococci in Ethiopia. A total of 816 children were studied during a one-year period: 24 cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), 44 chronic rheumatic heart disease (CRHD), 44 acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), 143 tonsillitis, 55 impetigo, and 506 were apparently healthy children. Both ARF and APSGN occurred throughout the year with two peaks during the rainy and cold seasons. The female:male ratio among ARF patients was 1.4:1 and 1:1.9 among APSGN. The monthly carrier rate of beta-haemolytic streptococci group A varied from 7.5-39%, average being 17%. T type 2 was the most frequent serotype. Marked seasonal fluctuations were noted in the distribution of serogroups among apparently healthy children. Beta-haemolytic streptococci group A dominated during the hot and humid months of February-May.

1419984,Role of fibronectin in the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to dermal tissues.,"Staphylococcus aureus has a fibronectin receptor on its surface. Fibronectin seems to play a role in the initiation and modification of infection with S. aureus. We studied the role of fibronectin in the binding of S. aureus (clinical isolates) to dermal tissues in mice, and the relationship between the fibronectin binding ability of S. aureus and clinical features of S. aureus skin infections. Mice were inoculated with S. aureus incubated with gold-particles bound fibronectin and skin specimens were taken for electron microscopic examination. The number of gold particles surrounding the S. aureus cells decreased with time, with none detected 4 h after inoculation. At both 5 min and 1 h after inoculation, gold particles were only found on the free surface of S. aureus cells and not in the interface between S. aureus cells and fibroblasts. Fibronectin-bound gold particles were bound more extensively to S. aureus strains isolated from furunculosis or furuncle than to those from bullous impetigo. These results suggest that the matrix fibronectin on the surface of the fibroblasts of mice contributes to the adherence of S. aureus to the fibroblasts, and that the number of fibronectin binding sites on S. aureus cells is related to the degree of local invasiveness.","['Kanzaki H', 'Arata J']",1992,4,2,J Dermatol Sci,Kanzaki H and Arata J.

1390457,Production of experimental staphylococcal impetigo in mice.,"We produced a staphylococcal impetigo model by epicutaneous inoculation in mature mice. A strain isolated from a human impetigo was used. Five-week-old female mice (ddy-strain) were used with and without pre-treatment by cyclophosphamide (Cy) (2 mg/mouse) for 5 days. The back skin of mice was shaved by a razor blade and slightly abraded by sand paper. Bacterial suspension (1.4 x 10(7) CFU/0.05 ml) was applied on the abraded areas which were then occluded under sterile plastic plaster. Although intraepidermal blisters developed in non-Cy-treated mice, massive neutrophil infiltration obscured the changes there. Development of subcorneal bullae in Cy-treated mice inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus was first observed at 3h and enlargement of bullae was apparent at 12 h after inoculation. The bullae produced in Cy-treated mice contained numerous S. aureus bacilli. Electronmicroscopically, S. aureus cells invaded the horny layer at 1/4 h. A clear halo was seen between S. aureus cells and horny cells. S. aureus cells attached to surrounding horny cells by fibril-like structures. The halo-like spaces became larger, coalesced and then developed into an intraepidermal blister. Our new method to produce human impetigo-like blister in Cy-treated adult mice may contribute to disclosing the mechanisms of blister formation in epidermis by S. aureus. Due to the thin structure of mouse epidermis, only specimens taken earlier than 24 h after inoculation were considered appropriate.","['Abe Y', 'Akiyama H', 'Arata J']",1992,4,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Abe Y, et al.

DESIGN: A longitudinal descriptive study (1984-9).
SETTING: A private primary care and STD clinic in Sydney, Australia.
SUBJECTS: 88 homosexual men documented to seroconvert to HIV-1, and 37 homosexual controls who had practised unprotected anal intercourse with another man known to be HIV-1 positive but who remained HIV-1 negative.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of bullous impetigo.
RESULTS: The crude annual incidence of bullous impetigo was 0.015 in subjects while they remained HIV-1 negative (10 cases) and 0.045 in early HIV-1 positive subjects (2 cases). Overall, 9% of the HIV-1 seroconverters and 9% of the HIV-1 negative controls were documented as suffering bullous impetigo over a mean of 29.2 and 39.3 months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Bullous impetigo in an adult could prove to be a clinical indication that a person is either infected with HIV-1 or is in close (possibly sexual) contact with a person with HIV-1 infection. If true, the recognition of bullous impetigo could provide an opportunity for behavioural intervention to limit the spread of HIV-1.","['Donovan B', 'Rohrsheim R', 'Bassett I', 'Mulhall BP']",1992,68,3,Genitourin Med,"Donovan B, et al.

1565046,Streptococcal infection and renal disease markers in Australian aboriginal children.,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate an association between markers of streptococcal infection and markers of glomerulonephritis in Aboriginal children.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of Aboriginal children of school age.
SETTING: Three Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory--two, coastal and one, desert.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty children, randomly selected from the school roll, were studied in each community; thus there were 180 children in total, aged 5-17 years. Midstream urine and venous blood was collected and swabs were taken from the pharynx and from impetiginous skin lesions or axillary skin in the absence of impetigo. Clinical records were examined for evidence of past glomerulonephritis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Swabs were cultured for beta-haemolytic streptococci and isolates were grouped; serum was tested for titres of antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNaseB). Protein and creatinine levels were measured in urine, and a ratio of protein to creatinine (UPC) of more than 50 mg protein per mmol creatinine was taken as a measure of significant proteinuria. Urine was examined microscopically for glomerular haematuria (greater than 10 red blood cells per microL with at least 20% dysmorphic red cells).
RESULTS: Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated from the throat swabs of two children and from skin swabs of 25 (13.9%) children; 20 of these were from impetiginous lesions and five from normal axillary skin. beta-Haemolytic streptococci of group C or G were grown from the throat swabs of 13 (8.1%) children. The median titre of ASO (256 IU) was raised compared with a reference level, and the median titre of anti-DNaseB (3172 IU) was particularly high; ASO titres were significantly higher in 31 children with impetigo than in 149 children without impetigo. Significant proteinuria was present in 7 (3.9%) children and glomerular haematuria in 16 (8.9%). Glomerular haematuria was present in 2/7 (28%) children with proteinuria, 4/21 (19%) children with a past history of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, in 5/31 (16%) of those with impetigo and in 4/25 (16%) of those with positive skin cultures. However, none of these prevalences was significantly greater than the prevalence of glomerular haematuria among the other children. The prevalence of proteinuria differed significantly between communities and increased significantly with age. Furthermore, the differences in childhood proteinuria observed between communities in this study were parallel with community differences in the prevalence of proteinuria in a related study of adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Group A streptococci are important causes of impetigo in Aboriginal children. Streptococcal skin infection may contribute to glomerular haematuria, proteinuria and persistent glomerulonephritis in Aboriginal children, and possibly to chronic glomerulonephritis in adult life. Public health programs are needed to reduce the prevalence of impetigo and group A streptococcal infections in Aboriginal communities; longitudinal studies are needed to test the relationship between streptococcal skin infection in Aboriginal children and chronic renal disease in later life.","['Van Buynder PG', 'Gaggin JA', 'Martin D', 'Pugsley D', 'Mathews JD']",1992,156,8,Med J Aust,"Van Buynder PG, et al.

1550713,Streptococcal skin diseases in children.,"Infections with streptococcal bacteria continue to be a common problem in children. They can produce cutaneous manifestations via three main mechanisms: (1) direct infection of the skin; (2) toxin-mediated disease; and (3) immunologically mediated disease. This review updates a variety of streptococcal diseases involving the skin. The changing bacteriology of impetigo is addressed, as well as the resurgence of rheumatic fever. A new manifestation of invasive streptococcal infection, termed streptococcal toxic shocklike syndrome, is also presented. Many changes in the epidemiology of streptococcal infections during the 1980s can be traced to the reemergence of more virulent strains of the organism. The impact of this natural occurrence is discussed. Therapeutic recommendations are presented for each disease, and the value of rapid streptococcal tests is reviewed.","['Barnett BO', 'Frieden IJ']",1992,11,1,Semin Dermatol,Barnett BO and Frieden IJ.

1550711,Staphylococcal toxin-mediated syndromes in childhood.,"Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) are two distinct toxin-mediated syndromes with prominent cutaneous features. The exanthematous presentation of these syndromes places them in the broad category of childhood exanthems, and the ability to recognize these potentially devastating illnesses is essential for pediatricians and dermatologists who may encounter children with fever and rash. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these entities has helped to explain the distinctive clinical presentations of TSS and SSSS. Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and enterotoxins are the secretory products of Staphylococcus aureus that lead to TSS. Many of the clinical features of TSS (fever, shock, multiple organ dysfunction) can be explained by the effects of cytokines (especially interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor) induced by TSST-1. TSS is not an exclusively menstrual event associated with tampon use. Nonmenstrual pediatric TSS may be associated with a wide variety of staphylococcal infections. Infected burn wounds in hospitalized children and bacterial tracheitis (in some cases following influenza B infection) are relatively high-risk settings for pediatric TSS. The epidermolytic toxins (A and B) directly produce subgranular epidermolysis leading to SSSS. SSSS encompasses a clinical spectrum from bullous impetigo to the widespread exfoliation of the Ritter disease variant of SSSS. This entity usually occurs in children under 5 years of age, and is primarily explained by lack of immunity to the toxins as well as renal immaturity leading to poor clearance of toxin. The newborn nursery is an important setting where epidemics of SSSS have occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Resnick SD'],1992,11,1,Semin Dermatol,Resnick SD.

1734386,Cost-effectiveness of erythromycin versus mupirocin for the treatment of impetigo in children.,"A new topical antibiotic, mupirocin, has been found to be as effective as erythromycin for the treatment of impetigo, but concerns about its expense have been raised. This controlled clinical trial sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of erythromycin (E) and mupirocin (M). Ninety-three children, aged 3 months to 16 years, were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of oral erythromycin (n = 46) or topical mupirocin (n = 47). Costs and effects were measured through structured interviews. Cost per case differed significantly by group (E = $56.85; M = $62.30; P less than .05) due chiefly to extra visits and medication changes needed by those treated with mupirocin. Erythromycin and mupirocin were equally effective. The likelihood of side effects (E = 43%, M = 22%) approached significance (P less than .07); those treated with erythromycin were willing to pay more for a different medicine to avoid the side effects experienced (P less than .05). Working parents and school-age children were more likely to alter their daily activities when the patient was taking erythromycin (P less than .04). Compliance and parental satisfaction did not differ by treatment group; however, parents of children treated with erythromycin were more likely to prefer the alternate drug regimen. It is concluded that the type of medication prescribed can be based on parental preference because the increased cost of mupirocin is offset by increased side effects and number of schooldays and workdays lost with erythromycin.","['Rice TD', 'Duggan AK', 'DeAngelis C']",1992,89,2,Pediatrics,"Rice TD, et al.

1605593,Double-blind study comparing erythromycin and mupirocin for treatment of impetigo in children: implications of a high prevalence of erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.,"Staphylococcus aureus has been consistently isolated from a high proportion of impetiginous lesions, and in several recent studies, it was present in the majority of the cases. Since recently a large proportion of S. aureus strains in our community showed erythromycin resistance, we undertook a prospective double-blind controlled study comparing topical mupirocin with oral erythromycin to determine (i) the prevalence of erythromycin-resistant S. aureus strains in impetigo and (ii) whether an increased rate of failure of erythromycin treatment was associated with such resistance. A total of 102 patients 3 to 185 months old (median = 49 months) were enrolled. Culture was positive for 97 of 102 (95%) patients, and S. aureus was present in 93% of the patients for whom cultures were positive. S. aureus was the single pathogen in 64% of these patients. Erythromycin-resistant S. aureus strains were present in 27 of 91 (28%) patients for whom cultures were positive. In all cases but one, S. aureus was resistant to penicillin, and in all cases it was sensitive to mupirocin. A marked difference was observed in favor of mupirocin in the clinical courses of the disease. However, only patients with erythromycin-resistant S. aureus strains had unfavorable courses compared with those treated with mupirocin (failure rate, 47 versus 2%, respectively). Patients with erythromycin-susceptible S. aureus strains who received erythromycin had a failure rate of 8%. In four patients, S. aureus strains initially susceptible to erythromycin became resistant during treatment. We conclude that erythromycin-resistant S. aureus strains are commonly isolated from impetigo in our region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dagan R', 'Bar-David Y']",1992,36,2,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Dagan R and Bar-David Y.

1495197,[Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].,"Cefdinir (CFDN), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a 10% fine granular form, was administered to 8 children and concentrations of the drug in plasma and urine and urinary recovery rates of the drug were determined. The subjects were divided into 2 groups of 4 children each; one group received 3 mg/kg of CFDN at 1 hour before meal (in the fasting state), and the other, at 30 minutes after meal. To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean dose of 4.8 mg/kg t.i.d. was administered for 8 days on the average to 9 children with various infections; tonsillitis (3 cases), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (1), acute purulent otitis media (1), urinary tract infection (2), and impetigo (1). MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFDN, cefaclor, cefixime (CFIX), methicillin, cloxacillin, amoxicillin (AMPC) against 4 strains freshly isolated from children receiving CFDN. An inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml was used in the MIC-determinations. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory findings attributable to this drug were also examined in these children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Mean plasma peak levels of CFDN were observed at 2 hours after administration in the before-meal group and 4 or 5 hours after administration in the after-meal group mean peak values of 0.88 and 0.50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Mean half-lives were 1.61 hours in the before-meal group and 2.54 hours in the after-meal group, and mean AUCs were 4.24 in the former and 3.59 micrograms.hr/ml in the latter. 2. Mean urinary peak concentrations of CFDN were observed during 2-4 hours after dosing in the before-meal group and during 6-8 hours in the after-meal group with values of 93.3 and 44.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, in cases for which plasma concentrations of drugs were determined. Mean urinary recovery rates during the first 8 hours after administration in the before- and after-meal groups were 16.6 and 13.4%, respectively. 3. Good clinical effects were obtained with an efficacy rate of 100% in 9 patients with 6 diseases due to bacterial infections. 4. Good bacteriological effects were also obtained against 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain of Haemophilus influenzae with an eradication rate of 100%. In 3 cases of these and another case (normal flora), strains present before the study were replaced by other strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Motohiro T', 'Handa S', 'Yamada S', 'Oki S', 'Tsumura N', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Sasaki H', 'Aramaki M', 'Oda K', 'Kawakami A']",1992,45,1,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

1662878,Systemic management of cutaneous bacterial infections.,"Cutaneous bacterial infections can be treated by a variety of modalities, although systemic antimicrobial agents usually provide the most efficacious and efficient means for treatment. Oral administration allows outpatient management, thus decreasing the overall cost of treatment. Although gram-negative organisms are increasingly implicated in dermatologic infections, the bacteria that are commonly found in skin infections include group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, which cause many types of pyoderma or impetigo. Not every patient exhibits the common signs of bacterial skin infection, which can include redness, crusting, induration, increased local temperature, serous exudate, a purulent discharge, pustules, bullae, or a foul-smelling odor, as well as such symptoms as malaise, pain, and tenderness. Bacterial confirmation may also be difficult. Beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracycline, and erythromycin have proven useful in this setting; however, increasing resistance is problematic. The management of bacterial infections of the skin and skin structure has been expanded during the past decade with the introduction of the new fluoroquinolones--agents with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity and good pharmacokinetic characteristics. While the clinical efficacy of each agent must be considered in the light of risk of adverse events and potential drug interactions, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and temafloxacin appear to be most useful for cutaneous bacterial infections.","['Parish LC', 'Witkowski JA']",1991,91,6A,Am J Med,Parish LC and Witkowski JA.

This study compared 18 families having one or more active trachoma cases among the children with 16 trachoma-free families in the same village with respect to water use. Potential confounders such as family size, distance to water source, socio-economic indicators, and hygiene behaviour were assessed in the 2 groups. The families with trachoma were found to use significantly less water per person per day for washing children than did the control group (P = 0.033) with no evidence of confounding by the other measured variables. Low amounts of water for washing were also associated with unclean faces and impetigo in the children.

The results are summarized as follows. 1. Serum concentrations of FMOX were 17.4 micrograms/ml 1-hour after intravenous injection on the average in 5 cases who received approximately 10 mg/kg, 41.8 micrograms/ml in 2 cases given 20 mg/kg, and 69.6 micrograms/ml in 2 cases given 40 mg/kg, indicating that serum concentrations of FMOX changed in a dose-dependent manner in this range. Average serum half-life (T 1/2) in 4 mature babies was 2.48 hours and that in 6 premature babies was 3.17 hours, indicating that elimination rates in premature cases tend to be slower than those in mature cases. Urinary recovery rates averaged 39.2% in the first 6 hours in 5 cases examined. 2. Five newborns or premature babies received FMOX 33.1-80.2 mg/kg (b.i.d. or t.i.d.) via intravenous route for 5 to 8 days. FMOX showed excellent or good clinical effectiveness in the treatment of all patients including 1 case each of sepsis with urinary infection, furunclal otitis, impetigo, uterogenic fetus infection and urinary infection. Bacteriological responses were also studied, and eradication of identified organisms (Escherichia coli 3 strains and Staphylococcus aureus 2 strains) was obtained upon the FMOX treatment, but in 1 strain of S. aureus showed only a decrease. No adverse reactions were observed in any cases, but a slight elevation of eosinophil was noted in 1 patient receiving a dose of 210 mg a day. From the results obtained in these tests, FMOX appears to be very usefull and safe for the treatment of some infectious diseases in neonates.","['Okura K', 'Yamakawa M', 'Kuroki S', 'Haruta T', 'Kobayashi Y']",1991,44,11,Jpn J Antibiot,"Okura K, et al.

The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as ""eradicated"". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment.

Ten% CFDN granules were administered to a total of 21 children with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections or infectious impetigo at daily doses of 6.4-18 mg/kg divided into 3 portions. Clinical efficacies were ""excellent"" in 13 patients, ""good"" in 7 patients and ""unknown"" in 1 patient (viral infection), hence an efficacy of 100% was obtained. 2. Bacteria identified in various disease cases included 19 strains of 7 species, and the eradication rate was 100%. 3. No side effects were noted in any of the children. Laboratory test results showed an abnormality in 1 case with eosinophilia. These results suggest that 10% CFDN granules as well as 5% CFDN granules may be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.","['Niinou K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Sato H']",1991,44,10,Jpn J Antibiot,"Niinou K, et al.

2061433,Recent advances in pediatric infectious diseases and their impact on dermatology.,"The past five years have seen numerous advances in the field of pediatric infectious diseases, and many of these have a substantial impact on the practice of dermatology. We review some of these advances and discuss their implications on etiology, diagnosis, therapy and complications of some relatively common conditions. The etiologic agent of exanthum subitum (roseola infantum) has been clearly implicated as a herpesvirus-6. Although in the classically described situation high fever in a young child is followed by defervescence and rash, two new scenarios have been described associated with this virus. The first is fever without rash and the second is rash without fever. The etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum (""slapped cheek"") has been shown to be a human parvovirus B19. The virus has also been associated with aplastic crises (in hemoglobinopathies), hydrops fetalis, and a syndrome of subacute arthralgias in women. The etiologic agent in cat-scratch disease has recently been shown to be a small pleomorphic bacillus that also can produce pyogenic granuloma-like lesions in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The number of cases of congenital syphilis, particularly in large cities, is increasing tremendously. Many of these infants have received no prenatal care because of drug abuse problems in their parents. Finally, we describe the changing etiology of impetigo that is predominantly associated with Staphylococcus aureus. We further describe the growing resistance to erythromycin and several new erythromycin drug-drug interactions.","['Grossman KL', 'Rasmussen JE']",1991,24,3,J Am Acad Dermatol,Grossman KL and Rasmussen JE.

The latter include bacteria, viruses and fungi, especially Staphylococcus auerus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Pityrosporum orbiculare. In childhood, Impetigo around the big joints is frequently seen, while the characteristic reaction to S. auerus in the young adults is pruritic pustules on the extremities or an exacerbation of the eczema to an exudative dermatitis. Similarily, P. orbiculare may induce a flare-up of the eczema of the head and neck, while HSV may cause a true wide-spread infection known as eczema herpeticum. An immunological disorder, a fragile skin, and special properties of the microorganism may account for the altered response to infection or severe colonization in the patient with atopic eczema. During exacerbations of the eczema, supplementary treatment with proper antimicrobial agents has been shown to be of great value.",['Svejgaard E'],1990,9,4,Semin Dermatol,Svejgaard E.

Current etiology and comparison of penicillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin therapies.","We attempted to determine the causative bacterial pathogens of impetigo in children in our area, to compare the effectiveness of three frequently used oral antimicrobial treatment regimens, and to correlate the antimicrobial sensitivity of the bacterial isolates with clinical responses to treatment. Seventy-three children with impetigo were randomly assigned to receive penicillin V potassium or cephalexin monohydrate, both administered in dosages of 40 to 50 mg/kg per day, or erythromycin estolate administered in a dosage of 30 to 40 mg/kg per day. All drugs were given in three divided doses for 10 days. Treatment failure was defined as persistence of lesions 8 to 10 days after initiation of drug therapy as determined by examiners blinded to the treatment therapies. Forty-five (62%) cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus only, 14 (19%) showed S aureus and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, six (8%) showed group A beta-hemolytic streptococci only, and eight (11%) showed no growth or other organisms. Treatment failure occurred in six (24%) of 25 patients treated with penicillin V, one (4%) of 25 patients treated with erythromycin estolate, and no patients treated with cephalexin. We conclude that S aureus is the most common cause of impetigo in children in our study population, that cephalexin is the most effective treatment, that erythromycin estolate is nearly equally effective and may be preferred on a cost-effectiveness basis, and that penicillin V is inadequate for treatment of this infection.","['Demidovich CW', 'Wittler RR', 'Ruff ME', 'Bass JW', 'Browning WC']",1990,144,12,Am J Dis Child,"Demidovich CW, et al.

2236335,Antibiotic therapy for common infections.,"Several important points regarding the treatment of urinary tract infections should be made. Single-dose and short-course antibiotic therapy is appropriate only for women with acute bacterial cystitis due to E. coli. Studies comparing single-dose to full-course therapy have not been sufficiently designed to draw valid statistical conclusions, and only TMP/SMX is recommended at this time. Recurrent UTI in women is almost always due to reinfection, which is best managed by prophylactic antibiotics. Acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are often due to viral infections, and therefore antibiotic therapy is not always needed. In acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the clearest success rates for antibiotic therapy have been in patients, who have all three of the following symptoms: increased dyspnea, increased sputum production, and sputum purulence. Mupirocin is an important addition to the agents used to treat bacterial skin infections due to streptococcal and staphylococcal strains. In impetigo, mupirocin has been demonstrated to be as effective or superior to oral erythromycin. In prostatitis, data on the fluoroquinolones appears impressive, but further comparative trials are needed. They may become first-line, empiric therapy. The newer oral antibiotics are not recommended as initial, empiric therapy in the outpatient management of common infections, with the possible exception of the treatment of prostatitis. These newer agents may be more important in the treatment of recurrent or resistant infections.","['Ellison MJ', 'Crabtree DW']",1990,17,3,Prim Care,Ellison MJ and Crabtree DW.

At three surveys from November 1984 to May 1985, pharyngeal group A streptococcal carriage was 5.3%, 22%, and 34% in the Inuit community and 5.3%, 5.1% and 10% in the native Indian, with impetigo prevalence 1.6%, 3.8% and 1.0%, and 2.4%, 4.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Increased pharyngeal carriage correlated with the increasing number of household residents and the lower school grade. In 12 months of observation the incidence of group A streptococcal pharyngitis was 49/100 schoolchildren for the Inuit and 9.4/100 for the native Indian community, with impetigo 13/100 and 11/100 respectively. The maximal incidence of pharyngitis was late winter in the Inuit community and midsummer in the native Indian. The incidence of impetigo peaked in January for both communities. M and T typing showed consecutive outbreaks of different serotypes in the Inuit community, but a persistent low level of endemic infection in the Indian community. These observations suggest a seasonal prevalence of group A streptococcal pharyngeal carriage consistent with other North American populations, but marked inter-community variation in pharyngeal carriage and disease. The midwinter peak of impetigo appears unique to these populations.","['Nicolle LE', 'Postl B', 'Urias B', 'Law B', 'Ling N']",1990,13,3,Clin Invest Med,"Nicolle LE, et al.

2401810,"[Prevention and control of nosocomial infection caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in premature infant ward--prevention effect of ""povidone iodine solution"" wipe of neonatal skin].","In January 1983, a number of premature infants under management in the premature infants' unit of our hospital were found to have bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus. By the end of February of the same year, 4 of these infants, who had been treated in the same unit, developed impetigo. The S. aureus responsible for this condition was classified as type IV by a coagulase typing. In a subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility test using the disk diffusion method, this microorganism was found to be resistant to methicillin, erythromycin and lincomycin, and to be susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cefmetazole, indicating that it was a methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Because the result from the coagulase typing agreed with the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in all cases, we concluded that these cases represented nosocomial infection with MRSA. The source and route of the infection were investigated, and measures taken to prevent bacterial spread from carriers and to keep instruments and environments clean. Although the source of infection was not identified. Then, we tried wiping the body surface of the premature infants with an Isodine solution (10% PVP-I, 1:100 dilution) in order to prevent colonization of the microorganism on the body surface. With this application+, MRSA was no longer detected from the body surface of the premature infants, and no additional MRSA infection occurred in the premature infants' unit. Data collected for premature infants' managed at our hospital in the subsequent 6 years allows us to conclude that MRSA infection can be almost completely controlled by frequent surveys of carriers and appropriate body surface wiping with Isodine solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Aihara M', 'Sakai M', 'Iwasaki M', 'Shimakawa K', 'Kozaki S', 'Kubo M', 'Jyohki M', 'Takahashi H', 'Akaishi K', 'Yamamoto I']",1990,64,4,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Aihara M, et al.

2138653,A human IgG receptor of group A streptococci is associated with tissue site of infection and streptococcal class.,"The distribution of receptors for immunoglobulins of several different isotypes was examined for group A streptococcal isolates derived from skin and nasopharyngeal sites. Although human IgG-Fc receptor activity was a variable property of group A streptococci, found among 61% of all isolates tested, it was largely restricted to well-defined subpopulations. Human IgG-binding activity was observed among nearly all impetigo isolates examined. In addition, the expression of the class II M protein molecule (one of two broad antigenic classes of the major virulence factor) and opacity factor (a lipoproteinase) was almost invariably accompanied by human IgG binding, regardless of tissue site of infection. In contrast to class I impetigo isolates, class I nasopharyngeal isolates were relatively devoid of human IgG-binding activity. The data suggest that the presence or absence of human IgG-binding activity correlates with certain diseases caused by group A streptococci.","['Bessen D', 'Fischetti VA']",1990,161,4,J Infect Dis,Bessen D and Fischetti VA.

2180022,Common cutaneous disorders in athletes.,"Athletic activity may cause or aggravate skin disorders, which in turn may diminish athletic performance. Since many sporting activities necessitate prolonged exposure to the sun, athletes must avoid painful sunburn which will adversely affect their performance. Drugs and chemicals also may cause photoallergic and/or phototoxic reactions, including polymorphous light eruption and athletes should thus avoid photosensitising drugs and chemicals. The effects of chronic ultraviolet exposure include ageing, pigmentation and skin cancers. The most effective protection against excessive exposure to sunlight is the use of sunscreens, although inadequate application and poor protection in the UVA spectrum may diminish their effectiveness and contact allergies may create other problems. Viral, bacterial and fungal infections are common in athletes due to heat, friction and contact with others. Herpes simplex may be treated with any drying agents (e.g. alcohol) as they are as effective as more expensive topical agents such as acyclovir. Molluscum contagiosum may be spread by close contact or water contact and is treated by superficial incision, cryotherapy or standard wart varnishes. Plantar wart infection is transmitted by swimming pool decks, changing rooms and hand-to-hand from weights in gymnasiums. Plantar warts presenting with pain may be aggressively treated, by blunt dissection, but painless ones are best treated conservatively. Impetigo and folliculitis often develop after trauma. Antibiotics are effective against mild infections while abrasions and lacerations should be cleansed and dressed with occlusive dressings. Diphtheroid bacteria in moist footwear may produce pitted keratolysis and erythrasma. Tinea pedis is common in athletes and probably originates in swimming pools, gymnasium floors and locker rooms. Interdigital, dry-moccasin and pustular-midsole forms can be distinguished. The latter two forms respond to topical antifungal agents, while the interdigital form, a mixed fungal/bacterial infection, is treated with debridement, antibiotics and drying routine similar to the therapy of otitis externa. Nail infections by a variety of organisms may appear as onycholysis with or without paronychia and should be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. Tinea versicolor occurs in heat and humidity. Since Pityrosporum orbiculare is part of the normal flora it often recurs, necessitating regular treatment. Acute trauma injuries include contusions, black heel or petichiae of the heel, black toe (bleeding under the nail), 'jogger's nipple' caused by chafing, and foot blisters. Chronic trauma may result in calluses, corns and paronychia. Plantar corns can be disabling and may be caused by overly tight shoes or abnormalities in biomechanics; treatment includes restoring normal foot function and minimal surgical procedures. Paronychia is treated best by wedge resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Conklin RJ'],1990,9,2,Sports Med,Conklin RJ. Common cutaneous disorders in athletes.

2097147,Topical antibiotic therapy: current status and future prospects.,"As we enter a new decade, topical antibiotics are the subject of much renewed interest and are being used on a wider scale than ever before. The reasons for using topical rather than oral therapy for a variety of dermatoses include the reduced risk of systemic side effects, the avoidance of resistance selection in the gut microflora, the higher achievable concentration of antibiotic at the site of action and the overall usage of less drug. Somewhat surprisingly, treatment costs are not reduced by the use of topical therapy. The number of antibiotics licensed for topical use has increased in recent years and now includes representatives of the tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, aminoglycoside and peptide families of antibiotics in addition to fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and pseudomonic acid. Opinions regarding the clinical efficacy of topical antibiotics are conflicting, and for most indications alternative oral therapies are available. Topical antibiotics are the drugs of choice for the elimination of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus and for the therapy of eye and external ear infections. They are also effective in the treatment of impetigo and other superficial pyodermas and in the management of localised infected eczema. Topical preparations of erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline are widely prescribed for the therapy of acne and are of clinical benefit in mild--moderate cases. However, they are no more effective against inflamed lesions than benzoyl peroxide and are less effective against non-inflamed lesions. They are not as effective as oral tetracycline in moderate to severe acne and should not be considered as a therapy for severe acne, for which 13-cis-retinoic acid is the drug of choice. It is well known that many antibiotics, when used topically, especially for prolonged periods, select for antibiotic-resistant staphylococci at the skin surface. Tetracyclines, erythromycin and clindamycin also select for resistant staphylococci on the surface of intact skin when delivered by the oral route. The contribution of topical antibiotic usage to the current high level of antibiotic resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are increasingly implicated in infections of compromised hosts, has not been quantified, although it is known that cutaneous staphylococci possess a large pool of transferable resistance genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Eady EA', 'Cove JH']",1990,16,8,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Eady EA and Cove JH.

CMX 20 mg/kg was administered by intravenous bolus injection to 6 neonates (with ages 2 to 20 days) and 5 infants (with ages 36 to 107 days) and its serum concentration and urinary excretion rates were determined. In the neonates, serum concentrations of CMX after intravenous administration reached peak levels of 48.2 to 90.7 micrograms/ml (mean 70.4 +/- 14.3 micrograms/ml) in 1/4 hour, then declined with half-lives of 1.27 to 5.19 hours (mean 2.28 +/- 1.56 hours), and were 3.6 to 16.9 micrograms/ml (mean 8.3 +/- 6.0 micrograms/ml) at 6 hours. In the infants, serum concentrations at 1/4 hour were 67.5 to 111.0 micrograms/ml (mean 95.5 +/- 18.0 micrograms/ml); half-lives were 0.64 to 0.94 hour (mean 0.81 +/- 0.13 hour); and the serum concentrations at 6 hours were 0.2 to 1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml). Mean peak serum concentrations in the neonates tended to be lower than those in the infants, but higher than those in children. Regarding the age differences of serum concentrations due to age in the neonates, their peak levels tended to be lower in younger ones. Half-lives were shorter in older subjects and, in early infancy, approached values observed in children. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after intravenous administration ranged from 43.6 to 87.5% (mean 61.6 +/- 14.6%) in the neonates and from 52.1 to 90.8% (mean 78.0 +/- 15.1%) in the infants.

We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Motohiro T', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Oda K', 'Aramaki M', 'Kawakami A', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Tomita S', 'Sakata Y', 'Yamashita F']",1989,42,9,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

Fifty-one culture-positive patients, aged 6 months to 9 years, were included, 26 in the amoxicillin group and 25 in the Augmentin group. The study groups were clinically and bacteriologically comparable at the start of the study. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from all patients and beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 14 (29%). All staphylococci were sensitive to Augmentin but resistant to amoxicillin. Forty-nine patients completed the study. The clinical response was significantly better among the Augmentin recipients (marked improvement in 71% and 95% of patients after 2 and 5 days, respectively; no new lesions during the treatment course) than among the amoxicillin recipients (marked improvement in 44% and 68% of patients after 2 and 5 days, respectively; new lesions appeared in 20% of patients). Recurrence within 3 weeks occurred in 12 (26%) of 49 patients, and no difference was observed between the two groups.

2516463,Efficacy and safety of 2% mupirocin ointment in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infections--an open multicentre trial.,"Staphylococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci are usually responsible for causing common primary and secondary skin infections. Mupirocin (Bactroban, Eismycin; trademarks of Beecham Group plc), a new antibiotic unrelated to any other antibacterial agent and developed for topical use only, shows a high level of activity against these bacteria. In an open multicentre study the efficacy and safety of mupirocin (2% in a polyethylene glycol vehicle) was evaluated in 1,391 general practice patients with superficial skin infections. The most common skin infections treated were pyoderma (eg, impetigo, folliculitis) and secondarily infected skin lesions. Treatment consisted of application of the ointment three times daily for an average of nine days. A total of 1,304 patients were evaluable for post-treatment clinical assessment. At the end of the treatment 961 (73.7 per cent) patients were cured and in 293 (22.5 per cent) patients the symptoms of the infection had markedly improved. In total, 525 bacterial strains were isolated from the wounds of 445 patients, predominantly staphylococci (n = 344) and streptococci (n = 93). Local side effects such as burning, itching and reddening were observed in 39 (2.9 per cent) of 1,357 patients. No evidence of systemic toxicity or abnormal laboratory data was noted.

In this study, a new topical antibiotic ointment, mupirocin, was compared with oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate in the treatment of impetigo. Seventy-five patients clinically diagnosed as having impetigo and with positive cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both were examined in an investigator-blinded study. Patients used topical mupirocin applied three times daily or the usual oral dose of erythromycin ethylsuccinate (30 to 50 mg/kg per day). Patients' lesions were examined clinically and cultured bacteriologically on days 0, 3, and 8, and 1 week after treatment. Susceptibility testing was performed on pathogens isolated to determine antibiotic resistance. Mupirocin treatment produced similar clinical results to oral erythromycin and was superior in the eradication of S aureus, including antibiotic-resistant S aureus. These results show topical mupirocin to be a safe and effective alternative to oral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of impetigo.","['Mertz PM', 'Marshall DA', 'Eaglstein WH', 'Piovanetti Y', 'Montalvo J']",1989,125,8,Arch Dermatol,"Mertz PM, et al.

The drugs tested included 4 drugs of the cephem group, R-3746, a Na-salt form of CPDX, cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX) and cefadroxil (CDX), and 3 drugs of the penicillin group, ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC). The bacterial strains tested were 71 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, all isolated from the above cases of pediatric infections. Inoculum sizes used in these tests were 10(6) and 10(8) cfu/ml. Ages of children in those cases to which the drug was administered ranged from 2 months to 15 years. A total of 66 cases were treated, including 60 cases of impetigo, 5 cases of subcutaneous abscess and 1 case of phlegmon.

Mupirocin was applied twice daily and sodium fusidate thrice daily for a period of 7 days. Both treatments were similarly effective with 97% patients treated with mupirocin and 93% patients treated with sodium fusidate responding. Mupirocin was significantly more effective in the treatment of acute primary skin infections and in the treatment of a subgroup of patients with impetigo (P less than 0.01). Of the organisms detected before treatment began, 93% were not found after treatment with mupirocin compared with 89% after treatment with sodium fusidate. Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta-haemolytic streptococci appeared to be eliminated in significantly more patients treated with mupirocin (96%) compared with those treated with sodium fusidate (88%), (P = 0.03).

2748707,Evaluation of the release and efficacy of two new antibacterial agents from different ointment bases.,"The in vitro release of rosoxacin (1) and oxolinic acid (2) from three different ointment bases including a revised water washable (NF), an oleaginous, and an O/W emulsion ointment base was studied. Among the bases evaluated, the revised water washable base provided the best release of the two drugs as revealed from the values of the release rate constant (K). The amounts released of both drugs from the revised water washable base showed direct relationship with the concentration of the drug in the ointment. In addition, the effect of some additives on the amount released of both drugs from the different bases has been investigated. The release of 1 from the revised water washable base had been enhanced by adding 0.2% Tween 80 or 10% ethanol, but addition of 10% of N,N-dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) led to retardation of the release of the drug. Furthermore addition of 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 200, N,N-dimethylacetamide, or ethanol led to enhancement of the release of the drug from both the oleaginous and the emulsion bases. On the other hand, the release of 2 from the revised water washable base had been enhanced only on addition of 0.2% Tween 80 and been retarded by adding 10% ethanol, N,N-dimethylacetamide or PVP to the formula. The release of 2 from the oleaginous, as well as the emulsion bases had been enhanced by 10% PEG 200. However urea was found to show no pronounced effect on the release of the two drugs from the different ointment bases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['el-Faham TH', 'Shawky S', 'abd el-Meguid E']",1989,44,3,Pharmazie,"el-Faham TH, et al.

Commonly observed skin lesions were Epstein pearls (88.7%), mongolian spots (62.2%), milia (34.9%), sebaceous hyperplasia (31.8%), salmon patches (28.4%), and erythema toxicum neonatorum (20.6%). These figures are comparable with earlier reports. Impetigo neonatorum occurred in 11.3% of infants, and was frequent in our hot and humid climate from May to August. Traumatic skin lesions were most often present in babies who had forceps deliveries. Three hundred ten (34%) babies were available for follow-up up to six weeks. Additional skin lesions observed were omphalitis (16 babies), oral thrush (9) and postinflammatory hypomelanosis (8). Three infants had atopic dermatitis, two each had seborrheic dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, pityriasis versicolor, and nevus achromicus. One each had vitiligo, ichthyosis vulgaris, urticaria, and strawberry hemangioma.

MICs of 7 drugs (SBTPC, ABPC, SBT, methicillin (DMPPC), cloxacillin (MCIPC), cephalexin and cefaclor) against 12 of 22 strains isolated from patients with infections of skin and soft tissue were determined with inoculum-sizes of 10(8) and 10(8) CFU/ml to study beta-lactamase producing activities. Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients including dropped-out cases. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Mean plasma peak levels of ABPC and SBT were observed at 1 hour after administration in both of the 10 mg/kg and the 15 mg/kg groups with values of 2.34 and 5.57 micrograms/ml for ABPC and 1.87 and 4.66 micrograms/ml for SBT, respectively. Mean concentrations of SBT were lower than those of ABPC in both groups and individuals. Dose-responses in plasma levels and AUCs were observed in both groups. Mean half-life values of ABPC and SBT in the 2 groups were 1.93 and 1.12 hours for ABPC and 1.97 and 1.22 for SBT, respectively. Mean half-life values for ABPC and SBT were similar in each group and this tendency was also seen among individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Motohiro T', 'Sakata Y', 'Aramaki M', 'Oda K', 'Kawakami A', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Yamashita F', 'Takajo N']",1988,41,12,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

Sixty-two children aged 5 months to 13 years with impetigo were assigned to be treated with either mupirocin in three daily applications or erythromycin ethylsuccinate (40 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four doses) according to a randomized treatment schedule. On the initial visit, exudate or cleansed infected sites or both were cultured and therapy was begun. All patients were treated for 8 days. Patients were seen again on days 4 to 5 of therapy, at the end of therapy, and 7 days after the end of therapy. Sites of infection were comparable between the groups, as were bacteriologic responses. At the first visit, 24 of 30 children in the mupirocin group and 14 of 32 children in the erythromycin group were cured or had at least a 75% reduction in size of the lesions. At the end of the study, all 29 of the children in the mupirocin group who came to follow-up, compared with 27 of 29 in the erythromycin group, were cured. Side effects were few. Five children in the erythromycin group developed mild diarrhea. Thus, mupirocin appears to be safe and effective in treating impetigo in children. Our data show a trend toward more rapid clinical response with mupirocin than with erythromycin.","['Goldfarb J', 'Crenshaw D', ""O'Horo J"", 'Lemon E', 'Blumer JL']",1988,32,12,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Goldfarb J, et al.

The average daily dose level used was 31.3 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses, for an average of 6 days of treatment. MICs of 4 different macrolide antibiotics including RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM) and midecamycin acetate (MDM acetate) were determined against 32 bacterial strains isolated from these cases including 30 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. The inoculum level used was 10(6) cells/ml. Among these strains of bacteria, 20 strains of S. aureus and 1 strain of S. pyogenes were also used, at the same inoculum size, for the determination of MICs of 4 beta-lactam antibiotics including 3 different penicillins such as ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) and cefaclor (CCL), a cephem antibiotic. RKM was then evaluated through the above treatment for its clinical efficacy, bacteriological effects, side effects and effects on laboratory test values. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Activities of drugs tested were compared to each other. MIC90 of RKM against S. aureus averaged 0.39 microgram/ml, and against no strains of S. aureus showed MIC values of higher than 25 micrograms/ml, thus, the antibacterial activity of RKM against S. aureus was the highest among the 8 drugs tested. The activity of MCIPC was next highest followed by that of DMPPC, MIC determination was done on only 2 strains, or, for some drugs, only one strain, of S. pyogenes, and RKM showed activities somewhat lower than ABPC and EM, and similar to JM and CCL within the limited testing. 2. Clinical efficacies of RKM determined by doctors in charge were 97.6% in the 41 cases of impetigo, with good or excellent efficacies were observed, 100% in the single case of SSSS and the 2 cases of subcutaneous abscess. Thus an overall efficacy on the 44 cases was rated very high, at 97.7%. 3. Clinical efficacy rating according to accumulated scores was determinable in 37 cases including all the 3 diseases on the third day of treatment with an efficacy rate of 89.2%.

Nowadays oral erythromycin is the treatment of choice, although flucloxacillin is preferred in areas where the causative micro-organisms are resistant to erythromycin. Topical mupirocin ointment has shown itself to be as effective as oral therapy in many cases and is less likely to be associated with unwanted effects.

Tween 80 is a water-soluble substrate, and thus estimates esterase activity. Lipase production was assayed using water-insoluble substrates (radiolabelled triglyceride emulsions). Only a minor proportion of Tween 80-positive strains had significant triglyceride lipase production (greater than 5 mU/10(9) bacteria). The discrepancy between the two methods was most pronounced in subgroups of samples with low frequency of lipase production, e.g. from isolates from superficial locations such as nasal mucosa and impetigo. Owing to its low specificity, the Tween 80 reaction therefore seems unsuitable as a marker for lipase activity in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.","['Rollof J', 'Hedström SA', 'Nilsson-Ehle P']",1988,96,8,APMIS,"Rollof J, et al.

GABHS infection was documented in 35 subjects (4.6%). The classic presentation (as proposed in the 1940s) of GABHS URI in children younger than 3 years of age was not confirmed by this study. In 32 of the GABHS cases there were pharyngitis, common cold symptoms or both, and these were associated with acute otitis media 10 times and with otitis media with effusion 3 times. Clinical impetigo was associated with GABHS URI (4 of 32 cases). GABHS URI would not have been documented in 6 of 32 cases if cultures of the anterior nares had not been performed. Children between 18 and 36 months of age were more likely to have GABHS disease than were younger children. Hoarseness and vomiting occurred less frequently in children younger than 36 months with GABHS infection than in those of that age who had non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal illnesses. A history of two or more siblings at home or a family member with a recent streptococcal infection and the presence of irritability, a reddened throat or palate or uvular edema were each associated with GABHS URI.

Fifteen strains were positive for ET-A, 32 for ET-B and 14 for both ET-A and ET-B. Among 61 ET-producing strains 27 (44%) were classified as Phage Group II, 16 (26%) as Group III, and 14 (23%) as Groups I and III.

Noninfectious skin disease accounted for less than 10% of dermatologic diagnoses, with unclassified eczema making up the majority. Undiagnosed skin conditions contributed one third of dermatologic visits, with an incidence inversely related to the incidence of scabies visits.

3231130,Relationship between susceptibility and immune response to staphylococcal exfoliative toxin A in mammalian species.,"Staphylococcal exfoliative toxin A (ETA) had a splitting effect at the granular layer of skin in humans and neonatal mice, but not in rabbits, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, or rats. Besides its splitting effect, ETA could stimulate productions of neutralizing antibody to ETA in rabbits, rats and B10D2 mice, but not in golden hamsters, guinea pigs, or ICR, HRS/J, and C57BL/10 mice. In our epidemiological investigation of human sera, the percentage of antibody to ETA in sera obtained from patients with impetigo (8%) was lower than those in sera of healthy males (23%) and females (29%). The relationship between susceptibility and immune response to ETA in these mammalians could be divided into three groups: the possession of resistant skin and high production of antibody to ETA; the possession of resistant skin and low production of antibody to ETA; the possession of sensitive skin and various titers of antibody to ETA.","['Machida K', 'Sakurai S', 'Kondo I', 'Ikawa S']",1988,32,10,Microbiol Immunol,"Machida K, et al.

3146455,Mupirocin: a topical antibiotic with a unique structure and mechanism of action.,"The chemistry, mechanism of action, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, dosage, and administration of mupirocin are reviewed. Mupirocin, formerly termed pseudomonic acid A, is a topical antibiotic under investigation for the treatment of impetigo and other superficial primary and secondary skin infections. Mupirocin (Bactroban, Beecham Laboratories) is currently formulated as a 2% ointment in a water-miscible polyethylene glycol base. The drug is a unique antimicrobial agent because of its structure and mechanism of action. Mupirocin apparently exerts its antimicrobial activity by reversibly inhibiting isoleucyl-transfer RNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein and RNA synthesis. Mupirocin has excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and most streptococci but less activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The drug will only be used topically because of its rapid and extensive systemic metabolism. Several controlled clinical trials documented that mupirocin was significantly better than the polyethylene glycol vehicle alone or ampicillin and as effective as cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, or erythromycin in producing clinical and bacteriological cures in patients with impetigo and wound infections caused by gram-positive pathogens. Limited studies suggest that mupirocin may also have a role in eradicating nasal carriage of staphylococci. Reported adverse effects are local and may be related to the polyethylene glycol vehicle base. Mupirocin should be useful for treating patients with impetigo and wound infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. However, additional controlled, comparative clinical studies are needed to identify the role of mupirocin in treating other primary and secondary skin infections and for eliminating nasal carriage of staphylococci.","['Parenti MA', 'Hatfield SM', 'Leyden JJ']",1987,6,10,Clin Pharm,"Parenti MA, et al.

2955294,Classification of diaper dermatitis: an overview.,"Several types of diaper dermatitis are discussed: generic diaper dermatitis is most common and involves a simple erythema and mild scaling of the gluteal crease, buttocks, thighs, and lower abdomen. Candidal diaper dermatitis involves clinically significant infection with Candida albicans and presents as a sharply marginated area of erythema with significant involvement of the anterior thighs, genital creases, abdomen, and genitalia. Noduloulcerative diaper dermatitis may develop in a small percentage of patients who have chronic diaper dermatitis, as large, raised erosions with rolled margins. The lesions are most noticeable on the prominent body parts-genitalia, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. Infantile seborrheic dermatitis involves a distinctive pattern of inflammation that usually begins beneath the diaper as a sharply marginated area of erythema with satellite lesions. Within 1-2 weeks, lesions develop on the scalp, cheeks, arms, legs, and intertriginous parts of the body. Impetigo is common in the diaper area, particularly in the first 6 months of life and during the warmer summer season. The lesions are usually bullous and represent infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Folliculitis appears as small, perifollicular erythematous papules and pustules, usually on the buttocks, thigh and lower abdomen. It is common in the warm summer months and is usually caused by bacteria such as S. aureus. Intertrigo categorizes disease that does not fit into the above categories. Often the patient presents with simple erythema of the folds without pustules or induration. This probably represents irritation and low-grade infection. It is important for the clinician to be aware that many other diseases can have manifestations in the diaper area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Rasmussen JE'],1987,14 Suppl 1,,Pediatrician,Rasmussen JE.

3562360,Childhood pemphigus foliaceus: case report and review of the literature.,"Childhood pemphigus foliaceus typically causes erythema and scaling of the scalp. Sometimes, blisters and oozing are present, which often are misdiagnosed as either impetigo or seborrheic dermatitis. The eruption may progress to involve the trunk and limbs, the lesions often having an arcuate pattern. The diagnosis can be established by histologic and immunologic evaluation. In children, the disease seems to be less severe than pemphigus vulgaris, as is the case with adults, and we recommend a trial of topical steroids before embarking on systemic therapy.","['Jones SK', 'Schwab HP', 'Norris DA']",1986,3,6,Pediatr Dermatol,"Jones SK, et al.

3102197,Topical mupirocin in the treatment of bacterial skin infections.,"Mupirocin is an investigational topical antibiotic used for treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial skin infections. Mupirocin differs from other antibiotics in its synthesis, structure, and mechanism of action. In vitro, mupirocin possesses antimicrobial activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Few studies comparing mupirocin to other topical antibiotics are available. Initial studies comparing mupirocin to inactive vehicle in the treatment of impetigo indicate an overall 92 percent pathogen eradication rate with active drug and 58 percent eradication rate with vehicle. Overall response to treatment of secondary skin infections was favorable in 91 percent of patients treated with mupirocin and 77 percent of those treated with vehicle. Although incidence is not greater than placebo, adverse effects have included pruritus, burning, dry skin, and erythema. Additional trials and clinical use should further help determine the role of mupirocin in the treatment of minor, primary, and secondary skin infections.","['Rumsfield J', 'West DP', 'Aronson IK']",1986,20,12,Drug Intell Clin Pharm,"Rumsfield J, et al.

3098541,"Mupirocin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.","Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A) is a novel topical antibacterial agent which inhibits bacterial protein and RNA synthesis. It has excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and most streptococci, but has less activity against other Gram-positive and most Gram-negative bacteria. Its rapid systemic metabolism means it will only be used topically which, combined with its novel chemical structure, should make cross-resistance less likely to occur than with other currently available topical antibacterial agents. Mupirocin 2% ointment administered 2 or 3 times daily has shown excellent efficacy in both primary and secondary superficial skin infections, usually with at least 80% of patients being clinically cured or markedly improved, and over 90% eradication of the bacterial pathogen involved. Efficacy in impetigo and, to a somewhat lesser extent, infected wounds has been particularly convincingly demonstrated, while in other secondary skin infections the clinical response seen with mupirocin was often similar to the high success rate of vehicle alone. Limited evidence suggests that mupirocin may be as effective as chlortetracycline, fusidic acid, neomycin and other antibacterial agents, but more controlled, comparative studies are needed. The evidence of efficacy against nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant forms, is encouraging and currently work is being undertaken to improve the acceptability of the vehicle for this use. Side effects are limited to local reactions (in less than 3% of patients) and are no more frequent than observed with the vehicle alone. Thus, mupirocin appears to be a useful addition to the agents available for the treatment of superficial primary skin infections, such as impetigo, although its precise place in therapy remains to be established.","['Ward A', 'Campoli-Richards DM']",1986,32,5,Drugs,"Ward A and Campoli-Richards DM.

3096221,Topical antibiotic treatment of impetigo with mupirocin.,"Because the effectiveness of topical antimicrobials in the treatment of ecthyma, impetigo, and pyoderma is not well established, the US Food and Drug Administration has recently proposed guidelines for tests of topical antimicrobial efficacy in primary skin infections. The guidelines require both comparison with the agent's base and microbiologic documentation of efficacy. These guidelines were followed in this double-blind, eight-day evaluation of impetigo/ecthyma treated with mupirocin, a new agent that is only active topically. All cultures, before and after therapy, were taken using swabs dipped in neutralizing broth plus 10% fetal bovine serum to minimize antimicrobial ""carry over"" to the culture plate. Staphylococcus aureus, which was isolated from 94% of the patients before therapy, was eliminated in 88% of the mupirocin-treated patients and 47% of the vehicle-treated patients. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were eliminated in 100% of the mupirocin-treated and 0% of the vehicle-treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first topical antibacterial treatment for primary skin infections proved superior to its vehicle using the proposed US Food and Drug Administration guidelines.","['Eells LD', 'Mertz PM', 'Piovanetti Y', 'Pekoe GM', 'Eaglstein WH']",1986,122,11,Arch Dermatol,"Eells LD, et al.

It was only in 26% of pigs with PD where the common ectoparasites Haematopinus suis and Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis were found out. The skin lesions were not fluorescent in the light of Wood's lamp. The fungi Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. tereus, Chrysosporium, Mucor sp., Scopulariopsis sp. were sporadically isolated from the skin lesions in 39% of pigs with PD. In 65% of pigs with PD Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the skin lesions, which was not found in pigs without dermal lesions. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 87% of pigs with PD and 58% of pigs without any skin changes. The skin lesions were virus-free. Increased concentrations of cadmium and mercury were observed in the skin of pigs with PD and in control pigs. The concentration of aflatoxin B1 in the skin of the two groups of pigs did not exceed the level of 5 micrograms X kg-1, in PD pigs it was, however, twice higher than in the clinically healthy pigs. The residues of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the subcutaneous fat were not higher than the certified hygienic levels. Both epidermis and corium are affected by inflammatory lesions. At the beginning, neutrophil infiltration with necrotization of epithelial cells prevails.

In the newborns, mean serum concentrations were 43.3 micrograms/ml at 1/4 hour, 36.7 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 27.8 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 17.7 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 8.8 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 4.8 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, and in the infants, they were 44.5 micrograms/ml, 31.2 micrograms/ml, 19.1 micrograms/ml, 7.6 micrograms/ml, 2.2 micrograms/ml and 0.7 micrograms/ml at the above sampling times, respectively. Mean half-lives were 1.92 hours for the newborns and 0.96 hour for the infants, and mean urinary recoveries within 6 hours were 41.2% and 50.1% for the newborns and the infants, respectively. Taking individual differences into account, serum peak levels (at 1/4 hour) in newborns were very similar to each other irrespective of age (days after birth), and did not appear to be greatly different from those in infants. Half-lives, however, became shorter with aging, and the half-life of the serum CTM level in infants of about 1 month old should be close to those in young children or school-age children. From these observations, it is suggested to establish a standard regimen in which CTM is administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg once or twice a day to newborns within 3 days after birth, twice or 3 times a day to those aged 4 to 7 days, and 3 or 4 times a day to those aged 8 days or older. Clinical study: The CTM was administered to 11 patients with acute pneumonia, 2 patients each with suspected septicemia and with bullous impetigo, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, 3 patients with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome and 1 patient with pneumothorax, and its clinical effect was investigated. Excellent responses were observed in 12 of the 15 evaluated cases,good responses in 2, and a poor response in 1, thus an overall clinical effectiveness was 93.3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Iwai N', 'Taneda Y', 'Shibata M', 'Mizoguchi F', 'Nakamura H', 'Katayama M', 'Tauchi N', 'Kawamura M', 'Ozaki T', 'Ichikawa T']",1986,39,9,Jpn J Antibiot,"Iwai N, et al.

3094224,[The clinical course and differential diagnosis of papular dermatitis in fattened pigs].,"Since December 1981, dermatitis of unknown etiology in form of papular lesions has appeared in fattened pigs in some large herds in the Czech Socialist Republic. Clinical investigations of diseased pigs were performed in a large fattening house D. and in a large production herd of pigs M. in the region with frequent mines (lignite extraction). The diameter of the papules is mostly 3-5 mm, they are not painful when touched, are straggled irregularly, their large numbers are on the upper surface of the body. Papular dermatitis has a chronic course, affecting the gilts and castrated boars from the body weight of 30 kg, irrespective of their nutritional status. The overall health condition of pigs is not impaired and the disease does not cause itch. In the infected herds, there are usually fewer than 30% of pigs suffering from the disease. The incidence of the disease is highest in winter months. It is necessary to distinguish by differential diagnostics: swine pox, parakeratosis of swine, lesions of impetigo contagiosa suum, pustular dermatitis and scab of swine, from rarely occurring skin diseases of swine hypotrichosis cystica suis and demodicosis of swine.

No correlation was found among the presence of CIC and the clinical, immunoserological or pathological findings of the disease. Our results do not support the hypothesis that trapping of the circulating immune complexes play an important role on the renal injury poststreptococcal infection.

3717862,[Congenital cutaneous candidiasis: a case with review of the literature].,"The clinical features of CCC are stereotyped. Twenty-two cases have been found in the literature. Skin lesions are present at birth (12/22) or within the first twelve hours of life (7/22) and sometimes later, up to the sixth day of life. Maculopapular lesions are the first to appear, followed by the more typical vesiculopustular rash and secondary desquamation. Involvement of the upper half of the body is frequent. Interestingly, palm and sole pustules are almost constant. Oral, periungueal and conjunctival lesions are rare. In most cases, healing occurs within ten days of topical treatment using either nystatin or imidazole derivatives. Rarely (2/22), systemic candidiasis may be associated and may progress to death because of lung or meningeal involvement. Differential diagnosis includes post-natal acquired candidiasis, infectious pustulosis-impetigo, herpes, varicella-, and syphilis. In the authors' experience, pustular erythema toxicum is the most difficult diagnosis to rule out and the value of the direct smear must be emphasized. The clinical picture of CCC correspond to intrauterine infection due to a specific chorioamnionitis, for the following reasons: the rash may occur at birth; experimental cutaneous candidiasis required from 2 to 7 days of incubation; C. albicans has already been demonstrated in the adnexae, even in cases with late onset; culture of C. albicans in multiple sites favours intrauterine infection. Ascending infection of the fetal skin by C. albicans via the birth canal occurs probably through intact membranes, but fissures or late amniocentesis may create a portal of entry.

3510114,Tioconazole. A review of its antimicrobial activity and therapeutic use in superficial mycoses.,"Tioconazole is a substituted imidazole antimicrobial agent structurally related to other drugs in this group. It has been shown to have a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against dermatophytes and yeasts, as well as against some chlamydia, trichomonads and Gram-positive bacteria. Both open and controlled clinical trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy and safety of topical preparations of tioconazole for treating superficial dermatophyte or yeast infections of the skin and vaginal candidiasis. In comparative studies it was at least as effective as alternative imidazole antifungal drugs, and in a few trials significantly greater efficacy has been reported for tioconazole, compared with clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole and systemic ketoconazole. Preliminary studies in other clinical areas suggest tioconazole may be useful for treating onychomycosis (in a special nail formulation), napkin-rash due to Candida albicans, impetigo, and vaginal trichomoniasis, although comparative studies are needed in each of these settings to clearly assess its relative place in therapy. Thus, tioconazole is an effective and well tolerated treatment for vaginal candidiasis and superficial fungal infections of the skin.","['Clissold SP', 'Heel RC']",1986,31,1,Drugs,Clissold SP and Heel RC.

Patients were allocated at random to receive treatment with one or other preparation, applied twice daily, over a period of 2 weeks. Assessments were made of total symptom severity scores on entry and at the end of each week, as also were bacteriological investigations. The results showed that both combinations produced marked clinical and bacteriological improvement or cure in approximately 90% of patients with infected eczema and the success rate was similar with each preparation. In the case of patients with impetigo, hydrocortisone/potassium hydroxyquinoline sulphate proved significantly more effective than the other combination, the success rates being 92% and 74%, respectively. Patient assessment of the two topical preparations in terms of greasiness, odour and staining showed that, whilst both were considered acceptable by most, there was a trend in favour of the hydrocortisone/potassium hydroxyquinoline sulphate cream.

4047974,Treatment of impetigo: a review.,"A number of well-designed comparison studies have shown the superiority of oral or injectable antibiotics over typical treatment in the treatment of impetigo contagiosa. Erythromycin, phenoxymethyl penicillin, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G as well as clindamycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid have been shown to be extremely effective. Because of significant differences in study design, it is difficult to compare drugs investigated in different studies. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G consistently has been associated with the highest cure rates, especially in studies specifically of streptococcal impetigo. It is unclear whether these high cure rates reflect superior efficacy or are the result of lesser compliance with oral medication, but the latter explanation is quite likely. This information generally translates into daily practice as a recommendation of a penicillin or an erythromycin preparation for streptococcal impetigo unless the lesions are small and few in number, in which case topical therapy is probably sufficient. If oral antibiotics are prescribed they should be given for 10 days. Systemic as opposed to topical antibiotics should be considered more strongly in situations where the incidence of impetigo is high, since these drugs are clearly superior in sterilizing the lesions quickly to prevent transmission. Other situations that favor the use of systemic as opposed to topical antibiotics include the presence of nephritogenic strains in the population, whether endemic or epidemic, more severe or spreading lesions and a population with poor hygiene.",['Baltimore RS'],1985,4,5,Pediatr Infect Dis,Baltimore RS.

Tupile residents used 7.1 liters of water/person/day compared to the 2.3 usage rate of inhabitants on Achutupo, the control island. Despite ready availability of water in each household, Tupile residents continued to store water in contaminated vessels prior to use.

There were 4.7 episodes/child year (E/Y) of acute diarrhea on Tupile compared with the 3.5 rate on Achutupo. The rotavirus infection rate on Tupile was 0.8 E/Y compared with 0.2 E/Y on Achutupo. Infection rates for Norwalk virus, respiratory syncytial virus and Coxsackie B 1-6 viruses were similar on both islands. Respiratory disease rates were high on both islands (2.2 E/Y on Tupile, 2.7 E/Y on Achutupo). Achutupo had much higher rates of impetigo and scabies (0.6 E/Y and 2.5 E/Y, respectively) than Tupile (0.2 E/Y and 1.4 E/Y).

Recent clinical and pharmacologic evaluations of several new antimicrobial agents have shed new light on the pathogenesis and management of these infections. Staphylococcus aureus now appears to be the most common bacterial isolate in children with impetigo. In patients hospitalized because of skin and soft tissue infections, S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae type b remain the predominant pathogens. Rational therapeutic approaches to these infections require a recognition of the interplay among the pharmacodynamic, pharmaceutic and pharmacokinetic determinants of effective antimicrobial therapy. Using this approach the therapeutic questions regarding ""what drug,"" ""what dose"" and ""how long to treat"" can be approached. Drugs such as the aminopenicillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations may offer rational outpatient therapeutic alternatives, while parenteral cefuroxime and ceftriaxone are more probably the drugs of choice for parenteral therapy. In an age when cost effectiveness must prevail, strategies using ceftriaxone for both inpatient and outpatient management may provide the safest and most cost-effective therapy.","['Blumer JL', ""O'Brien CA"", 'Lemon E', 'Capretta TM']",1985,4,3,Pediatr Infect Dis,"Blumer JL, et al.

The drug, as medium granules, was administered to a total of 92 pediatric patients, ranging in age from 1 month to 13 years and 2 months, with cutaneous/soft tissue infections (70 impetigo, 6 furuncle, 7 phlegmon, 6 abscess and 3 cases of lymphadenitis). It was found subsequently that 2 of the 70 impetigo cases had received topical antibiotic medication and these were excluded from clinical evaluation to give a total of 90 evaluable cases. The daily dosage of BRL 25000 ranged from 23.7 to 75.0 mg/kg, given in 3 or 4 divided doses (average 48.5 mg/kg) and the duration of treatment was for 3 to 13 days (average 6 days). Clinical isolates of S. aureus from the above cases were examined for beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility determined to the 5 antibiotics BRL 25000, AMPC, CVA, cephalexin (CEX) and cefaclor (CCL). The drugs' clinical effects on the various diseases, bacteriological effects and side effects were also studied. At an inoculum of 10(8) cells/ml, major MICs of BRL 25000, AMPC, CVA, CEX and CCL against 71 strains of S. aureus, including beta-lactamase negative ones, were 3.13 mcg/ml, 12.5 mcg/ml, 50 mcg/ml, 12.5 mcg/ml and 12.5 mcg/ml, accounting for 60.6, 38.0, 49.3, 38.0 and 43.7% of the strains respectively, whilst at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml, major MICs were 1.56 mcg/ml, 3.13 mcg/ml, 25 mcg/ml, 6.25 mcg/ml and 3.13 mcg/ml, accounting for 57.7, 33.8, 83.1, 50.7 and 54.9%, respectively. It was noted that all drugs tended to show smaller MIC values as the inoculum size was reduced to 10(6) cells/ml and that BRL 25000 showed the most potent antibacterial activity of all 5 drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Motohiro T', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Shimada Y', 'Tomita N', 'Nishiyama T', 'Ishimoto K', 'Tominaga K', 'Iriki T', 'Harada M']",1985,38,2,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

BRL 25000 is a formulation comprising 1 part of clavulanic acid (CVA) and 2 parts of amoxicillin (AMPC). The MICs of BRL 25000 and AMPC were assessed against 24 clinically isolated strains of S. aureus (including 23 beta-lactamase producing strains), 22 S. pyogenes, 20 E. coli (8 beta-lactamase producing strains), 24 K. pneumoniae (24 beta-lactamase producing strains), 20 H. influenzae (6 beta-lactamase producing strains). BRL 25000 showed MIC80 (cumulatively 80% of strains were inhibited) at 6.25 micrograms/ml against S. aureus, less than or equal to 0.10 micrograms/ml against inst S. pyogenes, 12.5 micrograms/ml against E. coli, 6.25 micrograms/ml against K. pneumoniae and 0.39 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. BRL 25000 showed no improvement in MIC terms against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains compared with AMPC. However, BRL 25000 was markedly more effective against beta-lactamase producing strains. Thus BRL 25000 was up to 8 fold more active against S. aureus, 2 to 64 fold against E. coli, 4 to 128 fold against K. pneumoniae, 4 to 16 fold against H. influenzae than AMPC. Following oral administration of BRL 25000 granules (at a dose level of 12.5 mg/kg) to 2 children aged 9 and 11 years, the mean peak serum concentrations of AMPC and CVA were 8.33 +/- 2.43 micrograms/ml and 4.44 +/- 1.65 micrograms/ml respectively 1 hour after dosing. The half-lives of AMPC and CVA were 1.35 +/- 0.42 hours and 0.91 +/- 0.05 hour, respectively. The urinary excretion was 48.21 +/- 3.83% for AMPC and 16.90 +/- 7.06% for CVA in the first 6 hours after administration. In clinical studies, 23 pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with bacterial infections were treated with BRL 25000 granules and the clinical effectiveness, bacteriological response and side effects were evaluated. The clinical response was assessed in 23 cases, 3 with acute rhinitis, 6 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 5 with acute bronchitis, 4 with acute pneumonia, 3 with impetigo, 1 with furunculosis and 1 with periproctal abscess. Results were excellent in 13 cases, good in 7, fair in 3 and hence the efficacy rate (excellent and good cases) was 87.0% (20/23). In particular the clinical response in 9 cases with infections due to beta-lactamase producing organisms was excellent in 6, good in 2, fair in 1 and the efficacy rate was 88.9% (8/9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Iwai N', 'Taneda Y', 'Shibata M', 'Mizoguchi F', 'Katayama M']",1985,38,2,Jpn J Antibiot,"Iwai N, et al.

3974168,[Microbiology of streptococcal infections].,"Since the discovery of streptococci by the surgeon of Vienna, Theodor Billroth, more than 100 years ago, they have proved to be a bacterial group of great medical and epidemiological importance. The classification in growth-characteristics on blood culture mediums (alpha-, beta- and gamma-hemolysis) has been detached by the evidence of group specific cell wall antigens. The antigene extraction described by Lancefield can distinguish at least 21 serogroups (A-T). They have also taken over the historical names (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae etc.). In addition to group relationship the antigen structure of the streptococci cell wall (carbohydrates, peptidoglycanes, M-T-R-proteins and others) is responsible for antigenetic and pathogenetic conditions. Some species of streptococci do also excrete exotoxines (streptolysin, hyaluronidase, bacteriocines, erythrogenic toxins) with antigenetic and pathogenetic significance. Infections with streptococci of the serogroup A, B, D and H are numerously and medically significant. There is a great interest in infections due to A streptococci (pharygitis, impetigo, erysipel, scarlatin fever). The known non-purulent diseases following A streptococci infections (acute rheumatoid fever, acute glomerulonephritis) are streptococcal specific reactions for the individual. Some antigens of the cell wall and also some exotoxines react in human beings as autoantigenes. Human beings are the most important reservoir for streptococci.

This benign tropical disease exists in South East France where it remains very rare, human contamination always being accidental. The lesions, single or multiple, affect the skin only. On the face, the differential diagnosis arises with other much commoner cutaneous lesions (impetigo, etc.). They consist, after 2 to 4 months of incubation, of a rounded erythematous papule, neither pruritic nor painful, which becomes secondarily excavated to produce a crusted ulcer. This lesion, typical at this stage, then persists for many months before an unsightly scar develops. Treatment is local: surgical excision offering the possibility of histological examination and hence a diagnosis. Plastic surgery may be used to correct scars in advanced forms.","['Koulmann M', 'Maria J', 'Tagliana P', 'Verdier M', 'Roche JC']",1985,86,2,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac,"Koulmann M, et al.

IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C4, lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory component concentrations and breast-milk volumes were measured longitudinally over a six month period which encompassed dry and rainy seasons. No increase in the production of any immunoprotein was observed at the time of maximum prevalence of serious infectious diseases, especially diarrhoea, in the children. Enhanced secretion of certain immunoproteins was noted in mothers of children aged 9-18 months at the beginning of the rainy season. There was some evidence that this may have been associated with skin sepsis, particularly impetigo, in the children. The production of most immunoproteins fell during the rainy season. This was not the result of declining maternal food intakes as similar decreases were seen for women receiving a dietary supplement.","['Prentice A', 'Watkinson M', 'Prentice AM', 'Cole TJ', 'Whitehead RG']",1984,73,6,Acta Paediatr Scand,"Prentice A, et al.

Growth, maturation and metabolic homeostasis of the organism depend, among other intrinsic factors, on a normal production and secretory rate of both thyroidal and parathyroidal hormones. Clinical conditions of hyperthyroidism induce 1. increased metabolic turnover of the body with transcutaneous heat loss, 2. disordered growth of hairs and nails, 3. hyperpigmentation of skin, 4. pruritus with or without urticaria. Pretibial (usually symmetrical) myxedema may be associated with conditions of either hyper- or hypothyroidism (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis); if combined with bilateral exophthalmus and acropachyderma of fingers and toes, it is called Diamond syndrome, or E.M.O. syndrome. In hypothyroidism, the skin feels chilly and dry, looks pale, and may present follicular keratoses with or without secondary eczema. The hair appears dull and sparse due to disordered anagen phase. Skin wounds heal with delay. Diffuse myxedema originates in the papillary and periadnexal connective tissue and eventually extends to the dermis as a whole. Clinical conditions of hyperparathyroidism rarely cause secondary calcification of the skin; they may induce severe pruritus, particularly in secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.

6372467,Cutaneous infections: microbiologic and epidemiologic considerations.,"The normal bacterial flora of the skin represents an important host defense mechanism against invasion by potentially pathogenic organisms. This flora is primarily composed of aerobic diphtheroids (Corynebacterium species), anaerobic diphtheroids (Propriono-bacterium acnes), and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli may be present in limited numbers in intertriginous areas. Localized cutaneous infections occur in ostensibly normal hosts, often after trivial trauma, examples being streptococcal or staphylococcal impetigo, staphylococcal furunculosis, or more unusual infections due to agents such as Mycobacterium marinum. When the skin is injured more extensively by trauma, burns, ischemia with ulceration, or iatrogenic manipulations, or when host immunologic defenses are suppressed, more severe infections are likely to supervene, and the threat of systemic dissemination of infecting microorganisms increases. Cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed hosts may involve the same pyogenic bacteria that affect normal subjects or it may involve a variety of opportunistic invaders, including herpes viruses, gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, and deep or superficial mycoses. The skin may also be affected by infections whose primary site lies elsewhere in the body. Cutaneous manifestations may be secondary to hematogenous seeding of the causative agent or to the effects of toxins or immune complexes. Certain microbial agents may initiate a wide variety of cutaneous lesions, depending on route of infection and the status of the host. Thus, cutaneous lesions attributable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa range from ""green nail syndrome"" and self-limited folliculitis to ecthyma gangrenosum. Similarly, group A streptococci may produce pyoderma, cellulitis, lymphangitis, erysipelas, or scarlet fever. We recently described a syndrome of recurrent cellulitis in the saphenous vein donor extremities of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafts. Most patients have associated tinea pedis. The pathophysiologic aspects of this syndrome are probably multifactorial, involving compromise of lymphatic or venous drainage, bacterial infection, elaboration of bacterial toxins, and hypersensitivity to bacterial or fungal products, or both. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are exhibiting a more prominent pathogenic potential than heretofore. When they infect immunosuppressed hosts or patients with indwelling intravascular catheters or cardiac prostheses, coagulase-negative staphylococci may cause life-threatening disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Bisno AL'],1984,76,5A,Am J Med,Bisno AL.

6546844,Hypocalcemia-induced pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch. New experience with an old syndrome.,"Hypocalcemia occurs in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch, and impetigo herpetiformis. In most cases hypocalcemia is caused by accompanying hypoalbuminemia, yet reductions in ionized serum calcium concentrations due to hypoparathyroidism or malabsorption have been reported. We report the case of a patient with surgical hypoparathyroidism in whom hypocalcemia precipitated typical pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch. The psoriasis rapidly cleared on two occasions when the patient's serum calcium was corrected by therapy with oral calcium and vitamin D or its analogues, and reappeared when treatment was discontinued. The patient's psoriasis cleared on a third occasion when her serum calcium level returned to normal with a calcium infusion. Hypocalcemia can precipitate pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch in susceptible persons. These psoriatic flares are due not to abnormal circulating levels of parathyroid hormone or vitamin D metabolites but to hypocalcemia.","['Stewart AF', 'Battaglini-Sabetta J', 'Millstone L']",1984,100,5,Ann Intern Med,"Stewart AF, et al.

All patients had the characteristic telangiectasia as described previously. However, the telangiectases did not conform to a classic photodistribution . Our series did include one patient with a pathologic reaction to light-simulating hydroa aestivale or vacciniforme . In addition, there were three patients with acanthosis nigricans in two unrelated families. Vitiligo, impetigo, recurrent herpetic gingivostomatitis, hirsutism, lipoatrophy, gray hair, progeroid changes and hyper- and hypopigmented macules were noted in our patients. Many of our patients had one or more caf'e au lait like-lesions in a dermatomal distribution.

The mean blood concentrations of CAZ in 2 children were 142, 70.3, 46.9, 35.7, 16.2, 5.82 and 2.36 micrograms/ml at 5, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively, after start of 5 minutes' intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg, with the half-life of 1.25 hours. CAZ was administered to 19 pediatric patients with acute infections. Out of them, 15 patients, i.e., 3 with acute tonsillitis, 1 with acute bronchitis, 5 with bronchopneumonia, 2 with pertussis accompanying pneumonia, 2 with Salmonella enteritis, 1 with impetigo staphylogenes and 1 with subdural abscess, were adopted for the evaluation, and the other 4 were excluded from the evaluation because of inadequate indications. The efficacy rate in these 15 cases was 93.3%. The doses used in 14 out of the evaluated 15 cases ranged from 31 to 50 mg/kg/day, the frequency of dosing was twice daily in 8 cases and 3 times daily in 7 cases. One shot intravenous injection was used in 6 cases, intravenous drip infusion in 8, and combination of these, in 1 case. The duration of treatment was 2 days in 3 cases, 3 days in 3, 4 days in 4, and 5 days in 3 cases. Patients with severe infections were generally given large doses for long-term. No clinical adverse event was observed in any case. In laboratory examinations, slight elevation of S-GPT alone was observed in 1 case.

Obstacles delaying their recognition included an entrenched belief that staphylococci should produce pus, the striking dissimilarity of their main clinical effects (impetigo and scalding), the strongly held opinions of von Rittershain, and controversy over the cause of impetigo. Phage typing and histopathology confirmed the common etiology of these diseases and established the existence of dermopathic strains securely. The important contributions made by Melish and Glasgow were to provide an experimental model for these strains and to discover the epidermolytic toxin, whose action of splitting the epidermis underlies the pathogenesis of all these diseases (which have become known collectively as the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome). Clinically, however, the impetigo effects and the scalding effects differ markedly, so it is proposed that staphylococcal impetigo should be retained as a separate clinical entity, and that staphylococcal impetigo and the modified staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome should be known collectively as the staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin syndrome.",['Lyell A'],1983,9,2,J Am Acad Dermatol,Lyell A.

6348337,[Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].,"T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new injectable cephamycin antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial activity, concentration in serum and urine, penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as clinical application. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibilities of clinically isolated K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae to T-1982 were superior to those of CEZ CMZ, and ABPC. T-1982 seemed to be useful for various infections due to Gram-negative rods. 2. Concentration in serum and urine: Subjects were 10 children with congenital heart failure but no abnormal renal and liver functions. T-1982 was given intravenously to 3 groups at 200 mg/kg by one shot (4 cases), 20 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases) and 10 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases). The half-lives were 60, 78 and 85 minutes, respectively. 3. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid: Three children with malignant tumor were injected 20 mg/kg intravenously. A small amount of T-1982 was penetrated into CSF. 4. Clinical efficacy: T-1982 was administered daily 40-116 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 2-14 days to 17 children comprising 1 bronchopneumonia, 1 bronchitis, 4 tonsillitis, 1 lymphadenitis, 1 sepsis, 1 pharyngitis, 1 impetigo, 1 acute sinusitis and 6 pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 2, fair and poor in 3, and the efficacy rate was 70.6%. Bacteriological effect was as follows; eradicated in 9 cases and unknown in 8 cases. As side effect, GOT and GPT elevations unrelated to the drug were observed in 2 cases. Other abnormal findings were not found.

Among 70 evaluable patients, 57 had staphylococcal bullous impetigo. The remaining 13 patients had bullous impetigo with streptococcal or mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal cultures (6 patients), abscess (4 patients), or cellulitis with pyoderma (3 patients). Staphylococci were recovered from lesions of 64 of the 70 evaluable patients; all strains were sensitive to both cephalexin and dicloxacillin, but only 2 of the 64 strains were susceptible to penicillin G. Cephalexin and dicloxacillin proved equally effective. Treatment failures were uncommon (1 patient in each group), and recurrences (3 patients in each group) were limited to patients with bullous impetigo. In general, patients with staphylococcal bullous impetigo responded promptly, with clearing of lesions evident within the first week, but delayed healing with persistence of staphylococci in lesions was more common in the group receiving dicloxacillin. Twice-daily dosing with oral antibiotics is obviously convenient and may enhance compliance.

7122351,Bacterial skin infections: management of common streptococcal and stapylococcal lesions.,"Skin infection occurs in any age-group, sex, and race but is particularly common in children. It is usually minor, but may indicate underlying systemic disease or may lead to systemic infection. Streptococci and staphylococci are common causes. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci account for the majority of streptococcal infections in man. Infection most often involves the lower extremities and produces spreading erythema and necrosis but little purulence. Staphylococcal infections most commonly involve the face, the hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts being the initial sites. Lesions appear as bullae and pustules with a narrow rim of erythema. Intense cellulitis surrounding the lesions usually points to a virulent, penicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus. Treatment of both types of infection consists of cleansing with antibacterial agents, removal of crusts, application of warm compresses, and use of topical or systemic antibiotics, depending on the severity of the infection and the type of pyoderma involved.","['Witkowski JA', 'Parish LC']",1982,72,4,Postgrad Med,"Witkowski JA and Parish LC.

7038190,[Clinical trials of cefroxadine on skin and soft tissue infections in the field of pediatrics (author's transl)].,"CXD was administered orally at an average dose of 28.6 mg/kg (18.3 approximately 42.3 mg/kg) for an average 6 days (3 approximately 12 days) to a total of 99 pediatric cases with skin and soft tissue infections (impetigo 89, abscess 7 and furuncle 3) ranging from 3 months to 9 years old. The drug was given twice to 4 times per day after meals. The clinical and bacteriological effects and adverse reactions of CXD as well as the susceptibility of the causative organisms against CXD and CEX were studied, and the results obtained are as described below: 1. According to judgement of the attending doctors, CXD had a high global efficacy rate of 90.9%. 2. Analysis of the attending physicians' evaluations of the clinical effects on impetigo revealed that a dose of CXD 20.5 approximately 30.4 mg/kg t.i.d. can produce satisfactory responses. 3. According to the assessments by Evaluation Committee, the global clinical effects after 3, 5 and 7 days were 81.4, 91.2 and 94.6%, respectively. This indicates that clinical responses increased with prolongation of the treatment period, viz. better responses obtained after 5 and 7 days. This suggests that a minimum of 5 days administration is required for treating these infections. 4. As for impetigo having the largest number of patients in this study, a dose of CXD 20.5 approximately 30.4 mg/kg per day seemed to produce satisfactory clinical effects. 5. As for dose per day, the t.i.d. regimen of CXD 20.5 approximately 30.4 mg/kg seemed to exhibit satisfactory clinical responses, as already mentioned. Because of quite a small number of patients on the q.i.d. regimen of higher doses, however, the question of whether the t.i.d. treatment with 20.5 approximately 30.4 mg is adequate or not should be determined by a comparative study between the q.i.d. and t.i.d. treatments. 6. As for bacteriological responses, a high global effect of 87.1% was obtained with CXD against S. aureus and S. pyogenes isolated from 74 and 1 cases, respectively. 7. As for impetigo with predominant number of cases, CXD was highly effective bacteriologically at a daily dose of 20.5 approximately 30.4 mg/kg t.i.d. As an appropriate comparative evidence with the q.i.d. treatment was lacking, however, therapeutic validity of the t.i.d. treatment could not be determined definitely. 8. Utility was evaluated by the attending physicians on the total 99 cases, and CXD showed as high as 88.9%. 9. There were neither non-compliances nor adverse reactions to this treatment. 10. CXD showed a distribution of antimicrobial activity similar to that of CEX, against 74 isolates of S. aureus with the MICs of CXD ranging from 1.56 to 25 mcg/ml and those of CEX ranging from 0.78 to 25 mcg/ml, with peak MIC being 3.13 mcg/ml for both drugs. As for S. pyogenes, only one isolate from the same species, CXD was antimicrobial activity at 0.2 mcg/ml and CEX was antimicrobial at 0.39 mcg/ml. The above findings suggest that CXD is highly effective against acute skin and soft tissue infections in pediatrics.","['Motohiro T', 'Tanaka K', 'Koga T', 'Shimada Y', 'Tomita N', 'Sakata Y', 'Nishiyama T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Nakajima T', 'Ishimoto K', 'Tominaga K', 'Yamashita F', 'Tomoishi T', 'Takenaka S', 'Kamezaki K', 'Ohyama K', 'Takasaki K', 'Oki S', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Nagai T', 'Kawano N', 'Toyoda J', 'Shimohida T']",1981,34,12,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

Also, its clinical efficacies and side effects were investigated in the following cases who were treated with a mean dose of 33 mg/day divided into 3 to 4 portions for a period of 9 days on the average; viz. a total of 151 cases consisting of 9 cases of pharyngitis, 39 of tonsillitis, 11 of streptococcal infection, i.e. scarlet fever, 7 of bronchitis, 6 of pneumonia, 1 of otitis media, 6 of purulent lymphadenitis, 1 of purulent parotitis, 1 of subcutaneous abscess and 3 of impetigo. 1. The serum level tends to reach its maximum level within 1 hour after administration. The mean concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dose in the foregoing time were 6.35, 9.12 and 21.62 mcg/ml respectively and dose response was observed. CXD showed higher concentration than CEX, CED and CFT. The mean half-life periods of the 3 dose were 72, 84 and 66 minutes respectively and variations were observed, but the drugs maintains a satisfactory serum level. 2. The time which showed highest urine excretion was mainly in the 0 to 2 hours bracket and the average concentrations of 5 , 10 and 20 mg/kg dose in the foregoing time were 381.2, 771.7 and 1,577.7 mcg/ml respectively. The dose response was more evident than in the serum concentrations. The average recovery rates within 6 hours were 93.6, 88.3 and 94.3% respectively and they were similar to those of CEX, CED and CFT. 3. The clinical effects were evaluated were in 148 cases out of the total of 151 and 136 cases, or 91.9% showed good or excellent efficacy response. 4. The daily dose groups of less than 30 mg/kg and 31 to 40 mg/kg formed the majority and there was no difference in the comparison of the clinical effectiveness in these 2 groups. Administration of a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg is sufficient for the treatment of the aforementioned mild diseases except for pneumonia. 5. The clinical effects were compared between the 3 and 4 times a day treatment groups, but there was no difference between these two groups with regard to the foregoing daily dose. The 3 times a day treatment is acceptable, but the 4 times a day treatment is preferable when pharmacokinetics if taken into account. 6. The bacteriological effects in 41 cases, or 97.6% out of the 42 cases were above the efficacy base line and a high efficacy rate was achieved. 7. With regard to side effects, diarrhea developed in 4 cases and eosinophilia in 6 cases, abnormal simultaneous increases in GOT and GPT in 1 case and 1 case each for abnormal values in LDH and BUN were seen in the clinical test values. The foregoing results show that CXD has high efficacy and safety and it can be said that it is a drug required in the pediatric field.","['Motohiro T', 'Sakata Y', 'Fujimoto T', 'Nishiyama T', 'Nakajima T', 'Ishimoto K', 'Tominaga K', 'Yamashita F', 'Takajo N', 'Araki H', 'Shiozuki Y', 'Takenaka S', 'Kamezaki K', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Kawano N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Komatsu R', 'Ohta M', 'Etoh Y', 'Moroi T', 'Iriki T', 'Chou H', 'Okada S', 'Kinoshita M', 'Imuta F', 'Koga T']",1981,34,12,Jpn J Antibiot,"Motohiro T, et al.

Serum level was higher than CCL administered orally at the same dose, and urinary excretion ratio after oral administration was good similarly to CEX and CCL. Patients treated were mostly scarlet fever and upper respiratory tract infections as acute tonsillitis and lacunar tonsillitis. They responded well to CDX at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg divided into 3-4 times. All cases of scarlet fever became normal temperature within 2 days. Among 14 cases in which A group beta-hemolytic Streptococcus was detected by pharyngeal sputum culture at admission, 11 cases became negative on the 1st day. This result was superior to CEX, when this drug was administered orally at a daily dose of 40-60 mg/kg, bacteria became negative at the ratio of 73.3% on the 2nd day. CDX was effective for acute tonsillitis, lacunar tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, impetigo and maxillary lymphadenitis in which numerous A group beta-Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were proven, as well as for acute urinary tract infection due to Escherichia coli. Clinical results of CDX in totalling 69 cases were excellent in 63 cases, good in 6 cases, efficacy ratio being 100%. No local nor systemic side effects were observed in 69 cases including maximum 11 days' treatment, as well as no effect was noticed on hepatic and renal functions.

7453264,The relationship of pediatric resident recording behavior across medical conditions.,"During the July 1975-June 1976 academic year, nonphysician abstractors collected data on 15,101 ambulatory patient visits managed by 175 residents in five pediatric training programs. The visits included in this study were those on which a general data base should be collected and visits for health maintenance, head trauma, impetigo, otitis media, tonsillopharyngitis and urinary tract infection. These data provided an opportunity to investigate the number of medical record audits required to obtain a stable estimate of resident performance for a given medical condition and the relationship of performance across a number of medical conditions. The standard errors of the mean for 844 distributions of per cent compliance scores for individual residents were calculated. The standard error was less than five in 97 per cent of the instances where ten or more records had been abstracted for a given resident. Although there was some variability of resident performance from case to case, these data indicate that ten records may be a lower bound on the number of abstracts required to provide a stable estimate of performance. The correlations across conditions showed a moderate amount of homogeneity of performance and a clustering of performance for the acute care conditions included in the study. The correlations across acute care conditions were all statistically significant and ranged in magnitude from .52 to .77. Although the relationships between general data base and health maintenance and the acute conditions were statistically significant in some instances, they were all of lower magnitude and ranged from -.20 to .36. Thus, a modest number of abstracts for only a few conditions may provide a reliable estimate of resident day-to-day performance in ambulatory care clinics.","['Erviti VF', 'Templeton B', 'Bunce JV', 'Burg FD']",1980,18,10,Med Care,"Erviti VF, et al.

The methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. Oleic and linoleic acids inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes markedly, Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition of growth of a strain of Str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. Linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation.

Generalized exfoliative dermatitis was seen in 24 babies, and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 23. Fourteen isolates were phage typed, with 13 reported as the epidemic strain 29/79/80/3A/3C/54/75. Eight babies had generalized scarlatiniform eruption without exfoliation (staphylococcal scarlet fever). Cultural data were available from six, all positive for S aureus. Four organisms were typed and reported as the epidemic strain. Of 34 infants with bullous impetigo 20 had cultures that were positive for S aureus, and four were phage typed, revealing the epidemic strain. Illness was mild in all patients; there were no deaths and no invasive forms of staphylococcal infection. The male to female ratio of generalized exfoliative disease was 5:1. The concept of a neonatal staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, comprised of a triad of skin disorders induced by an exotoxin elaborated by certain strains of coagulase positive S aureus, is confirmed.","['Curran JP', 'Al-Salihi FL']",1980,66,2,Pediatrics,Curran JP and Al-Salihi FL.

From 1975 through 1977, an epidemic of poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis occurred in Alaska. Fifty children required hospitalization, while 25 less seriously ill children were treated as outpatients. Sixty-seven percent of these 75 children had direct evidence of recent skin infections. Serotypes 49-14 and NT-14 were the most common streptococcal isolates. In villages in the epidemic area, approximately 15% of children had impetigo and more than 60% of lesions cultured were positive for group A streptococci. Impetigo rates in the epidemic area were similar to those found in nonepidemic areas. However, the introduction of the nephritogenic streptococcal serotypes not recently present in this population apparently led to the development of the epidemic.","['Margolis HS', 'Lum MK', 'Bender TR', 'Elliott SL', 'Fitzgerald MA', 'Harpster AP']",1980,134,7,Am J Dis Child,"Margolis HS, et al.

7439507,Tissue and fluid concentrations of cefadroxil monohydrate.,"In summary, there are several tissues and fluids in which the penetration of cefadroxil appears to be superior to that of other antibiotics, including other cephalosporins. A possible explanation for this relates to the characteristic solubility of cefadroxil in both aqueous and lipid solvents. A study comparing IV, IM and PO administration of cefadroxil appears to support this thesis. Clinically, based on work which shows that patients who had higher concentrations of antibiotic in sputum made a faster recovery, cefadroxil may have an advantage since sputum is one of the fluids in which the drug appears to have superior and earlier penetration. In addition, in comparison with cephalexin, penetration of skin-blister fluid by cefadroxil was superior, suggesting an advantage in treating disorders of the skin and skin structures, such as impetigo. The possibility of different dosage requirements for male and female patients, based on the difference in the availability of lipid deposit sites, cannot be considered clinically significant at this time.",['Bernhardt LL'],1980,8,Suppl 1,J Int Med Res,Bernhardt LL.

393631,Bactericidal effect of oleic acid on group A streptococci: mechanism of action.,"In contrast to Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, group A streptococci are infrequently present on normal human skin, except in certain populations with endemic impetigo. This has been attributed to differences in susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of skin surface lipids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids. When an M type 6 strain group A streptococcus was exposed to 500 mug of oleic acid per ml, viable counts decreased by 4 logs in 5 min. The rank order of killing was 35 > 20 > 4 degrees C. Oleic acid did not kill a strain of S. aureus, a strain of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, or a strain of Escherichia coli, but bound rapidly to these bacteria as well as to the group A streptococcus. The loss of [(3)H]uridine from labeled oleic acid-treated group A streptococcal cells was greater than 100 times that of controls. There was no loss of [(3)H]-thymidine from group A streptococci or of [(3)H]uridine or [(3)H]thymidine from identically exposed coagulase-negative staphylococci. When [(3)H]uridine was added to group A streptococci during mid-log-phase growth, cessation of uptake occurred within 5 min of addition of 50 mug of oleic acid per ml. Electron microscopic changes seen within 5 min included condensation of the nucleoid and distortion of the streptococcal surface by numerous clumps and blebs. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, and E. coli similarly exposed showed no comparable electron microscopic changes. We propose that oleic acid kills group A streptococci by altering the integrity of the cell membrane with resulting loss of ribonucleic acid but not deoxyribonucleic acid.","['Speert DP', 'Wannamaker LW', 'Gray ED', 'Clawson CC']",1979,26,3,Infect Immun,"Speert DP, et al.

Both groups of patients had significantly elevated levels of immune complexes during the acute phase and showed an equivalent decline to slightly elevated levels during the 6 months of observation. The incidence and molecular size of the immune complexes in the two post-streptococcal sequelae were equivalent. The Raji cell assay tended to show much higher levels of complexes on an absolute basis, but both assays demonstrated an equivalent decline from the acute phase. These studies suggest that the presence of equivalent levels of complexes in two entirely different post-streptococcal sequelae indicates that other factors, such as the nature of the antigen in the complex, are more important in the pathogenesis of the post-streptococcal sequelae than the actual presence or the absolute levels of complexes.","['van de Rijn I', 'Fillit H', 'Brandeis WE', 'Reid H', 'Poon-King T', 'McCarthy M', 'Day NK', 'Zabriskie JB']",1978,34,3,Clin Exp Immunol,"van de Rijn I, et al.

310537,Clinical implications of preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis in childhood.,"The available hospital records of all pediatric patients diagnosed as having periorbital, preseptal or orbital cellulitis over a five-year period were reviewed and compared to previously reported series. Only two of 39 patients had orbital cellulitis. The 37 patients with preseptal cellulitis had two characteristic clinical presentations. Twenty-two children had local trauma, abscesses, insect bites, or impetigo as the inciting event for their cellulitis. Infection was usually caused by staphylococci or streptococci. In contrast, 15 children, 12 of whom were under 36 months, had associated upper respiratory tract infections and otitis. Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly implicated pathogen and the children were at risk of bacteremia and metastastic infection. Determination of the location of the infection in the orbit and consideration of the clinical presentation of the patient with infection in and about the orbit are of assistance in choosing appropriate therapy. Young children who have upper respiratory tract symptoms in association with preseptal cellulitis should receive antibiotic coverage for Haemophilus.","['Smith TF', ""O'Day D"", 'Wright PF']",1978,62,6,Pediatrics,"Smith TF, et al.

Moreover the toxin could not be found to bind to murine epithelia by indirect immunofluorescence methods. However, the toxin, measured by radioimmunoassay, could be eluted from the skin of mice undergoing epidermolysis following intraperitoneal injection of toxinogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, epidemolysin was measured in the blister fluid of 3 of 5 children with bullous impetigo but not in blister fluid from control patients with other blistering eruptions. Thus epidermolysin has been demonstrated to be present in lesions of the staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin syndrome but its mechanism of action does not involve binding to cells.","['Baker DH', 'Dimond RL', 'Wuepper KD']",1978,71,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Baker DH, et al.

The other form is associated usually with drug reactions and is characterized by necrosis of the epidermis with a split between epidermis and dermis. The staphylococcal Lyell syndrome should be treated with penicillinase resistant antibiotics and not with corticosteroids; the non-staphylococcal form of the Lyell syndrome often requires systemic corticosteroids.

578361,Long-term transfer factor treatment in severe atopic dermatitis.,"Transfer factor therapy was applied in three patients with severe atopic dermatitis and given at regular intervals for 1 1/2 years. Clinically, slight improvements were seen, attacks of impetigo ceased and admissions to hospital were not necessary. However, IgE concentrations in serum remained constantly high in all cases and the absolute number of T and B lymphocytes was continuously subnormal despite treatment. The in vitro cellular reactivity to PPD as assayed by a leucocyte migration test was not significantly altered in the patients, although a slight increase was found early on in the therapy. Finally, a serum factor inhibiting leucocyte migration and appearing simultaneously with attacks of impetigo disappeared during treatment. In conclusion, no convincing effect of transfer factor therapy was encountered in immune parameters and no major alterations were found in the status of the patients' atopic dermatitis.","['Thulin H', 'Ellegaard J', 'Thestrup-Pedersen K', 'Zachariae H']",1977,32,4,Acta Allergol,"Thulin H, et al.

The socio-economic status of the four major racial groups, European, Maori, Pacific Island Polynesian and Asian was relatively constant and predominantly from Social Classes 4 and 5. The pattern of health in each group was not significantly different between races with the exception of a high incidence of scabies and impetigo among the Maori and Pacific Island Polynesians. These skin infections were possibly related to a significant degree of overcrowding that was found in this group where 21 to 29% of the families had five or more children under 15 years of age in the one house. Dental caries was commoner among Maori teenagers. These findings are in accord with the hypothesis that health differences between races are a reflection of socio-economic factors rather than due to any intrinsic differences in susceptibility to disease.",['Lines DR'],1977,7,2,Aust N Z J Med,Lines DR.

Findings are compared with studies reported in recent literature which describe pyoderma in other countries. In the present study, conducted in 1975 as part of the Danfa Project's Village Health Survey, pyoderma was diagnosed in 19.4% of villagers examined. Peak rates occurred in the five to nine-year-old age group, and pyoderma was more prevalent among males and unskilled labourers and farmers than among those engaged in more sedentary occupations. Non-bullous impetigo was most common (72% of lesions) and, in contrast to other studies, non-group A-streptococci predominated in these lesions (82% of streptococcal lesions were Group G, 18% Group C).

Five sites-hands, feet, axilla, groin and back-were examined quantitatively and qualitatively and compared with a control group. Total populations of indigenous flora were significantly higher from patients with repeated skin infections of the back, axillae and feet. The frequency of isolation of different species from normal skin was comparable between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus species which were isolated only from patients with repeated skin infections. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated with comparable frequency between the two groups, but patients with repeated skin infections tended to carry gram-negative bacteria on multiple sites. It was concluded from the high population of indigenous flora and the types of microogranisms present that the microflora of normal skin did not appear to protect patients with repeated skin infections against colonization by pathogens. The presence of high populations of Staphylococcus aureus on the normal skin of patients with repeated skin infections would appear to be the most important contributing factor.","['McBride ME', 'Duncan WC', 'Knox JM']",1977,4,1,J Cutan Pathol,"McBride ME, et al.

793381,The dynamics of streptococcal infections in a defined population of children: serotypes associated with skin and respiratory infections.,"Serial observations including cultures of the upper respiratory tract and of infected skin lesions and streptococcal antibody determinations were made over a two-year period in a semi-closed population of children between 10 months and 15 years of age. There was a high prevalence of group A streptococci in nose and throat cultures and of skin lesions containing these organisms. Almost 90% of the study population developed streptococcal impetigo during the study period. A slightly higher proportion of males than females developed skin infection but there was no relationship to age. Impetigo was observed throughout the calendar year, exceeding 12% of child-visits in one winter month, but was generally more common in the summer and fall. Conversely, group A streptococci were more often isolated from nose and throat cultures in the winter months. The increase in recovery of streptococci from nose and throat cultures lagged behind the increase in streptococcal impetigo and continued into the winter months, when the prevalence of impetigo had declined. Calculation of ratios for individual streptococcal serotypes isolated from different body sites revealed a clear cut distinction between ""respiratory"" and ""impetigo"" serotypes, with respect to both prevalence and acquisition rates. Respiratory serotypes were more commonly isolated in the winter and impetigo serotypes in the summer and fall. Significant antibody responses to extracellular antigens of the streptococcus were documented for pharyngeal acquisitions of both impetigo and respiratory serotypes and for skin lesions associated with impetigo serotypes. Group A streptococcal serotypes may be divided into three categories on the basis of their human pathogenicity for body sites: some with the potential for respiratory infection, others with the potential for skin infection and a few unusual serotypes with the potential for infecting both sites.","['Anthony BF', 'Kaplan EL', 'Wannamaker LW', 'Chapman SS']",1976,104,6,Am J Epidemiol,"Anthony BF, et al.

We will describe a case of bullous impetigo in an adult which developed while the patient was receiving short-term therapy with orally administered corticosteriods. Scalded skin syndrome in this case was characterized by isolation of phage group 2 staphylococci from intact bullae and by the presence of an intraepidermal, subgranular cleavage plane in histological sections. Features that differentiate the localized form of scalded skin syndrome from generalized forms include the presence of dermal infiltrate and the absence of cutaneous erythema and tenderness. On the basis of available experimental evidence, the rarity of both localized and generalized scalded skin syndrome in adults can be attributed to immunologic competence or enhanced capacity of adults to metabolize the staphylococcal exfoliatin.","['Elias PM', 'Levy SW']",1976,112,6,Arch Dermatol,Elias PM and Levy SW.

819654,Qualitative and quantitative methods for detecting staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin.,"Concentrated supernates of cultures of 98 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were screened for the production of epidermolytic toxin by (1) biological tests in 3-day-old mice, (2) double-diffusion precipitation tests against specific antiserum, and (3) the appearance of characteristic protein bands on thin-layer-gel isoelectric focusing. Positive results were obtained in all three of these tests with supernates from 11 of these cultures; the same 11 strains, and no others, produced epidermal splitting when newborn mice were challenged with viable organisms. Of the 14 phage-group II strains included in the survey, eight (58%) produced epidermolytic toxin. Three toxinogenic strains belonged to phage groups other than group II. A radial-immunodiffusion test employing antiserum to purified epidermolytic toxin proved satisfactory for measuring amounts of epidermolytic toxin in excess of 200 mug per ml. The results of immunodiffusion tests indicated that six of the 11 positive strains produced two serologically distinct forms of epidermolytic toxin and that the remainder produced only one of these. A striking correlation was observed between the presence of toxin of serotypes i and ii and the occurrence of protein bands i and ii in thin-layer isoelectric-focusing gels. These tests should facilitate the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the production of different serotypes of epidermolytic toxin by S. aureus in future surveys of strains isolated from toxic epidermal necrolysis of Ritter's type and impetigo. The two forms of epidermolytic toxin previously designated ETA (pI=7-0) and ETB (pI=6-0) were detected by preparative isoelectric focusing of sero-type-i toxin. Evidence suggests that studies of the effect of heat should provide a means of investigating the relationship between the different molecular forms of epidermolytic toxin.","['Arbuthnott JP', 'Billcliffe B']",1976,9,2,J Med Microbiol,Arbuthnott JP and Billcliffe B.

The majority of the opacity-factor-negative respiratory serotypes possess a shared M-associated antigen or antigens, to which high titres of antibody are common in patients with rheumatic fever, or patients recovering from upper respiratory infections with certain opacity-factor-negative serotypes. The antibody in these sera has a demonstrable but limited affinity for the M-associated antigens of strains belonging to a second category of M types, the majority of which are opacity-factor-positive serotypes of ""throat"" or ""skin"" origin. A third group, consisting mainly of opacity-factor-negative pyoderma serotypes, gave variable results and seemed to be intermediate between the other two categories. Complement-fixation-inhibition tests and absorption studies showed a marked degree of cross-reactivity between the M-associated antigens of the three categories.","['Widdowson JP', 'Maxted WR', 'Pinney AM']",1976,9,1,J Med Microbiol,"Widdowson JP, et al.

The Koch postulates necessary to confirm this hypothesis have been accomplished. 2nd ""Staphylococcus aureus"" produces a thermostable toxin that is active indepently of the staphilococcus and gives rise to the separation of the cells of the stratum granulosus of the epidermis and eventually exfoliation in suckling babies and in the newborn mouse. 3rd The ""Staphylococcus aureus"" may be present on the skin or in other localisations such as the bowel or pharinx. 4th The viable ""S. aureus"" when administered subcutaneously to the adult mice gives rise to lesions clinically and histologically similar to the impetigo observed in children. 5th The ""S. aureus"" killed by means of autoclave (that is, the staphylococcic toxine by itself does not give rise to any lesion when administered to the healthy adult mouse). Neijther has the SEE been observed in healthy adult man.

Hydration of the stratum corneum favors the growth of S. aureus. Before lesions of staphyloderma are produced, organisms multiply on the surface. Substances produced as the result of multiplication enter the skin and produce an irritant reaction characterized by necrobiosis, spongiosis followed by perivascular infiltration, exocytosis and intraepidermal vesicle formation.

The examination of the skin surface of the patient group, when compared with the corresponding control group, showed the following significant results: 1. an increase in the percentage of free cholesterol in skin surface lipids possibly as a result of an increased cell turnover in the epidermis, 2. a decrease in reducing substances as revealed by the ferricyanide and the phenolsulfuric acid methods in the so called water solubles, 3. a decrease in the alkali resistance of the skin possibly as a result of a decreased barrier function of the stratum corneum.

1107553,Enumeration of beta-haemolytic streptococci on normal skin by direct agar contact.,"Normal skin sites in children from a population in which streptococcal impetigo is endemic were examined for the presence of beta-haemolytic streptococci by a direct agar-contact technique. Ninety-eight of 554 samples (18%) were positive for these organisms. Penicillin prophylaxis reduced the frequency of isolation of streptococci from the normal skin for a period of 3 weeks, perhaps accounting in part for the lower isolation rate in this than in earlier studies. Numbers of streptococcal colony-forming units in positive samples were generally low, both in terms of absolute numbers isolated from the surface area sampled and in comparison with numbers of other aerobic flora recovered. The presence of streptococcal pyoderma at the time of agar contact was not necessarily associated with the presence of or with increased numbers of streptococci on samples obtained from normal skin sites. Low counts were consistently found in early summer and higher counts in some samples in late summer. In a simultaneous comparison of paired samples taken from adjacent sites, the frequency of detection of streptococci by direct agar contact compared favourably with that obtained with a moist-swab method. The increased frequency of detection by the agar-contact method appeared to be related to an increased sensitivity for the detection of low numbers of streptococcal colony-forming units on the normal skin.","['Brown J', 'Wannamaker LW', 'Ferrieri P']",1975,8,4,J Med Microbiol,"Brown J, et al.

810336,Streptococcal infections--updated.,"Streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. Infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. In newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (Table 1). In normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. Although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. Erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. Infections with group D streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group B streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. Streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see Table 1). Thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.","['Wannamaker LW', 'Ferrieri P']",1975,,,Dis Mon,Wannamaker LW and Ferrieri P.

In addition to the genetic ""typus neurodermiticus"", pharmaceutical, alimentary and respiratory allergens and psychological factors may play a part in the appearance of atopical dermatitis. Onset is usually in the 2nd to 6th month and the side of the face and the scalp are affected. The clinical picture varies considerably with age and includes sanious foci covered with scabs on the head and eczema flexurarum. Differences in family history, age and the location of sites will distinguish this form from seborrhoeic dermatitis. Gluteal dermitis is secondary to congestion caused by dampness, rugging and soaking, and the action of stools and urine (bacterial amniogenesis). The main complications of neonatal and infantile impetigo are: glomerulonephritis, exfoliative dermatitis, pulmonary abscess, pulmonitis and osteomyelitis; phlyctenular, serpiginous impetigo with large and small bullae is particularly important.

4829933,Effect of ethidium bromide on elimination of exfoliative toxin and bacteriocin production in Staphylococcus aureus.,"The scalded skin syndrome has been associated with phage group II staphylococci. The clinical manifestations of scalded skin syndrome, Ritter's disease, scarlatiniform erythema, and localized bullous impetigo, are due to the production of an extracellular protein, designated exfoliative toxin. Phage group II staphylococci can also produce an extracellular protein, bacteriocin, which is bacteriocidal for specific gram-positive microorganisms. Strain UT 0007 produces both bacteriocin and exfoliative toxin which appear to be products of extrachromosomal genes. These genes are jointly eliminated from strain UT 0007 after growth in either ethidium bromide or at high temperatures.","['Warren R', 'Rogolsky M', 'Wiley BB', 'Glasgow LA']",1974,118,3,J Bacteriol,"Warren R, et al.

Hamsters were challenged intradermally or intra-articularly with different streptococcal serotypes, and antibodies for streptolysin O (ASO), deoxyribonuclease B (anti-deoxyribonuclease B), and group A carbohydrate (anti-group A CHO) were determined. After a single injection at either site, 7 of 48 animals (14%) developed group A-CHO antibodies; however, none of the animals developed detectable levels of ASO or anti-deoxyribonuclease B. After repeated infections of the skin or joint, anti-deoxyribonuclease B antibodies were detectable in 13% (4 of 30) and 30% (5 of 17) of the animals, respectively. Elevations of ASO occurred after repeated joint infections in 4 of 16 animals (25%), whereas none of 30 hamsters repeatedly infected intradermally developed antibodies against streptolysin O. For all three antibodies tested, elevated levels were more frequently noted after repeated joint infections than after repeated skin infections with the same streptococcal serotype. These data, similar to ones previously noted in human impetigo, indicate that ASO responses are feeble after streptococcal skin infections and that the site of infection per se, rather than the infecting strain, appears to be responsible for this poor response.","['Dajani AS', 'Ferrieri P', 'Wannamaker LW']",1972,6,6,Infect Immun,"Dajani AS, et al.

5080412,Natural history of impetigo. I. Site sequence of acquisition and familial patterns of spread of cutaneous streptococci.,"The appearance on and spread of Group A streptococci among different body sites in relationship to the development of impetigo were studied prospectively in 31 children in five families. During July and August 1969 intensive clinical, bacteriological, and serological observations were made, including cultures taken at least every other day. In individual children, site sequence of spread of Group A streptococci was from normal skin to lesions and finally to respiratory tract. Streptococci were recovered from normal skin before development of lesions (mean interval of 10 days) in 74% of episodes. Recovery of streptococci from nose and throat followed (by means of 14 and 20 days, respectively) skin acquisition of streptococci (97% of episodes) and lesions (74% of episodes).Distribution of positive normal skin sites among wrist, ankle, and back was similar (28-37%) although 62% of lesions were on the legs. Recovery of a serotype from normal skin was associated with a high risk (76%) of subsequent development of lesions due to that type. New streptococcal serotypes usually entered a family during the peak or decline of a preceding serotoype with a tendency of one to predominate. Among family members the mean interval from index to secondary skin acquisition of streptococci was 4.8 days, but 21 days elapsed from first appearance to last acquisition of skin disease. In the population as a whole, streptococci were recovered in high frequency from normal skin before the increase in prevalence of lesions and also later in the fall when cutaneous infections were absent.","['Ferrieri P', 'Dajani AS', 'Wannamaker LW', 'Chapman SS']",1972,51,11,J Clin Invest,"Ferrieri P, et al.

4263498,Natural history of impetigo. II. Etiologic agents and bacterial interactions.,"Intensive observations on 37 children in a population with endemic skin infections provided an opportunity to study the interrelationships between and the significance of the bacterial genera commonly associated with impetigo. Cultures of the respiratory tract, three normal skin sites, and lesions, when present, were taken three times weekly from July to October 1969. Impetigo developed in all 37 children. Group A streptococci alone were recovered from 21% of 361 lesions, Staphylococcus aureus alone from 8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis alone from 5% and mixtures of streptococci and staphylococci from 61%. Vesicular or pustular lesions were more often pure streptococcal than pure staphylococcal. Streptococci alone were more often recovered from early stage lesions rather than from later ones. The pure staphylococcal lesions characteristically occurred early in the season whereas streptococcal or mixed lesions had later peaks.Serial observations on 74 lesions revealed longer persistence of streptococci than staphylococci in mixed lesions. In 85% of the instances the same streptococcal serotype was recovered repeatedly from an individual lesion, whereas staphylococcal types changed in 57% of instances. Phage type 75 accounted for the majority of staphylococcal isolates from all sites, whereas phage type 54 was recovered only from skin lesions. In contrast to streptococci, the site sequence of staphylococcal spread was from the nose to normal skin to skin lesions. These studies reveal important differences in the migration of staphylococci (as compared with streptococci) to various body sites and suggest a subsidiary role for staphylococci in nonbullous impetiginous lesions yielding both organisms.","['Dajani AS', 'Ferrieri P', 'Wannamaker LW']",1972,51,11,J Clin Invest,"Dajani AS, et al.

Cellular responses after streptococcal and staphylococcal infections.,"Various cellular responses to skin infections in an experimental animal model were explored. Total leukocyte counts varied after group A streptococcal infections, but a depression was commonly seen after M type 12 impetigo. Staphylococcus aureus infections resulted in moderate leukocytosis. A marked neutrophilia was universal with streptococcal or staphylococcal disease. A positive nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) response appeared 24 hr after infection, reached a peak in 48 hr, and then declined. This occurred in the absence of extensive cellulitis or bacteremia. An increase in the percentage and absolute number of NBT-positive neutrophils occurred. M type 57 streptococcus produced a more strongly positive NBT test than did M type 12. Cell-free filtrates of a broth culture of M type 57 streptococcus produced NBT responses in hamsters comparable to the responses seen after injection of live organisms. These studies indicate the usefulness of this animal model to study various parameters of the NBT test.","['Dajani AS', 'Wannamaker LW']",1972,5,6,Infect Immun,Dajani AS and Wannamaker LW.

15776563,Experimental infection of the skin in the hamster simulating human impetigo. III. Interaction between staphylococci and group A streptococci.,"The interaction between staphylococci and Group A beta hemolytic streptococci in mixed lesions was investigated in an experimental impetigo model. A strain of staphylococcus of phage Type 71, which has been shown in vitro to produce a bacteriocin for streptococci and other Gram-positive organisms, eliminates or reduces Group A streptococci in mixed lesions. In contrast, staphylococcal strains of phage Types 75 and 81, which do not produce a demonstrable bacteriocin in vitro, exhibit no such effect. Some variation was noted in the in vivo response of two different streptococcal M Types to the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci. Bacterial antagonism is more pronounced when staphylococci and streptococci are injected simultaneously into animals than when staphylococci are superimposed on preexisting streptococcal lesions. Marked variations were found in the numbers of viable streptococci (colony-forming units) recovered from individual lesions containing identical mixtures of streptococci and phage Type 71 staphylococci. The frequency of a demonstrable bactericidal effect was related to the number of streptococci injected. With small inocula of streptococci, the tendency towards an all-or-none effect was particularly striking. No evidence of selection of streptococcal or staphylococcal mutants which might explain this phenomenon was obtained. These observations suggest that the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci on other Gram-positive organisms, previously demonstrated in vitro, appears to operate also in vivo.","['Dajani AS', 'Wannamaker LW']",1971,134,3 Pt 1,J Exp Med,Dajani AS and Wannamaker LW.

5422020,Complement in overt and asymptomatic nephritis after skin infection.,"In an ongoing study of streptococcal skin infection and acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) begun in 1964, C'3 determinations were done in 784 patients. There were 126 patients with acute poststreptococcal nephritis, 172 of their siblings, and 486 patients with uncomplicated impetigo from families without an index case of nephritis.90% of the patients with nephritis were infected with one of the four prevalent streptococcal serotypes associated with nephritis in this population; only 12% of patients with uncomplicated impetigo were infected with similar serotypes.93% of the patients with overt nephritis had diminished complement levels. Low complement was more often observed (8%) in AGN siblings than was transient hypertension and/or hematuria (5%). Considering the relationship of low C'3 alone and low C'3 preceded hematuria in four others. Two (0.4%) of the patients with uncomplicated impetigo had low complement values, both of whom were infected with nephritogenic strains. Transient hematuria and/or hypertension was less frequently observed (2.7%) among patients with uncomplicated impetigo. Serial determinations in patients with low complement revealed a return to normal in a linear fashion within 2-12 wk. The validity of the hypothesis that the asymptomatic patients with low complement levels, with or without hematuria, likely had subclinical nephritis is strengthened by the accompanying epidemiologic data. The finding of low complement before the onset of, or in the absence of, hematuria or other evidence of nephritis supports the concept that an immunologic mechanism may precipitate the renal injury of acute streptococcal nephritis.","['Derrick CW', 'Reeves MS', 'Dillon HC']",1970,49,6,J Clin Invest,"Derrick CW, et al.

5946549,Impetigo. Bacteriologic features and renal involvement.,"One hundred children with impetigo were studied with particular emphasis upon the organism causing the infection and associated renal complications. In 50 per cent of cases, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus grew on cultures of material from the lesions, and evidence of recent infection with this organism as shown by an elevation of antistreptolysin O titer was present in an additional 17 per cent of cases. Acute glomerulonephritis developed in three of the 66 children with bacteriologic or serologic evidence of streptococcal infection. Four other children in this group and nine children with staphylococcal impetigo had unexplained microscopic hematuria. All children with nephritis already had evidence of the disease when first seen. In most of those with unexplained hematuria, this condition was detected at the first visit. Hematuria developed in others while they were receiving systemic antibiotics. The significance of isolated microscopic hematuria is uncertain, but is seen often in association with cutaneous infection with both staphylococcus and streptococcus. Microscopic hematuria as defined is apparently not prevented by antibiotic therapy. If acute glomerulonephritis that follows streptococcal cutaneous infection is to be prevented, streptococcal impetigo will have to be treated promptly after onset.",['Shuler SE'],1966,105,2,Calif Med,Shuler SE.

An intradermal skin test dose of 0.1 ml. was given initially. Reactors were forthwith placed in a separate category, otherwise this test injection was followed by intramuscular injection of 0.25 ml. of the vaccine, repeated a second time after six weeks. One hundred and sixty-nine controls received ""placebo vaccine"". Four months later the number of cases of impetigo in the vaccinated group had been reduced from 55 to 16. There was no reduction in the control group. The preventive effect waned after five months. The results of this field trial are considered encouraging.","['DILLENBERG H', 'WALDRON MP']",1963,89,18,Can Med Assoc J,DILLENBERG H and WALDRON MP.

14935883,Treatment of impetigo with sulfonamide-urea powder.,"Sulfonamides can be used in the treatment of impetigo with vastly increased safety and with more effectiveness in powder rather than ointment form when combined with urea powder in a ratio of approximately three parts of sulfonamide to one of urea. Of 701 patients treated with such a mixture, 95.6 per cent were cured within a week. The only complication was local dermatitis which occurred in 0.57 per cent of patients. This compares favorably with results obtained with newer and expensive drugs which usually have the disadvantage of being used in a greasy vehicle. The low incidence of sensitivity reaction to the sulfonamide-urea powder is perhaps ascribable in part to the avoidance of a greasy vehicle.","['REES RB', 'HAMLIN EM', 'McGINLEY JP']",1952,76,5,Calif Med,"REES RB, et al.
