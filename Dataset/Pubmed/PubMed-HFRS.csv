37652222,Predictive value of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive T cells for the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"PURPOSES: We aimed to investigate the levels of CD4
METHODS: The levels of DP T cells in 213 patients and 48 healthy donors were measured by flow cytometry, as were the levels of CD4
RESULTS: The frequency of DP T cells increased with disease severity and peaked in patients with critical disease. Furthermore, the level of DP T cells proportionally correlated with the levels of Cr, UA, and urea in the serum. In contrast, there was an inverse correlation between DP T cells and platelets. Interestingly, the pattern of change in DP T cell frequency was similar to those of CD8
CONCLUSIONS: The level of DP T cells is associated with HFRS severity, suggesting that it may be a potent indicator for the course of this disorder.","['Zhao HD', 'Sun JJ', 'Yu TB', 'Liu HL']",2023,120,,Clin Biochem,"Zhao HD, et al.

37636535,Rare central nervous system manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis in a 12-year-old child: A case report.,"To share a unique case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) identified in a child with CNS involvement, specifically PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Discuss this uncommon manifestation's clinical characteristics, diagnostic process, and treatment. We are currently discussing a 12-year-old female patient who presented with a chronic cough, shortness of breath, and a new-onset fever. Upon further examination, the patient was diagnosed with GPA, confirmed through positive cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA), a renal biopsy, and multiple lung cavitary lesions. During her hospitalization, the patient also experienced neurological symptoms, including a severe headache, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, and an abnormal neurological exam, which led to brain MR imaging. The imaging revealed evidence of small vessel vasculitis with confluent T2 hyper signal intensity of gray-white matter junctions in both parietooccipital and frontal lobes containing hemorrhagic components, suggesting Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. This case of Wegener's granulomatosis is noteworthy due to its occurrence in a pediatric patient with CNS involvement, specifically (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). This event highlights the importance of recognizing that autoimmune disorders can present infrequently in young patients. Diagnosing Wegener's granulomatosis can be challenging, particularly when the CNS is affected. However, when appropriate treatment is initiated promptly, favorable outcomes can be achieved, as evidenced by the patient's improved condition with the prednisolone, captopril, and Rituximab treatment plan. Further research is necessary to understand better the underlying pathophysiology and optimal management of CNS involvement in GPA, particularly in the pediatric population.","['Azin N', 'Hajihashemi A', 'Geravandi M']",2023,18,10,Radiol Case Rep,"Azin N, et al.

37632012,Differences in the Susceptibility of Human Tubular Epithelial Cells for Infection with Orthohantaviruses.,"Diseases induced by infection with pathogenic orthohantaviruses are characterized by a pronounced organ-specific manifestation. Pathogenic Eurasian orthohantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with often massive proteinuria. Therefore, the use of a relevant kidney cell culture would be favorable to analyze the underlying cellular mechanisms of orthohantavirus-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). We tested different human tubular epithelial cell lines for their suitability as an in vitro infection model. Permissiveness and replication kinetics of highly pathogenic Hantaan virus (HTNV) and non-/low-pathogenic Tula virus (TULV) were analyzed in tubular epithelial cell lines and compared to human primary tubular epithelial cells. Ana-lysis of the cell line HK-2 revealed the same results for viral replication, morphological and functional effects as observed for HTNV in primary cells. In contrast, the cell lines RPTEC/TERT1 and TH1 demonstrated only poor infection rates after inoculation with HTNV and are unusable as an infection model. While pathogenic HNTV infects primary tubular and HK-2 cells, non-/low-pathogenic TULV infects neither primary tubular cells nor the cell line HK-2. Our results show that permissiveness of renal cells varies between orthohantaviruses with differences in pathogenicity and that HK-2 cells demonstrate a suitable in vitro model to study viral tropism and pathogenesis of orthohantavirus-induced AKI.","['Schreiber P', 'Friedrich AK', 'Gruber G', 'Nusshag C', 'Boegelein L', 'Essbauer S', 'Uhrig J', 'Zeier M', 'Krautkrämer E']",2023,15,8,Viruses,"Schreiber P, et al.

37602312,Hantavirus infections in the South‑Eastern European countries: A study of two cases and literature review.,"Hantavirus infection is a rare zoonosis in South-Eastern Europe. Depending on the serotype involved, the virus can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome which is also known as endemic nephropathy, and cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt diagnosis of the disease is essential for reducing the risk of severe manifestations and complications like chronic kidney disease, secondary hypertension or even death because there is no specific treatment or vaccine approved. The present study reported two cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome diagnosed in the Department of Nephrology of The Fundeni Clinical Institute (Romania). In both patients, kidney needle biopsy played a major role in establishing the diagnosis. The difficulties encountered in diagnosing this disease were also emphasized, taking into consideration the rarity of this infection in South-Eastern Europe. The key literature data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of this infection were further reviewed.","['Lupuşoru G', 'Andronesi AG', 'Lupuşoru M', 'Ailincăi I', 'Sfeatcu R', 'Văcăroiu I', 'Banu M', 'Achim C', 'Ismail G']",2023,26,3,Exp Ther Med,"Lupuşoru G, et al.

37585670,Increased blood CD226<sup>-</sup> inflammatory monocytes with low antigen presenting potential correlate positively with severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Inflammatory monocytes (iMOs) are involved in early antiviral responses. Previous studies have found that blood iMOs numbers increase in the acute phase of HFRS. Here, we further identified the phenotypic characteristics of iMOs in HFRS and explored whether phenotypic changes in iMOs were associated with HFRS severity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 85 HFRS patients were used for phenotypic analysis of iMOs by flow cytometry. Plasma HTNV load was determined using RT-PCR. THP-1 cells overexpressing CD226 were used to investigate the effects of CD226 on HLA-DR/DP/DQ and CD80 expression. A mouse model was used to test macrophage phenotype following HTNV infection.
RESULTS: The proportion of CD226

37562571,"Puumala orthohantavirus circulation in its wild reservoir, the bank vole, during the 2021 outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Jura, France.","OBJECTIVE: A large and unprecedented outbreak of an attenuated form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome called nephropathia epidemica (NE) and caused by Puumala virus (PUUV) occurred in 2021 in the southern Jura Mountains (France) leading to numerous hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to investigate the circulation of PUUV in its animal reservoir at the time of this outbreak.
METHODS: We conjointly surveyed bank vole relative abundance, small mammal community composition, and PUUV circulation in bank voles (seroprevalence and genetic diversity) in the Jura NE epidemic area, between 2020 and 2022.
RESULTS: Trapping results showed a higher relative abundance of bank voles in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2022. Extremely high levels of PUUV seroprevalence in bank voles were found at the time of the human NE epidemic with seropositive animals trapped in almost all trap lines as of spring 2021. Genetic analyses of PUUV (S segment) gathered in 2021 at two sampling sites revealed a strong clustering of these strains within the ""Jura"" clade. No significant genetic variation was detected compared to what was already known to be circulating in the Jura region.
CONCLUSION: These results underline a need for enhanced monitoring of PUUV circulation in host reservoir populations in NE endemic areas. This would enable the relevant actors to better inform and sensitize the public on this zoonotic risk, and to implement prevention strategies in collaboration with physicians.","['Castel G', 'Alburkat H', 'Tatard C', 'Dutra L', 'Criado M', 'Bouilloud M', 'Pradel J', 'Sironen T', 'Charbonnel N']",2023,53,8,Infect Dis Now,"Castel G, et al.

37492567,Identification and characterization of codon usage pattern and influencing factors in HFRS-causing hantaviruses.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral zoonosis carried and transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. The etiology of HFRS is complex due to the involvement of viral factors and host immune and genetic factors which hinder the development of potential therapeutic solutions for HFRS. Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and Puumala virus (PUUV) are predominantly found in hantaviral species that cause HFRS in patients. Despite ongoing prevention and control efforts, HFRS remains a serious economic burden worldwide. Furthermore, recent studies reported that the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein is a multi-functional protein and plays a major role in the replication cycle of the hantavirus. However, the precise mechanism of the nucleoproteins in viral pathogenesis is not completely understood. In the framework of the current study, various ","['Noor F', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Bakar A', 'Qasim M', 'Masoud MS', 'Alshammari A', 'Alharbi M', 'Riaz MS']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Noor F, et al.

37486953,Time series analyses based on the joint lagged effect analysis of pollution and meteorological factors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and the construction of prediction model.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-related zoonotic disease induced by hantavirus. Previous studies have identified the influence of meteorological factors on the onset of HFRS, but few studies have focused on the stratified analysis of the lagged effects and interactions of pollution and meteorological factors on HFRS.
METHODS: We collected meteorological, contaminant and epidemiological data on cases of HFRS in Shenyang from 2005-2019. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model was used to predict the incidence of HFRS and compared with Holt-Winters three-parameter exponential smoothing model. A distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) with a maximum lag period of 16 days was applied to assess the lag, stratification and extreme effects of pollution and meteorological factors on HFRS cases, followed by a generalized additive model (GAM) to explore the interaction of SO2 and two other meteorological factors on HFRS cases.
RESULTS: The SARIMA monthly model has better fit and forecasting power than its own quarterly model and the Holt-Winters model, with an optimal model of (1,1,0) (2,1,0)12. Overall, environmental factors including humidity, wind speed and SO2 were correlated with the onset of HFRS and there was a non-linear exposure-lag-response association. Extremely high SO2 increased the risk of HFRS incidence, with the maximum RR values: 2.583 (95%CI:1.145,5.827). Extremely low windy and low SO2 played a significant protective role on HFRS infection, with the minimum RR values: 0.487 (95%CI:0.260,0.912) and 0.577 (95%CI:0.370,0.898), respectively. Interaction indicated that the risk of HFRS infection reached its highest when increasing daily SO2 and decreasing humidity.
CONCLUSIONS: The SARIMA model may help to enhance the forecast of monthly HFRS incidence based on a long-range dataset. Our study had shown that environmental factors such as humidity and SO2 have a delayed effect on the occurrence of HFRS and that the effect of humidity can be influenced by SO2 and wind speed. Public health professionals should take greater care in controlling HFRS in low humidity, low windy conditions and 2-3 days after SO2 levels above 200 μg/m3.","['Chen Y', 'Hou W', 'Dong J']",2023,17,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Chen Y, et al.

37486218,Molecular Detection of Orthohantavirus puumalaense in Plasma and Urine Samples from Hospitalized Patients Presenting with a Serologically Confirmed Acute Hantavirus Infection in France.,"Molecular detection of Orthohantavirus puumalaense (PUUV) RNA during the course of the disease has been studied in blood of patients in Sweden and Slovenia. The use of urine has been poorly investigated. The aims of this work were to study PUUV RNA detection in plasma from a cohort of patients in France where a different PUUV lineage circulates and to assess the use of urine instead of plasma. Matched plasma and urine samples were collected daily from hospitalized patients presenting with fever, pain, and thrombocytopenia within the last 8 days and testing positive for IgM and IgG against PUUV in serum collected at inclusion and/or approximately 1 month after release. RNA was extracted from samples, and PUUV RNA was detected using real-time reverse transcription-PCR for plasma and urine samples. Sixty-seven patients presented a serologically confirmed acute hantavirus infection. At inclusion, PUUV RNA was detected in plasma from 55 of 62 patients (88.7%) sampled within the first week after disease onset, whereas it was detected in 15 of 60 (25.0%) of matched urine samples. It was then detected from 33 (71.7%) and 2 (4.4%) of 46 patients discharged from the hospital during the second week after disease onset, in plasma and urine, respectively. When PUUV RNA was detected in urine it was also detected in plasma, and not vice versa. Detection of PUUV RNA in plasma from hospitalized patients in France is similar to that observed in Sweden and Slovenia. Urine is not an appropriate sample for this detection.","['Reynes JM', 'Schaeffer L', 'Papadopoulos P', 'Ait-Ahmed M', 'Siby-Diakite D', 'Ripaux-Lefèvre M', 'Buivan TP', 'Lechat S', 'Vray M', 'Galempoix JM', 'HANTADIAG Study Group']",2023,61,8,J Clin Microbiol,"Reynes JM, et al.

37452472,Validation of Frail Scale and comparison with hospital frailty risk score to predict hospital use in a cohort of older Australian women.,"INTRODUCTION: With no standard frailty tool for clinical care, research and policymaking, identifying frail older people is a challenge.
AIMS: This study aimed to compare two validated scales, which are the Frail Scale and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) for their ability in identifying frailty in older Australian women and predicting hospital use.
METHODS: This study included older Australian women aged 75-95 years, who had unplanned overnight hospital admission as an index admission between 2001 and 2016. Data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) were linked with administrative hospital data to calculate HFRS (using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Australia Modification (ICD-10-AM) diagnostic codes) and the Frail Scale (using the ALSWH self-reported survey).
RESULTS: The Frail Scale identified a higher proportion of older frail women (30.54%) compared to the HFRS (23.0%). Frail older women, classified by Frail Scale, were at higher risk of long hospital stay (adjusted odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.02-1.60), repeated admission (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.41) and death (AHR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.45-2.01). HFRS was associated with longer hospital stay and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of older women classified as frail by the Frail Scale tool was higher than women classified as frail by HFRS. The Frail Scale and HFRS were not significantly associated with each other. While both tools were associated with the risk of long hospital stay and mortality, only the Frail Scale predicted the risk of repeated admission.","['Shebeshi DS', 'Dolja-Gore X', 'Byles J']",2023,38,5,Int J Health Plann Manage,"Shebeshi DS, et al.

37428512,Hantavirus Infections among Military Forces.,"INTRODUCTION: Hantaviruses cause two kinds of clinical syndromes. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is caused by Hantaan virus in Asia, Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava virus in Europe, and Seoul virus worldwide. Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is caused by Sin Nombre virus in North America and Andes virus and related viruses in Latin America. All hantaviruses are carried by rodents and insectivores. Humans are infected via inhaled aerosols of rodent excreta. In the history, there are several epidemics of acute infectious diseases during many wars, which have been suggested or proven to be caused by various hantaviruses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review of 41 original publications and reviews published between 1943 and 2022 was performed. Among them, 23 publications handle hantavirus infections among military forces, and the rest 17 hantavirus infections themselves.
RESULTS: A large epidemic during World War II in 1942 among German and Finnish soldiers in Northern Finland with more than 1,000 patients was most probably caused by PUUV. During Korean War in 1951-1954,∼ 3,200 cases occurred among United Nations soldiers in an epidemic caused by Hantaan virus. During Balkan war from 1991 to 1995, numerous soldiers got ill because of hantavirus infection caused by PUUV and Dobrava virus. Several other reports of cases of various hantavirus infections especially among U.S. soldiers acting in South Korea, Germany, Bosnia, and Kosovo have been described in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Military maneuvers usually include soil removal, spreading, digging with accompanied dust, and living in field and other harsh conditions, which easily expose soldiers to rodents and their excreta. Therefore, the risks of hantavirus infections in military context are obvious. All military infections have been caused by hantaviruses leading to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.","['Mustonen J', 'Henttonen H', 'Vaheri A']",2023,,,Mil Med,"Mustonen J, et al.

37402555,Using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score to assess mortality risk in older medical patients admitted to the intensive care unit.,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic information at the time of hospital discharge can help guide goals-of-care discussions for future care. We sought to assess the association between the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), which may highlight patients' risk of adverse outcomes at the time of hospital discharge, and in-hospital death among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 12 months of a previous hospital discharge.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study that included patients aged 75 years or older admitted at least twice over a 12-month period to the general medicine service at 7 academic centres and large community-based teaching hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, from Apr. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2019. The HFRS (categorized as low, moderate or high frailty risk) was calculated at the time of discharge from the first hospital admission. Outcomes included ICU admission and death during the second hospital admission.
RESULTS: The cohort included 22 178 patients, of whom 1767 (8.0%) were categorized as having high frailty risk, 9464 (42.7%) as having moderate frailty risk, and 10 947 (49.4%) as having low frailty risk. One hundred patients (5.7%) with high frailty risk were admitted to the ICU, compared to 566 (6.0%) of those with moderate risk and 790 (7.2%) of those with low risk. After adjustment for age, sex, hospital, day of admission, time of admission and Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score, the odds of ICU admission were not significantly different for patients with high (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 1.23) or moderate (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) frailty risk compared to those with low frailty risk. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 75 (75.0%) of those with high frailty risk died, compared to 317 (56.0%) of those with moderate risk and 416 (52.7%) of those with low risk. After multivariable adjustment, the risk of death after ICU admission was higher for patients with high frailty risk than for those with low frailty risk (adjusted OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.77 to 4.77).
INTERPRETATION: Among patients readmitted to hospital within 12 months, patients with high frailty risk were similarly likely as those with lower frailty risk to be admitted to the ICU but were more likely to die if admitted to ICU. The HFRS at hospital discharge can inform prognosis, which can help guide discussions for preferences for ICU care during future hospital stays.","['Detsky ME', 'Shin S', 'Fralick M', 'Munshi L', 'Kruser JM', 'Courtright KR', 'Lapointe-Shaw L', 'Tang T', 'Rawal S', 'Kwan JL', 'Weinerman A', 'Razak F', 'Verma AA']",2023,11,4,CMAJ Open,"Detsky ME, et al.

We provide an overview of epidemiological surveillance of hantavirus disease (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hantavirus fever) during the period 1999-2019 by including all reported and confirmed cases according to the case definition established by the health authority. Our findings reveal that hantavirus disease is a low-frequency disease, affecting primarily young people, with a relatively low case-fatality rate compared to other hantaviruses in the Americas (e.g., ANDV and SNV). It presents an annual variation with peaks every 4-5 years and an interannual variation influenced by agricultural activities. Hantavirus disease is endemic in about 27% of Panama, which corresponds to agroecological conditions that favor the population dynamics of the rodent host, ","['Armién B', 'Muñoz C', 'Cedeño H', 'Salazar JR', 'Salinas TP', 'González P', 'Trujillo J', 'Sánchez D', 'Mariñas J', 'Hernández A', 'Cruz H', 'Villarreal LY', 'Grimaldo E', 'González S', 'Nuñez H', 'Hesse S', 'Rivera F', 'Edwards G', 'Chong R', 'Mendoza O', 'Meza M', 'Herrera M', 'Kant R', 'Esquivel R', 'Estripeaut D', 'Serracín D', 'Denis B', 'Robles E', 'Mendoza Y', 'Gonzalez G', 'Tulloch F', 'Pascale JM', 'Dunnum JL', 'Cook JA', 'Armién AG', 'Gracia F', 'Guerrero GA', 'de Mosca I']",2023,15,6,Viruses,"Armién B, et al.

37365496,Dengue hemorrhagic fever with bleeding and fluid overload in a patient with active lupus nephritis: a case report of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and management of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) can be challenging in the presence of confounding comorbidities. Important confounders are conditions that alter hematological parameters and intra/extra vascular fluid distribution. We report the case of a patient with active lupus nephritis, who developed DHF with subsequent bleeding and fluid overload. This is the first case report to highlight a unique set of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in DHF in this context.
CASE PRESENTATION: A seventeen-year-old girl with lupus nephritis class IV developed a renal flare of lupus and subsequently developed DHF with bleeding per vaginum. Due to acute kidney injury, she was managed with a restrictive fluid approach during the ascending limb with blood transfusion when required, and close monitoring for hemodynamic instability. During the descending limb, hourly input was transiently increased due to a rise in hematocrit. This precipitated nephrogenic pulmonary edema, which was managed with mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient posed two diagnostic challenges: diagnosis of dengue in a patient with lupus-related bicytopenia, and diagnosis of dengue leakage in a patient with nephrotic syndrome-related ascites. There were three therapeutic difficulties: deciding the fluid quota for DHF in the presence of renal impairment, and balancing the risks and benefits of steroids and anticoagulation in lupus nephritis with dengue. As decisions in such instances are patient-specific, sharing of individual experiences will help guide management decisions.","['Vidanapathirana M', 'Atukorala I']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,Vidanapathirana M and Atukorala I.

37329903,Investigation of a subunit protein vaccine for HFRS based on a consensus sequence between envelope glycoproteins of HTNV and SEOV.,"Due to the global resurgence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), more attention is being focused on this dangerous illness. In China and Korea, the only vaccines available are the virus-inactivated vaccine against Hantaan virus (HTNV) or Seoul virus (SEOV), but their efficacy and safety are inadequate. Therefore, it is important to develop new vaccines that are safer and more efficient to neutralize and regulate areas with a high prevalence of HFRS. We employed bioinformatics methods to design a recombinant protein vaccine based on conserved regions of protein consensus sequences in HTNV and SEOV membranes. The S2 Drosophila expression system was utilized to enhance protein expression, solubility and immunogenicity. After the Gn and Gc proteins of HTNV and SEOV were successfully expressed, mice were immunized, and the humoral immunity, cellular immunity, and in vivo protection of the HFRS universal subunit vaccine were systematically evaluated in mouse models. These results indicated that the HFRS subunit vaccine generated elevated levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies, particularly IgG1, compared to that of the traditional inactivated HFRS vaccine. Additionally, the spleen cells of immunized mice secreted IFN-r and IL-4 cytokines effectively. Moreover, the HTNV-Gc protein vaccine successfully protected suckling mice from HTNV infection and stimulated GC responses. In this research, a new scientific approach is investigated to develop a universal HFRS subunit protein vaccine that is capable of producing effective humoral and cellular immunity in mice. The results suggest that this vaccine could be a promising candidate for preventing HFRS in humans.","['Liu R', 'Lv Y', 'Sun W', 'Li M', 'Ge N', 'Zhu C', 'Ding Y', 'Liu Z', 'Ma R', 'Huang Y', 'Hou S', 'Ying Q', 'Gu T', 'Wang F', 'Nie L', 'Wang Y', 'Huang W', 'Shu J', 'Wu X']",2023,334,,Virus Res,"Liu R, et al.

37329347,Frailty in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the risk analysis index.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated frailty in the setting of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) using large-scale data. The risk analysis index (RAI) may be implemented at the bedside or assessed retrospectively, differentiating it from other indices used in administrative registry-based research.
METHODS: Adult aSAH hospitalizations were identified in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2015 to 2019. Complex samples statistical methods were performed to evaluate the comparative effect size and discriminative ability of the RAI, the modified frailty index (mFI), and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Poor functional outcome was determined by the NIS-SAH Outcome Measure (NIS-SOM), shown to have high concordance with modified Rankin Scale scores > 2.
RESULTS: 42,300 aSAH hospitalizations were identified in the NIS during the study period. By both ordinal [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.05, 3.36, p < 0.001] and categorical stratification [frail aOR 3.59, 95% CI 3.39, 3.80, p < 0.001; severely frail aOR 6.67, 95% CI 5.78, 7.69, p < 0.001], the RAI achieved the largest effect sizes for NIS-SOM in comparison with the mFI and HFRS. Discrimination of the RAI for NIS-SOM in high-grade aSAH was significantly greater than that of the HFRS (c-statistic 0.651 vs. 0.615). The mFI demonstrated the lowest discrimination in both high-grade and normal-grade patients. A combined Hunt and Hess-RAI model (c-statistic 0.837, 95% CI 0.828, 0.845) for NIS-SOM achieved significantly greater discrimination than both the combined models for mFI and HFRS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The RAI was robustly associated with poor functional outcomes in aSAH independent of established risk factors.","['Dicpinigaitis AJ', 'Kazim SF', 'Al-Mufti F', 'Hall DE', 'Reitz KE', 'Rumalla K', 'McIntyre MK', 'Arthur AS', 'Srinivasan VM', 'Burkhardt JK', 'Schmidt MH', 'Gandhi CD', 'Bowers CA']",2023,,,J Neurol,"Dicpinigaitis AJ, et al.

37326605,A comparison of three approaches to measuring frailty to determine adverse health outcomes in critically ill patients.,"BACKGROUND: studies comparing different frailty measures in intensive care unit settings are lacking. We aimed to compare the frailty index based on physiological and laboratory tests (FI-Lab), modified frailty index (MFI) and hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) to predict short-term outcomes for critically ill patients.
METHODS: we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality and discharge with need for nursing care.
RESULTS: the primary analysis was conducted with 21,421 eligible critically ill patients. After adjusting for confounding variables, frailty as diagnosed by all three frailty measures was found to be significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In addition, frail patients were more likely to receive further nursing care after being discharged. All three frailty scores could improve the discrimination ability of the initial model generated by baseline characteristics for adverse outcomes. The FI-Lab had the best predictive ability for in-hospital mortality, whereas the HFRS had the best predictive performance for discharge with need for nursing care amongst the three frailty measures. A combination of the FI-Lab with either the HFRS or MFI improved the identification of critically ill patients at increased risk of in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: frailty, as assessed by the HFRS, MFI and FI-Lab, was associated with short-term survival and discharge with need for nursing care amongst critically ill patients. The FI-Lab was a better predictor of in-hospital mortality than the HFRS and MFI. Future studies focusing on FI-Lab are warranted.","['Hao B', 'Chen T', 'Qin J', 'Meng W', 'Bai W', 'Zhao L', 'Ou X', 'Liu H', 'Xu W']",2023,52,6,Age Ageing,"Hao B, et al.

An Old World versus New World dichotomy is frequently applied to distinguish human diseases caused by orthohantaviruses. However, this geographic grouping masks the importance of phylogeny and virus-host ecology in shaping orthohantavirus traits, especially since related arvicoline rodents and their orthohantaviruses are found in both regions. We argue that orthohantaviruses can be separated into three phylogenetically based rodent host groups with differences in key functional traits, including human disease, transmission route, and virus-host fidelity. This framework can help understand and predict traits of under-studied and newly discovered orthohantaviruses and guide public health and biosafety policy.","['Mull N', 'Seifert SN', 'Forbes KM']",2023,,,Trends Microbiol,"Mull N, et al.

37275658,Frailty as a risk-stratification tool in patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).,"OBJECTIVES: The concept of frailty has gained importance, especially in patients with liver disease. Our study systematically investigated the effect of frailty on post-procedural outcomes in patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
METHODS: We used National Inpatient Sample(NIS) 2016-2019 data to identify patients who underwent TIPS. Hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) was used to classify patients as frail (HFRS>=5) and non-frail (HFRS<5). The relationship between frailty and outcomes such as death, post-procedural shock, non-home discharge, length of stay (LOS), post-procedural LOS, and total hospitalization charges (THC) was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 13,700 patients underwent TIPS during 2016-2019. Of them, 5,995 (43.76%) patients were frail, while 7,705 (56.24%) were non-frail. There were no significant differences between the two groups based on age, gender, race, insurance, and income. Frail patients had higher mortality (15.18% vs. 2.07%, p<0.001), a higher incidence of non-home discharge (53.38% vs. 19.08%, p<0.001), a longer overall LOS (12.5 days vs. 3.35,p<0.001), longer post-procedural stay (8.2 days vs. 3.4 days, p<0.001), and higher THC ($240,746.7 vs. $121,763.1, p<0.001) compared to the non-frail patients. On multivariate analysis, frail patients had a statistically significant higher risk of mortality (aOR-3.22, 95% CI-1.98- 5.00, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Frailty assessment can be beneficial in risk stratification in patients undergoing TIPS.","['Sohal A', 'Chaudhry H', 'Kohli I', 'Arora K', 'Patel J', 'Dhillon N', 'Singh I', 'Dukovic D', 'Roytman M']",2023,8,2,J Frailty Sarcopenia Falls,"Sohal A, et al.

37234545,Discovering common pathogenic processes between COVID-19 and HFRS by integrating RNA-seq differential expression analysis with machine learning.,"Zoonotic virus spillover in human hosts including outbreaks of Hantavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) imposes a serious impact on the quality of life of patients. Recent studies provide a shred of evidence that patients with Hantavirus-caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Both RNA viruses shared a higher degree of clinical features similarity including dry cough, high fever, shortness of breath, and certain reported cases with multiple organ failure. However, there is currently no validated treatment option to tackle this global concern. This study is attributed to the identification of common genes and perturbed pathways by combining differential expression analysis with bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. Initially, the transcriptomic data of hantavirus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and SARS-CoV-2 infected PBMCs were analyzed through differential gene expression analysis for identification of common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The functional annotation by enrichment analysis of common genes demonstrated immune and inflammatory response biological processes enriched by DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was then constructed and six genes named RAD51, ALDH1A1, UBA52, CUL3, GADD45B, and CDKN1A were identified as the commonly dysregulated hub genes among HFRS and COVID-19. Later, the classification performance of these hub genes were evaluated using Random Forest (RF), Poisson Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA), Voom-based Nearest Shrunken Centroids (voomNSC), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers which demonstrated accuracy >70%, suggesting the biomarker potential of the hub genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that unveiled biological processes and pathways commonly dysregulated in HFRS and COVID-19, which could be in the next future used for the design of personalized treatment to prevent the linked attacks of COVID-19 and HFRS.","['Noor F', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Bakar A', 'Ul Haq W', 'Allemailem KS', 'Alharbi BF', 'Al-Megrin WAI', 'Tahir Ul Qamar M']",2023,14,,Front Microbiol,"Noor F, et al.

37200083,The Spatiotemporal Pattern and Its Determinants of Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal Syndrome in Northeastern China: Spatiotemporal Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a significant zoonotic disease mainly transmitted by rodents. However, the determinants of its spatiotemporal patterns in Northeast China remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of HFRS and detect the meteorological effect of the HFRS epidemic in Northeastern China.
METHODS: The HFRS cases of Northeastern China were collected from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and meteorological data were collected from the National Basic Geographic Information Center. Times series analyses, wavelet analysis, Geodetector model, and SARIMA model were performed to identify the epidemiological characteristics, periodical fluctuation, and meteorological effect of HFRS in Northeastern China.
RESULTS: A total of 52,655 HFRS cases were reported in Northeastern China from 2006 to 2020, and most patients with HFRS (n=36,558, 69.43%) were aged between 30-59 years. HFRS occurred most frequently in June and November and had a significant 4- to 6-month periodicity. The explanatory power of the meteorological factors to HFRS varies from 0.15 ≤ q ≤ 0.01. In Heilongjiang province, mean temperature with a 4-month lag, mean ground temperature with a 4-month lag, and mean pressure with a 5-month lag had the most explanatory power on HFRS. In Liaoning province, mean temperature with a 1-month lag, mean ground temperature with a 1-month lag, and mean wind speed with a 4-month lag were found to have an effect on HFRS, but in Jilin province, the most important meteorological factors for HFRS were precipitation with a 6-month lag and maximum evaporation with a 5-month lag. The interaction analysis of meteorological factors mostly showed nonlinear enhancement. The SARIMA model predicted that 8,343 cases of HFRS are expected to occur in Northeastern China.
CONCLUSIONS: HFRS showed significant inequality in epidemic and meteorological effects in Northeastern China, and eastern prefecture-level cities presented a high risk of epidemic. This study quantifies the hysteresis effects of different meteorological factors and prompts us to focus on the influence of ground temperature and precipitation on HFRS transmission in future studies, which could assist local health authorities in developing HFRS-climate surveillance, prevention, and control strategies targeting high-risk populations in China.","['Wang Y', 'Wei X', 'Jia R', 'Peng X', 'Zhang X', 'Yang M', 'Li Z', 'Guo J', 'Chen Y', 'Yin W', 'Zhang W', 'Wang Y']",2023,9,,JMIR Public Health Surveill,"Wang Y, et al.

37194039,"Potential distribution of Leptotrombidium scutellare in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, China, and its association with mite-borne disease transmission.","BACKGROUND: Leptotrombidium scutellare is one of the six main vectors of scrub typhus in China and is a putative vector of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). This mite constitutes a large portion of the chigger mite community in southwest China. Although empirical data on its distribution are available for several investigated sites, knowledge of the species' association with human well-being and involvement in the prevalence of mite-borne diseases remains scarce.
METHODS: Occurrence data on the chigger mite were obtained from 21 years (2001-2021) of field sampling. Using boosted regression tree (BRT) ecological models based on climate, land cover and elevation variables, we predicted the environmental suitability for L. scutellare in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces. The potential distribution range and shifts in the study area for near-current and future scenarios were mapped and the scale of L. scutellare interacting with human activities was evaluated. We tested the explanatory power of the occurrence probability of L. scutellare on incidences of mite-borne diseases.
RESULTS: Elevation and climate factors were the most important factors contributing to the prediction of the occurrence pattern of L. scutellare. The most suitable habitats for this mite species were mainly concentrated around high-elevation areas, with predictions for the future showing a trend towards a reduction. Human activity was negatively correlated with the environmental suitability of L. scutellare. The occurrence probability of L. scutellare in Yunnan Province had a strong explanatory power on the epidemic pattern of HFRS but not scrub typhus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the exposure risks introduced by L. scutellare in the high-elevation areas of southwest China. Climate change may lead to a range contraction of this species towards areas of higher elevation and lessen the associated exposure risk. A comprehensive understanding of the transmission risk requires more surveillance efforts.","['Song WY', 'Lv Y', 'Yin PW', 'Yang YY', 'Guo XG']",2023,16,1,Parasit Vectors,"Song WY, et al.

37188347,Case Report: Multiple Organ Failure Caused by Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a natural epidemic disease caused by hantavirus (HV), is one of the viral diseases that pose a major threat to our health. Considering the increasing number of atypical-onset cases reported in some countries, it is important to be familiar with the symptoms of HFRS and the signs of HV infection. This report describes the case of a 55-year-old man with complaints of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. His symptoms showed no significant improvement after routine anti-infective, antipyretic, and other symptomatic supportive treatments administered at a local clinic. During these treatments, the patient had progressive oliguria; after 3 days, he also developed multiple organ failures, such as the liver and kidney, and was examined for positive serum IgM antibodies to hemorrhagic fever during treatment at our hospital. The patient was finally diagnosed with HFRS followed by multiple organ failure. After antiviral therapy, including ribavirin, piperacillin, and tazobactam, continuous renal replacement therapy, fluid metabolism adjustment, and related supportive therapy were administered, which improved his liver and kidney function. He was discharged on the 25th day after hospitalization. It is difficult to manage patients who develop multiple organ failure after HFRS. Moreover, this condition is rare in clinical settings, with fever being the initial indication. For diseases with unknown origin such as refractory fever and diarrhea, it is crucial to differentiate them from common pathogenic infection and HV infections to provide timely treatment that improves the prognosis of patients.","['Wang R', 'Zhao XY', 'Liu XJ', 'Zhang M', 'Sun YT', 'Ning X', 'Xu J', 'Bu CY']",2023,109,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Wang R, et al.

37170433,Hearing Impairment and Incident Frailty in Later Life: The Health in Men Study (HIMS).,"OBJECTIVES: This study is designed to determine if hearing loss is associated with increased risk of frailty in later life.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrieved data of a community sample of men aged 70 years and above living in the metropolitan region of Perth, Western Australia. 3,285 participants who were free of frailty at the beginning of the study were followed for up to 17 years. Data were retrieved from the Health in Men Study (HIMS) and the Western Australian Data Linkage System (WADLS).
MEASUREMENTS: Hearing loss was defined by self-report or by diagnosis recorded in the WADLS. Incident frailty was assessed using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS).
RESULTS: A total of 2,348 (71.5%) men developed frailty during follow up. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.95-1.12). The majority of the participants became frail by age 90 regardless of hearing condition. The time point where half of the group become frail was delayed by 14.4 months for men without hearing loss compared with hearing impaired men.
CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss is not associated with incident frailty in men aged 70 years or older when frailty was measured by HFRS. However, this statistically non-significant result could be due to the low sensitivity of study measures. Also, we found a trend that men with hearing loss were more likely to develop frailty compared with their normal-hearing peers, suggesting a potential association between hearing loss and frailty.","['Tian R', 'Trevenen M', 'Ford AH', 'Jayakody DMP', 'Hankey GJ', 'Yeap BB', 'Golledge J', 'Flicker L', 'Almeida OP']",2023,27,4,J Nutr Health Aging,"Tian R, et al.

37142192,Development of a novel minigenome and recombinant VSV expressing Seoul hantavirus glycoprotein-based assays to identify anti-hantavirus therapeutics.,"Seoul virus (SEOV) is an emerging global health threat that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which results in case fatality rates of ∼2%. There are no approved treatments for SEOV infections. We developed a cell-based assay system to identify potential antiviral compounds for SEOV and generated additional assays to characterize the mode of action of any promising antivirals. To test if candidate antivirals targeted SEOV glycoprotein-mediated entry, we developed a recombinant reporter vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SEOV glycoproteins. To facilitate the identification of candidate antiviral compounds targeting viral transcription/replication, we successfully generated the first reported minigenome system for SEOV. This SEOV minigenome (SEOV-MG) screening assay will also serve as a prototype assay for discovery of small molecules inhibiting replication of other hantaviruses, including Andes and Sin Nombre viruses. Ours is a proof-of-concept study in which we tested several compounds previously reported to have activity against other negative-strand RNA viruses using our newly developed hantavirus antiviral screening systems. These systems can be used under lower biocontainment conditions than those needed for infectious viruses, and identified several compounds with robust anti-SEOV activity. Our findings have important implications for the development of anti-hantavirus therapeutics.","['Shrivastava-Ranjan P', 'Jain S', 'Chatterjee P', 'Montgomery JM', 'Flint M', 'Albariño C', 'Spiropoulou CF']",2023,214,,Antiviral Res,"Shrivastava-Ranjan P, et al.

37140839,Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) Predicts Adverse Outcomes Among Hospitalized Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis.,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of frailty among patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its impact on clinical outcomes is unclear. We report the impact of frailty on mortality, readmission rates, and healthcare utilization among patients with chronic pancreatitis in the United States.
METHODS: We extracted data on patients hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of CP from the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2019. We applied a previously validated hospital frailty risk scoring system to classify CP patients into frail and non-frail on index hospitalization and compared the characteristics of frail and non-frail patients. We studied the impact of frailty on mortality, readmission, and healthcare utilization.
RESULTS: Of 56,072 patients with CP, 40.78% of patients were classified as frail. Frail patients experienced a higher rate of unplanned and preventable hospitalizations. Almost two-thirds of frail patients were younger than 65, and one-third had no or only single comorbidity. On multivariate analysis, frailty was independently associated with two times higher mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.05; 95% CI 1.7-2.5). Frailty was also associated with a higher risk of all-cause readmission with an aHR of 1.07; (95% CI 1.03-1.1). Frail patients experienced a longer length of stay, higher hospitalization costs, and hospitalization charges. Infectious causes were the most common cause of readmission among frail patients compared to acute pancreatitis among non-frail patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is independently associated with higher mortality, readmission rates, and healthcare utilization among patients with chronic pancreatitis in the US.","['Kumar V', 'Barkoudah E', 'Jin DX', 'Banks P', 'McNabb-Baltar J']",2023,68,7,Dig Dis Sci,"Kumar V, et al.

37131138,An ensemble machine learning approach to predict postoperative mortality in older patients undergoing emergency surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Prediction of preoperative frailty risk in the emergency setting is a challenging issue because preoperative evaluation cannot be done sufficiently. In a previous study, the preoperative frailty risk prediction model used only diagnostic and operation codes for emergency surgery and found poor predictive performance. This study developed a preoperative frailty prediction model using machine learning techniques that can be used in various clinical settings with improved predictive performance.
METHODS: This is a national cohort study including 22,448 patients who were older than 75 years and visited the hospital for emergency surgery from the cohort of older patients among the retrieved sample from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. The diagnostic and operation codes were one-hot encoded and entered into the predictive model using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) as a machine learning technique. The predictive performance of the model for postoperative 90-day mortality was compared with those of previous frailty evaluation tools such as Operation Frailty Risk Score (OFRS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: The predictive performance of the XGBoost, OFRS, and HFRS for postoperative 90-day mortality was 0.840, 0.607, and 0.588 on a c-statistics basis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques, XGBoost to predict postoperative 90-day mortality, using diagnostic and operation codes, the prediction performance was improved significantly over the previous risk assessment models such as OFRS and HFRS.","['Lee SW', 'Lee EH', 'Choi IC']",2023,23,1,BMC Geriatr,"Lee SW, et al.

37112856,Hantavirus Infection in Children-A Pilot Study of Single Regional Center.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses are infectious etiological agents of a group of rodent-borne hemorrhagic fevers, with two types of clinical manifestations in humans: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). According to available statistics, the disease occurs mainly in adults, but the lower incidence in the pediatric population might also be related to a lack of diagnosis possibilities or even unsatisfactory knowledge about the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome diagnosed and treated in the Department of Nephrology at St. Mary's Emergency Hospital for Children in Iasi, Romania, representative of the North-East of Romania. We also reviewed the specialized literature on the topic.
RESULTS: Between January 2017 and January 2022, eight cases of HFRS, all men, and seven from rural areas, aged 11-18 years old, were referred to our clinic because of an acute kidney injury (AKI). Seven cases were identified as Dobrava serotype while one case was determined by Haantan serotype.
CONCLUSIONS: HFRS should always be considered as a differential diagnosis when faced with a patient with AKI and thrombocytopenia. Dobrava serotype is the most common hantavirus subtype in the Balkans. For the specific prevention of human infections, mainly in high-risk groups, vaccines are needed. As far as we know, this is the first study on HFRS in Romanian children.","['Mocanu A', 'Cajvan AM', 'Lazaruc TI', 'Lupu VV', 'Florescu L', 'Lupu A', 'Bogos RA', 'Ioniuc I', 'Scurtu G', 'Dragan F', 'Starcea IM']",2023,15,4,Viruses,"Mocanu A, et al.

37108178,Differential Cytokine Responses and the Clinical Severity of Adult and Pediatric Nephropathia Epidemica.,"Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by the hantavirus infection, is endemic in Tatarstan Russia. The majority of patients are adults, with infection rarely diagnosed in children. This limited number of pediatric NE cases means there is an inadequate understanding of disease pathogenesis in this age category. Here, we have analyzed clinical and laboratory data in adults and children with NE to establish whether and how the disease severity differs between the two age groups. Serum cytokines were analyzed in samples collected from 11 children and 129 adult NE patients during an outbreak in 2019. A kidney toxicity panel was also used to analyze urine samples from these patients. Additionally, serum and urine samples were analyzed from 11 control children and 26 control adults. Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that NE was milder in children than in adults. A variation in serum cytokine activation could explain the differences in clinical presentation. Cytokines associated with activation of Th1 lymphocytes were prominent in adults, while they were obscured in sera from pediatric NE patients. In addition, a prolonged activation of kidney injury markers was found in adults with NE, whilst only a short-lasting activation of these markers was observed in children with NE. These findings support previous observations of age differences in NE severity, which should be considered when diagnosing the disease in children.","['Martynova E', 'Stott-Marshall RJ', 'Shakirova V', 'Saubanova A', 'Bulatova A', 'Davidyuk YN', 'Kabwe E', 'Markelova M', 'Khaertynova I', 'Foster TL', 'Khaiboullina S']",2023,24,8,Int J Mol Sci,"Martynova E, et al.

HFRS of Weihe Basin remains highly prevalent in recent years and attracts wide attention. With the acceleration of urbanization and related environmental changes, the interaction among anthropogenic activities, environmental factors, and host animals becomes more complicated in this area, which posed increasingly complex challenges for implementing effective prevention measures. Identifying the potential influencing factors of continuous HFRS epidemics in this typical area is critical to make targeted prevention and control strategies.
METHODS: Spatiotemporal characteristics of HFRS epidemic were analyzed based on HFRS case point data in Weihe Basin from 2005 to 2020. MaxEnt models were constructed to explore the main influencing factors of HFRS epidemic based on HFRS data, natural environment factors and socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: Results showed that the HFRS epidemics in Weihe Basin were temporally divided into three periods (the relatively stable period, the rapid rising period, and the fluctuating rising period) and were spatially featured by relatively concentrated in the plains alongside the Weihe River. Landscape played controlling effect in this area while land use, vegetation and population in the area interacted with each other and drove the change of HFRS epidemic. The potential high-risk area for HFRS epidemic was 419 km2, where the HFRS case density reached 12.48 cases/km2, especially in the northern plains of Xi'an City.
CONCLUSION: We suggested that the temporal and spatial variations in the HFRS epidemics, as well as their dominant influencing factors should be adequately considered for making and/or adjusting the targeted prevention and control strategies on this disease in Weihe Basin.","['Zhu L', 'Lu L', 'Li S', 'Ren H']",2023,17,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhu L, et al.

36998462,Development and validation of a combined hypoxia and ferroptosis prognostic signature for breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is involved in tumor biological processes and disease progression. Ferroptosis, as a newly discovered programmed cell death process, is closely related to breast cancer (BC) occurrence and development. However, reliable prognostic signatures based on a combination of hypoxia and ferroptosis in BC have not been developed.
METHOD: We set The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer cohort as training set and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) BC cohort as the validation set. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and COX regression approaches were used to construct ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) prognostic signature (HFRS). The CIBERSORT algorithm and ESTIMATE score were used to explore the relationship between HFRS and tumor immune microenvironment. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect protein expression in tissue samples. A nomogram was developed to advance the clinical application of HFRS signature.
RESULTS: Ten ferroptosis-related genes and hypoxia-related genes were screened to construct the HFRS prognostic signature in TCGA BC cohort, and the predictive capacity was verified in METABRIC BC cohort. BC patients with high-HFRS had shorter survival time, higher tumor stage, and a higher rate of positive lymph node. Moreover, high HFRS was associated with high hypoxia, ferroptosis, and immunosuppression status. A nomogram that was constructed with age, stage, and HFRS signature showed a strong prognostic capability to predict overall survival (OS) for BC patients.
CONCLUSION: We developed a novel prognostic model with hypoxia and ferroptosis-related genes to predict OS, and characterize the immune microenvironment of BC patients, which might provide new cures for clinical decision-making and individual treatment of BC patients.","['Zhong J', 'Shen X', 'Zhou J', 'Yu H', 'Wang B', 'Sun J', 'Wang J', 'Liu F']",2023,13,,Front Oncol,"Zhong J, et al.

36992513,Puumala Hantavirus Infections Show Extensive Variation in Clinical Outcome.,"The clinical outcome of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection shows extensive variation, ranging from inapparent subclinical infection (70-80%) to severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), with about 0.1% of cases being fatal. Most hospitalized patients experience acute kidney injury (AKI), histologically known as acute hemorrhagic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Why this variation? There is no evidence that there would be more virulent and less virulent variants infecting humans, although this has not been extensively studied. Individuals with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles B*08 and DRB1*0301 are likely to have a severe form of the PUUV infection, and those with B*27 are likely to have a benign clinical course. Other genetic factors, related to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene and the C4A component of the complement system, may be involved. Various autoimmune phenomena and Epstein-Barr virus infection are associated with PUUV infection, but hantavirus-neutralizing antibodies are not associated with lower disease severity in PUUV HFRS. Wide individual differences occur in ocular and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations and in the long-term consequences of nephropathia epidemica (NE). Numerous biomarkers have been detected, and some are clinically used to assess and predict the severity of PUUV infection. A new addition is the plasma glucose concentration associated with the severity of both capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, inflammation, and AKI in PUUV infection. Our question, ""Why this variation?"" remains largely unanswered.","['Vaheri A', 'Smura T', 'Vauhkonen H', 'Hepojoki J', 'Sironen T', 'Strandin T', 'Tietäväinen J', 'Outinen T', 'Mäkelä S', 'Pörsti I', 'Mustonen J']",2023,15,3,Viruses,"Vaheri A, et al.

It is not known whether frailty and complexity of medication regimens influence attitudes toward deprescribing. This study aimed to investigate (1) older inpatients' attitudes toward deprescribing; (2) if frailty and complexity of medication regimen influence attitudes and willingness to deprescribe - a relationship that has not been investigated in previous studies.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, older adults (≥ 65 years) recruited from general medicine and geriatric services in a New Zealand hospital completed the revised Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. Hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) was calculated using diagnostic codes and other relevant information present at the time of index hospital admission; higher scores indicate higher frailty risk. Medication regimen complexity was quantified using the medication regimen complexity index (MRCI); higher scores indicate greater complexity. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of attitudes and willingness to deprescribe.
RESULTS: A total of 222 patients were included in the study, the median age was 83 years and 63% were female. One in two patients reported feeling they were taking too many medications, and 1 in 5 considered their medications burdensome. Almost 3 in 4 (73%) wanted to be involved in decision-making about their medications, and 4 in 5 (84%) were willing to stop one or more of their medications if their prescriber said it was possible. Patients with higher MRCI had increased self-reported medication burden (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.6, 95% CI 1.29, 5.29) and were more interested in being involved in decision-making about their medications (AOR 1.8, CI 0.99, 3.42) than those with lower MRCI. Patients with moderate HFRS had lower odds of willingness to deprescribe (AOR 0.45, CI 0.22,0.92) compared to the low-risk group. Female patients had a lower desire to be involved in decision-making. The oldest old age group( > 80 years) had lower self-reported medication burden and were less likely to want to try stopping their medications.
CONCLUSION: Most older inpatients wanted to be involved in decision-making about their medications and were willing to stop one or more medications if proposed by their prescriber. Medication complexity and frailty status influence patients' attitudes toward deprescribing and thus should be taken into consideration when making deprescribing decisions. Further research is needed to investigate the relationship between frailty and the complexity of medication regimens.","['Mohammed MA', 'Harrison J', 'Milosavljevic A', 'Chan AHY']",2023,23,1,BMC Geriatr,"Mohammed MA, et al.

36950831,The Hospital Frailty Risk Score and outcomes in head and neck cancer surgery.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess if the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) could predict outcomes for older people undergoing head and neck procedures.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between April 2008 and February 2020, undergoing head and neck procedures defined as major resections using procedural codes.
SETTING: The analysis was performed using data from the NHS Secondary Uses Service (SUS) electronic database.
PARTICIPANTS: A number of 7479 patients were selected based on an age of 75 years and above and an admission associated with a diagnostic code associated with a head and neck cancer. Based on HFRS, 5153 patients were risk-stratified into mild, moderate, and severe frailty risk.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationships between frailty risk and length of stay, readmission rate, and mortality were quantified using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Severely frail patients had a median length of stay of 9 days compared to 3 for mildly frail patients. Twenty-seven percentage of severely frail patients were readmitted within 30 days of surgery. Rising levels of frailty correlate with a higher risk of death following surgery which is maintained in longer term mortality at 1 year and until the data were extracted in March 2022. Fifty percentage of moderately frail patients and 66% of severely frail patients had died in hospital by the end of the study period.
CONCLUSION: The results quantify the relationship between frailty and adverse health outcomes. This information could be used to identify those that might benefit from holistic assessment, aid prognostication, commissioning, and service planning.","['Imam T', 'Konstant-Hambling R', 'Flint H', 'Brooks TA', 'Patel NN', 'Conroy S']",2023,48,4,Clin Otolaryngol,"Imam T, et al.

36948450,"Risk of lymphoid malignancies increased after Puumala virus infection in Finland, 2009-2019: A retrospective register-based cohort study.","OBJECTIVES: The Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Studies showing an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies after hantavirus infection, together with the observation that PUUV infects B cells, motivated us to study the risk of lymphoid malignancies after PUUV infection.
METHODS: We linked data from the Finnish Cancer Registry and National Infectious Diseases Register for 2009-2019. We used a time-dependent Cox regression model to evaluate the hazard of the lymphoid malignancies grouped according to the HAEMACARE classification.
RESULTS: We identified 68 cases of lymphoid malignancies after PUUV infection among 16,075 PUUV-infected individuals during 61,114,826 person-years of observation. A total of 10 cases occurred within 3-<12 months and 38 within 1-<5 years after PUUV infection, and the risk of lymphoid malignancies increased with hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.7) and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2-2.3), respectively. The group of mature B cell neoplasms showed an increased risk 3-<12 months and 1-<5 years after PUUV infection, HR 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.3) and HR 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.5), respectively.
CONCLUSION: PUUV infection is associated with lymphoid malignancies in the Finnish population, supporting the earlier studies. Further research is required to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this association.","['Kääriäinen S', 'Ollgren J', 'Dub T', 'Laine O', 'Sinisalo M', 'Hepojoki J', 'Strandin T', 'Kekäläinen E', 'Sane J', 'Lyytikäinen O']",2023,131,,Int J Infect Dis,"Kääriäinen S, et al.

36947542,Health progression for Covid-19 survivors hospitalized in geriatric clinics in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse if the health progression of geriatric Covid-19 survivors three months after an acute Covid-19 infection was worse than in other geriatric patients. Specifically, we wanted to see if we could see distinct health profiles in the flow of re-admitted Covid-19 patients compared to re-admitted non-Covid-19 controls.
DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Electronic medical records of geriatric patients hospitalised in geriatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, between March 2020 and January 2022. Patients readmitted three months after initial admission were selected for the analysis and Covid-19 survivors (n = 895) were compared to age-sex-Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)-matched non-Covid-19 controls (n = 2685).
METHODS: We assessed using binary logistic and Cox regression if a previous Covid-19 infection could be a risk factor for worse health progression indicated by the CCI, hospital frailty risk score (HFRS), mortality and specific comorbidities.
RESULTS: The patients were mostly older than 75 years and, already at baseline, had typically multiple comorbidities. The Covid-19 patients with readmission had mostly had their acute-phase infection in the 1st or 2nd pandemic waves before the vaccinations. The Covid-19 patients did not have worse health after three months compared to the matched controls according to the CCI (odds ratio, OR[95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.12[0.94-1.34]), HFRS (OR[95%CI] = 1.05[0.87-1.26]), 6-months (hazard ratio, HR[95%CI] = 1.04[0.70-1.52]) and 1-year-mortality risk (HR[95%CI] = 0.89[0.71-1.10]), adjusted for age, sex and health at baseline (the CCI and HFRS).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The overall health progression of re-hospitalized geriatric Covid-19 survivors did not differ dramatically from other re-hospitalized geriatric patients with similar age, sex and health at baseline. Our results emphasize that Covid-19 was especially detrimental for geriatric patients in the acute-phase, but not in the later phase. Further studies including post-vaccination samples are needed.","['Kananen L', 'Hong X', 'Annetorp M', 'Mak JKL', 'Jylhävä J', 'Eriksdotter M', 'Hägg S', 'Religa D']",2023,18,3,PLoS One,"Kananen L, et al.

36936258,Prophylactic Steroids for Preventing Postembolization Syndrome after Transcatheter Arterial Embolization of Renal Angiomyolipoma: A Comparative Study.,"PURPOSE: Postembolization syndrome (PES) after renal arterial embolization (RAE) can reduce the patient's tolerance of the procedure and extend the length of hospital stay. We aimed to assess the efficacy of steroid administration in preventing PES in patients undergoing RAE for angiomyolipoma (AML).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between May 2004 and March 2020, 29 RAE procedures in 26 patients with AML were performed. Patient information, including age, sex, tumor size, tuberous sclerosis complex-associated/sporadic AML, hemorrhagic/nonhemorrhagic AML, embolic material, steroid use, medication type, some blood laboratory parameters, hospital stay, and PES occurrence were retrospectively obtained. The prophylactic steroid protocol used in the study was as follows: 250 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) 2 h before the RAE procedure, followed by 2 days of intravenous prednisolone (Predonine; 2 mg/kg/day), which was tapered by halving the dose every 2 days within the course of 2 weeks. After the discharge, intravenous prednisolone was changed to oral prednisolone (Predonine). PES was defined as the presence of fever, pain, nausea, or vomiting. Data were compared between the steroid and non-steroid groups and between PES and non-PES groups.
RESULTS: The PES incidence rate was 76%, and a comparison between the steroid and non-steroid groups revealed that steroid use significantly decreased the incidence of PES (P < 0.001), including fever (P < 0.001), pain (P = 0.005), and nausea (P = 0.028). The use of anti-inflammatory drugs during the hospital stay was significantly lower in the steroid group (P = 0.019). Moreover, in the steroid group, C-reactive protein level was significantly lower (P = 0.006), whereas white blood cell count was significantly higher (P = 0.004). Conversely, the median length of hospital stay was not significantly shorter in the steroid group (P = 0.292).
CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of steroids before and after embolization of renal AML may be effective in preventing PES in this small retrospective study.","['Tsuchiya S', 'Saiga A', 'Yokota H', 'Kubota Y', 'Wada T', 'Akutsu A', 'Koizumi J', 'Aramaki T', 'Uno T']",2023,8,1,Interv Radiol (Higashimatsuyama),"Tsuchiya S, et al.

36920700,Pseudotyped Viruses for Orthohantavirus.,"Orthohantaviruses, members of the Orthohantavirus genus of Hantaviridae family of the Bunyavirales order, are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded, tripartite RNA viruses. They are emerging zoonotic pathogens carried by small mammals including rodents, moles, shrews, and bats and are the etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) among humans. With the characteristics of low biological risk but strong operability, a variety of pseudotyped viruses have been constructed as alternatives to authentic orthohantaviruses to help delineate the roles of host factors in viral entry and other virus-host interactions, to assist in deciphering mechanisms of immune response and correlates of protection, to enhance our understanding of viral antigenic property, to characterize viral entry inhibitors, and to be developed as vaccines. In this chapter, we will discuss the general property of orthohantavirus, construction of pseudotyped orthohantaviruses based on different packaging systems, and their current applications.","['Ning T', 'Huang W', 'Min L', 'Yang Y', 'Liu S', 'Xu J', 'Zhang N', 'Xie SA', 'Zhu S', 'Wang Y']",2023,1407,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Ning T, et al.

This zoonotic infection is the result of exposure to the virus-contaminated aerosols. Orthohantavirus infection may cause Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HRFS), a disease that is characterized by acute kidney injury and increased vascular permeability. Several species of orthohantaviruses were identified as causing infection, where Hantaan, Puumala, and Seoul viruses are most common. Orthohantaviruses are endemic to several Asian countries, such as China, South Korea, and Japan. Along with those countries, HFRS tops the list of zoonotic infections in the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia. Recently, orthohantavirus circulation was demonstrated in small mammals in Thailand and India, where orthohantavirus was not believed to be endemic. In this review, we summarized the current data on orthohantaviruses in Asia. We gave the synopsis of the history and diversity of orthohantaviruses in Asia. We also described the clinical presentation and current understanding of the pathogenesis of orthohantavirus infection. Additionally, conventional and novel approaches for preventing and treating orthohantavirus infection are discussed.","['Sehgal A', 'Mehta S', 'Sahay K', 'Martynova E', 'Rizvanov A', 'Baranwal M', 'Chandy S', 'Khaiboullina S', 'Kabwe E', 'Davidyuk Y']",2023,15,2,Viruses,"Sehgal A, et al.

METHODS: Paired LUS and chest CT scan were prospectively performed and compared when in diagnosing five pathologies including region with alveolar-interstitial pattern (RAIP), alveolar-interstitial syndrome (AIS), lung consolidation, pleural effusion (PE), and pericardial effusion, in each patient with HFRS.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients (aged 39.9 ± 15.0 years, 35 males) were included, from which 68 paired LUS and chest CT imaging data of 816 lung regions were obtained and analyzed. Compared with chest CT, LUS showed high sensitivity (92.19-100%) and negative predictive value (95.9-100%), but relatively low specificity (39.47-97.21%) and positive predictive value (37.5-76.47%) for diagnosing the above pathologies. McNemer's test showed LUS detected more positive findings than chest CT (all p ≤ 0.002). There was a strong correlation between LUS and chest CT scores (r
CONCLUSIONS: LUS was comparable with chest CT for diagnosing peripheric pulmonary lesions and clinical assessment in patients with HFRS. Given the high sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with chest CT, LUS can be used as an excellent rule-out tool in HFRS, while its use in rule-in still requires more evidence. Considering the obvious advantages of LUS being a bedside, less expansive, and non-radiating exam, future multi-center randomized LUS versus chest CT studies may help to guide the preferred method.
KEY POINTS: • LUS could detect more positive findings than chest CT in assessing peripheric pulmonary lesions in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). • Compared with chest CT, LUS showed high sensitivity but relatively low specificity when diagnosing the peripheric pulmonary lesions caused by HFRS. • Both LUS and chest CT scores correlated with the disease severity, hospital days, and partial laboratory profiles in HFRS.","['Yang Y', 'Lian J', 'Zhao Y', 'Huo C', 'Lv S', 'Gao H', 'Wang Z']",2023,33,7,Eur Radiol,"Yang Y, et al.

36834023,Urbanization-Related Environmental Factors and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome: A Review Based on Studies Taken in China.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease that has threatened Chinese residents for nearly a century. Although comprehensive prevent and control measures were taken, the HFRS epidemic in China presents a rebounding trend in some areas. Urbanization is considered as an important influencing factor for the HFRS epidemic in recent years; however, the relevant research has not been systematically summarized. This review aims to summarize urbanization-related environmental factors and the HFRS epidemic in China and provide an overview of research perspectives. The literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol. Journal articles on the HFRS epidemic in both English and Chinese published before 30 June 2022 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Inclusion criteria were defined as studies providing information on urbanization-related environmental factors and the HFRS epidemic. A total of 38 studies were included in the review. Changes brought by urbanization on population, economic development, land use, and vaccination program were found to be significantly correlated with the HFRS epidemic. By changing the ecological niche of humans-affecting the rodent population, its virus-carrying rate, and the contact opportunity and susceptibility of populations-urbanization poses a biphasic effect on the HFRS epidemic. Future studies require systematic research framework, comprehensive data sources, and effective methods and models.","['Li S', 'Zhu L', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang G', 'Ren H', 'Lu L']",2023,20,4,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Li S, et al.

36773810,Prevalence and Influence of Frailty on Hospital Outcomes After Surgical Resection of Spinal Meningiomas.,"OBJECTIVE: Frailty has been shown to affect patient outcomes after medical and surgical interventions. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a growing metric used to assess patient frailty using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of frailty, assessed by HFRS, on health care resource utilization and outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for spinal meningiomas.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample database. Adult patients with benign or malignant spinal meningiomas, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, were stratified by HFRS: low frailty (HFRS <5) and intermediate-high frailty (HFRS ≥5). Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, comorbidities, procedural variables, adverse events, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and cost of admission were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of increased LOS, discharge disposition, and cost.
RESULTS: Of the 3345 patients, 530 (15.8%) had intermediate-high frailty. The intermediate-high cohort was significantly older (P < 0.001). More patients in the intermediate-high cohort had ≥3 comorbidities (P < 0.001). In addition, a greater proportion of patients in the intermediate-high cohort experienced ≥1 perioperative adverse events (P < 0.001). Intermediate-high patients experienced greater mean LOS (P < 0.001) and accrued greater costs (P < 0.001). A greater proportion of intermediate-high patients had nonroutine discharges (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increased HFRS (≥5) was independently associated with extended LOS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.04; P < 0.001), nonroutine discharge (aOR, 1.98; P = 0.006), and increased costs (aOR, 2.39; P = 0.004).

The aim of this paper was to systematically explore the HFRS epidemic in Jiangxi from the perspective of Hantavirus (HV) prevalence in rodents and humans and virus molecular characteristics. Individual information on all HFRS cases in Jiangxi from 2005 to 2021 was extracted from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. All S and M fragment sequences of the Seoul virus and Hantan virus strains uploaded by Jiangxi and its neighbouring provinces and some representative sequences from provinces in China or some countries of Southeast Asia with the highest HV prevalence were retrieved and downloaded from NCBI GenBank. Periodogram and spatial autocorrelation were adopted for temporal periodicity and spatial clustering analysis of the HFRS epidemic. Joinpoint regression was utilized to explore the changing morbidity trend patterns of HFRS. Multiple sequence alignment and amino acid variation analysis were used to explore the homology and variation of strain prevalence in Jiangxi. Based on monthly morbidity time series, the periodogram analysis showed that the prevalence of HFRS had periodicities of 6 months and 12 months. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that HFRS distributed in Jiangxi was not random, with a ""High-High"" clustering area around Gaoan County. HFRS morbidity among the 0 ~ 15-year-old and ~ 61-year-old or older populations in Jiangxi increased significantly during the period of 2008-2015. Generally, HFRS morbidity was significantly positively correlated with the index of rat with virus (IRV) (r = 0.742) in the counties surrounding Gaoan from 2005 to 2019. HTNV strains in Jiangxi were in one independent branch, while the SEOV strains in Jiangxi were relatively more diverse. Both the YW89-15 and GAW30/2021 strains shared approximately 85% nucleotide homology and approximately 97% amino acid homology with their corresponding standard strains and vaccine strains. GAW30/2021 and YW89-15 had some amino acid site variations in nucleoprotein, glycoprotein precursor and RNA-dependent polymerase with their corresponding vaccine strains Z10 (HTNV) and Z37 (SEOV). The HFRS epidemic in Jiangxi has obvious temporal periodicity and spatial clustering, and the significant increase in the non-Immunization Expanded Program (EPI) targeted population (children and elderly) suggests that HFRS vaccination in this population needs to be considered. Although applying the EPI played a certain role in curbing the incidence of HFRS in Jiangxi from the perspective of ecological epidemiology, HTNV and SEOV strains prevalent in Jiangxi have some amino acid site variations compared to their corresponding vaccine strains, suggesting that HV variation needs to be continuously monitored in the future to observe vaccine protective efficiency.","['Liu S', 'Zhang T']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Liu S and Zhang T.

36735847,External validation of the hospital frailty risk score among hospitalised home care clients in Canada: a retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is scored using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in administrative hospital records. Home care clients in Canada are routinely assessed with Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) which can calculate the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and the Frailty Index (FI).
OBJECTIVE: Measure the correlation between the HFRS, CFS and FI and compare prognostic utility for frailty-related outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada.
SUBJECTS: Home care clients aged 65+ admitted to hospital within 180 days (median 65 days) of a RAI-HC assessment (n = 167,316).
METHODS: Correlation between the HFRS, CFS and FI was measured using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Prognostic utility of each measure was assessed by comparing measures of association, discrimination and calibration for mortality (30 days), prolonged hospital stay (10+ days), unplanned hospital readmission (30 days) and long-term care admission (1 year).
RESULTS: The HFRS was weakly correlated with the FI (ρ 0.21) and CFS (ρ 0.28). Unlike the FI and CFS, the HFRS was unable to discriminate for 30-day mortality (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.506; confidence interval (CI) 0.502-0.511). It was the only measure that could discriminate for prolonged hospital stay (AUC 0.666; CI 0.661-0.673). The HFRS operated like the FI and CFI when predicting unplanned readmission (AUC 0.530 CI 0.526-0.536) and long-term care admission (AUC 0.600; CI 0.593-0.606).
CONCLUSIONS: The HFRS identifies a different subset of older adult home care clients as frail than the CFS and FI. It has prognostic utility for several frailty-related outcomes in this population, except short-term mortality.","['Turcotte LA', 'Heckman G', 'Rockwood K', 'Vetrano DL', 'Hébert P', 'McIsaac DI', 'Rhynold E', 'Mitchell L', 'Mowbray FI', 'Larsen RT', 'Hirdes JP']",2023,52,2,Age Ageing,"Turcotte LA, et al.

36702048,Association of Frailty Status on the Causes and Outcomes of Patients Admitted With Cardiovascular Disease.,"Data are limited about the contemporary association between frailty and the causes and outcomes of patients admitted with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Using the US National Inpatient Sample, CVD admissions of interest (acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, and hemorrhagic stroke) were stratified by Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of in-hospital mortality among different groups with frailty. The study included 9,317,398 hospitalizations. Of these, 5,573,033 (59.8%) had a low HFRS (<5); 3,422,700 (36.7%) had an intermediate HFRS (5 to 15); and 321,665 (3.5%) had a high HFRS (>15). Ischemic stroke was the most common admission for the groups with high risk (75.4%), whereas acute myocardial infarction was the most common admission for the group with low risk (36.9%). Compared with the group with low risk, patients with high risk had increased mortality across the most CVD admissions, except in patients admitted for cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic stroke (p <0.001). The strongest association with all-cause mortality was shown among patients with high risk admitted for AF (aOR 6.75, 95% CI 6.51 to 7.00, and aOR 17.69, 95% CI 16.08 to 19.45) compared with their counterparts with low risk. In conclusion, patients with CVD admissions have varying frailty risk according to cardiovascular cause of admission, with ischemic stroke being the most common among groups with frailty and high risk. Increased frailty is associated with all-cause mortality in patients with most CVD admissions, except for cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic stroke, with the strongest association seen in patients admitted with AF.","['Sokhal BS', 'Matetić A', 'Rashid M', 'Protheroe J', 'Partington R', 'Mallen C', 'Mamas MA']",2023,192,,Am J Cardiol,"Sokhal BS, et al.

36684588,Impact of frailty on early rhythm control outcomes in older adults with atrial fibrillation: A nationwide cohort study.,"PURPOSE: Rhythm-control therapy administered early following the initial diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) has superior cardiovascular outcomes compared to rate-control therapy. Frailty is a key factor in identifying older patients' potential for improvement after rhythm-control therapy. This study evaluated whether frailty affects the outcome of early rhythm-control therapy in older patients with AF.
METHODS: From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database (2005-2015), we collected 20,611 populations aged ≥65 years undergoing rhythm- or rate-control therapy initiated within 1 year of AF diagnosis. Participants were emulated by the EAST-AFNET4 trial, and stratified into non-frail, moderately frail, and highly frail groups based on the hospital frailty risk score (HFRS). A composite outcome of cardiovascular-related mortality, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, and ischemic stroke was compared between rhythm- and rate-control.
RESULTS: Early rhythm-control strategy showed a 14% lower risk of the primary composite outcome in the non-frail group [weighted incidence 7.3 vs. 8.6 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.93, 
CONCLUSION: Although the degree attenuated with increasing frailty, the superiority of cardiovascular outcomes of early rhythm-control in AF treatment was maintained without increased risk for safety outcomes. An individualized approach is required on the benefits of early rhythm-control therapy in older patients with AF, regardless of their frailty status.","['Yu GI', 'Kim D', 'Sung JH', 'Jang E', 'Yu HT', 'Kim TH', 'Pak HN', 'Lee MH', 'Lip GYH', 'Yang PS', 'Joung B']",2022,9,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Yu GI, et al.

An 18-year-old woman visited our hospital with a 2-day history of fever, dyspnoea, and leg edema. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated inflammatory reaction, increased serum creatinine levels, and normocytic anaemia. Additionally, the anti-streptolysin-O titre was positive, and complement component-3 levels were decreased. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and hematuria. Bronchoalveolar lavage aliquots were progressively more hemorrhagic. These findings supported a diagnosis of PRS secondary to streptococcal infection. The patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and antibiotics. After 4 days of treatment, her respiratory symptoms and serum creatinine levels improved. Steroid tapering was performed over 15 days. The findings in this case indicate that streptococcal infection is a potential cause of PRS, and that short-term steroid therapy is an effective treatment.","['Shimokawa J', 'Nagano H', 'Raita Y']",2023,11,2,Respirol Case Rep,"Shimokawa J, et al.

Propensity-score (PS) matching was utilized to balance the baseline characteristics between frail and non-frail groups. In-hospital mortality, unfavorable discharge, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and total hospital cost were compared using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 19,522 patients with metastatic (frailty n = 9,906; no frailty n = 9,716) and 135,200 with non-metastatic breast cancer (frailty n = 30,235; no frailty n = 104,965) were included. After adjustment, frailty was significantly and independently associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality, unfavorable discharge, prolonged LOS, and greater hospital cost in both metastatic and non-metastatic diseases, in which the impacts of frailty was greater in women with non-metastatic disease. In stratified analysis, frailty had the greatest impact on in-hospital mortality among women had had non-metastatic disease and aged <50 years (aOR = 3.88; 95% CI: 1.95-7.73).

36614878,Impact of Frailty Risk on Oral Intake and Length of Hospital Stay in Older Patients with Pneumonia: A Historical Cohort Study.,"The aim of this study was to examine the association between frailty risk and outcomes in older patients with pneumonia. For this purpose, the JMDC multi-center database was used, and a historical cohort study was conducted to examine the association between the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and oral intake prognosis and length of hospital stay in older patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Patients were classified into low-risk (HFRS < 5), intermediate-risk (HFRS = 5−15), and high-risk (HFRS > 15) groups based on their HFRS scores, and outcomes were defined as the number of days from admission to the start of oral intake and length of hospital stay. A total of 98,420 patients with pneumonia (mean age 82.2 ± 7.2) were finally included. Of these patients, 72,207 (73.4%) were in the low-risk group, 23,136 (23.5%) were in the intermediate-risk group, and 3077 (3.1%) were in the high-risk group. The intermediate- and high-risk groups had a higher number of days to the start of oral intake than the low-risk group (intermediate-risk group: coefficient 0.705, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.642−0.769; high-risk group: coefficient 0.889, 95% CI 0.740−1.038). In addition, the intermediate- and high-risk groups also had longer hospital stays than the low-risk group (intermediate-risk group: coefficient 5.743, 95% CI 5.305−6.180; high-risk group: coefficient 7.738, 95% CI 6.709−8.766). Overall, we found that HFRS is associated with delayed initiation of oral intake and prolonged hospital stay in older patients with pneumonia. Therefore, evaluation based on HFRS could be helpful in making clinical decisions regarding the selection of feeding strategies and when to discharge older patients with pneumonia.","['Hori S', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Ushida K', 'Shirai Y', 'Shimizu M', 'Kato Y', 'Shimizu A', 'Momosaki R']",2022,12,1,J Clin Med,"Hori S, et al.

36612680,Detection of the Frail Elderly at Risk of Postoperative Sepsis.,"With the increase in the elderly population, surgery in aged patients is seeing an exponential increase. In this population, sepsis is a major concern for perioperative care, especially in older and frail patients. We aim to investigate the incidence of sepsis in elderly patients receiving diverse types of surgical procedures and explore the predictive capacity of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) to identify patients at high risk of incidence of postoperative sepsis. This study relies on information from the Spanish Minimum Basic Data Set, including data from nearly 300 hospitals in Spain. We extracted records of 254,836 patients aged 76 years and older who underwent a series of surgical interventions within three consecutive years (2016-2018). The HFRS and Elixhauser comorbidity index were computed to determine the independent effect on the incidence of sepsis. Overall, the incidence of postoperative sepsis was 2645 (1.04%). The higher risk of sepsis was in major stomach, esophageal, and duodenal (7.62%), followed by major intestinal procedures (5.65%). Frail patients are at high risk of sepsis. HFRS demonstrated a high predictive capacity to identify patients with a risk of postoperative sepsis and can be a valid instrument for risk stratification and vigilant perioperative monitoring for the early identification of patients at high risk of sepsis.","['Sarría-Santamera A', 'Yessimova D', 'Viderman D', 'Polo-deSantos M', 'Glushkova N', 'Semenova Y']",2022,20,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Sarría-Santamera A, et al.

36590594,IL-15 induced bystander activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may mediate endothelium injury through NKG2D in Hantaan virus infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Hantaan virus (HTNV) can cause endothelium injury in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients. Bystander activation of CD8+ T cells by virus infection has been shown that was involved in host injury, but it is unclear during HTNV infection. This project aimed to study the effect of bystander-activated CD8+ T cell responses in HTNV infection.
METHODS: The in vitro infection model was established to imitate the injury of endothelium in HFRS patients. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the expression of markers of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The levels of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in serum and supermanant were detected using ELISA kit. The expression of MICA of HUVECs was respectively determined by flow cytometry and western blot. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells was assessed through the cytotoxicity assay and antibody blocking assay.
RESULTS: EBV or CMV-specific CD8+ T cells were bystander activated after HTNV infection in HFRS patients. HTNV-infected HUVECs in vitro could produce high levels of IL-15, which was positively correlated with disease severity and the expression of NKG2D on bystander-activated CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the elevated IL-15 could induce activation of CD122 (IL-15Rβ)+NKG2D+ EBV/CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. The expression of IL-15Rα and ligand for NKG2D were upregulated on HTNV-infected HUVECs. Bystander-activated CD8+ T cells could exert cytotoxicity effects against HTNV-infected HUVECs, which could be enhanced by IL-15 stimulation and blocked by NKG2D antibody.
DISCUSSION: IL-15 induced bystander activation of CD8+ T cells through NKG2D, which may mediate endothelium injury during HTNV infection in HFRS patients.","['Zhang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu H', 'Tang K', 'Zhang C', 'Wang M', 'Xue M', 'Jia X', 'Hu H', 'Li N', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y']",2022,12,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Zhang X, et al.

36588580,Association between frailty and short- and long-term mortality in patients with critical acute myocardial infarction: Results from MIMIC-IV.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty has been recognized as an important prognostic indicator in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, no study has focused on critical AMI patients. We aimed to determine the impact of frailty on short- and long-term mortality risk in critical AMI patients.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was used. Frailty was assessed using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the association between frailty and outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 5,003 critical AMI patients, 2,176 were non-frail (43.5%), 2,355 were pre-frail (47.1%), and 472 were frail (9.4%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 13.8%, and the 1-year mortality rate was 29.5%. In our multivariable model, frailty was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.41] and 1-year mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.24-1.35] as a continuous variable (per five-score increase). When assessed as categorical variables, pre-frailty and frailty were both associated with in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 2.19-3.59 and OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.93-3.73, respectively) and 1-year mortality (HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 2.00-2.69 and HR = 2.81, 95% CI: 2.33-3.39, respectively) after adjustment for confounders. Subgroup analysis showed that frailty was only associated with in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but not STEMI (
CONCLUSION: Frailty, as assessed by the HFRS, was associated with both in-hospital and 1-year mortality in critical AMI patients. Frailty improves the prediction of short- and long-term mortality in critical AMI patients and may have potential clinical applications.","['Bai W', 'Hao B', 'Meng W', 'Qin J', 'Xu W', 'Qin L']",2022,9,,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Bai W, et al.

36577891,Performance of administrative database frailty instruments in predicting clinical outcomes and cost for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a historical cohort study.,"PURPOSE: Frailty instruments may improve prognostic estimates for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Few studies have evaluated and compared the performance of administrative database frailty instruments for patients undergoing TAVI. This study aimed to examine the performance of administrative database frailty instruments in predicting clinical outcomes and costs in patients who underwent TAVI.
METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study of 3,848 patients aged 66 yr or older who underwent a TAVI procedure in Ontario, Canada from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2018. We used the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) frailty indicator and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) to assign frailty status. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, one-year mortality, rehospitalization, and healthcare costs. We compared the performance of the two frailty instruments with that of a reference model that adjusted baseline covariates and procedural characteristics. Accuracy measures included c-statistics, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI), bias, and accuracy of cost estimates.
RESULTS: A total of 863 patients (22.4%) were identified as frail using the Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator and 865 (22.5%) were identified as frail using the HFRS. Although agreement between the frailty instruments was fair (Kappa statistic = 0.322), each instrument classified different subgroups as frail. Both the Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator (rate ratio [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.20) and the HFRS (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.21) were significantly associated with increased one-year costs. Compared with the reference model, both the Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator and HFRS significantly improved NRI for one-year mortality (Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator: NRI, 0.160; P < 0.001; HFRS: NRI, 0.146; P = 0.001) and rehospitalization (Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator: NRI, 0.201; P < 0.001; HFRS: NRI, 0.141; P = 0.001). These improvements in NRI largely resulted from classification improvement among those who did not experience the event. With one-year mortality, there was a significant improvement in IDI (IDI, 0.003; P < 0.001) with the Johns Hopkins ACG frailty indicator. This improvement in performance resulted from an increase in the mean probability of the event among those with the event.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty assessment may add some predictive value for TAVI outcomes.

36573519,"Role of Seaports and Imported Rats in Seoul Hantavirus Circulation, Africa.","Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) is not considered a major public health threat on the continent of Africa. However, Africa is exposed to rodentborne SEOV introduction events through maritime traffic after exponential growth of trade with the rest of the world. Serologic studies have already detected hantavirus antibodies in human populations, and recent investigations have confirmed circulation of hantavirus, including SEOV, in rat populations. Thus, SEOV is a possible emerging zoonotic risk in Africa. Moreover, the range of SEOV could rapidly expand, and transmission to humans could increase because of host switching from the usual brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) species, which is currently invading Africa, to the more widely installed black rat (R. rattus) species. Because of rapid economic development, environmental and climatic changes, and increased international trade, strengthened surveillance is urgently needed to prevent SEOV dissemination among humans in Africa.","['Castel G', 'Filippone C', 'Tatard C', 'Vigan J', 'Dobigny G']",2023,29,1,Emerg Infect Dis,"Castel G, et al.

36562294,"The presence of intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal and pleural fluid in acute Puumala hantavirus infection.","BACKGROUND: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes most cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. PUUV infection is characterised by acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia and increased capillary leakage. Typical symptoms are fever, headache, nausea, abdominal and back pain. This study aimed to evaluate the amount and distribution of intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal and pleural fluid and the association of fluid collections to the symptoms and clinical findings in patients with acute PUUV infection.
METHODS: Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 27 hospitalised patients with acute PUUV infection. The clinical and laboratory findings and patients' symptoms were analysed in relation to the imaging findings. The thickness of the fluid collections was measured in millimetres (mm) from axial images.
RESULTS: Fluid collections were found in all patients. The amount of intraperitoneal fluid correlated positively with plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level (
CONCLUSIONS: Fluid collections were found in all patients. A greater amount of intraperitoneal fluid associates with higher CRP concentrations but not with higher serum creatinine levels. Back pain associates with higher creatinine level but not with the presence of fluids.","['Tervo L', 'Outinen T', 'Kiekara T', 'Tietäväinen J', 'Paakkala A', 'Pörsti I', 'Huhtala H', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J']",2023,55,3,Infect Dis (Lond),"Tervo L, et al.

36530151,Comparative performance of distinct frailty measures among patients undergoing percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.,"AIMS: Frailty is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC). This study aimed to compare the performance of two claims-based frailty measures in predicting adverse outcomes following LAAC.
METHODS: We identified patients 66 years and older who underwent LAAC between October 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019, in Medicare fee-for-service claims. Frailty was assessed using the previously validated Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and Kim Claims-based Frailty Index (CFI). Patients were identified as frail based on HFRS ≥5 and CFI ≥0.25.
RESULTS: Of the 21,787 patients who underwent LAAC, frailty was identified in 45.6% by HFRS and 15.4% by CFI. There was modest agreement between the two frailty measures (kappa 0.25, Pearson's correlation 0.62). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, frailty was associated with higher risk of 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, 30-day readmission, long hospital stay, and reduced days at home (p < .01 for all) regardless of the frailty measure used. The addition of frailty to standard comorbidities significantly improved model performance to predict 1-year mortality, long hospital stay, and reduced days at home (Delong p-value < .001).
CONCLUSION: Despite significant variation in frailty detection and modest agreement between the two frailty measures, frailty status remained highly predictive of mortality, readmissions, long hospital stay, and reduced days at home among patients undergoing LAAC. Measuring frailty in clinical practice, regardless of the method used, may provide prognostic information useful for patients being considered for LAAC, and may inform shared decision-making in this population.","['Wang A', 'Ferro EG', 'Xu J', 'Song Y', 'Sun T', 'Strom JB', 'Kim DH', 'Yeh RW', 'Ko D', 'Kramer DB']",2023,46,3,Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,"Wang A, et al.

36511440,Comparison of a multidomain frailty index from routine health data with the hospital frailty risk score in older patients in an Australian hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is an important determinant of health-care needs and outcomes for people in hospital.
OBJECTIVES: To compare characteristics and predictive ability of a multidomain frailty index derived from routine health data (electronic frailty index-acute hospital; eFI-AH) with the hospital frailty risk score (HFRS).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 6771 patients aged ≥75 years admitted to an Australian metropolitan tertiary referral hospital between October 2019 and September 2020. The eFI-AH and the HFRS were calculated for each patient and compared with respect to characteristics, agreement, association with age and ability to predict outcomes.
RESULTS: Median eFI-AH was 0.17 (range 0-0.66) whilst median HFRS was 3.2 (range 0-42.9). Moderate agreement was shown between the tools (Pearson's r 0.61). After adjusting for age and gender, both models had associations with long hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, unplanned all-cause readmission and fall-related readmission. Specifically, the eFI-AH had the strongest association with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.81, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.49-3.17), whilst the HFRS was most strongly associated with long hospital stay (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18-1.21). Both tools predicted hospital stay >10 days with good discrimination and calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the eFI-AH and the HFRS did not consistently identify the same inpatients as frail, both were associated with adverse outcomes and they had comparable predictive ability for prolonged hospitalisation. These two constructs of frailty may have different implications for clinical practice and health service provision and planning.","['Fujita K', 'Lo SY', 'Hubbard RE', 'Gnjidic D', 'Hilmer SN']",2022,,,Australas J Ageing,"Fujita K, et al.

Here we describe the prevalence of frailty among hospitalized older adults in New Brunswick (NB), Canada.
METHODS: NB administrative hospital claims data were used to identify hospitalized older adults aged 65 or older between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2019. Frailty was quantified using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), a validated frailty tool derived from claims data.

36480318,HTNV infection induces activation and deficiency of CD8+MAIT cells in HFRS patients.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection causes an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) mainly in Asia. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T lymphocytes known to play an important role in innate host defense during virus infection. However, their roles and phenotypes during HTNV infection have not yet been explored. We characterized CD8+MAIT cells from HFRS patients based on scRNA-seq data combined with flow cytometry data. We showed that HTNV infection caused the loss and activation of CD8+MAIT cells in the peripheral blood, which were correlated with disease severity. The production of granzyme B and IFN-γ from CD8+MAIT cells and the limitation of HTNV replication in endothelia cells indicated the anti-viral property of CD8+MAIT cells. In addition, in vitro infection of MAIT cells by HTNV or HTNV-exposed monocytes showed that the activation of MAIT cells was IL-18 mediated. In conclusion, this study identified, for the first time, gene expression profiles of MAIT cells, provided underlying molecular mechanisms for activation of MAIT cells during HTNV infection, and suggested a potential anti-viral role of MAIT cells in HFRS.","['Zhang Y', 'Wang M', 'Zhang X', 'Tang K', 'Zhang C', 'Jia X', 'Hu H', 'Liu H', 'Li N', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang Y']",2023,211,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Zhang Y, et al.

36471522,Halogenated flame retardant exposure pathways in urban-adapted gulls: Are atmospheric routes underestimated?,"Urban-adapted gulls can be exposed to flame retardants while foraging in landfills where elevated concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) have frequently been measured in air. However, the contribution of atmospheric exposure has largely been overlooked compared to dietary exposure in birds and other wildlife. The overall objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of atmospheric exposure pathways relative to diet for PBDEs and other HFRs in ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) nesting in the densely populated Montreal area (QC, Canada). Miniature passive air samplers (PASs) were deployed on the back of wild-caught ring-billed gulls for ten days. Concentrations of PBDEs and other HFRs were determined in PASs carried by ring-billed gulls as well as their lungs, stomach content, liver, preen oil, and onto the surface of their feathers. We evaluated the atmospheric and dietary exposure routes for the most abundant HFRs in samples using a structural equation model implemented in a Bayesian framework. Results indicated that lung concentrations of BDE-28 increased with its levels in air determined using bird-borne PASs. No association was found between BDE-28 concentrations in lungs and liver, whereas BDE-209 concentrations in liver increased with those in lungs. Moreover, BDE-28 and -47 concentrations in liver increased with those on feather surface, while liver BDE-47 concentrations were also positively related with those in stomach content. These findings suggested that, in addition to dietary exposure, atmospheric exposure pathways through inhalation and co-ingestion during feather maintenance (preening) significantly contribute to the accumulation of PBDEs in liver of ring-billed gulls. Atmospheric exposure to HFRs should therefore be considered in future landfill-foraging wildlife species as a potential exposure route compared to the traditional dietary exposure pathway.","['Kerric A', 'Mazerolle MJ', 'Giroux JF', 'Verreault J']",2023,860,,Sci Total Environ,"Kerric A, et al.

36461843,"Microsurgical clipping and endovascular management of unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms: how age, frailty, and comorbidity indexes influence outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: Frailty is one of the important factors in predicting the outcomes of surgery. Many surgical specialties have adopted a frailty assessment in the preoperative period for prognostication; however, there are limited data on the effects of frailty on the outcomes of cerebral aneurysms. The object of this study was to find the effect of frailty on the surgical outcomes of anterior circulation unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and compare the frailty index with other comorbidity indexes.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2016-2018). The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) was used to assess frailty. On the basis of the HFRS, the whole cohort was divided into low-risk (0-5), intermediate-risk (> 5 to 15), and high-risk (> 15) frailty groups. The analyzed outcomes were nonhome discharge, complication rate, extended length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 37,685 patients were included in the analysis, 5820 of whom had undergone open surgical clipping and 31,865 of whom had undergone endovascular management. Mean age was higher in the high-risk frailty group than in the low-risk group for both clipping (63 vs 55.4 years) and coiling (64.6 vs 57.9 years). The complication rate for open surgical clipping in the high-risk frailty group was 56.1% compared to 0.8% in the low-risk group. Similarly, for endovascular management, the complication rate was 60.6% in the high-risk group compared to 0.3% in the low-risk group. Nonhome discharges were more common in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group for both open clipping (87.8% vs 19.7%) and endovascular management (73.1% vs 4.4%). Mean hospital charges for clipping were $341,379 in the high-risk group compared to $116,892 in the low-risk group. Mean hospital charges for coiling were $392,861 in the high-risk frailty group and $125,336 in the low-risk group. Extended length of stay occurred more frequently in the high-risk frailty group than in the low-risk group for both clipping (82.9% vs 10.7%) and coiling (94.2% vs 12.7%). Frailty had higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values than those for other comorbidity indexes and age in predicting outcomes.

There is currently no early warning model for patients with severe HFRS. Data from 235 patients with HFRS between January 2013 and December 2019, as well as 394 laboratory indicators, were retrospectively collected. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to construct an early warning model for severe diseases. The model's accuracy was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under the curve of the early warning models for both exceeded 0.9 for the two stages. In the febrile stage, there were significant differences between the severe and mild groups (P < 0.05) in renal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary leukocytes, electrolytes, urine conductivity, and urinary epithelial cell count. In the nonfebrile stage, there were significant differences between the severe and mild groups (P < 0.05) in renal eGFR, electrolytes, urine conductivity, and renal cystatin C levels. The two early warning models were well-fitted and exhibited excellent predictive performance. This can help clinicians gain time to provide appropriate preemptive treatment to avoid the further development of severe disease and reduce the mortality rate.","['Chen H', 'Huang J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang W', 'Zhao Y', 'Lu Z', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen T']",2023,76,2,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Chen H, et al.

36443254,"Spatial Heterogeneity and Influencing Factors of HFRS Epidemics in Rural and Urban Areas: A Study in Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi Province, China.","OBJECTIVE: The Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi Province is a severely afflicted hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) epidemic area, while HFRS prevalence has decreased in most epidemic areas in China. Little information is available regarding the leading fine-scale influencing factors in this highly HFRS-concentrated area and the roles of natural environmental and socioeconomic factors. To investigate this, two regions in the Guanzhong Plain, that is, the Chang'an District and Hu County, with similar geographical environments, different levels of economic development, and high epidemic prevalence, were chosen as representative areas of the HFRS epidemic.
METHODS: Maximum entropy models were constructed based on HFRS cases and fine-scale influencing factors, including meteorological, natural environmental, and socioeconomic factors, from 2014 to 2016.
RESULTS: More than 95% of the HFRS cases in the study area were located in the northern plains, which has an altitude of less than 800 m, with topography contributed 84.1% of the impact on the spatial differentiation of the HFRS epidemic. In the northern plains, precipitation and population density jointly affected the spatial differentiation of the HFRS epidemic, with contribution rates of 60.7% and 28.0%, respectively. By comparing the influencing factors of the northern plains of Chang'an District and Hu County, we found that precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dominated the HFRS epidemic in the relatively developed Chang'an District, while land-use type, temperature, precipitation and population density dominated the HFRS epidemic in the relatively undeveloped Hu County.
CONCLUSION: Topography was the primary key factor for HFRS prevalence in the Chang'an District and Hu County, and the spatial differentiation of HFRS was dominated by precipitation and population density in the northern plains. Compared with the influencing factors of the relatively developed Chang'an District, the developing Hu County was more affected by socioeconomic factors. When formulating targeted HFRS epidemic prevention and control strategies in the targeted areas, it is crucial to consider the local economic development state and combine natural environmental factors, including the meteorological environment and vegetation coverage.","['Zhu LL', 'Li YP', 'Lu L', 'Li SJ', 'Ren HY']",2022,35,11,Biomed Environ Sci,"Zhu LL, et al.

36427712,Dual seasonal pattern for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and its potential determinants in China.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) continued to affect human health across Eurasia, which complicated by climate change has posed a challenge for the disease prevention measures. Nation-wide surveillance data of HFRS cases were collected during 2008-2020.The seasonality and epidemiological features were presented by combining the HFRS incidence and the endemic types data. Factors potentially involved in affecting incidence and shaping disease seasonality were investigated by generalized additive mixed model, distributed lag nonlinear model and multivariate meta-analysis. A total of 76 cities that reported totally 111,054 cases were analyzed. Three endemic types were determined, among them the Type I cities (Hantaan virus-dominant) were related to higher incidence level, showing one spike every year in Autumn-Winter season; Type II (Seoul virus-dominant) cities were related to lower incidence, showing one spike in Spring, while Type III (Hantaan/Seoul-mixed type) showed dual peaks with incidence lying between. Persistently heavy rainfall had significantly negative influence on HFRS incidence in Hantaan virus-dominant endemic area, while a significantly opposite effect was identified when continuously heavy rainfall induced floods, where temperature and relative humidity affected HFRS incidence via an approximately parabolic or linear manner, however few or no such effects was shown in Seoul virus-dominant endemic areas, which was more vulnerable to temperature variation. Dual seasonal pattern of HFRS was depended on the dominant genotypes of hantavirus, and impact of climate on HFRS was greater in Hantaan virus-dominant endemic areas, than in Seoul virus-dominant areas.","['Lv CL', 'Tian Y', 'Qiu Y', 'Xu Q', 'Chen JJ', 'Jiang BG', 'Li ZJ', 'Wang LP', 'Hay SI', 'Liu W', 'Fang LQ']",2023,859,Pt 2,Sci Total Environ,"Lv CL, et al.

36414682,"Meteorological change and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemic in China, 2004-2018.","Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by hantavirus, is a serious public health problem in China. Despite intensive countermeasures including Patriotic Health Campaign, rodent control and vaccination in affected areas, HFRS is still a potential public health threat in China, with more than 10,000 new cases per year. Previous epidemiological evidence suggested that meteorological factors could influence HFRS incidence, but the studies were mainly limited to a specific city or region in China. This study aims to evaluate the association between monthly HFRS cases and meteorological change at the country level using a multivariate distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) from 2004 to 2018. The results from both univariate and multivariate models showed a non-linear cumulative relative risk relationship between meteorological factors (with a lag of 0-6 months) such as mean temperature (Tmean), precipitation, relative humidity (RH), sunshine hour (SH), wind speed (WS) and HFRS incidence. The risk for HFRS cases increased steeply as the Tmean between - 23 and 14.79 °C, SH between 179.4 and 278.4 h and RH remaining above 69% with 50-95 mm precipitation and 1.70-2.00 m/s WS. In conclusion, meteorological factors such as Tmean and RH showed delayed-effects on the increased risk of HFRS in the study and the lag varies across climate factors. Temperature with a lag of 6 months (RR = 3.05) and precipitation with a lag of 0 months (RR = 2.08) had the greatest impact on the incidence of HFRS.","['Luo Y', 'Lv H', 'Yan H', 'Zhu C', 'Ai L', 'Li W', 'Yi J', 'Zhang L', 'Tan W']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Luo Y, et al.

36412616,Higher Hospital Frailty Risk Score Is an Independent Predictor of In-Hospital Mortality in Hospitalized Older Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,"Background: Frailty predisposes individuals to stressors, increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Therefore, this study examined the impact of frailty defined by the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and other characteristics in older hospitalized patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using the National Inpatient Sample 2016 in patients ≥65 years old with OSA. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of frailty on inpatient mortality. A Kaplan-Meier curve with a log-rank test was used to estimate survival time between frailty groups. Results: 182,174 discharge records of elderly OSA were included in the study. 54% of the cohort were determined to be a medium/high frailty risk, according to HFRS. In multivariable analysis, frailty was associated with a fourfold (medium frailty, adjusted odd ratio (aOR): 4.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.76−4.53, p-value < 0.001) and sixfold (high frailty, OR: 6.38, 95% CI: 5.60−7.27, p-value < 0.001) increased odds of mortality. Hospital survival time was significantly different between the three frailty groups (Log-rank test, p < 0.0001). Comorbidity burden defined by Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI) was associated with increased mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusion: More than half of the whole cohort was determined to be at medium and high frailty risk. Frailty was a significant predictor of in-hospital deaths in hospitalized OSA patients.

36380817,Exosomal miRNA-155 and miRNA-146a are promising prognostic biomarkers of the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by Orthohantaviruses, occupies one of the leading places among natural focal human diseases, for which there are no modern accurate and highly sensitive diagnostic methods. To improve this situation, a better understanding of the Hantavirus pathogenesis of HFRS is required. Determination of the expression level of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the serum/plasma of patients makes them potential biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting HFRS. The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression level of miRNA-146a, miRNA-126, miRNA-218, miRNA-410, miRNA-503 and miRNA-155 in patients with HFRS at different stages (fever stage, polyuric stage and convalescence stage) and with different severity of the course this disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The moderate group of patients with HFRS included 105 patients, the severe group included 99 patients, and the severe group with complications included 84 patients. Blood samples from patients with HFRS for molecular genetic analysis were collected three times: during the initial febrile period (days 1-4 of illness), the polyuric period (days 15-22 of the disease), and during convalescence. Total RNA isolation was performed using the exoRNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the miRCURY LNA SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and the LightCycler96 real-time PCR product detection system (Roche, Switzerland).
RESULTS: When comparing the expression level of exosomal miRNAs in groups of patients with different severity of the disease, a statistically significant increase in the expression level of miRNA-146a was revealed in patients with severe HFRS with complications (Fold change 2.694; p = 0.0022) compared to the group with a moderate disease form, as well as an increase in miRNA-155 expression in patients with severe and severe HFRS with complications compared to the moderate form (Fold change 1.861; p = 0.0492; Fold change 1.976; p = 0.001, respectively). Comparative analysis of the expression level of other miRNAs in patients with HFRS at various stages and with different severity of HFRS did not reveal any statistically significant results (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-155 and miRNA-146a may be promising prognostic biomarkers in HFRS. However, further investigations are needed to evaluate the changes in the expression of miRNAs and the network of genes that can be potential targets for the studied miRNAs in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that can influence the occurrence and development of HFRS.","['Gilyazova I', 'Ivanova E', 'Pavlov V', 'Khasanova G', 'Khasanova A', 'Izmailov A', 'Asadullina D', 'Gilyazova G', 'Wang G', 'Gareev I', 'Beylerli O', 'Khusnutdinova E']",2023,8,1,Noncoding RNA Res,"Gilyazova I, et al.

36371012,Hantaan virus-induced elevation of plasma osteoprotegerin and its clinical implications in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"OBJECTIVES: The bleeding tendency is a hallmark of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) after Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection. Growing reports indicate the importance of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in vascular homeostasis, implying OPG might be involved in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in patients with HFRS.
METHODS: Acute and convalescence plasmas of 32 patients with HFRS were collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to detect plasma OPG levels and other parameters. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with HTNV and/or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to explore the source of OPG.
RESULTS: Plasma OPG levels of patients with HFRS were elevated and correlated positively with the severity of HFRS and negatively with platelet counts. Abundant OPG was released from endothelial cells in response to TNF-α stimuli, along with HTNV infection, which was in accordance with the findings of positive correlations between plasma OPG and TNF-α or c-reactive protein. Importantly, plasma OPG levels correlated positively with activated partial thromboplastin time and the content of d-dimer.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that increased plasma OPG levels induced by HTNV might be an important factor for the severity of HFRS, and was likely involved in endothelium dysfunction and hemorrhagic disorder of HFRS, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of hemorrhage in HFRS.","['Tang K', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Hu H', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y']",2023,126,,Int J Infect Dis,"Tang K, et al.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the impact of frailty on outcomes in patients with AP.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Appended data was obtained from the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
PARTICIPANTS: 574,895 adult patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of AP.
MEASUREMENTS: We performed a nationwide cohort study utilizing International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes to identify adult patients with AP. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) was used to classify patients as frail or non-frail. The primary outcome was complications related to AP including all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay and total hospitalization costs. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between frailty and complications.
RESULTS: 574,895 patients were represented; 24.7% (141,999) characterized as frail and 75.3% (432,896) as non-frail. 26.7% of frail patients suffered composite complications related to AP versus 13.3% of non-frail patients (P < 0.001). Frail patients had more cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and infectious adverse events compared to non-frail patients. Frail patients also had higher mortality rates (2.0% vs 0.1% P < 0.001), increased length of stay (6.5 days vs 3.6, P < 0.001) and total hospitalization charges ($60,136 vs $31,095, P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, positive frailty status was associated with 2.33 times increased odds of having composite complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments can be utilized as an adjunct to validated scoring systems to improve risk stratification and clinical management of patients with AP.","['Acosta CJ', 'Barkin JA', 'Amin S']",2022,11,4,J Frailty Aging,"Acosta CJ, et al.

36333699,Application of logistic differential equation models for early warning of infectious diseases in Jilin Province.,"BACKGROUND: There is still a relatively serious disease burden of infectious diseases and the warning time for different infectious diseases before implementation of interventions is important. The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year.
METHODS: Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively.
RESULTS: Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model.

A total of 1 665 431 cases of HFRS were reported with an average annual incidence of 54.22 cases/100 000 individuals during 1950-2018. The joint regression model was used to define the global trend of the HFRS cases with an increasing-decreasing-slightly increasing-decreasing-slightly increasing trend during the 68 years. Then spatial correlation analysis and wavelet cluster analysis were used to identify four types of clusters of HFRS cases located in central and northeastern China. Lastly, the prophet model outperforms auto-regressive integrated moving average model in the HFRS modeling. Our findings will help reduce the knowledge gap on the transmission dynamics and distribution patterns of the HFRS in mainland China and facilitate to take effective preventive and control measures for the high-risk epidemic area.","['He J', 'Wang Y', 'Wei X', 'Sun H', 'Xu Y', 'Yin W', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang W']",2023,95,1,J Med Virol,"He J, et al.

In this study, KHF4 and KHF5 were compared to evaluate pathological differences in mice in vitro and in vivo. The characteristics of the two glycoproteins were not significantly different in vitro. However, the virulent KHF5 strain targeted the lungs and caused pneumonia and edema in vivo. Both strains induced high infectivity levels in the liver and caused hepatitis; however, petechial hemorrhage and glycogen storage reduction were observed in KHF5-infected mice alone. Renal hemorrhage was observed using viral antigens in the tubular region of KHF5-infected mice. In addition, an increase in white blood cell levels and neutrophilia were found in KHF5-infected mice. Microarray analysis of liver cells showed that CD8+ T cell activation, acute-phase protein production, and neutrophil activation was induced by KHF5 infection. KHF5 infectivity was significantly increased in vivo and the histological and clinicopathological findings were similar to those in patients with HFRS.","['Wei Z', 'Shimizu K', 'Sarii RS', 'Muthusinghe DS', 'Lokupathirage SMW', 'Nio-Kobayashi J', 'Yoshimatsu K']",2022,14,10,Viruses,"Wei Z, et al.

In this study, we characterized DP T cells from HFRS patients based on flow cytometry data combined with scRNA-seq data. We showed that HTNV infection caused the upregulation of DP T cells in the peripheral blood, which were correlated with disease stage. The scRNA-seq data clustered DP T cells, unraveled their gene expression profile, and estimated the ordering of these cells.

36284266,A comparison between the clinical frailty scale and the hospital frailty risk score to risk stratify older people with emergency care needs.,"BACKGROUND: Older adults living with frailty who require treatment in hospitals are increasingly seen in the Emergency Departments (EDs). One quick and simple frailty assessment tool-the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)-has been embedded in many EDs in the United Kingdom (UK). However, it carries time/training and cost burden and has significant missing data. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) can be automated and has the potential to reduce costs and increase data availability, but has not been tested for predictive accuracy in the ED. The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between and the ability of the CFS at the ED and HFRS to predict hospital-related outcomes.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using data from Leicester Royal Infirmary hospital during the period from 01/10/2017 to 30/09/2019. We included individuals aged + 75 years as the HFRS has been only validated for this population. We assessed the correlation between the CFS and HFRS using Pearson's correlation coefficient for the continuous scores and weighted kappa scores for the categorised scores. We developed logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted) to estimate Odds Ratios (ORs) and Confidence Intervals (CIs), so we can assess the ability of the CFS and HFRS to predict 30-day mortality, Length of Stay (LOS) > 10 days, and 30-day readmission.
RESULTS: Twelve thousand two hundred thirty seven individuals met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 84.6 years (SD 5.9) and 7,074 (57.8%) were females. Between the CFS and HFRS, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.36 and weighted kappa score was 0.15. When comparing the highest frailty categories to the lowest frailty category within each frailty score, the ORs for 30-day mortality, LOS > 10 days, and 30-day readmission using the CFS were 2.26, 1.36, and 1.64 and for the HFRS 2.16, 7.68, and 1.19.
CONCLUSION: The CFS collected at the ED and the HFRS had low/slight agreement. Both frailty scores were shown to be predictors of adverse outcomes. More research is needed to assess the use of historic HFRS in the ED.","['Alshibani A', 'Coats T', 'Maynou L', 'Lecky F', 'Banerjee J', 'Conroy S']",2022,22,1,BMC Emerg Med,"Alshibani A, et al.

36275790,"Factors associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome based maximum entropy model in Zhejiang Province, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a serious public health problem in China. The geographic distribution has went throughout China, among which Zhejiang Province is an important epidemic area. Since 1963, more than 110,000 cases have been reported.
METHODS: We collected the meteorological factors and socioeconomic indicators of Zhejiang Province, and constructed the HFRS ecological niche model of Zhejiang Province based on the algorithm of maximum entropy.
RESULTS: Model AUC from 2009 to 2018, is 0.806-0.901. The high incidence of epidemics in Zhejiang Province is mainly concentrated in the eastern, western and central regions of Zhejiang Province. The contribution of digital elevation model ranged from 2009 to 2018 from 4.22 to 26.0%. The contribution of average temperature ranges from 6.26 to 19.65%, Gross Domestic Product contribution from 7.53 to 21.25%, and average land surface temperature contribution with the highest being 16.73% in 2011. In addition, the average contribution of DMSP/OLS, 20-8 precipitation and 8-20 precipitation were all in the range of 9%. All-day precipitation increases with the increase of rainfall, and the effect curve peaks at 1,250 mm, then decreases rapidly, and a small peak appears again at 1,500 mm. Average temperature response curve shows an inverted v-shape, where the incidence peaks at 17.8

36275660,Comprehensive computational analysis reveals YXXΦ[I/L/M/F/V] motif and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides across HFRS causing Hantaviruses and their association with viral pathogenesis and host immune regulation.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute zoonotic disease transmitted through aerosolized excrement of rodents. The etiology of HFRS is complex due to the involvement of viral factors and host immune and genetic factors. The viral species that dominantly cause HFRS are Puumala virus (PUUV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), and Hantaan virus (HTNV). Despite continuous prevention and control measures, HFRS remains a significant public health problem worldwide. The nucleocapsid protein of PUUV, SEOV, DOBV, and HTNV is a multifunctional viral protein involved in various stages of the viral replication cycle. However, the exact role of nucleoproteins in viral pathogenesis is yet to be discovered. Targeting a universal host protein exploited by most viruses would be a game-changing strategy that offers broad-spectrum solutions and rapid epidemic control. The objective of this study is to understand the replication and pathogenesis of PUUV, SEOV, DOBV, and HTNV by targeting tyrosine-based motif (YXXΦ[I/L/M/F/V]) and YXXΦ-like tetrapeptides. In the light of the current study, ","['Noor F', 'Ashfaq UA', 'Asif M', 'Adeel MM', 'Alshammari A', 'Alharbi M']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Noor F, et al.

36272632,Developmental toxicity assessments for TBBPA and its commonly used analogs with a human embryonic stem cell liver differentiation model.,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is widely used in industrial production as a halogenated flame retardant (HFR). Its substitutes and derivatives are also commonly employed as HFRs. Consequently, they can be frequently detected in environmental and human samples. The potential developmental toxicity of TBBPA and its analogs, particularly to the human liver, is still controversial or not thoroughly assessed. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the early stages of human liver development to explore the toxic effects of those HFRs, by using a human embryonic stem cell liver differentiation model. We concluded that nanomolar treatments (1, 10, and 100 nM) of those pollutants may not exert significant interference to liver development and functions. However, at 5 μM doses, TBBPA and its analogs severely affected liver functions, such as glycogen storage, and caused lipid accumulation. Furthermore, TBBPA-bis(allyl ether) showed the most drastic effects among the six compounds tested. Taken together, our findings support the view that TBBPA can be used safely, provided its amounts are strictly controlled. Nonetheless, TBBPA alternatives or derivatives may exhibit stronger adverse effects than TBBPA itself, and may not be safer choices for manufacturing applications when utilized in a large and unrestricted way.","['Li S', 'Yang R', 'Yin N', 'Zhao M', 'Zhang S', 'Faiola F']",2023,310,,Chemosphere,"Li S, et al.

She denied a history of prior strokes, recent illness, or fever. The vital signs on arrival as follows: blood pressure 151/71 mmHg, temperature of 98.4F, pulse of 77 beats/min, and respirations of 16 breaths/min. Upon examination, she appeared in mild distress with a left sided facial droop, right sided hemiparesis, and expressive aphasia, only answering to yes/no. Neurological examination revealed: expressive aphasia, intact sensation throughout the face and bilateral extremities, no effort in the right arm against gravity, some effort against gravity of the right leg, left arm and left leg had muscle strength of 5/5. Patient had an NIH stroke scale of 8. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable. Radiographic imaging with CT revealed no intracranial hemorrhage (Fig. 1) and the patient was given alteplase (tPA) injection 5.6 mg within 1 h of her arrival to the Emergency Department. After administration of tPA a CT perfusion scan was performed (Fig. 2). Imaging demonstrated decreased cerebral blood flow and prolonged mean transit time within the majority of the left middle cerebral artery territory, sparing the basal ganglia. This indicated a left middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion. Neurosurgery was consulted and the patient underwent thrombectomy. Her hospital course was complicated by hemorrhagic transformation (HT) on hospital day 2. The patient underwent MRI that showed a large left MCA distribution acute infarction with focal reperfusion hemorrhage and parenchymal hematoma measuring approximately 3 cm in each dimension (Fig. 3). This finding prompted emergent decompression and hemicraniectomy on day 2 of hospitalization. The patient was discharged on hospital day 17 to a rehab center.","['Taube S', 'Bennett J']",2023,63,,Am J Emerg Med,Taube S and Bennett J.

36261239,The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) applied to primary data: protocol for a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is characterised by vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and increases with age. Many frailty risk scores have been developed. One important example is the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) which has the potential to be widely used and automatically calculated which will provide accurate assessment of frailty in a time/cost-effective manner. This systematic review, therefore, seeks to describe the HFRS use since its publication in 2018.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We will include published original peer-reviewed articles, preprints, conference proceedings and letters to the editor reporting primary data where there is an English language abstract available from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2022. Databases to be searched are MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. Additional studies from, for example, the reference of the included studies will be identified and assessed for potential inclusion. Two independent reviewers will perform and assess the following: (1) eligibility of the included studies, (2) critical appraisal using the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool, and (3) data extraction using a predefined form. Disagreements will be resolved through discussions or by involvement of a third reviewer. It may be possible to undertake a meta-analysis if there are sufficient studies reporting effect measures in homogenous populations and/or settings. Effect sizes will be calculated using meta-analysis methods and expressed as risk ratios or ORs with 95% CIs.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required for this systematic review as it will use secondary data only. The results of the systematic review will be submitted for publication in recognised peer-reviewed journals related to frailty and geriatric care and will be widely disseminated through conferences, congresses, seminars, symposia and scientific meetings.","['Alshibani A', 'Warner B', 'Owen RK', 'Mukherjee A', 'Gilbert T', 'Conroy S']",2022,12,10,BMJ Open,"Alshibani A, et al.

Generally, infections are due to a single pathogen, but due to the shared risk factors for transmission, co-infections are not uncommon. The severity and outcome of infections are adversely affected by co-infection. Co-infections present as diagnostic and therapeutic enigmas because of the complex interaction between different pathogens involved and distorted host responses. The southeast Asian region, particularly Pakistan, is known for unique combinations of different infections. We present a distinctive case of triple co-infection of dengue virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. The index case was a 60-year-old gentleman who presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath, bruises, and hemoptysis. He had thrombocytopenia, deranged liver and renal function, coagulopathy, and infiltrates in both lung fields. Subsequent investigations revealed a positive polymerase chain reaction for ribonucleic acid of dengue virus, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. He received supportive treatment including antibiotics, blood products, ribavirin, and supplemental oxygen. He developed multi-organ failure and succumbed to the triple co-infection. This case will act as a wake-up call for clinicians, public health authorities, and infectious disease specialists to plan before the volcano of co-infections erupts.","['Rahim F', 'Amin S', 'Noor M', 'Ali B', 'Wahab A']",2022,14,9,Cureus,"Rahim F, et al.

36223391,Diverse susceptibilities and responses of human and rodent cells to orthohantavirus infection reveal different levels of cellular restriction.,"Orthohantaviruses are rodent-borne emerging viruses that may cause severe diseases in humans but no apparent pathology in their small mammal reservoirs. However, the mechanisms leading to tolerance or pathogenicity in humans and persistence in rodent reservoirs are poorly understood, as is the manner in which they spread within and between organisms. Here, we used a range of cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the interactions of three different orthohantaviruses-Puumala virus (PUUV), responsible for a mild to moderate form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans, Tula virus (TULV) with low pathogenicity, and non-pathogenic Prospect Hill virus (PHV)-with human and rodent host cell lines. Besides the fact that cell susceptibility to virus infection was shown to depend on the cell type and virus strain, the three orthohantaviruses were able to infect Vero E6 and HuH7 human cells, but only the former secreted infectious particles. In cells derived from PUUV reservoir, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), PUUV achieved a complete viral cycle, while TULV did not enter the cells and PHV infected them but did not produce infectious particles, reflecting differences in host specificity. A search for mature virions by electron microscopy (EM) revealed that TULV assembly occurred in part at the plasma membrane, whereas PHV particles were trapped in autophagic vacuoles in cells of the heterologous rodent host. We described differential interactions of orthohantaviruses with cellular factors, as supported by the cellular distribution of viral nucleocapsid protein with cell compartments, and proteomics identification of cellular partners. Our results also showed that interferon (IFN) dependent gene expression was regulated in a cell and virus species dependent manner. Overall, our study highlighted the complexity of the host-virus relationship and demonstrated that orthohantaviruses are restricted at different levels of the viral cycle. In addition, the study opens new avenues to further investigate how these viruses differ in their interactions with cells to evade innate immunity and how it depends on tissue type and host species.","['Gallo G', 'Kotlik P', 'Roingeard P', 'Monot M', 'Chevreux G', 'Ulrich RG', 'Tordo N', 'Ermonval M']",2022,16,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Gallo G, et al.

36197493,"Frailty, length of stay and cost in hip fracture patients.","UNLABELLED: A hip fracture causes high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is associated with adverse outcomes and increased costs. Frailty measured using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is associated with higher costs and adverse outcomes. HFRS is useful as a fuss-free frailty measurement in the management of older adults with hip fractures.
INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures account for an increasing number of hospital admissions around the world and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Frailty is increasingly recognized to be associated with adverse outcomes and increased costs. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) with the healthcare cost and outcomes in older adults who present with a hip fracture.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1014 patients ≥ 60 years who presented with a hip fracture between January 2016 to June 2020. Each patient was classified into HFRS low, intermediate or high frailty cohorts. Demographics, hip fracture type, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), American Society of Anesthesiologist score (ASA), costs, length of stay, time to surgery, complications, readmission rate and mortality were compared between the cohorts.
RESULTS: Median total hospitalization costs were significantly higher in the highest HFRS (SGD$22,432) patients as compared to intermediate (SGD$18,759) and low HFRS (SGD$15,671) patients. The difference between the high and low groups remains significant after adjusting for covariates using quantile regression. Similar results were shown for median length of stay (14 vs 10 vs 8 days), total number of complications (2 vs 1 vs 0) and adjusted time to surgery (p < 0.05). HFRS was not associated with 30-day readmission or 30-day or 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with a marked increase in total costs in hip fracture patients.

METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of HFRS patients in this outbreak were retrospectively analyzed. The whole genome of a hantavirus named 201120HV03xa (hv03xa for short) isolated from Apodemus agrarius captured in the construction site was sequenced and analyzed. In addition, nine HFRS patients were monitored for the IgG antibody against the HV N protein at 6 and 12 months, respectively.
RESULTS: In this study, inhalation of aerosolized excreta and contaminated food may be the main source of infection. Genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis showed that hv03xa is a reassortment strain of HTNV, having an S segment related to A16 of HTN 4, an M segment related to Q37 and Q10 of HTN 4, and an L segment related to prototype strain 76-118 of HTN 7. Potential recombination was detected in the S segment of hv03xa strain. The anti-HV-IgG level of all the patients persist for at least one year after infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This report documented an HFRS outbreak in Xi'an, China, which provided the basic data for epidemiological surveillance of endemic HTNV infection and facilitated to predict disease risk and implement prevention measures.","['Wei X', 'Meng B', 'Peng H', 'Li Y', 'Liu M', 'Si H', 'Wu R', 'Chen H', 'Bai Y', 'Li Y', 'Feng Q', 'Wang C', 'Zhao X']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Wei X, et al.

36134577,Measuring the Predictive Accuracy of Preoperative Clinical Frailty Instruments Applied to Electronic Health Data in Older Patients Having Emergency General Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare predictive accuracy of frailty instruments operationalizable in electronic data for prognosticating outcomes among older adults undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS).
BACKGROUND: Older patients undergoing EGS are at higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Preoperative frailty is a common and strong perioperative risk factor in this population. Despite this, existing barriers preclude routine preoperative frailty assessment.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults above 65 undergoing EGS from 2012 to 2018 using Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) provincial healthcare data in Ontario, Canada. We compared 4 frailty instruments: Frailty Index (FI), Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), Risk Analysis Index-Administrative (RAI), ACG Frailty-defining diagnoses indicator (ACG). We compared predictive accuracy beyond baseline risk models (age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, procedural risk). Predictive performance was measured using discrimination, calibration, explained variance, net reclassification index and Brier score (binary outcomes); using explained variance, root mean squared error and mean absolute prediction error (continuous outcomes). Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 365-day mortality, nonhome discharge, days alive at home, length of stay, and 30-day and 365-day health systems cost.
RESULTS: A total of 121,095 EGS patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11,422 (9.4%) experienced death 30 days postoperatively. Addition of FI, HFRS, and RAI to the baseline model led to improved discrimination, net reclassification index, and R2 ; RAI demonstrated the largest improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding 4 frailty instruments to typically assessed preoperative risk factors demonstrated strong predictive performance in accurately prognosticating perioperative outcomes. These findings can be considered in developing automated risk stratification systems among older EGS patients.","['Grudzinski AL', 'Aucoin S', 'Talarico R', 'Moloo H', 'Lalu MM', 'McIsaac DI']",2023,278,2,Ann Surg,"Grudzinski AL, et al.

36123054,Benefits of heart failure-specific pharmacotherapy in frail hospitalised patients: a cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES: Up to 50% of heart failure (HF) patients may be frail and have worse clinical outcomes than non-frail patients. The benefits of HF-specific pharmacotherapy (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor-blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonist) in this population are unclear. This study explored whether HF-specific pharmacotherapy improves outcomes in frail hospitalised HF patients.
DESIGN: Observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS: Tertiary care hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand four hundred and six hospitalised frail HF patients admitted between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2020.
MEASURES: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) determined frailty status and patients with HFRS ≥5 were classified as frail. The primary outcomes included the days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) at 90 days following discharge, 30-day and 180-day mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) and 30-day readmissions. Propensity score matching (PSM) compared clinical outcomes depending on the receipt of HF-specific pharmacotherapy.
RESULTS: Of 5734 HF patients admitted over a period of 8 years, 1406 (24.5%) were identified as frail according to the HFRS and were included in this study. Of 1406 frail HF patients, 1025 (72.9%) received HF-specific pharmacotherapy compared with 381 (27.1%) who did not receive any of these medications. Frail HF patients who did not receive HF-specific pharmacotherapy were significantly older, with higher creatinine and brain natriuretic peptide but with lower haemoglobin and albumin levels (p<0.05) when compared with those frail patients who received HF medications. After PSM frail patients on treatment were more likely to have an increased DAOH (coefficient 16.18, 95% CI 6.32 to 26.04, p=0.001) than those who were not on treatment. Both 30-day (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.39, p<0.001) and 180-day mortality (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.54, p<0.001) were significantly lower in frail patients on HF treatment but, there were no significant differences in LOS and 30-day readmissions (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study found an association between the use of HF-specific pharmacotherapy and improved clinical outcomes in frail HF hospitalised patients when compared to those who were not on treatment.

36010275,An HFman Probe-Based Multiplex Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Simultaneous Detection of Hantaan and Seoul Viruses.,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that are widely distributed worldwide. Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) are two most common hantaviruses that infect humans and cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Rapid and sensitive detection of HTNV and SEOV are crucial for surveillance, clinical treatment and management of HFRS. This study aimed to develop a rapid HFman probe-based mulstiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to simultaneously detect HTNV and SEOV. A novel multiplex RT-LAMP assay was developed, and 46 serum samples obtained from clinically suspected patients were used for evaluation. The novel RT-LAMP assay can detect as low as 3 copies/reaction of hantaviruses with a detection limit of 41 and 73 copies per reaction for HTNV and SEOV, respectively. A clinical evaluation showed that the consistencies of the multiplex RT-LAMP with RT-qPCR assay were 100% and 97.8% for HTNV and SEOV, respectively. In view of the high prevalence of HTNV and SEOV in rural areas with high rodent density, a colorimetric visual determination method was also developed for point-of-care testing (POCT) for the diagnosis of the two viruses. The novel multiplex RT-LAMP assay is a sensitive, specific, and efficient method for simultaneously detecting HTNV and SEOV.","['Zeng Y', 'Feng Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Yang L', 'Wang J', 'Gao Z', 'Zhang C']",2022,12,8,Diagnostics (Basel),"Zeng Y, et al.

35988878,Leveraging HFRS to assess how frailty affects healthcare resource utilization after elective ACDF for CSM.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Frailty is a common comorbidity associated with worsening outcomes in various medical and surgical fields. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a recently developed tool which assesses frailty using 109 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) comorbidity codes to assess severity of frailty. However, there is a paucity of studies utilizing the HFRS with patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of HFRS on health care resource utilization following ACDF for CSM.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2016-2019.
PATIENT SAMPLE: All adult (≥18 years old) patients undergoing primary, ACDF for CSM were identified using the ICD-10 CM codes.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Weighted patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and total admission costs were assessed.
METHODS: The 109 ICD-10 codes with pre-assigned values from 0.1 to 7.1 pertaining to frailty were queried in each patient, with a cumulative HFRS ≥5 indicating a frail patient. Patients were then categorized as either Low HFRS (HFRS<5) or Moderate to High HFRS (HFRS≥5). A multivariate stepwise logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio for risk-adjusted extended LOS, non-routine discharge disposition, and increased hospital cost.
RESULTS: A total of 29,305 patients were identified, of which 3,135 (10.7%) had a Moderate to High HFRS. Patients with a Moderate to High HFRS had higher rates of 1 or more postoperative complications (Low HFRS: 9.5% vs. Moderate-High HFRS: 38.6%, p≤.001), significantly longer hospital stays (Low HFRS: 1.8±1.7 days vs. Moderate-High HFRS: 4.4 ± 6.0, p≤.001), higher rates of non-routine discharge (Low HFRS: 5.8% vs. Moderate-High HFRS: 28.2%, p≤.001), and increased total cost of admission (Low HFRS: $19,691±9,740 vs. Moderate-High HFRS: $26,935±22,824, p≤.001) than patients in the Low HFRS cohort. On multivariate analysis, Moderate to High HFRS was found to be a significant independent predictor for extended LOS [OR: 3.19, 95% CI: (2.60, 3.91), p≤.001] and non-routine discharge disposition [OR: 3.88, 95% CI: (3.05, 4.95), p≤.001] but not increased cost [OR: 1.10, 95% CI: (0.87, 1.40), p=.418].
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with a higher HFRS have increased total hospital costs, a longer LOS, higher complication rates, and more frequent nonroutine discharge compared with patients with a low HFRS following elective ACDF for CSM. Although frail patients should not be precluded from surgical management of cervical spine pathology, these findings highlight the need for peri-operative protocols to medically optimize patients to improve health care quality and decrease costs.","['Elsamadicy AA', 'Koo AB', 'Sarkozy M', 'David WB', 'Reeves BC', 'Patel S', 'Hansen J', 'Sandhu MRS', 'Hengartner AC', 'Hersh A', 'Kolb L', 'Lo SL', 'Shin JH', 'Mendel E', 'Sciubba DM']",2023,23,1,Spine J,"Elsamadicy AA, et al.

35980246,Nanomechanical Sensing Using Heater-Integrated Fluidic Resonators.,"Micro/nanochannel resonators have been used to measure cells, suspended nanoparticles, or liquids, primarily at or near room temperature while their high temperature operation can offer promising applications such as calorimetric measurements and thermogravimetric analysis. To date, global electrothermal or local photothermal heating mechanisms have been attempted for channel resonators, but both approaches are intrinsically limited by a narrow temperature modulation range, slow heating/cooling, less quantitative heating, or time-consuming optical alignment. Here, we introduce heater-integrated fluidic resonators (HFRs) that enable fast, quantitative, alignment-free, and wide-range temperature modulation and simultaneously offer resistive thermometry and resonant densitometry. HFRs with or without a dispensing nozzle are fabricated, thoroughly characterized, and used for high throughput thermophysical properties measurements, microchannel boiling studies, and atomized spray dispensing. The HFR, without a doubt, opens a new avenue for nanoscale thermal analysis and processing and further encourages the integration of additional functions into channel resonators.","['Ko J', 'Khan F', 'Nam Y', 'Lee BJ', 'Lee J']",2022,22,19,Nano Lett,"Ko J, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the 2016-2019 Nationwide Readmission Database. All NPH patients (≥60 years) undergoing a VP shunt surgery were identified using ICD-10-CM diagnostic and procedural codes. Patients were dichotomized into 2 cohorts as follows: Low HFRS (<5) and Intermediate-High HFRS (≥5). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to identify independent predictors of adverse event (AE) and 30- and 90-day readmission.
RESULTS: Of 13,262 patients, 4386 (33.1%) had an Intermediate-High HFRS score. A greater proportion of the Intermediate-High HFRS cohort experienced at least one AE (1.9 vs. 22.1, P < 0.001). The Intermediate-High HFRS cohort also had a longer length of stay (2.3 ± 2.4 days vs. 7.0 ± 7.7 days, P < 0.001), higher non-routine discharge rate (19.9% vs. 39.9%, P < 0.001), and greater admission cost ($14,634 ± 5703 vs. $21,749 ± 15,234, P < 0.001). The Intermediate-High HFRS cohort had higher rates of 30- (7.6% vs. 11.0%, P < 0.001) and 90-day (6.8% vs. 8.3%, P < 0.001) readmissions. On a multivariate regression analysis, Intermediate-High HFRS compared to Low HFRS was an independent predictor of any AE (odds ratio, 16.6; 95% confidence interval, [12.9-21.5]; P < 0.001) and 30-day readmission (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, [1.2-1.7]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that frailty, as defined by HFRS, is associated with increased resource utilization in NPH patients undergoing VP shunt surgery. Furthermore, HFRS was an independent predictor of adverse events and 30-day hospital readmission.","['Koo AB', 'Elsamadicy AA', 'Renedo D', 'Sarkozy M', 'Reeves BC', 'Barrows MM', 'Hengartner A', 'Havlik J', 'Sandhu MRS', 'Antonios JP', 'Malhotra A', 'Matouk CC']",2023,170,,World Neurosurg,"Koo AB, et al.

35943063,Remotely Monitored Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Data Predict All-Cause and Cardiovascular Unplanned Hospitalization.,"Background Unplanned hospitalizations are common in patients with cardiovascular disease. The ""Triage Heart Failure Risk Status"" (Triage-HFRS) algorithm in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices uses data from up to 9 device-derived physiological parameters to stratify patients as low/medium/high risk of 30-day heart failure (HF) hospitalization, but its use to predict all-cause hospitalization has not been explored. We examined the association between Triage-HFRS and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or HF hospitalization. Methods and Results A prospective observational study of 435 adults (including patients with and without HF) with a Medtronic Triage-HFRS-enabled cardiac implantable electronic device (cardiac resynchronization therapy device, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or pacemaker). Cox proportional hazards models explored association between Triage-HFRS and time to hospitalization; a frailty term at the patient level accounted for repeated measures. A total of 274 of 435 patients (63.0%) transmitted ≥1 high HFRS transmission before or during the study period. The remaining 161 patients never transmitted a high HFRS. A total of 153 (32.9%) patients had ≥1 unplanned hospitalization during the study period, totaling 356 nonelective hospitalizations. A high HFRS conferred a 37.3% sensitivity and an 86.2% specificity for 30-day all-cause hospitalization; and for HF hospitalizations, these numbers were 62.5% and 85.6%, respectively. Compared with a low Triage-HFRS, a high HFRS conferred a 4.2 relative risk of 30-day all-cause hospitalization (8.5% versus 2.0%), a 5.0 relative risk of 30-day cardiovascular hospitalization (3.6% versus 0.7%), and a 7.7 relative risk of 30-day HF hospitalization (2.0% versus 0.3%). Conclusions In patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices, remotely monitored Triage-HFRS data discriminated between patients at high and low risk of all-cause hospitalization (cardiovascular or noncardiovascular) in real time.","['Sammut-Powell C', 'Taylor JK', 'Motwani M', 'Leonard CM', 'Martin GP', 'Ahmed FZ']",2022,11,16,J Am Heart Assoc,"Sammut-Powell C, et al.

35891358,Serum Markers Associated with Disease Severity in a Bosnian Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome Cohort.,"Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) is endemic in Europe and can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (nephropathia epidemica). Disease features include fever, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). This retrospective cohort study of forty PUUV patients aims to characterize associations of serum immunological, hemostatic or kidney injury markers to disease severity. While interleukin-18 (IL-18) was significantly increased in severely thrombocytopenic patients (<100 × 109 platelets/L) compared to patients with higher platelet counts, RANTES was significantly decreased in these patients. These data suggest that patients with significant thrombocytopenia might have experienced pronounced Th1 immune responses. When kidney dysfunction was used as the primary disease outcome, recently identified AKI biomarkers (Cystatin C, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, Nephrin, and trefoil factor 3) were significantly upregulated in patients with severe PUUV infection, defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 m/min/1.73 m2. The increased expression of these markers specifically indicates pathology in glomeruli and proximal tubuli. Furthermore, E-selectin was significantly higher while interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) was significantly lower in PUUV patients with more severe kidney dysfunction compared to patients with higher eGFR-values. Increased E-selectin illustrates the central role of endothelial cell activation, whereas decreased IP-10 could indicate a less important role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of kidney dysfunction.","['Noack D', 'Travar M', 'Mrdjen V', 'Voermans JJC', 'van de Vijver D', 'Molenkamp R', 'Koopmans MPG', 'Goeijenbier M', 'Rockx B']",2022,14,7,Viruses,"Noack D, et al.

Combining the advantages of both the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and INLA frameworks, the MCMCINLA algorithm is used to implement imputation of the missing data and fit the model to derive estimates of the parameters from the posterior margins. Finally, the economic data and the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) disease data of mainland China from 2016-2018 are used as examples to explore the development of public health in China in the post-epidemic era. The results show that compared with expectation maximization (EM) and full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML), the predicted values of the missing data obtained using our method are closer to the true values, and the spatial distribution of HFRS in China can be inferred from the imputation results with a southern-heavy and northern-light distribution. It can provide some references for the development of public health in China in the post-epidemic era.","['Teng J', 'Ding S', 'Shi X', 'Zhang H', 'Hu X']",2022,24,7,Entropy (Basel),"Teng J, et al.

35847100,In vitro Anti-Hantavirus Activity of Protein Kinase Inhibitor 8G1 Targeting AKT/mTOR/eIF4E Signaling Pathway.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is the main cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) around the world, which results in profound morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines against HFRS. To find new anti-HTNV drugs, the inhibitory activity of 901 small molecule kinase inhibitors against HTNV is analyzed. Among these compounds, compound 8G1 inhibits HTNV with a relatively high inhibition rate and lower toxicity. The viral titer and nucleocapsid protein of HTNV are reduced after compound 8G1 treatment in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μM. In addition, the administration of compound 8G1 at the early stage of HTNV infection can inhibit the replication of HTNV. The molecular docking result reveals that compound 8G1 forms interactions with the key amino acid residues of serine/threonine-protein kinase B (Akt), which is responsible for the observed affinity. Then, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) signaling pathways are inhibited. Our results may help to design novel targets for therapeutic intervention against HTNV infection and to understand the anti-HTNV mechanism of protein kinase inhibitors.","['Li Z', 'Wang F', 'Ying Q', 'Kong D', 'Zhang X', 'Dong Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhai D', 'Chen Z', 'Jia M', 'Xue X', 'Li M', 'Wu X']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Li Z, et al.

35809515,Seroprevalence and incidence of Puumala orthohantavirus in its bank vole (Myodes glareolus) host population in northeastern France: Between-site and seasonal variability.,"Given the difficulty of measuring pathogen transmission in wildlife, epidemiological studies frequently rely on cross-sectional seroprevalence. However, seropositivity indicates only exposure to a pathogen at an unknown time. By allowing to obtain repeated test results from individuals sampled multiple times over an extended period, longitudinal data help reduce this uncertainty. We used capture-mark-recapture data on bank vole (Myodes glareolus) individuals collected at four sites over ten years in northeastern France to investigate the impact of environmental variables on seroprevalence and incidence of Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV). PUUV causes a chronic infection without apparent symptoms, that may however impair survival of its rodent host in the wild. Viral transmission between rodents may occur through direct contact or via the environment. Principal component analysis was used to deal with multicollinearity among environmental variables. Incidence and seroprevalence were investigated with either generalized estimating equations or Poisson regression models depending on the number of observations for each season. In spring, only the factor site was found to be significant for seroprevalence, while a principal component including meteorological conditions of the previous winter and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of both the previous winter and spring had a significant effect on incidence. In autumn, only the factor site was significant for incidence, while two principal components, including either the meteorological conditions of the autumn and previous spring or NDVI of the autumn significantly affected seroprevalence. We discuss these results in light of the particular demography of small mammals. We encourage other researchers to investigate the relationships between demographic parameters of wild host populations and the environment, by using both incidence and seroprevalence.","['Monchatre-Leroy E', 'Sauvage F', 'Boué F', 'Augot D', 'Marianneau P', 'Hénaux V', 'Crespin L']",2022,40,,Epidemics,"Monchatre-Leroy E, et al.

In patients with coinfection of tuberculosis with leptospirosis, there may be severe hepatic and renal dysfunction rendering the standard antitubercular therapy (ATT) regimen useless, thus requiring alternate drug selection and dose modification of antitubercular drugs. We present a case of a 57-year-old female who presented with high-grade fever and yellowish discoloration of the eyes. She was diagnosed with Weil's disease and started on treatment. She later developed altered sensorium and lumbar puncture was suggestive of tubercular meningitis. Due to her deranged renal and hepatic function tests, she was started on a modified regimen of ATT with intermittent dialysis.

35756741,"The kidney in hantavirus infection-epidemiology, virology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management.","Hantavirus-induced diseases are emerging zoonoses with endemic appearances and frequent outbreaks in different parts of the world. In humans, hantaviral pathology is characterized by the disruption of the endothelial cell barrier followed by increased capillary permeability, thrombocytopenia due to platelet activation/depletion and an overactive immune response. Genetic vulnerability due to certain human leukocyte antigen haplotypes is associated with disease severity. Typically, two different hantavirus-caused clinical syndromes have been reported: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). The primarily affected vascular beds differ in these two entities: renal medullary capillaries in HFRS caused by Old World hantaviruses and pulmonary capillaries in HCPS caused by New World hantaviruses. Disease severity in HFRS ranges from mild, e.g. Puumala virus-associated nephropathia epidemica, to moderate, e.g. Hantaan or Dobrava virus infections. HCPS leads to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality rates. Due to novel insights into organ tropism, hantavirus-associated pathophysiology and overlapping clinical features, HFRS and HCPS are believed to be interconnected syndromes frequently involving the kidneys. As there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines approved in Europe or the USA, only preventive measures and public awareness may minimize the risk of hantavirus infection. Treatment remains primarily supportive and, depending on disease severity, more invasive measures (e.g., renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) are needed.","['Koehler FC', 'Di Cristanziano V', 'Späth MR', 'Hoyer-Allo KJR', 'Wanken M', 'Müller RU', 'Burst V']",2022,15,7,Clin Kidney J,"Koehler FC, et al.

35733862,Outcomes of Care by Geriatricians and Non-geriatricians in an Academic Hospital.,"INTRODUCTION: While hospitalist and internist inpatient care models dominate the landscape in many countries, geriatricians and internists are at the frontlines managing hospitalized older adults in countries such as Singapore and the United Kingdom. The primary aim of this study was to determine outcomes for older patients cared for by geriatricians compared with non-geriatrician-led care teams.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1,486 Internal Medicine patients aged ≥75 years admitted between April and September 2021 was conducted. They were either under geriatrician or non-geriatrician (internists or specialty physicians) care. Data on demographics, primary diagnosis, comorbidities, mortality, readmission rate, Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, Length of Stay (LOS), and cost of hospital stay were obtained from the hospital database and analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 84.0 ± 6.3 years, 860 (57.9%) females, 1,183 (79.6%) of Chinese ethnicity, and 902 (60.7%) under the care of geriatricians. Patients under geriatrician were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of frailty, dementia, and stroke, whereas patients under non-geriatrician had a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. Delirium as the primary diagnosis was significantly higher among patients under geriatrician care. Geriatrician-led care model was associated with shorter LOS, lower cost, similar inpatient mortality, and 30-day readmission rates. LOS and cost were lower for patients under geriatrician care regardless of frailty status but significant only for low and intermediate frailty groups. Geriatrician-led care was associated with significantly lower extended hospital stay (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.95) and extended cost (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54-0.95).
CONCLUSION: Geriatrician-led care model showed shorter LOS, lower cost, and was associated with lower odds of extended LOS and cost.","['Merchant RA', 'Ho VWT', 'Chen MZ', 'Wong BLL', 'Lim Z', 'Chan YH', 'Ling N', 'Ng SE', 'Santosa A', 'Murphy D', 'Vathsala A']",2022,9,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Merchant RA, et al.

35727463,Neurological Complications of Dengue Fever.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the neurological complications of dengue virus (DENV) infection and their pathogenesis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Include recognition of the four different serotypes of DENV and their epidemiology as well as recognition of the expanded dengue syndrome encompassing multisystem involvement in the severe form of the disease including involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). DENV is a neurotropic virus with the ability to infect the supporting cells of the CNS. Neural injury during the acute stage of the infection results from direct neuro-invasion and/or the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement, resulting in plasma leakage and coagulopathy. Immune mechanisms have been implicated in the development of the delayed neurological sequelae through molecular mimicry. A myriad of neurological syndromes has been described as a result of the involvement of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both. Neurological manifestations in DENV infection are increasingly being recognized, some of which are potentially fatal if not treated promptly. DENV encephalopathy and encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other acute febrile encephalopathies, autoimmune encephalitides, and in cases of encephalopathy/encephalitis related to SARS-CoV2 infection, especially in dengue-endemic areas. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) may be occasionally encountered. Clinicians should be knowledgeable of the expanded dengue syndrome characterized by the concurrent compromise of cardiac, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, and hematopopoietic systems. Isolated cranial nerve palsies occur rather uncommonly and are often steroid responsive. These neuropathies may result from the direct involvement of cranial nerve nuclei or nerve involvement or may be immune-mediated. Even if the diagnosis of dengue is confirmed, it is absolutely imperative to exclude other well-known causes of isolated cranial nerve palsies. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes may occur following dengue fever. The pathogenesis may be beyond the commonly observed thrombocytopenia and include cerebral vasculitis. Involvement of ocular blood vessels may cause maculopathy or retinal hemorrhages. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is uncommon and possibly related to dysregulated cytokine release phenomena. Lastly, any patient developing acute neuromuscular weakness during the course or within a fortnight of remission from dengue fever must be screened for acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), hypokalemic paralysis, or acute myositis. Rarely, a Miller-Fisher-like syndrome with negative anti-GQ1b antibody may develop.","['Trivedi S', 'Chakravarty A']",2022,22,8,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,Trivedi S and Chakravarty A.

35723816,Utility of hospital frailty risk score for predicting postoperative outcomes in craniopharyngioma.,"OVERVIEW: Frailty is an age-associated decline in functional status leading to increased vulnerability to otherwise innocuous stressors. In neurosurgical patients, frailty has been associated with postoperative complications, increased mortality, longer hospitalization, and increased care costs for a variety of conditions. This study seeks to determine the association between frailty and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma.
METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried for patients diagnosed with craniopharyngioma who underwent surgery via either craniotomy or transsphenoidal approach. Comorbid diagnoses were used to calculate the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and assign patients to low (< 5), intermediate (5-15), or high-risk (> 15) categories. Logistic regression was completed to determine whether the HFRS category was predictive of mortality, postoperative complication, extended hospitalization, or increased hospital costs compared to age.
RESULTS: Increased frailty score was predictive of increased length of stay, increased hospital costs, and non-home discharge in binary logistic regression with good discrimination on the ROC curve compared to age at admission. HFRS risk categories were significantly predictive of the development of any complication, with 100% of high-risk patients developing a complication compared to 76% of intermediate-risk and 63% of low-risk patients. HFRS risk categories were also predictive of the extended length of stay (71%, 49%, and 11% for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk, respectively) and non-home discharge (86%, 56%, and 17%). Regression analysis was unable to be performed for mortality due to the low number of deaths in the study group.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing any surgery for craniopharyngioma, frailty is predictive of increased hospital length of stay and overall care costs. HFRS failed to independently predict mortality because the incidence of mortality is too low in this population to analyze. The HFRS is a valuable tool to identify post-operative outcomes following surgery for craniopharyngioma.","['Peterson R', 'Kandregula S', 'Jee E', 'Guthikonda B']",2022,159,1,J Neurooncol,"Peterson R, et al.

35675645,Elevation of Myeloperoxidase Correlates with Disease Severity in Patients with Hantaan Virus Infection.,"Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) characterized by acute kidney injury and hemorrhage. Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cell and the body's first line of defense against pathogens. Currently, an increasing number of studies have shown that neutrophils may be a mixed blessing in terms of viral infections. However, the role of neutrophils in HFRS patients with HTNV infection has not been fully declared. In this study, we analyzed plasma levels of both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and MPO-DNA in HFRS patients, together with the clinical parameters. Neutrophil-platelet aggregates (NPAs) during the acute and convalescent phases of HFRS were also assessed. The results showed that plasma MPO-DNA levels had no change in different disease phases or severities of HFRS patients. Whereas plasma MPO significantly increased in the acute phase and critical/severe groups of HFRS patients. Furthermore, plasma MPO was positively correlated with inflammatory clinical parameters, such as white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and renal injury-related parameters, such as blood urea nitrogen, blood uric acid, and serum creatinine, as well as negatively correlated with and platelet counts. In addition, NPAs increased both in acute and convalescent phase in HFRS patients compared with normal controls. These results suggested that elevated plasma MPO in HFRS patients correlated with disease severity, together with the increases of NPAs in HFRS patients, which may provide new insights into potential role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of HFRS.","['Li P', 'Zhang C', 'Wang M', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Tang K', 'Hu H', 'Jia X', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang Y']",2022,35,6,Viral Immunol,"Li P, et al.

35577262,Environmentally relevant exposure to TBBPA and its analogues may not drastically affect human early cardiac development.,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and its substitutes and derivatives have been widely used as halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), in the past few decades. As a consequence, these compounds are frequently detected in the environment, as well as human bodily fluids, especially umbilical cord blood and breast milk. This has raised awareness of their potential risks to fetuses and infants. In this study, we employed human embryonic stem cell differentiation models to assess the potential developmental toxicity of six TBBPA-like compounds, at human relevant nanomolar concentrations. To mimic early embryonic development, we utilized embryoid body-based 3D differentiation in presence of the six HFRs. Transcriptomics data showed that HFR exposure over 16 days of differentiation only interfered with the expression of a few genes, indicating those six HFRs may not have specific tissue/organ targets during embryonic development. Nevertheless, further analyses revealed that some cardiac-related genes were dysregulated. Since the heart is also the first organ to develop, we employed a cardiac differentiation model to analyze the six HFRs' potential developmental toxicity in more depth. Overall, HFRs of interest did not significantly disturb the canonical WNT pathway, which is an essential signal transduction pathway for cardiac development. In addition, the six HFRs showed only mild changes in gene expression levels for cardiomyocyte markers, such as NKX2.5, MYH7, and MYL4, as well as a significant down-regulation of some but not all the epicardial and smooth muscle cell markers selected. Taken together, our results show that the six studied HFRs, at human relevant concentrations, may impose negligible effects on embryogenesis and heart development. Nevertheless, higher exposure doses might affect the early stages of heart development.","['Zhao M', 'Yin N', 'Yang R', 'Li S', 'Zhang S', 'Faiola F']",2022,306,,Environ Pollut,"Zhao M, et al.

35537845,[Epidemic process and influencing factors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: a review].,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a category B infectious disease caused by hantaviruses that cause acute kidney injury and has a high mortality rate, and HFRS control has been given a high priority in China. It has been found that hantavirus types are closely associated with selective host transformation and regional adaption, and continue to evolve in the form of gene recombination. The severity of HFRS varies in hantavirus types. In addition, global environmental changes and alteration of host animal behaviors accelerate Hantavirus genome variations, and large-scale land reclamation and infrastructure building increases the likelihood of human contacts with hosts and disease-transmitting vectors, thereby increasing the risk of HFRS development. This review summarizes the main characteristics and influencing factors pertaining to the epidemic process of HFRS, so as to provide insights into effective prevention and control of this infectious disease.","['Wang N', 'Yin JX']",2021,34,2,Zhongguo Xue Xi Chong Bing Fang Zhi Za Zhi,Wang N and Yin JX.

In this study, we report virological assessment of a fatal case of HFRS-PUUV (Puumala virus) in the Kursk Region. The infection caused severe multiorgan failure and the maximum viral load was detected in the tissue of the spleen. Viral sequences were obtained from the patient's autopsy material and lung tissues of bank voles captured in the region. These sequences formed a new clade in the PUUV phylogenetic tree, an outgroup to all known Russian (RUS) lineage sequences. On the other hand viruses collected in the Kursk Region grouped with the RUS lineage and are separated from all other PUUV linages. We propose to nominate this novel group as W-RUS as the identified viruses were collected near the western Russian boundary. The recombination signals between their ancestors and RUS lineage representatives from the Volga region were revealed.

In Chile, the zoonoses of mandatory notification are brucellosis, anthrax, trichinosis, hydatidosis, leptospirosis, dengue, Chagas disease, hantavirosis and rabies.
AIM: To assess the trend and characterize the mortality from zoonoses of mandatory notification in Chile between 1997-2018.
METHODS: An official mortality and population data were used. Relative, general and specific mortality rates were described according to sociodemographic variables. Crude and adjusted annual mortality rates (direct method) were calculated. Temporal trend was evaluated with the Prais-Winsten regression model.
RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2018, the mortality rate due to zoonosis of mandatory notification corresponded to 0.13% (2152 deaths) of the total mortality, being Chagas disease (59.2%), hydatidosis (24.6%) and hantavirosis (13.5%) the main causes. The general adjusted mortality rate decreased significantly (B: -0.017; IC95%: -0.024; -0.009) as did hydatidosis (B: -0.011; IC95%: -0.013; -0.008), and only hantavirosis showed an increase trend (not significant).
CONCLUSION: Mortality due to zoonoses decreased during the period; only hantavirosis showed an increasing trend.

35505435,Comparison of the predictive ability of clinical frailty scale and hospital frailty risk score to determine long-term survival in critically ill patients: a multicentre retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is the most commonly used frailty measure in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) was recently proposed for the quantification of frailty. We aimed to compare the HFRS with the CFS in critically ill patients in predicting long-term survival up to one year following ICU admission.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicentre cohort study from 16 public ICUs in the state of Victoria, Australia between 1st January 2017 and 30th June 2018, ICU admission episodes listed in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database registry with a documented CFS, which had been linked with the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset and the Victorian Death Index were examined. The HFRS was calculated for each patient using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes that represented pre-existing conditions at the time of index hospital admission. Descriptive methods, Cox proportional hazards and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to investigate the association between each frailty score and long-term survival up to 1 year, after adjusting for confounders including sex and baseline severity of illness on admission to ICU (Australia New Zealand risk-of-death, ANZROD).
RESULTS: 7001 ICU patients with both frailty measures were analysed. The overall median (IQR) age was 63.7 (49.1-74.0) years; 59.5% (n = 4166) were male; the median (IQR) APACHE II score 14 (10-20). Almost half (46.7%, n = 3266) were mechanically ventilated. The hospital mortality was 9.5% (n = 642) and 1-year mortality was 14.4% (n = 1005). HFRS correlated weakly with CFS (Spearman's rho 0.13 (95% CI 0.10-0.15) and had a poor agreement (kappa = 0.12, 95% CI 0.10-0.15). Both frailty measures predicted 1-year survival after adjusting for confounders, CFS (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.21-1.31) and HFRS (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15). The CFS had better discrimination of 1-year mortality than HFRS (AUROC 0.66 vs 0.63 p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Both HFRS and CFS independently predicted up to 1-year survival following an ICU admission with moderate discrimination.

35491227,Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome - Suspected Cases in Sri Lanka: Clinical Picture and Epidemiology from 2013-2021.,"Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic disease in Europe and Asia, which is clinically indistinguishable from leptospirosis. A total of 1,032 patients with clinical suspicion of HFRS-like illness were included in the analysis from March 2013 to March 2021. Of these, 168 were positive for hantavirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Thirty-one of 35 patients had a 4-fold increase in IgG antibody titer with paired serum, confirming acute hantavirus infections. The detected antibodies showed a diverse pattern, strongly cross-reacting with the Seoul, Hantaan, and Puumala virus antigens. All the IgM-positive patients had no serological evidence of acute dengue or leptospirosis and had classical features of HFRS, including fever, thrombocytopenia, and renal involvement. More than 90% of patients had a history of rodent exposure 2-3 weeks prior to the onset of the fever. The highest number of positive cases was diagnosed in the Western and North Central Provinces of Sri Lanka during the paddy harvesting seasons. A significant number of patients develop severe complications with high mortality rates. Therefore, hantavirus infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis for leptospirosis-like illnesses in Sri Lanka.","['Muthugala R', 'Dheerasekara K', 'Manamperi A', 'Gunasena S', 'Galagoda G']",2022,75,5,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Muthugala R, et al.

35459229,Central nervous system infection with Seoul Orthohantavirus in a child after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are prone to complicate viral infection. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement caused by the viruses is rare but with poor prognosis. Hantavirus, which usually cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and none case has been reported about these infection in allo-HSCT patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: In August 2021, a 13-year-old male child developed intermittent fever and refractory hypotension after allo-HSCT. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed abnormal signal foci in the left midbrain cerebral peduncle and bilateral thalamus. His family reported traces of mouse activity in the patient's home kitchen. HFRS was suspected, but with no significant kidney damage. The specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M of hantavirus were negative. The metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) detected Seoul Orthohantavirus (SEOV) sequences directly in cerebrospinal fluid and blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Allo-HSCT patients are a high-risk group for infection. Usually the causative agent of infection is difficult to determine, and sometimes the site of infection is concealed. This report highlights the importance of suspecting hantavirus infection in allo-HSCT patients with CNS symptoms despite the absence of renal syndromes. The mNGS is a powerful tool for detecting pathogens. CNS infection with Seoul orthohantavirus in transplant patients is rare but possible as demonstrated in this case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case employing mNGS to diagnose SEOV caused CNS infection in an allo-HSCT patient.","['Liu E', 'Lv S', 'Yi P', 'Feng L', 'Deng X', 'Xia H', 'Xu Y']",2022,19,1,Virol J,"Liu E, et al.

35458553,Expression Profile of Human Renal Mesangial Cells Is Altered by Infection with Pathogenic Puumala Orthohantavirus.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) with proteinuria is a hallmark of infections with Eurasian orthohantaviruses. Different kidney cells are identified as target cells of hantaviruses. Mesangial cells may play a central role in the pathogenesis of AKI by regulation of inflammatory mediators and signaling cascades. Therefore, we examined the characteristics of hantavirus infection on human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs). Receptor expression and infection with pathogenic Puumala virus (PUUV) and low-pathogenic Tula virus (TULV) were explored. To analyze changes in protein expression in infected mesangial cells, we performed a proteome profiler assay analyzing 38 markers of kidney damage. We compared the proteome profile of in vitro-infected HRMCs with the profile detected in urine samples of 11 patients with acute hantavirus infection. We observed effective productive infection of HRMCs with pathogenic PUUV, but only poor abortive infection for low-pathogenic TULV. PUUV infection resulted in the deregulation of proteases, adhesion proteins, and cytokines associated with renal damage. The urinary proteome profile of hantavirus patients demonstrated also massive changes, which in part correspond to the alterations observed in the in vitro infection of HRMCs. The direct infection of mesangial cells may induce a local environment of signal mediators that contributes to AKI in hantavirus infection.","['Nusshag C', 'Boegelein L', 'Schreiber P', 'Essbauer S', 'Osberghaus A', 'Zeier M', 'Krautkrämer E']",2022,14,4,Viruses,"Nusshag C, et al.

35456288,External Validation of the Hospital Frailty-Risk Score in Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Older Heart-Failure Patients in Australia.,"Frailty is common in older hospitalised heart-failure (HF) patients but is not routinely assessed. The hospital frailty-risk score (HFRS) can be generated from administrative data, but it needs validation in Australian health-care settings. This study determined the HFRS scores at presentation to hospital in 5735 HF patients ≥ 75 years old, admitted over a period of 7 years, at two tertiary hospitals in Australia. Patients were classified into 3 frailty categories: HFRS < 5 (low risk), 5−15 (intermediate risk) and >15 (high risk). Multilevel multivariable regression analysis determined whether the HFRS predicts the following clinical outcomes: 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) > 7 days, and 30-day readmissions; this was determined after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson index and socioeconomic status. The mean (SD) age was 76.1 (14.0) years, and 51.9% were female. When compared to the low-risk HFRS group, patients in the high-risk HFRS group had an increased risk of 30-day mortality and prolonged LOS (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.09; 95% CI 1.21−3.60) for 30-day mortality, and an aOR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.01−2.43) for prolonged LOS (c-statistics 0.730 and 0.682, respectively). Similarly, the 30-day readmission rate was significantly higher in the high-risk HFRS group when compared to the low-risk group (aOR 1.69; 95% CI 1.06−2.69; c-statistic = 0.643).

PURPOSE: To determine if abdominal computed tomography (CT) can lead to a diagnosis of Puumala virus infection in the presence of a suggestive clinical picture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT findings were studied retrospectively in 30 patients who presented to the emergency department of two (Belgian) hospitals with serologically confirmed Puumala hantavirus infection.
RESULTS: The most frequent finding was perirenal fascial thickening (90%), followed by perirenal fat stranding (87%). Retroperitoneal fat stranding was found in 19 patients (64%) in the perivesical spaces along the fascia of the external iliac vessels with or without involvement of the presacral fat. Half of the patients had pelvic ascites, and pleural fluid was found in 7 of them. The right and left mean pole-to-pole kidney's lengths were respectively 125.7 mm and 127.8 mm in 28 patients.
CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal fat stranding, perirenal fascial thickening and/or perirenal fat stranding were found in most patients with acute Puumala virus infection who have undergone CT.

35362148,Virus isolation data improve host predictions for New World rodent orthohantaviruses.,"Identifying reservoir host species is crucial for understanding the ecology of multi-host pathogens and predicting risks of pathogen spillover from wildlife to people. Predictive models are increasingly used for identifying ecological traits and prioritizing surveillance of likely zoonotic reservoirs, but these often employ different types of evidence for establishing host associations. Comparisons between models with different infection evidence are necessary to guide inferences about the trait profiles of likely hosts and identify which hosts and geographical regions are likely sources of spillover. Here, we use New World rodent-orthohantavirus associations to explore differences in the performance and predictions of models trained on two types of evidence for infection and onward transmission: RT-PCR and live virus isolation data, representing active infections versus host competence, respectively. Orthohantaviruses are primarily carried by muroid rodents and cause the diseases haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans. We show that although boosted regression tree (BRT) models trained on RT-PCR and live virus isolation data both performed well and capture generally similar trait profiles, rodent phylogeny influenced previously collected RT-PCR data, and BRTs using virus isolation data displayed a narrower list of predicted reservoirs than those using RT-PCR data. BRT models trained on RT-PCR data identified 138 undiscovered hosts and virus isolation models identified 92 undiscovered hosts, with 27 undiscovered hosts identified by both models. Distributions of predicted hosts were concentrated in several different regions for each model, with large discrepancies between evidence types. As a form of validation, virus isolation models independently predicted several orthohantavirus-rodent host associations that had been previously identified through empirical research using RT-PCR. Our model predictions provide a priority list of species and locations for future orthohantavirus sampling. More broadly, these results demonstrate the value of multiple data types for predicting zoonotic pathogen hosts. These methods can be applied across a range of systems to improve our understanding of pathogen maintenance and increase efficiency of pathogen surveillance.","['Mull N', 'Carlson CJ', 'Forbes KM', 'Becker DJ']",2022,91,6,J Anim Ecol,"Mull N, et al.

The clinical manifestations of dengue infection range from an asymptomatic subclinical course to severe dengue shock syndrome. Besides, dengue can affect any organ in the body and can present with atypical manifestations.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 6-year-old previously healthy Tamil child who had dengue complicated with multiorgan involvement. She initially presented with high fever, headache, body aches for 5 days, blood and mucus diarrhea, hematuria, and right knee joint swelling for 2 days. Dengue NS1 antigen was positive on day 2 of febrile illness. She was managed symptomatically in the local hospital for 3 days and transferred to the tertiary care hospital for further management. She was eventually diagnosed as having dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated with multiorgan involvement including acute liver failure, pancreatic involvement, coagulopathy, arthritis, acute kidney injury, and multiple intracranial hemorrhages. The constellation of disease manifestations was identified as expanded dengue syndrome. She was managed with fresh blood, platelet, and cryoprecipitate transfusions and intravenous antibiotics in addition to renal and liver support in the intensive care unit. On day 14 of illness, she deteriorated while on the ventilator and died due to multiple intracranial hemorrhages.
CONCLUSION: The reported child with dengue hemorrhagic fever developed several unusual presentations such as acute liver and renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, pancreatic involvement, and multiple intracranial hemorrhages, which form part of expanded dengue syndrome.

35336910,Alcohol Consumption and Its Influence on the Clinical Picture of Puumala Hantavirus Infection.,"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Characteristic clinical findings include acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, and capillary leakage. Smoking increases the risk of severe AKI, but it is not known whether alcohol consumption predisposes patients to a more severe infection. Liver and pancreatic enzymes, as well as biomarkers of alcohol consumption (gamma-glutamyl transferase, GGT; carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, CDT; GGT-CDT combination; and ethyl glucuronide, EtG), were measured from 66 patients with acute PUUV infection during hospitalization and at the convalescence phase. Alcohol consumption was present in 41% of the study population, 15% showing signs of heavy drinking. Alcohol use did not affect the severity of PUUV induced AKI nor the overall clinical picture of the infection. Liver enzyme levels (GGT or alanine aminotransferase, ALT) were elevated in 64% of the patients, but the levels did not associate with the markers reflecting the severity of the disease. Serum amylase activities at the convalescent stage were higher than those at the acute phase (p < 0.001). No cases with acute pancreatitis were found.

35324593,Analysis of Puumala orthohantavirus Genome Variants Identified in the Territories of Volga Federal District.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic disease commonly diagnosed in the Volga Federal District (VFD). HFRS is caused by Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV), and this virus is usually detected in bank voles as its natural host (Myodes glareolus). The PUUV genome is composed of the single-stranded, negative-sense RNA containing three segments. The goal of the current study is to identify genome variants of PUUV strains circulating in bank voles captured in the Udmurt Republic (UR) and Ulyanovsk region (ULR). The comparative and phylogenetic analysis of PUUV strains revealed that strains from Varaksino site UR are closely related to strains previously identified in the Pre-Kama area of the Republic of Tatarstan (RT), whilst strains from Kurlan and Mullovka sites ULR are similar to strains from the Trans-Kama area of the RT. It was also found that Barysh ULR strains form a separate distinct group phylogenetically equidistant from Varaksino and Kurlan−Mullovka groups. The identified groups of strains can be considered as separate sub-lineages in the PUUV Russian genetic lineage. In addition, the genomes of the strains from the UR, most likely, were formed as a result of reassortment.","['Kabwe E', 'Al Sheikh W', 'Shamsutdinov AF', 'Ismagilova RK', 'Martynova EV', 'Ohlopkova OV', 'Yurchenko YA', 'Savitskaya TA', 'Isaeva GS', 'Khaiboullina SF', 'Rizvanov AA', 'Morzunov SP', 'Davidyuk YN']",2022,7,3,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Kabwe E, et al.

35294259,Human antibody recognizing a quaternary epitope in the Puumala virus glycoprotein provides broad protection against orthohantaviruses.,"The rodent-borne hantavirus Puumala virus (PUUV) and related agents cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Other hantaviruses, including Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus, cause a distinct zoonotic disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Although these infections are severe and have substantial case fatality rates, no FDA-approved hantavirus countermeasures are available. Recent work suggests that monoclonal antibodies may have therapeutic utility. We describe here the isolation of human neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against tetrameric Gn/Gc glycoprotein spikes from PUUV-experienced donors. We define a dominant class of nAbs recognizing the ""capping loop"" of Gn that masks the hydrophobic fusion loops in Gc. A subset of nAbs in this class, including ADI-42898, bound Gn/Gc complexes but not Gn alone, strongly suggesting that they recognize a quaternary epitope encompassing both Gn and Gc. ADI-42898 blocked the cell entry of seven HCPS- and HFRS-associated hantaviruses, and single doses of this nAb could protect Syrian hamsters and bank voles challenged with the highly virulent HCPS-causing ANDV and HFRS-causing PUUV, respectively. ADI-42898 is a promising candidate for clinical development as a countermeasure for both HCPS and HFRS, and its mode of Gn/Gc recognition informs the development of broadly protective hantavirus vaccines.","['Mittler E', 'Wec AZ', 'Tynell J', 'Guardado-Calvo P', 'Wigren-Byström J', 'Polanco LC', ""O'Brien CM"", 'Slough MM', 'Abelson DM', 'Serris A', 'Sakharkar M', 'Pehau-Arnaudet G', 'Bakken RR', 'Geoghegan JC', 'Jangra RK', 'Keller M', 'Zeitlin L', 'Vapalahti O', 'Ulrich RG', 'Bornholdt ZA', 'Ahlm C', 'Rey FA', 'Dye JM', 'Bradfute SB', 'Strandin T', 'Herbert AS', 'Forsell MNE', 'Walker LM', 'Chandran K']",2022,14,636,Sci Transl Med,"Mittler E, et al.

35293969,Comparison of Electronic Frailty Metrics for Prediction of Adverse Outcomes of Abdominal Surgery.,"IMPORTANCE: Electronic frailty metrics have been developed for automated frailty assessment and include the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), the Electronic Frailty Index (eFI), the 5-Factor Modified Frailty Index (mFI-5), and the Risk Analysis Index (RAI). Despite substantial differences in their construction, these 4 electronic frailty metrics have not been rigorously compared within a surgical population.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between 4 electronic frailty metrics and to measure their predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from patients who underwent abdominal surgery from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, at 20 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants included adults older than 50 years who underwent abdominal surgical procedures at KPNC from 2010 to 2020 that were sampled for reporting to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pearson correlation coefficients between electronic frailty metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of univariate models and multivariate preoperative risk models for 30-day mortality, readmission, and morbidity, which was defined as a composite of mortality and major postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Within the cohort of 37 186 patients, mean (SD) age, 67.9 (female, 19 127 [51.4%]), correlations between pairs of metrics ranged from 0.19 (95% CI, 0.18- 0.20) for mFI-5 and RAI 0.69 (95% CI, 0.68-0.70). Only 1085 of 37 186 (2.9%) were classified as frail based on all 4 metrics. In univariate models for morbidity, HFRS demonstrated higher predictive discrimination (AUROC, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.70-0.72) than eFI (AUROC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65), mFI-5 (AUROC, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.57-0.59), and RAI (AUROC, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.57-0.58). The predictive discrimination of multivariate models with age, sex, comorbidity burden, and procedure characteristics for all 3 adverse surgical outcomes improved by including HFRS into the models.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the 4 electronic frailty metrics demonstrated heterogeneous correlation and classified distinct groups of surgical patients as frail. However, HFRS demonstrated the highest predictive value for adverse surgical outcomes.","['Le ST', 'Liu VX', 'Kipnis P', 'Zhang J', 'Peng PD', 'Cespedes Feliciano EM']",2022,157,5,JAMA Surg,"Le ST, et al.

35292571,Higher Hospital Frailty Risk Score is associated with increased complications and healthcare resource utilization after endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms.,"AIM: To use the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) to investigate the impact of frailty on complication rates and healthcare resource utilization in patients who underwent endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample database. All adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing endovascular treatment for IAs after subarachnoid hemorrhage were identified using ICD-10-CM codes. Patients were categorized into frailty cohorts: low (HFRS <5), intermediate (HFRS 5-15) and high (HFRS >15). Patient demographics, adverse events, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and total cost of admission were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of prolonged LOS, increased cost, and non-routine discharge.
RESULTS: Of the 33 840 patients identified, 7940 (23.5%) were found to be low, 20 075 (59.3%) intermediate and 5825 (17.2%) high frailty by HFRS criteria. The rate of encountering any adverse event was significantly greater in the higher frailty cohorts (low: 59.9%; intermediate: 92.4%; high: 99.2%, p<0.001). There was a stepwise increase in mean LOS (low: 11.7±8.2 days; intermediate: 18.7±14.1 days; high: 26.6±20.1 days, p<0.001), mean total hospital cost (low: $62 888±37 757; intermediate: $99 670±63 446; high: $134 937±80 331, p<0.001), and non-routine discharge (low: 17.3%; intermediate: 44.4%; high: 69.4%, p<0.001) with increasing frailty. On multivariate regression analysis, a similar stepwise impact was found in prolonged LOS (intermediate: OR 2.38, p<0.001; high: OR 4.49, p<0.001)], total hospital cost (intermediate: OR 2.15, p<0.001; high: OR 3.62, p<0.001), and non-routine discharge (intermediate: OR 2.13, p<0.001; high: OR 4.17, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that greater frailty as defined by the HFRS was associated with increased complications, LOS, total costs, and non-routine discharge.","['Koo AB', 'Elsamadicy AA', 'Renedo D', 'Sarkozy M', 'Sherman J', 'Reeves BC', 'Havlik J', 'Antonios J', 'Sujijantarat N', 'Hebert R', 'Malhotra A', 'Matouk C']",2023,15,3,J Neurointerv Surg,"Koo AB, et al.

35271898,Historical record of legacy and alternative halogenated flame retardants in dated sediment from a highly industrialized saltwater lake in Korea.,"Legacy and alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs), and dechlorane plus (DP), were measured in dated sediments from a highly industrialized lake in Korea. All HFRs were detected in almost all of the sediment depth layers for more than 70 years, indicating a history of long-term contamination. Similar historical trends in PBDEs, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), and DP were observed in dated sediments, whereas decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-octabromo-1,3,3-trimethyl-1-phenylindane (OBIND) concentrations sharply increased since the 1990s. Moreover, the concentration ratios of DBDPE/BDE 209 increased from the early 1990s to the present. Our findings suggest that DBDPE and OBIND have been used as HFR alternatives. The historical record of the concentrations and profiles of legacy and alternative HFRs corresponded with industrial activities, consumption of FRs, and coastal development activities. Inventories of legacy and alternative HFRs were similar to those reported for highly industrialized regions around the globe.","['Lee HK', 'Bak G', 'Lim JE', 'Lee JW', 'Lee S', 'Moon HB']",2022,297,,Chemosphere,"Lee HK, et al.

Methods: We undertook a prospective, single centre outcome study of patients implanted with an HFRS-enabled Medtronic CIED, generating a “high risk” alert between November 2018 and November 2020. All patients generating a “high risk” HFRS alert were managed within an integrated HF pathway. Alerts were shared with local HF teams, prompting patient contact and appropriate intervention. Outcome data on health care utilisation (HCU) and mortality were collected. A validated questionnaire was completed by the HF teams to obtain feedback. Results: 367 “High risk” alerts were noted in 188 patients. The mean patient age was 70 and 49% had a Charlson Comorbidity Score of >6. Mean number of alerts per patients was 1.95 and 44 (23%) of patients had >3 “high risk” alerts in the follow up period. Overall, 75 (39%) patients were hospitalised in the 4−6-week period of the alert; 53 (28%) were unplanned of which 24 (13%) were for decompensated HF. A total of 33 (18%) patients died in the study period. Having three or more alerts significantly increased the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 2.5, CI 1.1−5.6 p = 0.03). The feedback on the pathway was positive. Conclusions: Patients with “high risk” alerts are co-morbid and have significant HCU. An integrated approach can facilitate timely risk stratification and intervention. Intervention in these patients is not limited to HF alone and provides the opportunity for holistic management of this complex cohort.","['Garner D', 'Lunt L', 'Leung W', 'Llewellyn J', 'Kahn M', 'Wright DJ', 'Rao A']",2022,22,5,Sensors (Basel),"Garner D, et al.

35246062,Validating the agreement between the geriatric trauma frailty index and four published frailty scores in the Chinese geriatric trauma population.,"BACKGROUND: In the geriatric patient population, frailty significantly affects a patient's prognostic outcome. This study aimed to compare the consistency of our constructed geriatric trauma frailty index with previously published indexes.
METHODS: The geriatric trauma frailty index (GTFI) was compared with four previously published frailty indexes, i.e., the hospital frailty risk score (HFRS), Fried index, trauma-specific frailty index (TSFI), and 11-item modified frailty index (mFI) using the Bland-Altman method, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and kappa consistency test. The indexes were calculated based on data collected from 101 questionnaires and medical records from 101 geriatric trauma patients at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai.
RESULTS: Among the 101 geriatric trauma patients, 64 (63.4%) were women, with a mean age of 71.18 (SD = 9.89) years and mean length of stay (LOS) of 7.51 (SD = 3.89) days. The mean scores of GTFI score(≥ 1.3045 as frail), Fried index score(≥3 items as frail), TSFI score(≥ 4 as frail), and mFI (≥ 3 as frail),were 0.86 (SD = 1.51), 0.76 (SD = 1.07), 1.76 (SD = 1.96), and 1.29 (SD = 1.17). respectively. The GTFI score had good consistency with the HFRS (ICC: 0.716, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.596, 0.799, kappa: 0.608, 95% CI: 0.449, 0.766), fair consistency with the TSFI (ICC: 0.407, 95% CI: 0.227, 0.562, kappa: 0.460, 95% CI: 0.239, 0.672), and poor consistency with the mFI (ICC: 0.286, 95% CI: 0.097, 0.455, kappa: 0.305, 95% CI: 0.069, 0.525) and Fried index score (ICC: 0.256, 95% CI: 0.063, 0.426, kappa: 0.188, 95% CI: - 0.028, 0.408).
CONCLUSIONS: Different frailty indexes are based on different concepts of frailty and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable. There is still no gold standard for the current assessment methods of frailty, but it can be compared based on the understanding in terms of the concepts and measures used in each.","['Zhao F', 'Tang B', 'Liu X', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang L']",2022,22,1,BMC Geriatr,"Zhao F, et al.

35245549,Persistent organic pollutant exposures among Greenlandic adults in relation to lifestyle and diet: New data from the ACCEPT cohort.,"High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in blood of the Greenlandic population are well known. The exposure is mainly through traditional food intake, including marine mammals and seabirds. The present study aimed to follow up on POP concentrations (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs)) and relations to lifestyle and diet of the mothers included in the Greenlandic ACCEPT cohort (3-5 years after inclusion in 2013-15) and to include the children's fathers. This new data collection in 2019-20 included blood samples for measurement of POP concentrations and lifestyle and food frequency questionnaires from 101 mothers and 76 fathers aged 24-55 years living in Nuuk, Sisimiut, and Ilulissat, Greenland. The mothers' intra-individual median percentage decrease in POP concentrations from inclusion to this follow-up (3-5 years later) was 16-58%, except for mirex (0% change). Median concentrations of POPs were 1.4-4.6 times higher in fathers than in mothers. The POPs differed by residential town with generally higher concentrations in Ilulissat compared to Sisimiut and Nuuk. We report, for the first time, novel HFRs in human samples from Greenland. However, concentrations were low and only dechlorane plus (with its anti-isomer) was detected in >50% of the samples. Most POPs correlated positively with age and n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio. The lipophilic POPs correlated positively with the percentage of life lived in Greenland, whereas few POPs correlated positively with BMI, income (personal and household), education, and alcohol intake. The POPs generally associated positively with the intake of marine mammals, seabirds, and dried fish, while few POPs associated positively with Greenlandic fish intake. In contrast, POPs generally associated negatively with imported meat products intake. The study findings may be of interest for future dietary recommendations in Greenland. We discuss the potential explanations for the findings and suggestions for future research.","['Wielsøe M', 'Long M', 'Bossi R', 'Vorkamp K', 'Bonefeld-Jørgensen EC']",2022,827,,Sci Total Environ,"Wielsøe M, et al.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cohort study using a regional government administrative healthcare and long-term care (LTC) claims database in Japan 2014-18.
PARTICIPANTS: Plan enrollees aged ≥50 years.
METHODS: We applied the two algorithms to the cohort and assessed the scores' distributions alongside enrollees' 4-year mortality and initiation of government-supported LTC. Using Cox regression and Fine-Gray models, we evaluated the association between frailty scores and outcomes as well as the models' discriminatory ability.
RESULTS: Among 827,744 enrollees, 42.8% were categorised by eFI as fit, 31.2% mild, 17.5% moderate and 8.5% severe. For HFRS, 73.0% were low, 24.3% intermediate and 2.7% high risk; 35 of 36 predictors for eFI, and 92 of 109 codes originally used for HFRS were available in the Japanese system. Relative to the lowest frailty group, the highest frailty group had hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 2.09 (1.98-2.21) for mortality and 2.45 (2.28-2.63) for LTC for eFI; those for HFRS were 3.79 (3.56-4.03) and 3.31 (2.87-3.82), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for the unadjusted model at 48 months was 0.68 for death and 0.68 for LTC for eFI, and 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, for HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The frailty algorithms were applicable to the Japanese system and could contribute to the identifications of enrollees at risk of long-term mortality or LTC use.","['Nishimura S', 'Kumamaru H', 'Shoji S', 'Nakatani E', 'Yamamoto H', 'Ichihara N', 'Miyachi Y', 'Sandhu AT', 'Heidenreich PA', 'Yamauchi K', 'Watanabe M', 'Miyata H', 'Kohsaka S']",2022,51,3,Age Ageing,"Nishimura S, et al.

35184215,Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) indicated frailty is associated with increased in-hospital and 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The concept of frailty provides an age-independent, easy-to-use tool for risk stratification. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the efficacy of frailty tools in risk assessment in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: The protocol was registered (CRD42021241544). Studies reporting on frailty in COVID-19 patients were eligible. The main outcomes were mortality, length of hospital stay (LOH) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in frail and non-frail COVID-19 patients. Frailty was also compared in survivors and non-survivors. Five databases were searched up to 24th September 2021. The QUIPS tool was used for the risk of bias assessment. Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I
RESULTS: From 3640 records identified, 54 were included in the qualitative and 42 in the quantitative synthesis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used in 46 studies, the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) by 4, the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) by 3 and three studies used other scores. We found that patients with frailty (CFS 4-9 or HFRS ≥ 5) have a higher risk of mortality (CFS: OR: 3.12; CI 2.56-3.81; HFRS OR: 1.98; CI 1.89-2.07). Patients with frailty (CFS 4-9) were less likely to be admitted to ICU (OR 0.28, CI 0.12-0.64). Quantitative synthesis for LOH was not feasible. Most studies carried a high risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: As determined by CFS, frailty is strongly associated with mortality; hence, frailty-based patient management should be included in international COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

35157930,Habitat-dependent trophic transfer of legacy and emerging halogenated flame retardants in estuarine and coastal food webs near a source region.,"With the phase-out of legacy halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), such as decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), emerging ones, such as decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), are being widely produced. We conducted field campaigns to assess the trophic transfer of legacy and emerging HFRs in estuarine and coastal food webs of Laizhou Bay, which are located near the largest HFR manufacturing base in China. Seawater, sediment, plankton, invertebrates, and fish were collected from both sites. BDE-209 was the predominant compound in the estuary, whereas DBDPE was the main contributor to HFRs in the bay, followed by BDE-209. Invertebrates, especially bivalves and sea cucumbers, showed higher levels of BDE-209 and DBDPE than fish. The HFR levels in the organisms of the two coastal zones were comparable to each other, although their concentrations in the estuarine water were one order of magnitude higher than those in the bay. The HFR profiles in benthic organisms were similar to those in the sediments, indicating that the bioaccumulation of HFRs in coastal food webs depended on the habitat. The ΣHFR concentrations followed the order filter-feeding > carnivorous for invertebrates, and demersal non-migratory fish showed higher HFR levels than oceanodromous fish. The trophic magnification factors estimated for BDE-209, dechlorane plus, and DBDPE were lower than 1, suggesting biodilution potential in both food webs, whereas several PBDE congeners exhibited biomagnification capacity. Feeding habits, habitats, hydrophobicity, bioavailability, and metabolism may be the main factors impacting the bioaccumulation of HFRs in organisms in estuarine-coastal ecosystems of northern China.","['Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Ji C', 'Xiao P', 'Tang J']",2022,300,,Environ Pollut,"Li Y, et al.

35148505,Hospital Frailty Risk Score and healthcare resource utilization after surgery for metastatic spinal column tumors.,"OBJECTIVE: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) was developed utilizing ICD-10 diagnostic codes to identify frailty and predict adverse outcomes in large national databases. While other studies have examined frailty in spine oncology, the HFRS has not been assessed in this patient population. The aim of this study was to examine the association of HFRS-defined frailty with complication rates, length of stay (LOS), total cost of hospital admission, and discharge disposition in patients undergoing spine surgery for metastatic spinal column tumors.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the years 2016 to 2019 of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) undergoing surgical intervention for metastatic spinal column tumors were identified using the ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes and Procedural Coding System. Patients were categorized into the following three cohorts based on their HFRS: low frailty (HFRS < 5), intermediate frailty (HFRS 5-15), and high frailty (HFRS > 15). Patient demographics, comorbidities, treatment modality, perioperative complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and total cost of hospital admission were assessed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of prolonged LOS, nonroutine discharge, and increased cost.
RESULTS: Of the 11,480 patients identified, 7085 (61.7%) were found to have low frailty, 4160 (36.2%) had intermediate frailty, and 235 (2.0%) had high frailty according to HFRS criteria. On average, age increased along with progressively worsening frailty scores (p ≤ 0.001). The proportion of patients in each cohort who experienced ≥ 1 postoperative complication significantly increased along with increasing frailty (low frailty: 29.2%; intermediate frailty: 53.8%; high frailty: 76.6%; p < 0.001). In addition, the mean LOS (low frailty: 7.9 ± 5.0 days; intermediate frailty: 14.4 ± 13.4 days; high frailty: 24.1 ± 18.6 days; p < 0.001), rate of nonroutine discharge (low frailty: 40.4%; intermediate frailty: 60.6%; high frailty: 70.2%; p < 0.001), and mean total cost of hospital admission (low frailty: $48,603 ± $29,979; intermediate frailty: $65,271 ± $43,110; high frailty: $96,116 ± $60,815; p < 0.001) each increased along with progressing frailty. On multivariate regression analysis, intermediate and high frailty were each found to be significant predictors of both prolonged LOS (intermediate: OR 3.75 [95% CI 2.96-4.75], p < 0.001; high: OR 7.33 [95% CI 3.47-15.51]; p < 0.001) and nonroutine discharge (intermediate: OR 2.05 [95% CI 1.68-2.51], p < 0.001; high: OR 5.06 [95% CI 1.93-13.30], p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use the HFRS to assess the impact of frailty on perioperative outcomes in patients with metastatic bony spinal tumors. Among patients with metastatic bony spinal tumors, frailty assessed using the HFRS was associated with longer hospitalizations, more nonroutine discharges, and higher total hospital costs.","['Elsamadicy AA', 'Koo AB', 'Reeves BC', 'Pennington Z', 'Yu J', 'Goodwin CR', 'Kolb L', 'Laurans M', 'Lo SL', 'Shin JH', 'Sciubba DM']",2022,,,J Neurosurg Spine,"Elsamadicy AA, et al.

35145824,A Case of Oral Glomeruloid Hemangioma Without Systemic Conditions.,"Glomeruloid hemangioma is a rare variant of hemangioma that is accompanied by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin abnormalities (POEMS) syndrome and, rarely, by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome. This report presents the case of a 78-year-old male who presented with a hemorrhagic nodule on the tongue without any other systemic diseases. Microscopically, the lesion was a lobular proliferation extending from the lamina propria to muscular tissue. Some intravascular nodules with irregular vascular lumens closely resembled renal glomeruli. Each nodule consisted of plump endothelial and stromal cells that partially showed vacuolated cytoplasm containing eosinophilic and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive globules. Immunohistochemically, IgG-positive deposition was noted within CD31-positive cells. Many plump stromal cells were positive for CD31, CD146, nestin, and type IV collagen but not α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). These results reflect the proliferation of immature endothelial cells and pericytes, which might characterize this unique lesion. Microscopically, this case revealed glomeruloid hemangioma without systemic conditions related to POEMS, and composed of an intravascular proliferation of immature endothelial and pericytic stromal cells.","['Roy RR', 'Shimada K', 'Hasegawa H']",2022,14,1,Cureus,"Roy RR, et al.

35118091,Hantavirus Induced Kidney Disease.,"Hantavirus induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging viral zoonosis affecting up to 200,000 humans annually worldwide. This review article is focused on recent advances in the mechanism, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hantavirus induced HFRS. The importance of interactions between viral and host factors in the design of therapeutic strategies is discussed. Hantavirus induced HFRS is characterized by thrombocytopenia and proteinuria of varying severities. The mechanism of kidney injury appears immunopathological with characteristic deterioration of endothelial cell function and compromised barrier functions of the vasculature. Although multidisciplinary research efforts have provided insights about the loss of cellular contact in the endothelium leading to increased permeability, the details of the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The epidemiology of hantavirus induced renal failure is associated with viral species and the geographical location of the natural host of the virus. The development of vaccine and antiviral therapeutics is necessary to avoid potentially severe outbreaks of this zoonotic illness in the future. The recent groundbreaking approach to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine has revolutionized the general field of vaccinology and has provided new directions for the use of this promising platform for widespread vaccine development, including the development of hantavirus mRNA vaccine. The combinational therapies specifically targeted to inhibit hantavirus replication and vascular permeability in infected patients will likely improve the disease outcome.",['Mir S'],2021,8,,Front Med (Lausanne),Mir S.

35107591,Frailty in elderly patients with acute appendicitis.,"PURPOSE: Acute appendicitis in the elderly is becoming increasingly recognized for its often severe course. For various elective and urgent operations in older patients, frailty is a risk factor for poor outcomes. However, there is a lack of data on frailty in elderly patients with acute appendicitis.
METHODS: Patients over 65 years old who underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in three hospitals between January 2015 and September 2020 were assessed with the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the modified Frailty Index (mFI). Outcomes of interest, including morbidity, mortality, and length of stay, were recorded.
RESULTS: While frailty can be measured with both tests, the mFI has better applicability and takes significantly less time to implement compared to the HFRS (21.6 s vs. 80.3 s, p < 0.0001) while providing the same information value. Patients who exhibited frailty according to either assessment had a significantly higher rate of milder (OR 5.85/2.87, p < 0.0001/0.009) and serious (OR 4.92/3.61, p < 0.011/0.029) complications, more admissions to the intensive care unit (OR 5.16/7.36, p < 0.0001), and an almost doubled length of stay (12.7 days vs. 6.6 days, p < 0.005). Up to 31% of these patients required institutional care after discharge, which is significantly more than those without frailty (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the mortality rate in frail patients was significantly elevated to 17%, compared to less than 1% in non-frail patients (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: In elderly patients, frailty is a significant risk factor for negative outcomes. Frailty can be assessed more quickly and reliably with the mFI compared to the HFRS.","['Reinisch A', 'Reichert M', 'Ondo Meva CC', 'Padberg W', 'Ulrich F', 'Liese J']",2022,48,4,Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,"Reinisch A, et al.

35080673,Industrial Production of Organophosphate Flame Retardants (OPFRs): Big Knowledge Gaps Need to Be Filled?,"Since the phase-out of traditional halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), interests of research are gradually being shifted to organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), and this can be reflected by the increasing number of publications on OPFRs year by year. Here, an extensive survey is conducted in an attempt to generate a list of OPFRs that are being produced in factories, and to investigate the annual production volume (APV). This survey suggests that at least n = 56 OPFR monomers and n = 62 OPFR mixtures are being currently produced in 367 factories around the world, and 201 out of them are in Mainland China. APV of OPFRs was estimated as 598,422 metric tons, and this number could be underestimated due to the limitation of available information. We also notice that current researches are confined to a limited number of OPFRs, especially for OP esters (OPEs), and other OPFRs with different structures from OPEs has been rarely studied. Based on all the collected datasets, we provide five recommendations for how to proceed with future research to more comprehensively understand the currently-produced OPFRs in the environment.","['Huang J', 'Ye L', 'Fang M', 'Su G']",2022,108,5,Bull Environ Contam Toxicol,"Huang J, et al.

35063325,Impact of multimorbidity and frailty on adverse outcomes among older delayed discharge patients: Implications for healthcare policy.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impacts of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and frailty on 30-day post-discharge readmission and mortality among older patients with delayed discharge.
DATA SOURCE/EXTRACTION: We used a retrospective cohort of older patients in the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) between 2004 and 2017 in Ontario, Canada. We extracted data on patients aged ≥ 65 who experienced delayed discharge during hospitalization (N = 353,106).
STUDY DESIGN: We measured MCC and frailty using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), respectively. We used multinomial logistic regression to model the main and interactive effects of MCC and frailty on the adverse outcomes.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After adjusting for sex, discharge destination, urban/rural residency, wait time for alternative care, and socioeconomic status, the coexistence of MCC and high frailty increased the relative risk of 30-day mortality and readmission when compared to the references group, i.e., non-MCC patients with low-to-moderate frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity and frailty each provide unique information about adverse outcomes among older patients with delayed discharge but are most informative when examined in unison.
IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: To minimize the risk of adverse outcomes among older delayed discharge patients, discharge planning must be tailored to their concurrent multimorbidity and frailty status.","['Ghazalbash S', 'Zargoush M', 'Mowbray F', 'Costa A']",2022,126,3,Health Policy,"Ghazalbash S, et al.

35062248,Severity Biomarkers in Puumala Hantavirus Infection.,"Annually, over 10,000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are diagnosed in Europe. Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes most of the European HFRS cases. PUUV causes usually a relatively mild disease, which is rarely fatal. However, the severity of the infection varies greatly, and factors affecting the severity are mostly unrevealed. Host genes are known to have an effect. The typical clinical features in PUUV infection include acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and increased vascular permeability. The primary target of hantavirus is the endothelium of the vessels of different organs. Although PUUV does not cause direct cytopathology of the endothelial cells, remarkable changes in both the barrier function of the endothelium and the function of the infected endothelial cells occur. Host immune or inflammatory mechanisms are probably important in the development of the capillary leakage. Several immunoinflammatory biomarkers have been studied in the context of assessing the severity of HFRS caused by PUUV. Most of them are not used in clinical practice, but the increasing knowledge about the biomarkers has elucidated the pathogenesis of PUUV infection.","['Outinen TK', 'Mäkelä S', 'Pörsti I', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen J']",2021,14,1,Viruses,"Outinen TK, et al.

The highest incidence rate is among zoonotic disease cases in Russia. Most cases of HFRS are reported in the Volga region of Russia, which commonly identifies the Puumala virus (PUUV) as a pathogen. HFRS management is especially challenging due to the lack of specific treatments and vaccines. This study aims to develop new approaches for HFRS prevention. Our goal is to test the efficacy of microvesicles (MVs) as PUUV nucleocapsid (N) and glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) delivery vehicles. Our findings show that MVs could deliver the PUUV N and Gn/Gc proteins in vitro. We have also demonstrated that MVs loaded with PUUV proteins could elicit a specific humoral and cellular immune response in vivo. These data suggest that an MV-based vaccine could control HFRS.","['Shkair L', 'Garanina EE', 'Martynova EV', 'Kolesnikova AI', 'Arkhipova SS', 'Titova AA', 'Rizvanov AA', 'Khaiboullina SF']",2022,14,1,Pharmaceutics,"Shkair L, et al.

35045122,Beyond the revised cardiac risk index: Validation of the hospital frailty risk score in non-cardiac surgery.,"Frailty is an established risk factor for adverse outcomes following non-cardiac surgery. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a recently described frailty assessment tool that harnesses administrative data and is composed of 109 International Classification of Disease variables. We aimed to examine the incremental prognostic utility of the HFRS in a generalizable surgical population. Using linked administrative databases, a retrospective cohort of patients admitted for non-cardiac surgery between October 1st, 2008 and September 30th, 2019 in Alberta, Canada was created. Our primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest at 30-days. Multivariable logistic regression was undertaken to assess the impact of HFRS on outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, components of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) and peri-operative biomarkers. The final cohort consisted of 712,808 non-cardiac surgeries, of which 55·1% were female and the average age was 53·4 +/- 22·4 years. Using the HFRS, 86.3% were considered low risk, 10·7% were considered intermediate risk and 3·1% were considered high risk for frailty. Intermediate and high HFRS scores were associated with increased risk of the primary outcome with an adjusted odds ratio of 1·61 (95% CI 1·50-1.74) and 1·55 (95% CI 1·38-1·73). Intermediate and high HFRS were also associated with increased adjusted odds of prolonged hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality. The HFRS is a minimally onerous frailty assessment tool that can complement perioperative risk stratification in identifying patients at high risk of short- and long-term adverse events.","['Gouda P', 'Wang X', 'Youngson E', 'McGillion M', 'Mamas MA', 'Graham MM']",2022,17,1,PLoS One,"Gouda P, et al.

35031495,Frailty in patients undergoing percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in older adults. Whether frailty predicts adverse outcomes after percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between frailty and clinical outcomes after percutaneous LAAC.
METHODS: We identified patients 65 years and older in Medicare fee-for-service claims who underwent LAAC between October 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019. Patients were identified as frail on the basis of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), a validated frailty measure centered on health resource utilization, with the cohort stratified into low (<5), intermediate (5-15), and high (>15) risk groups.
RESULTS: Of the 21,787 patients who underwent LAAC, 10,740 (49.3%) were considered frail (HFRS >5), including 3441 (15.8%) in the high-risk group. The mortality rate (up to 1095 days) were 16.1% in the low-risk group, 26.7% in the intermediate-risk group, and 41.1% in the high-risk group (P < .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, HFRS >15 (compared with HFRS <5) was associated with a higher risk of long hospital stay (odds ratio [OR] 8.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.94-11.57), 30-day readmission (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.58-2.05), 30-day mortality (OR 5.68, 95% CI 3.40-9.40), and 1-year mortality (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.39-3.35). In restricted cubic spline models, the adjusted OR for all outcomes monotonically increased with increasing HFRS.

34989483,Epidemiological study on the incidence of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in five Western Balkan countries for a 10-year period: 2006-2015.,"BACKGROUND: Large-scale epidemics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been reported mostly in Asia and Europe, with around 100,000 people affected each year. In the Southeast Europe, Balkan region, HFRS is endemic disease with approximately 100 cases per year. Our aim was to describe epidemiological characteristics of HFRS in five Western Balkan (WB) countries and to describe correlation between HFRS incidence and major meteorological event that hit the area in May 2014.
METHODS: National surveillance data of HFRS from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia obtained from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2015 were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: In a 10-year period, a total of 1,065 HFRS patients were reported in five WB countries. Cumulative incidence rate ranged from 0.05 to 15.80 per 100.000 inhabitants (in North Macedonia and Montenegro respectively). Increasing number of HFRS cases was reported with a peak incidence in three specific years (2008, 2012, and 2014). Average incidence for the entire area was higher in males than females (5.63 and 1.90 per 100.000 inhabitants respectively). Summer was the season with the highest number of cases and an average incidence rate of 1.74/100.000 inhabitants across 10-year period. Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence was significantly increased (7.91/100.000 inhabitants) in 2014, when a few months earlier, severe floods affected several WB countries. A strong significant negative correlation (r = -.84, p < .01) between the monthly incidence of HFRS and the number of months after May's floods was demonstrated for the total area of WB.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the HFRS incidence had similar distribution (general, age, sex and seasonality) across majority of the included countries. Summer was the season with the highest recorded incidence. Common epidemic years were detected in all observed countries as well as a negative correlation between the monthly incidence of HFRS and the number of months after May's cyclone.","['Štrbac M', 'Vuković V', 'Patić A', 'Medić S', 'Pustahija T', 'Petrović V', 'Lendak D', 'Ličina MK', 'Bakić M', 'Protić J', 'Pranjić N', 'Jandrić L', 'Sokolovska N', 'Ristić M']",2022,69,3,Zoonoses Public Health,"Štrbac M, et al.

Orthohantavirus is a genus of single-stranded, enveloped, negative-sense RNA viruses in the family Hantaviridae of the order Bunyavirales. The important reservoir of Hantaviruses is rodents. Each virus serotype has its unique rodent host species and is transmitted to human beings with the aid of aerosolized virus, which is shed in urine, faeces and saliva and hardly by a bite of the contaminated host. Andes virus is the only Hantavirus identified to be transmitted from human-to-human and its major signs and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, lungs filled with fluid, etc. In early 1993, this viral syndrome appeared in the Four Corner location in the southwestern United States. The only accepted therapeutics for this virus is Ribavirin. Recently, serological examinations to identify Hantavirus antibodies have become most popular for investigation among humans and rodent reservoirs.","['Ashique S', 'Sandhu NK', 'Das S', 'Haque SN', 'Koley K']",2022,22,3,Infect Disord Drug Targets,"Ashique S, et al.

34926978,N95 vs Half-face Respirator Wear in Surgical Trainees: Physiologic and Psychological Effects of Prolonged Use.,"OBJECTIVES: As specialists of the upper airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. N95 and half-face respirator (HFR) masks are commonly worn, each with advantages in functionality and comfort. In this study, physiologic and psychological parameters of prolonged N95 vs HFR wear were compared.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective crossover cohort study.
SETTING: Single academic tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: A prospective crossover cohort study was performed. Healthy otolaryngology trainees and medical students (N = 23) participated and wore N95 and HFR masks continuously for 3 hours each on separate days. Various measures were analyzed: vitals, spirometry variables, scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test-6), distress, and ""difficulty being understood.""
RESULTS: The average age was 26.3 years (SD, 3.42). There were no significant differences in vital signs and spirometry variables between N95 and HFR wear. N95 wear was associated with decreases in oxygen saturation of approximately 1.09% more than with HFRs (95% CI, 0.105-2.077). State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores increased more with HFR wear when compared with mean changes with N95 wear (95% CI, 1.350-8.741). There were no significant differences in HIT-6 scores or distress levels between masks. The proportions of participants reporting difficulty being understood was significantly higher with HFRs.
CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen saturation decreases with prolonged N95 wear, but anxiety and difficulty being understood are greater with HFR wear. Although HFRs have less resistance to gas exchange, N95 respirators may produce less anxiety and distress in clinical situations. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical significance of these differences.

34871302,Dissection of the NKG2C NK cell response against Puumala Orthohantavirus.,"BACKGROUND: Infections with the Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) in humans may cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), known as nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is associated with acute renal failure in severe cases. In response to PUUV-infections, a subset of potent antiviral NKG2C+ NK cells expand, whose role in virus defence and pathogenesis of NE is unclear. NKG2C+ NK cell proliferation is mediated by binding of NKG2C/CD94 to HLA-E on infected cells. The proliferation and activation of NKG2C+ NK cells via the NKG2C/HLA-E axis is affected by different NKG2C (NKG2Cwt/del) and HLA-E (HLA-E*0101/0103) alleles, which naturally occur in the human host. Homozygous (NKG2Cdel/del) and heterozygous (NKG2Cwt/del) deletions of the NKG2C receptor results in an impaired NKG2C/CD94 mediated proliferation and activation of NKG2C+ cells. We therefore analyzed the PUUV-mediated NKG2C+ NK cell responses and the impact of different NKG2C and HLA-E alleles in NE patients.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NKG2C+ NK cell expansion and effector functions in PUUV-infected cells were investigated using flow cytometry and it was shown that PUUV-infected endothelial cells led to a NKG2C/CD94 mediated NKG2C+ NK cell activation and expansion, dependent on the HLA-G-mediated upregulation of HLA-E. Furthermore, the NKG2Cdel and HLA-E*0101/0103 alleles were determined in 130 NE patients and 130 matched controls, and it was shown that in NE patients the NKG2Cwt/del allele was significantly overrepresented, compared to the NKG2Cwt/wt variant (p = 0.01). In addition, in vitro analysis revealed that NKG2Cwt/del NK cells exhibited on overall a lower proliferation (p = 0.002) and lower IFNγ expression (p = 0.004) than NKG2Cwt/wt NK cells.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results corroborate the substantial impact of the NKG2C/HLA-E axis on PUUV-specific NK cell responses. A weak NKG2C+ NK cell response, as reflected by NKG2Cwt/del variant, may be associated with a higher risk for a severe hantavirus infections.","['Vietzen H', 'Hartenberger S', 'Aberle SW', 'Puchhammer-Stöckl E']",2021,15,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Vietzen H, et al.

34869938,The menopause after cancer study (MACS) - A multimodal technology assisted intervention for the management of menopausal symptoms after cancer - Trial protocol of a phase II study.,"AIMS: This study will aim to assess if a composite intervention which involves a specific evidence-based intervention for management of insomnia and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy to manage vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause can improve quality of life for patients experiencing troublesome VMS after cancer who are not eligible for standard systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Participants will be asked to nominate a partner or companion to support them during this process as an additional form of support.
BACKGROUND: The menopause transition and its symptoms represent a significant challenge for many patients after cancer treatment, particularly those for whom conventional MHT is contraindicated. These symptoms include hot flushes, night sweats, urogenital symptoms as well as mood and sleep disturbance. These symptoms can exacerbate the consequences of cancer and its treatment.
METHODS: We will recruit 205 women who meet inclusion criteria and enrol them on a composite intervention which consists of four parts: (1) use of non-hormonal pharmacotherapy for the management of troublesome vasomotor symptoms of menopause tailored to the timing of predominant symptoms, (2) digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia through the web based Sleepio service, (3) access to information regarding self-management strategies for the common symptoms of menopause and their consequences and (4) identification of a partner or other support person who commits to providing support during the study period.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be cancer specific quality of life measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30). Secondary outcomes will include sleep quality, bother/interference of vasomotor symptoms and communication between couples about their cancer diagnosis and their menopause experience. Sleep will be measured using the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) tool, bother/interference of vasomotor symptoms will be measured by the Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS) and communication will be measured using the Couples' Illness Communication Scale (CICS). These validated scales will be administered at baseline, four weeks, three months and six months.

METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of eosinophilia (defined as an eosinophil count above 500 cells/mm
RESULTS: Among 387 patients hospitalized for HFRS, 98 (25.3%) had eosinophilia. By univariate analysis, eosinophilia was significantly associated with more severe thrombocytopenia, high C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count and neutrophil count and lower nephrotoxic drug intake. As there was a collinearity between white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, only C-reactive protein level with platelet count and nephrotoxic drug intake were entered in the multivariable analysis. Elevated C-reactive protein concentrations remained independently associated with eosinophilia.
CONCLUSION: Eosinophilia during HFRS affects one quarter of patients, and supports the role of eosinophils in antiviral immunity against hantavirus infection.","['Bermejo M', 'Mestrallet S', 'Servettaz A', 'Pannet LA', 'Lebrun D', ""N'Guyen Y"", 'Andreoletti L', 'Reynes JM', 'Hentzien M', 'Bani-Sadr F']",2022,54,4,Infect Dis (Lond),"Bermejo M, et al.

34710791,High frequency residues: A new set of signals for detectability studies of an X-ray imaging system.,"A new set of signals for studying detectability of an X-ray imaging system is presented. The results obtained with these signals are intended to complement the NEQ results. The signals are generated from line spread profiles by progressively removing their lower frequency components and the resulting high frequency residues (HFRs) form the set of signals to be used in detectability studies. Detectability indexes for these HFRs are obtained using a non-prewhitening (NPW) observer and a series of edge images are used to obtain the HFRs, the covariance matrices required by the NPW model and the MTF and NPS used in NEQ calculations. The template used in the model is obtained by simulating the processes of blurring and sampling of the edge images. Comparison between detectability indexes for the HFRs and NEQ are carried out for different acquisition techniques using different beam qualities and doses. The relative sensitivity shown by detectability indexes using HFRs is higher than that of NEQ, especially at lower doses. Also, the different observers produce different results at high doses: while the ideal Bayesian observer used by NEQ distinguishes between beam qualities, the NPW used with the HFRs produces no differences between them. Delta functions used in HFR are the opposite of complex exponential functions in terms of their support in the spatial and frequency domains. Since NEQ can be interpreted as detectability of these complex exponential functions, detectability of HFRs is presented as a natural complement to NEQ in the performance assessment of an imaging system.",['González-López A'],2021,91,,Phys Med,González-López A.

34653923,Hospital Frailty Risk Score predicts adverse events in older patients with hip fractures after surgery: Analysis of a nationwide inpatient database in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty may predict adverse events in patients with hip fractures. This study aimed to investigate the association between frailty and adverse events in patients with hip fractures after surgery using information from Japanese health insurance.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with hip fractures aged ≥ 65 years using a nationwide database in Japan. We examined the relationship of the frailty risk, which was defined using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), with in-hospital mortality, complications such as delirium and pneumonia, and functional outcomes. We used descriptive analysis, logistic regression, and linear regression analysis to estimate the association between the HFRS and outcomes in patients with hip fracture.
RESULTS: We analysed data from 36,192 patients with hip fractures after surgery (mean age: 83.6 ± 6.7 years, female: 79.5%). The proportions of low, intermediate, and high risk of frailty were 68.4%, 28.1%, and 3.5%, respectively. The frailty risk was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (intermediate risk: odds ratio [OR] 1.385, P < 0.001; high risk: OR 1.572; P < 0.001) and the occurrence of complications. Furthermore, each frailty risk was negatively associated with the Barthel Index score at discharge (intermediate risk: coefficient -11.919, P < 0.001; high risk: coefficient -18.044; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The HFRS could predict adverse events, including in-hospital mortality, in Japanese older patients with hip fractures.

34653656,Association between haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and cancers.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk of haematologic and solid organ malignancies in patients with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) compared with the general population.
METHODS: This propensity-score-matched cohort study was conducted using data collected from the Korean national health insurance service (NHIS) between January 2003 and December 2017. The HFRS cohort included 5888 newly diagnosed cases of HFRS, and 412,804 general participants from the NHIS database were included as the control cohort. The incidence rate of malignancies was assessed and compared between the HFRS and control cohorts.
RESULTS: There were 64 cases of haematologic malignancy in 236,286 person-years of observation, and 1245 cases of solid organ cancer in 209,333 person-years. The risks of haematologic malignancy and solid organ cancer were significantly higher in the HFRS cohort [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-7.14] than the control cohort [aHR 2.97, 95% CI 2.60-3.38). In subgroup analysis, the HFRS cohort was associated with high hazard ratios for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The HFRS cohort also had increased aHRs for all types of solid organ cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HFRS are at increased risk of both haematologic and solid organ malignancies compared with the general population, and this increased proportionally over time.

HLH can occur in patients with underlying rheumatic or autoinflammatory disorders. Additionally, HLH can develop in patients during infections or malignancies without a known genetic predisposition.
CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a patient, who presented with fever, both acute kidney and liver injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia and HSV stomatitis. HLH was diagnosed based on clinical criteria and qPCR revealed an acute parvovirus B19 infection as potential underlying infectious trigger. Treatment was started with both IVIG and dexamethasone. Subsequently, kidney biopsy demonstrated TMA.
CONCLUSIONS: In rare cases both HLH and aHUS can occur simultaneously in a patient as a consequence of viral infections. Insights from this unusual case might help physicians understand this complex symptom constellation.","['Steffen CJ', 'Koch N', 'Eckardt KU', 'Amann K', 'Seelow E', 'Schreiber A']",2021,22,1,BMC Nephrol,"Steffen CJ, et al.

34619188,Formal waste treatment facilities as a source of halogenated flame retardants and organophosphate esters to the environment: A critical review with particular focus on outdoor air and soil.,"Extensive use of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and organophosphate esters (OPEs) has generated great concern about their adverse effects on environmental and ecological safety and human health. As well as emissions during use of products containing such chemicals, there are mounting concerns over emissions when such products reach the waste stream. Here, we review the available data on contamination with HFRs and OPEs arising from formal waste treatment facilities (including but not limited to e-waste recycling, landfill, and incinerators). Evidence of the transfer of HFRs and OPEs from products to the environment shows that it occurs via mechanisms such as: volatilisation, abrasion, and leaching. Higher contaminant vapour pressure, increased temperature, and elevated concentrations of HFRs and OPEs in products contribute greatly to their emissions to air, with highest emission rates usually observed in the early stages of test chamber experiments. Abrasion of particles and fibres from products is ubiquitous and likely to contribute to elevated FR concentrations in soil. Leaching to aqueous media of brominated FRs (BFRs) is likely to be a second-order process, with elevated dissolved humic matter and temperature of leaching fluids likely to facilitate such emissions. However, leaching characteristics of OPEs are less well-understood and require further investigation. Data on the occurrence of HFRs and OPEs in outdoor air and soil in the vicinity of formal e-waste treatment facilities suggests such facilities exert a considerable impact. Waste dumpsites and landfills constitute a potential source of HFRs and OPEs to soil, and improper management of waste disposal might also contribute to HFR contamination in ambient air. Current evidence suggests minimal impact of waste incineration plants on BFR contamination in outdoor air and soil, but further investigation is required to confirm this.","['Ma Y', 'Stubbings WA', 'Abdallah MA', 'Cline-Cole R', 'Harrad S']",2022,807,Pt 1,Sci Total Environ,"Ma Y, et al.

34601572,Remote monitoring data from cardiac implantable electronic devices predicts all-cause mortality.,"AIMS: To determine if remotely monitored physiological data from cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can be used to identify patients at high risk of mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study evaluated whether a risk score based on CIED physiological data (Triage-Heart Failure Risk Status, 'Triage-HFRS', previously validated to predict heart failure (HF) events) can identify patients at high risk of death. Four hundred and thirty-nine adults with CIEDs were prospectively enrolled. Primary observed outcome was all-cause mortality (median follow-up: 702 days). Several physiological parameters [including heart rate profile, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia (AF/AT) burden, ventricular rate during AT/AF, physical activity, thoracic impedance, therapies for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation] were continuously monitored by CIEDs and dynamically combined to produce a Triage-HFRS every 24 h. According to transmissions patients were categorized into 'high-risk' or 'never high-risk' groups. During follow-up, 285 patients (65%) had a high-risk episode and 60 patients (14%) died (50 in high-risk group; 10 in never high-risk group). Significantly more cardiovascular deaths were observed in the high-risk group, with mortality rates across groups of high vs. never-high 10.3% vs. <4.0%; P = 0.03. Experiencing any high-risk episode was associated with a substantially increased risk of death [odds ratio (OR): 3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.57-6.58, P = 0.002]. Furthermore, each high-risk episode ≥14 consecutive days was associated with increased odds of death (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06-1.48; P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring data from CIEDs can be used to identify patients at higher risk of all-cause mortality as well as HF events. Distinct from other prognostic scores, this approach is automated and continuously updated.","['Ahmed FZ', 'Sammut-Powell C', 'Kwok CS', 'Tay T', 'Motwani M', 'Martin GP', 'Taylor JK']",2022,24,2,Europace,"Ahmed FZ, et al.

However, so far, there is rarely available research about the potential role of ABO blood types in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) infection. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between ABO blood types and the development of HFRS infection in Qingdao, China. We carried out a retrospective study enrolling 116 HFRS patients as the case group and 373 healthy subjects as the control group. ABO blood type distribution was analysed using the Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Results showed that the distribution of ABO blood types between the two groups was significantly different (","['Li J', 'Song X', 'Bu X', 'Wan Y']",2021,149,,Epidemiol Infect,"Li J, et al.

The presence of Hantaan virus (HTNV) RNA or infectious particles in urine specimens of patient with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) remains to be investigated.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected four urine and serum specimens of Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) patients with HFRS. We performed multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) to obtain the genome sequences of clinical HTNV in urine specimens containing ultra-low amounts of viral genomes. The epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses of HTNV demonstrated geographically homogenous clustering with those in Apodemus agrarius captured in highly endemic areas, indicating that phylogeographic tracing of HTNV genomes reveals the potential infection sites of patients with HFRS. Genetic exchange analyses showed a genetic configuration compatible with HTNV L segment exchange in nature.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that whole or partial genome sequences of HTNV from the urine enabled to track the putative infection sites of patients with HFRS by phylogeographically linking to the zoonotic HTNV from the reservoir host captured at endemic regions. This report raises awareness among physicians for the presence of HTNV in the urine of patients with HFRS.","['Cho S', 'Kim WK', 'No JS', 'Lee SH', 'Jung J', 'Yi Y', 'Park HC', 'Lee GY', 'Park K', 'Kim JA', 'Kim J', 'Lee J', 'Lee D', 'Song DH', 'Gu SH', 'Jeong ST', 'Song JW']",2021,15,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Cho S, et al.

34538265,"Impact of interventions on the incidence of natural focal diseases during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, China.","BACKGROUND: During the period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, strong intervention measures, such as lockdown, travel restriction, and suspension of work and production, may have curbed the spread of other infectious diseases, including natural focal diseases. In this study, we aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 prevention and control measures on the reported incidence of natural focal diseases (brucellosis, malaria, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], dengue, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], rabies, tsutsugamushi and Japanese encephalitis [JE]).
METHODS: The data on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases and natural focal disease cases were collected from Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Jiangsu Provincial CDC). We described and compared the difference between the incidence in 2020 and the incidence in 2015-2019 in four aspects: trend in reported incidence, age, sex, and urban and rural distribution. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)
RESULTS: Natural focal diseases in Jiangsu Province showed a long-term seasonal trend. The reported incidence of natural focal diseases, malaria and dengue in 2020 was lower than the predicted incidence, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The reported incidence of brucellosis in July, August, October and November 2020, and SFTS in May to November 2020 was higher than that in the same period in the previous 4 years (P < 0.05). The reported incidence of malaria in April to December 2020, HFRS in March, May and December 2020, and dengue in July to November 2020 was lower than that in the same period in the previous 4 years (P < 0.05). In males, the reported incidence of malaria in 2020 was lower than that in the previous 4 years, and the reported incidence of dengue in 2020 was lower than that in 2017-2019. The reported incidence of malaria in the 20-60-year age group was lower than that in the previous 4 years; the reported incidence of dengue in the 40-60-year age group was lower than that in 2016-2018. The reported cases of malaria in both urban and rural areas were lower than in the previous 4 years. The DID of brucellosis and SFTS in 2020 was shorter than that in 2015-2018; the DID of tsutsugamushi in 2020 was shorter than that in the previous 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions for COVID-19 may help control the epidemics of natural focal diseases in Jiangsu Province. The reported incidence of natural focal diseases, especially malaria and dengue, decreased during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. COVID-19 prevention and control measures had the greatest impact on the reported incidence of natural focal diseases in males and people in the 20-60-year age group.","['Cheng X', 'Hu J', 'Luo L', 'Zhao Z', 'Zhang N', 'Hannah MN', 'Rui J', 'Lin S', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Yang M', 'Xu J', 'Liu X', 'Yang T', 'Liu W', 'Li P', 'Deng B', 'Li Z', 'Liu C', 'Huang J', 'Peng Z', 'Bao C', 'Chen T']",2021,14,1,Parasit Vectors,"Cheng X, et al.

34515290,Evidence for Human-to-Human Transmission of Hantavirus: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus is known to be transmitted from rodents to humans. However, some reports from Argentina and Chile have claimed that the hantavirus strain Andes virus (ANDV) can cause human-to-human transmission of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for human-to-human transmission of hantavirus.
METHODS: We searched PubMed (inception to 28 February 2021), Cochrane Central, Embase, LILACS and SciELO (inception to 3 July 2020), and other sources. We included studies that assessed whether interpersonal contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed hantavirus infection led to human-to-human transmission. Two reviewers conducted screening, selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. With the exception of 1 prospective cohort study of ANDV in Chile with serious risk of bias, evidence from comparative studies (strongest level of evidence available) does not support human-to-human transmission of hantavirus infection. Noncomparative studies with a critical risk of bias suggest that human-to-human transmission of ANDV may be possible.
CONCLUSIONS: The balance of the evidence does not support the claim of human-to-human transmission of ANDV. Well-designed cohort and case-control studies that control for co-exposure to rodents are needed to inform public health recommendations.","['Toledo J', 'Haby MM', 'Reveiz L', 'Sosa Leon L', 'Angerami R', 'Aldighieri S']",2022,226,8,J Infect Dis,"Toledo J, et al.

34487792,Innate Immunity to Orthohantaviruses: Could Divergent Immune Interactions Explain Host-specific Disease Outcomes?,"The genus Orthohantavirus (family Hantaviridae, order Bunyavirales) consists of numerous genetic and pathologically distinct viral species found within rodent and mammalian insectivore populations world-wide. Although reservoir hosts experience persistent asymptomatic infection, numerous rodent-borne orthohantaviruses cause severe disease when transmitted to humans, with case-fatality rates up to 40%. The first isolation of an orthohantavirus occurred in 1976 and, since then, the field has made significant progress in understanding the immune correlates of disease, viral interactions with the human innate immune response, and the immune kinetics of reservoir hosts. Much still remains elusive regarding the molecular mechanisms of orthohantavirus recognition by the innate immune response and viral antagonism within the reservoir host, however. This review provides a summary of the last 45 years of research into orthohantavirus interaction with the host innate immune response. This summary includes discussion of current knowledge involving human, non-reservoir rodent, and reservoir innate immune responses to viruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome. Review of the literature concludes with a brief proposition for the development of novel tools needed to drive forward investigations into the molecular mechanisms of innate immune activation and consequences for disease outcomes in the various hosts for orthohantaviruses.",['Kell AM'],2022,434,6,J Mol Biol,Kell AM.

34487097,Hantavirus infections in Italy: not reported doesn't mean inexistent.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses can cause serious human diseases including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS). European Hantavirus are usually associated with HFRS, and their geographical distribution mirrors the ecology of reservoir host species. Epidemiology of HFRS is well-studied in Western Europe, but data from Italy are fragmentary.
METHODS: We searched into two different databases (PubMed and EMBASE), focusing on studies reporting the prevalence of Hantaviruses in Italy. Data were extracted using a standardized assessment form, and results of the analyses were systematically reported, summarized and compared.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 18 articles, including 12 reports (total population: 5,336 subjects, 1981-2019) and 6 case reports (1984-2019). In total, 200 subjects exhibited some degree of seropositivity, with a pooled seroprevalence of 1.7% (95% confidence interval 0.7%-4.0%) in the general population. Higher occurrence was reported in selected subgroups, i.e. acute (28.7%, 95%CI 22.1-36.2) and chronic (6.6%, 95%CI 4.7-9.1) renal failure, forestry workers (3.0%, 95%CI 1.4-6.5, actual range 0.0 to 10.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In the last decade, no human cases of hantavirus infection have been officially reported in Italy. However, our analysis stresses the actual occurrence of Hantavirus among general population and in selected population groups. Further studies on hantavirus infection rates in reservoir host species (rodents, shrews, and bats) and virus transmission to humans are needed to prevent outbreaks in the future.","['Riccò M', 'Peruzzi S', 'Ranzieri S', 'Balzarini F', 'Valente M', 'Marchesi F', 'Bragazzi NL']",2021,92,4,Acta Biomed,"Riccò M, et al.

34412581,Time series analysis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in mainland China by using an XGBoost forecasting model.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is still attracting public attention because of its outbreak in various cities in China. Predicting future outbreaks or epidemics disease based on past incidence data can help health departments take targeted measures to prevent diseases in advance. In this study, we propose a multistep prediction strategy based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for HFRS as an extension of the one-step prediction model. Moreover, the fitting and prediction accuracy of the XGBoost model will be compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model by different evaluation indicators.
METHODS: We collected HFRS incidence data from 2004 to 2018 of mainland China. The data from 2004 to 2017 were divided into training sets to establish the seasonal ARIMA model and XGBoost model, while the 2018 data were used to test the prediction performance. In the multistep XGBoost forecasting model, one-hot encoding was used to handle seasonal features. Furthermore, a series of evaluation indices were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the multistep forecast XGBoost model.
RESULTS: There were 200,237 HFRS cases in China from 2004 to 2018. A long-term downward trend and bimodal seasonality were identified in the original time series. According to the minimum corrected akaike information criterion (CAIC) value, the optimal ARIMA (3, 1, 0) × (1, 1, 0)
CONCLUSIONS: The multistep XGBoost prediction model showed a much better prediction accuracy and model stability than the multistep ARIMA prediction model. The XGBoost model performed better in predicting complicated and nonlinear data like HFRS. Additionally, Multistep prediction models are more practical than one-step prediction models in forecasting infectious diseases.","['Lv CX', 'An SY', 'Qiao BJ', 'Wu W']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lv CX, et al.

34405079,Treatment of Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas With CyberKnife Robotic Hypofractionated Radiosurgery: A Single Institution Experience.,"Introduction The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife® (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) hypofractionated radiosurgery (HfRS) in the treatment of chordomas and chondrosarcomas. Methods A total of 24 patients retrospectively identified with chordomas (19 patients) or chondrosarcomas (five patients) were treated between 2012 and 2019 with HfRS as monotherapy or an adjuvant, rescue, or combination therapy. Tumors were located in the skull base (75%) and vertebral spine (25%). Of these, 19 patients underwent previous partial resection and four patients received previous conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (60-74 Gy). Exclusive or rescue HfRS (20 patients) was administered in five fractions with a median dose of 37.5 Gy (30-40 Gy). Combined tomotherapy-EBRT treatment (median dose: 54 Gy) and HfRS (16.5-30 Gy in 3-12 fractions) were performed in four patients with bulky chordomas. Results The median follow-up from HfRS was 28 months. During clinical follow-up, no deaths were registered with overall survival (OS) of 100% and the actuarial local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was 93% at one year, 85% at three years, and 68% at five years. Acute toxicity related to HfRS was present in a single patient. Conclusions It is seen that HfRS is effective and safe for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, with rates of LRFS comparable to other radiation modalities.","['Sallabanda M', 'Garcia R', 'Lorenzana L', 'Santaolalla I', 'Abarca J', 'Sallabanda K']",2021,13,8,Cureus,"Sallabanda M, et al.

34404450,Cells of the human respiratory tract support the replication of pathogenic Old World orthohantavirus Puumala.,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of all known pathogenic orthohantaviruses (family Hantaviridae) usually occurs via inhalation of aerosols contaminated with viral particles derived from infected rodents and organ manifestation of infections is characterized by lung and kidney involvement. Orthohantaviruses found in Eurasia cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and New World orthohantaviruses cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). However, cases of infection with Old World orthohantaviruses with severe pulmonary manifestations have also been observed. Therefore, human airway cells may represent initial targets for orthohantavirus infection and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of infections with Eurasian orthohantaviruses.
METHODS: We analyzed the permissiveness of primary endothelial cells of the human pulmonary microvasculature and of primary human epithelial cells derived from bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli for Old World orthohantavirus Puumala virus (PUUV) in vitro. In addition, we examined the expression of orthohantaviral receptors in these cell types. To minimize donor-specific effects, cells from two different donors were tested for each cell type.
RESULTS: Productive infection with PUUV was observed for endothelial cells of the microvasculature and for the three tested epithelial cell types derived from different sites of the respiratory tract. Interestingly, infection and particle release were also detected in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells although expression of the orthohantaviral receptor integrin β
CONCLUSIONS: The human respiratory epithelium is among the first targets of orthohantaviral infection and may contribute to virus replication, dissemination and pathogenesis of HFRS-causing orthohantaviruses. Differences in initial pulmonary infection due to donor-specific factors may play a role in the observed broad variance of severity and symptoms of orthohantavirus disease in patients.

34389893,Inhibition of interferon I induction by non-structural protein NSs of Puumala virus and other vole-associated orthohantaviruses: phenotypic plasticity of the protein and potential functional domains.,"The orthohantavirus Puumala virus (PUUV), which is transmitted by bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), and other vole-borne hantaviruses contain in their small (S) genome segment two overlapping open reading frames, coding for the nucleocapsid protein and the non-structural protein NSs, a putative type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonist. To investigate the role of NSs of PUUV and other orthohantaviruses, the expression pattern of recombinant NSs constructs and their ability to inhibit human IFN-I promoter activity were investigated. The NSs proteins of PUUV and related cricetid-borne orthohantaviruses showed strong inhibition of IFN-I promoter induction. We identified protein products originating from three and two methionine initiation codons in the NSs ORF of PUUV during transfection and infection, respectively. The three putative start codons are conserved in all PUUV strains analysed. Translation initiation at these start codons influenced the inhibitory activity of the NSs products, with the wild-type (wt) construct expressing two proteins starting at the first and second methionine and showing strong inhibition activity. Analysis of in vitro-generated variants and naturally occurring PUUV NSs proteins indicated that amino acid variation in the NSs protein is well tolerated, suggesting its phenotypic plasticity. The N-terminal 20-amino-acid region of the NSs protein was found to be associated with strong inhibition and to be highly vulnerable to amino acid exchanges and tag fusions. Infection studies using human, bank vole, and Vero E6 cells did not show obvious differences in the replication capacity of PUUV Sotkamo wt and a strain with a truncated NSs protein (NSs21Stop), showing that the lack of a full-length NSs might be compensated by its N-terminal peptide, as seen in transfection experiments. These results contribute to our understanding of virus-host interactions and highlight the importance of future innate immunity studies in reservoir hosts.","['Binder F', 'Gallo G', 'Bendl E', 'Eckerle I', 'Ermonval M', 'Luttermann C', 'Ulrich RG']",2021,166,11,Arch Virol,"Binder F, et al.

34383814,A comparison of comorbidity measures for predicting mortality after elective hip and knee replacement: A cohort study of data from the National Joint Registry in England and Wales.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of mortality following elective total hip (THR) and knee replacements (KR) may be influenced by patients' pre-existing comorbidities. There are a variety of scores derived from individual comorbidities that can be used in an attempt to quantify this. The aims of this study were to a) identify which comorbidity score best predicts risk of mortality within 90 days or b) determine which comorbidity score best predicts risk of mortality at other relevant timepoints (30, 45, 120 and 365 days).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We linked data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) on primary elective hip and knee replacements performed between 2011-2015 with pre-existing conditions recorded in the Hospital Episodes Statistics. We derived comorbidity scores (Charlson Comorbidity Index-CCI, Elixhauser, Hospital Frailty Risk Score-HFRS). We used binary logistic regression models of all-cause mortality within 90-days and within 30, 45, 120 and 365-days of the primary operation using, adjusted for age and gender. We compared the performance of these models in predicting all-cause mortality using the area under the Receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUROC) and the Index of Prediction Accuracy (IPA).
RESULTS: We included 276,594 elective primary THRs and 338,287 elective primary KRs for any indication. Mortality within 90-days was 0.34% (N = 939) after THR and 0.26% (N = 865) after KR. The AUROC for the CCI and Elixhauser scores in models of mortality ranged from 0.78-0.81 after THR and KR, which slightly outperformed models with ASA grade (AUROC = 0.77-0.78). HFRS performed similarly to ASA grade (AUROC = 0.76-0.78). The inclusion of comorbidities prior to the primary operation offers no improvement beyond models with comorbidities at the time of the primary. The discriminative ability of all prediction models was best for mortality within 30 days and worst for mortality within 365 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity scores add little improvement beyond simpler models with age, gender and ASA grade for predicting mortality within one year after elective hip or knee replacement. The additional patient-specific information required to construct comorbidity scores must be balanced against their prediction gain when considering their utility.","['Penfold CM', 'Whitehouse MR', 'Blom AW', 'Judge A', 'Wilkinson JM', 'Sayers A']",2021,16,8,PLoS One,"Penfold CM, et al.

34379707,Hantavirus infection-induced B cell activation elevates free light chains levels in circulation.,"In humans, orthohantaviruses can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). An earlier study reported that acute Andes virus HPS caused a massive and transient elevation in the number of circulating plasmablasts with specificity towards both viral and host antigens suggestive of polyclonal B cell activation. Immunoglobulins (Igs), produced by different B cell populations, comprise heavy and light chains; however, a certain amount of free light chains (FLCs) is constantly present in serum. Upregulation of FLCs, especially clonal species, associates with renal pathogenesis by fibril or deposit formations affecting the glomeruli, induction of epithelial cell disorders, or cast formation in the tubular network. We report that acute orthohantavirus infection increases the level of Ig FLCs in serum of both HFRS and HPS patients, and that the increase correlates with the severity of acute kidney injury in HFRS. The fact that the kappa to lambda FLC ratio in the sera of HFRS and HPS patients remained within the normal range suggests polyclonal B cell activation rather than proliferation of a single B cell clone. HFRS patients demonstrated increased urinary excretion of FLCs, and we found plasma cell infiltration in archival patient kidney biopsies that we speculate to contribute to the observed FLC excreta. Analysis of hospitalized HFRS patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed elevated plasmablast levels, a fraction of which stained positive for Puumala virus antigen. Furthermore, B cells isolated from healthy donors were susceptible to Puumala virus in vitro, and the virus infection induced increased production of Igs and FLCs. The findings propose that hantaviruses directly activate B cells, and that the ensuing intense production of polyclonal Igs and FLCs may contribute to acute hantavirus infection-associated pathological findings.","['Hepojoki J', 'Cabrera LE', 'Hepojoki S', 'Bellomo C', 'Kareinen L', 'Andersson LC', 'Vaheri A', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Vapalahti O', 'Martinez V', 'Strandin T']",2021,17,8,PLoS Pathog,"Hepojoki J, et al.

34373474,Rodent host population dynamics drive zoonotic Lyme Borreliosis and Orthohantavirus infections in humans in Northern Europe.,"Zoonotic diseases, caused by pathogens transmitted between other vertebrate animals and humans, pose a major risk to human health. Rodents are important reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens, and rodent population dynamics affect the infection dynamics of rodent-borne diseases, such as diseases caused by hantaviruses. However, the role of rodent population dynamics in determining the infection dynamics of rodent-associated tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria, have gained limited attention in Northern Europe, despite the multiannual abundance fluctuations, the so-called vole cycles, that characterise rodent population dynamics in the region. Here, we quantify the associations between rodent abundance and LB human cases and Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) infections by using two time series (25-year and 9-year) in Finland. Both bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance as well as LB and PUUV infection incidence in humans showed approximately 3-year cycles. Without vector transmitted PUUV infections followed the bank vole host abundance fluctuations with two-month time lag, whereas tick-transmitted LB was associated with bank vole abundance ca. 12 and 24 months earlier. However, the strength of association between LB incidence and bank vole abundance ca. 12 months before varied over the study years. This study highlights that the human risk to acquire rodent-borne pathogens, as well as rodent-associated tick-borne pathogens is associated with the vole cycles in Northern Fennoscandia, yet with complex time lags.","['Aminikhah M', 'Forsman JT', 'Koskela E', 'Mappes T', 'Sane J', 'Ollgren J', 'Kivelä SM', 'Kallio ER']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Aminikhah M, et al.

34370707,Utility of Nested Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction of Clinical Specimens for Early Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is confirmed by the isolation of hantavirus from serum, detection of virus-specific IgM, or a four-fold change in IgG titers during the acute and convalescent periods measured using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, these tests are inefficient for early diagnosis. Therefore, this study investigated the usefulness of reverse-transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) for early diagnosis of HFRS using clinical samples such as urine and serum. Electronic medical records of eight patients with confirmed HFRS using IFA and RT-nPCR between May 2016 and May 2020 at Chosun University Hospital were reviewed. The virus was detected in all patients using RT-nPCR targeting the large (L) segment of hantavirus during the early phase in urine and serum. Importantly, the virus was identified in urine at a time when it was not identified in serum. Additionally, the virus was detected in urine and serum for up to 1 month after initial presentation with illness, but not in saliva, using RT-nPCR. We report eight HFRS cases diagnosed using urine and serum, but not using saliva, with RT-nPCR targeting the L-segment. Hantavirus RNA detection by RT-nPCR in urine and serum may aid the rapid diagnosis of HFRS during the early phase of the disease. In particular, HFRS should not be ruled out based on negative RT-PCR results in serum, and RT-PCR should be performed using urine as well as serum during the early phase of symptoms.","['Seo JW', 'Kim DY', 'Kim CM', 'Yun NR', 'Lee YM', 'Lawrence Panchali MJ', 'Kim DM']",2021,105,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Seo JW, et al.

34358248,The changing epidemiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Southeastern China during 1963-2020: A retrospective analysis of surveillance data.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by hantavirus which was endemic Zhejiang Province, China. In this study, we aim to explore the changing epidemiology of HFRS in Zhejiang, identify high-risk areas and populations, and evaluate relevant policies and interventions to better improve HFRS control and prevention.
METHODS: Surveillance data on HFRS during 1963-2020 in Zhejiang Province were extracted from Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention archives and the Chinese Notifiable Disease Reporting System. The changing epidemiological characteristics of HFRS including seasonal distribution, geographical distribution, and demographic features, were analyzed using joinpoint regression, autoregressive integrated moving average model, descriptive statistical methods, and Spatio-temporal cluster analysis.
RESULTS: From 1963 to 2020, 114 071 HFRS cases and 1269 deaths were reported in Zhejiang Province. The incidence increased sharply from 1973 and peaked in 1986, then decreased steadily and maintained a stable incidence from 2004. HFRS cases were reported in all 11 prefecture-level cities of Zhejiang Province from 1963 to 2020. The joint region (Shengzhou, Xinchang, Tiantai, and surrounding areas), and Kaihua County are the most seriously affected regions throughout time. After 1990, the first HFRS incidence peak was in May-June, with another one from November to January. Most HFRS cases occurred in 21- (26.48%) and 30- years group (24.25%) from 1991 to 2004, but 41- (25.75%) and 51-years (23.30%) had the highest proportion from 2005 to 2020. Farmers accounted for most cases (78.10%), and cases are predominantly males with a male-to-female ratio of 2.6:1. It was found that the median time from onset to diagnosis was 6.5 days (IQR 3.75-10.42), and the time from diagnosis to disease report was significantly shortened after 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed dynamic changes in the seasonal distribution, geographical distribution, and demographic features of HFRS, which should be well considered in the development of control and prevention strategies in future. Additional researches are warranted to elucidate the environmental, meteorological, and social factors associated with HFRS incidence in different decades.","['Zhang R', 'Mao Z', 'Yang J', 'Liu S', 'Liu Y', 'Qin S', 'Tian H', 'Guo S', 'Ren J', 'Shi X', 'Li X', 'Sun J', 'Ling F', 'Wang Z']",2021,15,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang R, et al.

34350130,Integrative Analysis of HTNV Glycoprotein Derived MHC II Epitopes by In Silico Prediction and Experimental Validation.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV), the causative pathogen of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), is a negative RNA virus belonging to the Orthohantaviridae family. HTNV envelope glycoprotein (GP), encoded by the genomic medium segment, is immunogenic and is therefore a promising vaccine candidate. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) epitopes derived from HTNV has been extensively studied, but little is known of MHC-II epitopes. In silico predictions based on four databases indicated that the full-length HTNV GP has 1121 15-mer epitopes, of which 289 had a high score for binding to the human and murine MHC-II superfamily. It found that epitope ILTVLKFIANIFHTS could potentially bind most MHC-II molecules covering human and murine haplotypes. Dominant epitopes were validated by enzyme-linked immunospot assay of splenocytes from immunized mice; 6 of 10 epitopes supported the predictions including TATYSIVGPANAKVP, TKTLVIGQCIYTITS, FSLLPGVAHSIAVEL, CETYKELKAHGVSCP, CGLYLDRLKPVGSAY, and NLGENPCKIGLQTSS. Conservation analysis of dominant epitopes revealed host-virus interactions without geographic stratification, thus meeting the requirements of candidate vaccines for large-population prophylaxis.

For this purpose, a network of laboratories delivering reliable analytical data on human exposure is fundamental. The analytical comparability and accuracy of laboratories analysing flame retardants (FRs) in serum and urine were investigated by a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) scheme comprising interlaboratory comparison investigations (ICIs) and external quality assurance schemes (EQUASs). This paper presents the evaluation process and discusses the results of four ICI/EQUAS rounds performed from 2018 to 2020 for the determination of ten halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) represented by three congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, BDE-153 and BDE-209), two isomers of hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCD and γ-HBCD), two dechloranes (anti-DP and syn-DP), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) in serum, and four metabolites of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) in urine, at two concentration levels. The number of satisfactory results reported by laboratories increased during the four rounds. In the case of HFRs, the scope of the participating laboratories varied substantially (from two to ten) and in most cases did not cover the entire target spectrum of chemicals. The highest participation rate was reached for BDE-47 and BDE-153. The majority of participants achieved more than 70% satisfactory results for these two compounds over all rounds. For other HFRs, the percentage of successful laboratories varied from 44 to 100%. The evaluation of TBBPA, DBDPE, and 2,4,6-TBP was not possible because the number of participating laboratories was too small. Only seven laboratories participated in the ICI/EQUAS scheme for OPFR metabolites and five of them were successful for at least two biomarkers. Nevertheless, the evaluation of laboratory performance using Z-scores in the first three rounds required an alternative approach compared to HFRs because of the small number of participants and the high variability of experts' results. The obtained results within the ICI/EQUAS programme showed a significant core network of comparable European laboratories for HBM of BDE-47, BDE-153, BDE-209, α-HBCD, γ-HBCD, anti-DP, and syn-DP. On the other hand, the data revealed a critically low analytical capacity in Europe for HBM of TBBPA, DBDPE, and 2,4,6-TBP as well as for the OPFR biomarkers.","['Dvorakova D', 'Pulkrabova J', 'Gramblicka T', 'Polachova A', 'Buresova M', 'López ME', 'Castaño A', 'Nübler S', 'Haji-Abbas-Zarrabi K', 'Klausner N', 'Göen T', 'Mol H', 'Koch HM', 'Vaccher V', 'Antignac JP', 'Haug LS', 'Vorkamp K', 'Hajslova J']",2021,202,,Environ Res,"Dvorakova D, et al.

The pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood, nor if they affect the humoral immune system. The objective of this study was to investigate humoral immune responses to hantavirus infection and to correlate them to the typical features of HFRS: thrombocytopenia and transient kidney dysfunction.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive characterisation of longitudinal antiviral B-cell responses of 26 hantavirus patients and combined this with paired clinical data. In addition, we measured extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its breakdown products in circulation and performed 
RESULTS: We found that thrombocytopenia was correlated to an elevated frequency of plasmablasts in circulation. In contrast, kidney dysfunction was indicative of an accumulation of CD27
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that thrombocytopenia and kidney dysfunction associate with distinctly different effects on the humoral immune system.

34276633,"Edging on Mutational Bias, Induced Natural Selection From Host and Natural Reservoirs Predominates Codon Usage Evolution in Hantaan Virus.","The molecular evolutionary dynamics that shape hantaviruses' evolution are poorly understood even now, besides the contribution of virus-host interaction to their evolution remains an open question. Our study aimed to investigate these two aspects in Hantaan virus (HTNV)-the prototype of hantaviruses and an emerging zoonotic pathogen that infects humans, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS): endemic in Far East Russia, China, and South Korea-via a comprehensive, phylogenetic-dependent codon usage analysis. We found that host- and natural reservoir-induced natural selection is the primary determinant of its biased codon choices, exceeding the mutational bias effect. The phylogenetic analysis of HTNV strains resulted in three distinct clades: South Korean, Russian, and Chinese. An effective number of codon (ENC) analysis showed a slightly biased codon usage in HTNV genomes. Nucleotide composition and RSCU analyses revealed a significant bias toward A/U nucleotides and A/U-ended codons, indicating the potential influence of mutational bias on the codon usage patterns of HTNV. Via ENC-plot, Parity Rule 2 (PR2), and neutrality plot analyses, we would conclude the presence of both mutation pressure and natural selection effect in shaping the codon usage patterns of HTNV; however, natural selection is the dominant factor influencing its codon usage bias. Codon adaptation index (CAI), Relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and Similarity Index (SiD) analyses uncovered the intense selection pressure from the host (Human) and natural reservoirs (Striped field mouse and Chinese white-bellied rat) in shaping HTNV biased codon choices. Our study clearly revealed the evolutionary processes in HTNV and the role of virus-host interaction in its evolution. Moreover, it opens the door for a more comprehensive codon usage analysis for all hantaviruses species to determine their molecular evolutionary dynamics and adaptability to several hosts and environments. We believe that our research will help in a better and deep understanding of HTNV evolution that will serve its future basic research and aid live attenuated vaccines design.","['Ata G', 'Wang H', 'Bai H', 'Yao X', 'Tao S']",2021,12,,Front Microbiol,"Ata G, et al.

Appendicitis caused by Hantaan virus has not been reported previously. An 81-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for suspected appendicitis based on abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and computed tomography findings. Based on a suspicion of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, the patient's plasma was simultaneously analyzed using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The appendix tissue was also analyzed using nested RT-PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to identify the presence of Hantaan virus. Nested RT-PCR detected the presence of Hantaan virus, and indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay results revealed the presence of elevated antibody levels. Furthermore, IHC staining of the appendix tissue confirmed Hantaan virus antigens in the peripheral nerve bundle. Based on these findings, we confirmed the nerve tropism of the Hantaan virus. Hantaan virus in plasma and appendix tissue samples was confirmed using PCR and phylogenetic tree analysis. Moreover, we detected hypertrophy of the submucosa and periappendiceal adipose tissue nerve bundle along with Hantaan virus antigens in peripheral nerve bundles using IHC staining. Hence, we report that Hantaan virus infection may be accompanied by appendicitis.","['Lim SC', 'Lee YM', 'Kim CM', 'Yun NR', 'Kim DM']",2021,105,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Lim SC, et al.

At northern high latitudes, the effect of global warming on especially winter conditions is strong. By using long term monitoring data (1980-1986 and 2003-2013) from Northern Europe on temperature, precipitation, an endemic zoonotic pathogen (Puumala orthohantavirus, PUUV) and its reservoir host (the bank vole, Myodes glareolus), we show that early winters have become increasingly wet, with a knock-on effect on pathogen transmission in its reservoir host population. Further, our study is the first to show a climate change effect on an endemic northern zoonosis, that is not induced by increased host abundance or distribution, demonstrating that climate change can also alter transmission intensity within host populations. Our results suggest that rainy early winters accelerate PUUV transmission in bank voles in winter, likely increasing the human zoonotic risk in the North.","['Sipari S', 'Khalil H', 'Magnusson M', 'Evander M', 'Hörnfeldt B', 'Ecke F']",2022,51,3,Ambio,"Sipari S, et al.

The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic value of two different frailty scores in patients hospitalised for COVID-19.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (≥18 years) inpatients with COVID-19 and took place from 3 March to 2 May 2020. Patients were categorised by Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were tocilizumab treatment, length of hospital stay, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, kidney function and comorbidity.
RESULTS: Of the 290 included patients, 54 were frail according to the CFS (≥5 points; prevalence 18.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-23.7) vs 65 by HFRS (≥5 points; prevalence: 22.4%, 95% CI 17.8-27.7). Prevalence of frailty increased with age according to both measures: 50-64 years, CFS 1.9% vs HFRS 12.3%; 65-79 years, CFS 31.5% vs HFRS 40.0%; and ≥80 years, CFS 66.7% vs HFRS 40.0% (P < .001). CFS-defined frailty was independently associated with risk of death (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.49-9.04) and less treatment with tocilizumab (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.93). HFRS-defined frailty was independently associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.53-5.44), ICU admission (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.84-9.52) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.93, 95% CI 2.33-15.10).
CONCLUSION: In the spring 2020 wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, CFS-defined frailty was an independent predictor for death, while frailty as measured by the HFRS was associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days, ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.","['Ramos-Rincon JM', 'Moreno-Perez O', 'Pinargote-Celorio H', 'Leon-Ramirez JM', 'Andres M', 'Reus S', 'Herrera-García C', 'Martí-Pastor A', 'Boix V', 'Gil J', 'Sanchez-Martinez R', 'Merino E', 'COVID-19 ALC Research Group']",2021,75,10,Int J Clin Pract,"Ramos-Rincon JM, et al.

34226582,Epidemiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Tai'an area.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a serious threat to human health, is mainly transmitted by rodents in Eurasia. The risk of disease differs according to sex, age, and occupation. Further, temperature and rainfall have some lagging effects on the occurrence of the disease. The quantitative data for these factors in the Tai'an region of China are still unknown. We used a forest map to calculate the risk of HFRS in different populations and used four different mathematical models to explain the relationship between time factors, meteorological factors, and the disease. The results showed that compared with the whole population, the relative risk in rural medical staff and farmers was 5.05 and 2.00, respectively (p < 0.05). Joinpoint models showed that the number of cases decreased by 33.32% per year from 2005 to 2008 (p < 0.05). The generalized additive model showed that air temperature was positively correlated with disease risk from January to June, and that relative humidity was negatively correlated with risk from July to December. From January to June, with an increase in temperature, after 15 lags, the cumulative risk of disease increased at low temperatures. From July to December, the cumulative risk decreased with an increase in the relative humidity. Rural medical staff, farmers, men, and middle-aged individuals were at a high risk of HFRS. Moreover, air temperature and relative humidity are important factors that affect disease occurrence. These associations show lagged and differing effects according to the season.","['Bi X', 'Yi S', 'Zhang A', 'Zhao Z', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang C', 'Ye Z']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Bi X, et al.

Patients with severe HFRS may develop multiple organ failure or even death, which makes HFRS a serious public health problem.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included a total of 155 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with HFRS, of whom 109 patients served as a training cohort and 46 patients as an independent verification cohort. In the training set, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to screen the characteristic variables of the risk model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to construct a nomogram containing the characteristic variables selected in the LASSO regression model.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the nomogram indicated that the model had good discrimination. The calibration curve exhibited that the nomogram was in good agreement between the prediction and the actual observation. Decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve suggested that the predictive nomogram had clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we established a simple and feasible model to predict severity in patients with HFRS, with which HFRS would be better identified and patients can be treated early.","['Yang Z', 'Hu Q', 'Feng Z', 'Sun Y']",2021,16,1,Open Med (Wars),"Yang Z, et al.

34185827,External validation of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score in France.,"BACKGROUND: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) has made it possible internationally to identify subgroups of patients with characteristics of frailty from routinely collected hospital data.
OBJECTIVE: To externally validate the HFRS in France.
DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the French medical information database.
SETTING: 743 hospitals in Metropolitan France.
SUBJECTS: All patients aged 75 years or older hospitalised as an emergency in 2017 (n = 1,042,234).
METHODS: The HFRS was calculated for each patient based on the index stay and hospitalisations over the preceding 2 years. Main outcome measures were 30-day in-patient mortality, length of stay (LOS) >10 days and 30-day readmissions. Mixed logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between outcomes and HFRS score.
RESULTS: Patients with high HFRS risk were associated with increased risk of mortality and prolonged LOS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.38 [1.35-1.42] and 3.27 [3.22-3.32], c-statistics = 0.676 and 0.684, respectively), while it appeared less predictive of readmissions (aOR = 1.00 [0.98-1.02], c-statistic = 0.600). Model calibration was excellent. Restricting the score to data prior to index admission reduced discrimination of HFRS substantially.

We examined frailty indices derived from population-scale linked data on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospitalised non-ICU patients with pneumonia to elucidate the influence of frailty on mortality. Longitudinal cohort study between 2010-2018 using population-scale anonymised data linkage of healthcare records for adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia in Wales. Primary outcome was in-patient mortality. Odds Ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) for age, hospital frailty risk score (HFRS), electronic frailty index (eFI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and social deprivation index were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was estimated to determine the best fitting models. Of the 107,188 patients, mean (SD) age was 72.6 (16.6) years, 50% were men. The models adjusted for the two frailty indices and the comorbidity index had an increased odds of in-patient mortality for individuals with an ICU admission (ORs for ICU admission in the eFI model 2.67 [2.55, 2.79], HFRS model 2.30 [2.20, 2.41], CCI model 2.62 [2.51, 2.75]). Models indicated advancing age, increased frailty and comorbidity were also associated with an increased odds of in-patient mortality (eFI, baseline fit, ORs: mild 1.09 [1.04, 1.13], moderate 1.13 [1.08, 1.18], severe 1.17 [1.10, 1.23].

For predicting inpatient deaths, the CCI and HFRS based models were similar, however for longer term outcomes the CCI based model was superior.

34157089,Predicting outcomes in older patients undergoing vascular surgery using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty may explain why some older patients having vascular surgery are at high risk of adverse outcomes. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) has been designed specifically for use with administrative data and has three categories of frailty risk (low, intermediate and high). The aim of this study was to evaluate the HFRS in predicting mortality, and hospital use in older patients undergoing vascular surgery.
METHODS: Routinely collected hospital data linked to death records were analysed for all patients aged 75 years or older who had undergone either endovascular or open vascular surgery between 2010 and 2012 in New South Wales, Australia. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to compare outcomes adjusted for patient and procedural factors, with and without frailty.
RESULTS: Some 9752 patients were identified, of whom 1719 (17·6 per cent) had a high-risk HFRS. Patients in the high-risk frailty category had an adjusted odds ratio for death by 30 days after surgery of 4·15 (95 per cent c.i. 2·99 to 5·76) compared with those in the low-risk frailty category, and a similarly increased odds of death by 2 years (odds ratio 4·27, 3·69 to 4·95). Adding the HFRS to a model adjusted for age, sex, co-morbidity score, socioeconomic status, previous hospitalization and vascular procedure type improved the prediction of 2-year mortality and prolonged hospital stay, but there was minimal improvement for 30-day mortality and readmission.
CONCLUSION: Adjusting for the HFRS in addition to other patient and procedural risk factors provided greater discrimination of outcomes in this cohort of older patients undergoing vascular surgery.","['Aitken SJ', 'Lujic S', 'Randall DA', 'Noguchi N', 'Naganathan V', 'Blyth FM']",2021,108,6,Br J Surg,"Aitken SJ, et al.

34134417,"Severe contamination and time trends of legacy and novel halogenated flame retardants in multiple environmental media from Lake Shihwa, Korea: Effectiveness of regulatory action.","Novel halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were introduced to industrial markets as alternatives to legacy brominated FRs (BFRs), such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). In the present study, PBDEs and their brominated and chlorinated alternatives, novel BFRs (NBFRs) and dechlorane plus (DP), were measured in multiple environmental matrices in a highly industrialized lake in Korea. Legacy and novel HFRs were detected in multiple samples, indicating ubiquitous contamination. Concentrations of HFRs in water and sediment observed in creeks running through machine, textiles, and automobile industrial complexes were significantly higher than those observed in inside and outside of the lake. Higher bioaccumulation levels of HFRs were observed in inshore compared with offshore waters. Results suggest that multi-matrix distribution of legacy and novel HFRs was dependent on the geographical proximity to industrial sources. Compared with previous studies, the highest levels of PBDEs and NBFRs were recorded in water samples on a global scale, implying on-going emissions from industrial activities. Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was a dominant compound in water samples, whereas the concentrations of PBDEs, NBFRs, and DP in sediment were similar to each other. This suggests a shift in consumption from legacy to novel HFRs, preferentially in water environments. A significant declining trend in PBDEs was observed in water and sediment collected between 2008 and 2015, indicating the effectiveness of regulatory actions. Based on their environmental occurrence and bioaccumulation potential, pentabromoethylbenzene and bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate may pose emerging concerns regarding contamination of aquatic environments.","['Lee S', 'Ra K', 'Moon HB']",2021,279,,Chemosphere,"Lee S, et al.

34087930,Frailty is an outcome predictor in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving endovascular treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a disorder of multiple physiological systems impairing the capacity of the organism to cope with insult or stress. It is associated with poor outcomes after acute illness. Our aim was to study the impact of frailty on the functional outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) submitted to endovascular stroke treatment (EST).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with AIS of the anterior circulation submitted to EST between 2012 and 2017, based on a prospectively collected local registry of consecutive patients. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) at discharge was calculated for each patient. We compared groups of patients with and without favourable 3-month outcome after index AIS (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 and 3-6, respectively). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify variables independently associated with favourable 3-month outcome. Diagnostic test statistics were used to compare HFRS with other prognostic scores for AIS.
RESULTS: We included 489 patients with median age 75.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 65.3-82.3) and median NIHSS 15 (IQR = 11-19). About 29.7% presented a high frailty risk (HFRS >15 points). Patients with favourable 3-month outcome presented lower HFRS and lower prevalence of high frailty risk. High frailty risk was independently associated with decreased likelihood of favourable 3-month outcome (adjusted odds ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval = 0.26-0.89). Diagnostic performances of HFRS and other prognostic scores (THRIVE and PRE scores, SPAN-100 index) for outcome at 3-months were similar.
DISCUSSION: Frailty is an independent predictor of outcome in AIS patients submitted to EST.","['Pinho J', 'Küppers C', 'Nikoubashman O', 'Wiesmann M', 'Schulz JB', 'Reich A', 'Werner CJ']",2021,50,5,Age Ageing,"Pinho J, et al.

The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) has been developed and proven to be capable of identifying patients which are at high risk of adverse outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether frail patients also face adverse outcomes after experiencing an endovascular treated large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS). In this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed patients ≥ 65 years that were admitted during 2015-2019 with LVOS and endovascular treatment. Primary outcomes were mortality and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after three months. Regression models were used to determine the impact of frailty. A total of 318 patients were included in the cohort. The median HFRS was 1.6 (IQR 4.8). A total of 238 (75.1%) patients fulfilled the criteria for a low-frailty risk with a HFRS < 5.72 (22.7%) for moderate-frailty risk with an HFRS from 5-15 and 7 (2.2%) patients for a high-frailty risk. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the HFRS was associated with an increased mortality after 90 days (CI (95%) 1.001 to 1.236; OR 1.112) and a worse mRS (CI (95%) 1.004 to 1.270; OR 1.129).

Samples covered the period from 1985 to 2016. 43 HFRs comprising polybrominated diphenyl ethers as well as emerging brominated and chlorinated compounds such as Dechlorane Plus, DBDPE, or DPTE, were analysed in 115 samples from ten sub sites originating from six areas characterised by different land uses, including urban as well as a background site. HFRs were observed in each sample showing the widespread distribution of HFRs in Germany in tree leaves and shoots as bioindicators of past and present atmospheric pollution. Analytes observed at elevated concentrations were BDE 209, DBDPE and DPTE. Observed HFR-levels differed between analytes as well as sampling locations, particularly prior to the year 2000. They were typically highest at conurbation areas. Concentrations at the background site often belonged to the lowest ones observed, however, lowest values were not exclusively found there. The quantification frequencies appeared to decrease from the past to most recent samples. With few exceptions, atmospheric pollution of both, legacy and emerging HFRs, decreased significantly.","['Dreyer A', 'Neugebauer F', 'Lohmann N', 'Rüdel H', 'Tarricone K', 'Rauert C', 'Koschorreck J']",2021,287,,Environ Pollut,"Dreyer A, et al.

33989395,Hospital frailty risk score and adverse health outcomes: evidence from longitudinal record linkage cardiac data.,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent evidence on the effect of frailty on health outcomes among those with heart failure, there is a dearth of knowledge on measuring frailty using administrative health data on a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective record-linkage cohort study of patients with diverse CVD in Queensland, Australia. We investigated the relationship between the risk of frailty, defined using the hospital frailty risk score (HFRS), and 30-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, non-home discharge, length of hospital stay (LOS) at an emergency department and inpatient units and costs of hospitalisation. Descriptive analysis, bivariate logistic regression and generalised linear models were used to estimate the association between HFRS and CVD outcomes. Smear adjustment was applied to hospital costs and the LOS for each frailty risk groups.
RESULTS: The proportion of low, medium and high risk of frailty was 24.6%, 34.5% and 40.9%, respectively. The odds of frail patients dying or being readmitted within 30 days of discharge was 1.73 and 1.18, respectively. Frail patients also faced higher odds of LOS, and non-home discharge at 3.1 and 2.25, respectively. Frail patients incurred higher hospital costs (by 42.7-55.3%) and stayed in the hospital longer (by 49%).
CONCLUSION: Using the HFRS on a large CVD cohort, this study confirms that frailty was associated with worse health outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Administrative data should be more accessible to research such that the HFRS can be applied to healthcare planning and patient care.","['Nghiem S', 'Afoakwah C', 'Scuffham P', 'Byrnes J']",2021,50,5,Age Ageing,"Nghiem S, et al.

33979351,A novel genotype of Hantaan orthohantavirus harbored by Apodemus agrarius chejuensis as a potential etiologic agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Republic of Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Orthohantaviruses, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, pose a significant public health threat worldwide. Despite the significant mortality and morbidity, effective antiviral therapeutics for orthohantavirus infections are currently unavailable. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of HFRS-associated orthohantaviruses and identify the etiological agent of orthohantavirus outbreaks in southern Republic of Korea (ROK).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected small mammals on Jeju Island during 2018-2020. We detected the Hantaan virus (HTNV)-specific antibodies and RNA using an indirect immunofluorescence assay test and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on Apodemus agrarius chejuensis (A. chejuensis). The prevalence of anti-HTNV antibodies among rodents was 14.1%. A total of six seropositive mouse harbored HTNV RNA. The amplicon-based next-generation sequencing provided nearly full-length tripartite genomic sequences of six HTNV harbored by A. chejuensis. Phylogenetic and tanglegram analyses were conducted for inferring evolutionary relationships between orthohantaviruses with their reservoir hosts. Phylogenetic analysis showed a novel distinct HTNV genotype. The detected HTNV genomic sequences were phylogenetically related to a viral sequence derived from HFRS patient in southern ROK. Tanglegram analysis demonstrated the segregation of HTNV genotypes corresponding to Apodemus spp. divergence.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that A. chejuensis-borne HTNV may be a potential etiological agent of HFRS in southern ROK. Ancestral HTNV may infect A. chejuensis prior to geological isolation between the Korean peninsula and Jeju Island, supporting the co-evolution of orthohantaviruses and rodents.

33925451,"Cytokine, Chemokine, and Metalloprotease Activation in the Serum of Patients with Nephropathia Epidemica from the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic of Mordovia, Russia.","Nephropathia Epidemica (NE), endemic to several Volga regions of Russia, including the Republic of Tatarstan (RT) and the Republic of Mordovia (RM), is a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by infection with rodent-borne orthohantaviruses. Although NE cases have been reported for decades, little is known about the hantavirus strains associated with human infection in these regions. There is also limited understanding of the pathogenesis of NE in the RT and the RM. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted comparative analyses of patients with NE in the RT and the RM. Clinical symptoms were more severe in patients with NE from the RM with longer observed duration of fever symptoms and hospitalization. Analysis of patient sera showed changes in the levels of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in patients with NE from both the RT and the RM, suggesting leukocyte activation, extracellular matrix degradation, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Interestingly, levels of several cytokines were distinctly different between patients NE from the RT when compared with those from the RM. These differences were not related to the genetic variation of orthohantaviruses circulating in those regions, as sequence analysis showed that Puumala virus (PUUV) was the causative agent of NE in these regions. Additionally, only the ""Russia"" (RUS) genetic lineage of PUUV was detected in the serum samples of patients with NE from both the RT and the RM. We therefore conclude that differences in serum cytokine, chemokine, and MMP levels between the RT and the RM are related to environmental factors and lifestyle differences that influence individual immune responses to orthohantavirus infection.","['Martynova E', 'Davidyuk Y', 'Kabwe E', 'Garanina EE', 'Shakirova V', 'Pavelkina V', 'Uskova Y', 'Stott RJ', 'Foster TL', 'Markelova M', 'Goyal M', 'Gupta A', 'Bhola M', 'Kumar V', 'Baranwal M', 'Rizvanov AA', 'Khaiboullina SF']",2021,10,5,Pathogens,"Martynova E, et al.

Rats that were experimentally infected by the intraperitoneal route showed transient immunoglobulin M (IgM) production, followed by an increased anti-SEOV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response and maturation of IgG avidity. The level of SEOV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) peaked at 6 days after inoculation and the viral genome disappeared from serum. In contrast, naturally infected brown rats simultaneously had a high rate of SEOV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies (28/43). Most of the IgM-positive rats (24/27) had the SEOV genome in their lungs, suggesting that chronic SEOV infection was established in those rats. In female rats with IgG avidity maturation, the viral load in the lungs was decreased. On the other hand, there was no relationship between IgG avidity and viral load in the lungs in male rats. A CTL response was not detected in naturally infected rats. The difference between immune responses in the experimentally and naturally infected rats is associated with the establishment of chronic infection in natural hosts.","['Yasuda SP', 'Shimizu K', 'Koma T', 'Hoa NT', 'Le MQ', 'Wei Z', 'Muthusinghe DS', 'Lokupathirage SMW', 'Hasebe F', 'Yamashiro T', 'Arikawa J', 'Yoshimatsu K']",2021,13,4,Viruses,"Yasuda SP, et al.

33893001,The Hospital Frailty Risk Score is Not an Accurate Predictor of Treatment Costs for Total Joint Replacement Patients in a Medicare Bundled Payment Population.,"BACKGROUND: Medically complex patients require more resources and experience higher costs within total joint arthroplasty (TJA) bundled payment models. While risk adjustment would be beneficial for such patients, no tool currently exists which can reliably identify these patients preoperatively. The purpose of this study is to determine if the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a valid predictor of high-TJA treatment costs.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on patients who underwent primary TJA between 2015 and 2020 from a single large orthopedic practice. ICD-10 codes from an institutional database were used to calculate HFRS. Cost data including inpatient, postacute, and episode of care (EOC) costs were collected. Charlson comorbidity index, demographics, readmissions, and complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: 4936 patients had a calculable HFRS and those with intermediate and high scores experienced more frequent readmissions/complications after TJA, as well as higher EOC costs. However, HFRS did not reliably predict EOC costs, yielding a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 66%. Multivariate analysis revealed that both patient age and sex are superior individual cost predictors when compared with HFRS. Secondary analyses indicated that HFRS more effectively predicts TJA complications and readmissions but is still nonideal for clinical applications.
CONCLUSION: HFRS has poor sensitivity as a predictor of high-EOC costs for TJA patients but has adequate specificity for predicting postoperative readmissions and complications. Further research is needed to develop a scale that can appropriately predict orthopedic cost outcomes.","['Ong CB', 'Krueger CA', 'Star AM']",2021,36,8,J Arthroplasty,"Ong CB, et al.

33871175,Applying Administrative Data-Based Coding Algorithms for Frailty in Patients With Cirrhosis.,"Frailty is a powerful prognostic tool in cirrhosis. Claims-based frailty scores estimate the presence of frailty without the need for in-person evaluation. These algorithms have not been validated in cirrhosis. Whether they measure true frailty or perform as well as frailty in outcome prediction is unknown. We evaluated 2 claims-based frailty scores-Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and Claims-Based Frailty Index (CFI)-in 3 prospective cohorts comprising 1100 patients with cirrhosis. We assessed differences in neuromuscular/neurocognitive capabilities in those classified as frail or nonfrail based on each score. We assessed the ability of the indexes to discriminate frailty based on the Fried Frailty Index (FFI), chair stands, activities of daily living (ADL), and falls. Finally, we compared the performance of claims-based frailty measures and physical frailty measures to predict transplant-free survival using competing risk regression and patient-reported outcomes. The CFI identified neuromuscular deficits (balance, chair stands, hip strength), whereas the HFRS only identified poor chair-stand performance. The CFI had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) for identifying frailty as measured by the FFI, ADL, and falls of 0.57, 0.60, and 0.68, respectively; similarly, the AUROCs were 0.66, 0.63, and 0.67, respectively, for the HFRS. Claims-based frailty scores were associated with poor quality of life and sleep but were outperformed by the FFI and chair stands. The HFRS, per 10-point increase (but not the CFI) predicted survival of patients in the liver transplantation (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.12) and non-liver transplantation cohorts (SHR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22).

33818946,[The potential role of mirnas in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute natural focal viral disease caused by viruses of the genus hantavirus, characterized by damage to small blood vessels, kidneys, lungs and other organs of a person. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-22 nucleotide endogenously expressed RNA molecules that inhibit gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to the 3-untranslated region of the target mRNA. It has been proven that miRNAs play a significant role in various biological processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been proven that miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including HFRS. Hantavirus infection predominantly affects endothelial cells and causes dysfunction of the endothelium of capillaries and small vessels. It is known that the immune response induced by Hantavirus infection plays an important role in disrupting the endothelial barrier. In a few studies, both in vitro and in vivo, it has been shown that endothelial dysfunction and the immune response after infection with Hantavirus can be partially regulated by miRNAs by acting on certain genes. Most of the miRNAs is expressed within the cells themselves. However, in some biological fluids of the human body, for example, plasma or blood serum, numerous miRNAs, called circulating miRNAs, have been found. Circulating miRNAs can be secreted by cells into human biological fluids as part of extracellular vesicles as exosomes or be part of an RNA-bound protein complex as miRNA-Argonaute 2 (Ago2). These miRNAs are resistant to nucleases, which makes them attractive as potential biomarkers in various human diseases. There is no specific antiviral therapy for HFRS, and the determination of laboratory parameters that are used to diagnose, assess the severity, and predict the course of the disease remains a challenge due to the peculiarities of the pathophysiology and clinical course of the disease. Studying the role of miRNAs in HFRS seems to be expedient for the development of specific and effective therapy, as well as for use as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (in relation to circulating miRNAs).","['Gareev IF', 'Beylerli OA', 'Pavlov VN', 'Izmailov AA', 'Khusnutdinova EK', 'Khasanova GM', 'Gilyazova IR', 'Khasanova AN', 'Guoqing Wang GW', 'Honglan Huang HH', 'Jiahui Pan JP', 'Tong Shao TS', 'Haochen Yao HY', 'Wenfang Wang WW', 'Khasanov DN']",2021,,1,Urologiia,"Gareev IF, et al.

33784301,"Misdiagnosis of scrub typhus as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and potential co-infection of both diseases in patients in Shandong Province, China, 2013-2014.","BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium, along with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by hantaviruses, are natural-focus infectious diseases prevalent in Shandong Province, China. Both diseases have similar clinical manifestations in certain disease stages and similar epidemic seasons, which has caused difficulties for physicians in distinguishing them. The aim of this study was to investigate whether misdiagnosis of scrub typhus as HFRS occurred in patients in Shandong Province.
METHODS: Serum samples (N = 112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients from 2013 to 2014 in Shandong Province were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to both hantavirus and Orientia tsutsugamushi.
RESULTS: ELISA showed that 56.3% (63/112) and 8.0% (9/112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients were IgM antibody positive to hantavirus and O. tsutsugamushi, respectively. Among the hantavirus IgM antibody positive patients, 7.9% (5/63) were also IgM antibody positive to O. tsutsugamushi. Among the hantavirus IgM antibody negative sera, 8.2% (4/49) of sera were positive to O. tsutsugamushi.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that some scrub typhus patients were misdiagnosed as HFRS and co-infection of scrub typhus and HFRS might exist in China.

33764984,"Effects and interaction of meteorological factors on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence in Huludao City, northeastern China, 2007-2018.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease, is a severe public health threat. Previous studies have discovered the influence of meteorological factors on HFRS incidence, while few studies have concentrated on the stratified analysis of delayed effects and interaction effects of meteorological factors on HFRS.
OBJECTIVE: Huludao City is a representative area in north China that suffers from HFRS with primary transmission by Rattus norvegicus. This study aimed to evaluate the climate factors of lag, interaction, and stratified effects of meteorological factors on HFRS incidence in Huludao City.
METHODS: Our researchers collected meteorological data and epidemiological data of HFRS cases in Huludao City during 2007-2018. First, a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) for a maximum lag of 16 weeks was developed to assess the respective lag effect of temperature, precipitation, and humidity on HFRS incidence. We then constructed a generalized additive model (GAM) to explore the interaction effect between temperature and the other two meteorological factors on HFRS incidence and the stratified effect of meteorological factors.
RESULTS: During the study period, 2751 cases of HFRS were reported in Huludao City. The incidence of HFRS showed a seasonal trend and peak times from February to May. Using the median WAT, median WTP, and median WARH as the reference, the results of DLNM showed that extremely high temperature (97.5th percentile of WAT) had significant associations with HFRS at lag week 15 (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04-2.74) and lag week 16 (RR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.31-5.95). Under the extremely low temperature (2.5th percentile of WAT), the RRs of HFRS infection were significant at lag week 5 (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01-1.67) and lag 6 weeks (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01-1.57). The RRs of relative humidity were statistically significant at lag week 10 (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.00-1.43) and lag week 11 (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.50) under extremely high relative humidity (97.5th percentile of WARH); however, no statistically significance was observed under extremely low relative humidity (2.5th percentile of WARH). The RRs were significantly high when WAT was -10 degrees Celsius (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76), -9 degrees Celsius (1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.79), and -8 degrees Celsius (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.75) at lag week 5 and more than 23 degrees Celsius after 15 weeks. Interaction and stratified analyses showed that the risk of HFRS infection reached its highest when both temperature and precipitation were at a high level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that meteorological factors, including temperature and humidity, have delayed effects on the occurrence of HFRS in the study area, and the effect of temperature can be modified by humidity and precipitation. Public health professionals should pay more attention to HFRS control when the weather conditions of high temperature with more substantial precipitation and 15 weeks after the temperature is higher than 23 degrees Celsius.","['Sun W', 'Liu X', 'Li W', 'Mao Z', 'Sun J', 'Lu L']",2021,15,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sun W, et al.

33731024,Acute pancreatitis associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: a cohort study of 346 patients.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with HFRS admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2013 to July 2020 were enrolled. Patients with and without AP were compared by two risk stratification models: (1) a multivariate regression analysis using propensity score to adjust for confounding and (2) a propensity-matched nested case-control study.
RESULTS: A total of 346 patients were enrolled in the cohort study, 29 of whom (8.4%) were diagnosed as AP. There was no significant difference between patients with and without AP with regards to common risk factors and presenting signs/symptoms other than gastrointestinal symptoms (p < 0.01). The patients with AP had a significantly higher 90-day mortality rate (24.1% vs. 3.5%, OR 8.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 103.4, p = 0.045), and significantly shorter duration of therapy free-days to 28 day such as RRT and mechanical ventilation free days (p < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that AP was independently associated with higher mortality in HFRS patients. While considering the difficulty of early recognition of AP among HFRS patients with similar signs and/or symptoms, further laboratory and imaging studies might help identify these patients at risk of poor clinical prognosis.","['Guo Q', 'Xu J', 'Shi Q', 'Du B']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Guo Q, et al.

33725011,Improving the precision of modeling the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in mainland China with an ensemble machine learning approach.,"OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), one of the main public health concerns in mainland China, is a group of clinically similar diseases caused by hantaviruses. Statistical approaches have always been leveraged to forecast the future incidence rates of certain infectious diseases to effectively control their prevalence and outbreak potential. Compared to the use of one base model, model stacking can often produce better forecasting results. In this study, we fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS in mainland China with a model stacking approach and compared its forecasting performance with those of five base models.
METHOD: We fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS ranging from January 2004 to June 2019 in mainland China with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; the Holt-Winter (HW) method, seasonal decomposition of the time series by LOESS (STL); a neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model; and an exponential smoothing state space model with a Box-Cox transformation; ARMA errors; and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and we combined the forecasting results with the inverse rank approach. The forecasting performance was estimated based on several accuracy criteria for model prediction, including the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
RESULT: There was a slight downward trend and obvious seasonal periodicity inherent in the time series data for HFRS in mainland China. The model stacking method was selected as the best approach with the best performance in terms of both fitting (RMSE 128.19, MAE 85.63, MAPE 8.18) and prediction (RMSE 151.86, MAE 118.28, MAPE 13.16).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that model stacking by using the optimal mean forecasting weight of the five abovementioned models achieved the best performance in terms of predicting HFRS one year into the future. This study has corroborated the conclusion that model stacking is an easy way to enhance prediction accuracy when modeling HFRS.","['Ye GH', 'Alim M', 'Guan P', 'Huang DS', 'Zhou BS', 'Wu W']",2021,16,3,PLoS One,"Ye GH, et al.

33705105,"Insights into the Occurrence, Fate, and Impacts of Halogenated Flame Retardants in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants.","Halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) have been extensively used in various consumer products and many are classified as persistent organic pollutants due to their resistance to degradation, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity. HFRs have been widely detected in the municipal wastewater and wastewater treatment solids in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the discharge and agricultural application of which represent a primary source of environmental HFRs contamination. This review seeks to provide a current overview on the occurrence, fate, and impacts of HFRs in WWTPs around the globe. We first summarize studies recording the occurrence of representative HFRs in wastewater and wastewater treatment solids, revealing temporal and geographical trends in HFRs distribution. Then, the efficiency and mechanism of HFRs removal by biosorption, which is known to be the primary process for HFRs removal from wastewater, during biological wastewater treatment processes, are discussed. Transformation of HFRs via abiotic and biotic processes in laboratory tests and full-scale WWTPs is reviewed with particular emphasis on the transformation pathways and functional microorganisms responsible for HFRs biotransformation. Finally, the potential impacts of HFRs on reactor performance (i.e., nitrogen removal and methanogenesis) and microbiome in bioreactors are discussed. This review aims to advance our understanding of the fate and impacts of HFRs in WWTPs and shed light on important questions warranting further investigation.","['Xu G', 'Zhao X', 'Zhao S', 'Chen C', 'Rogers MJ', 'Ramaswamy R', 'He J']",2021,55,8,Environ Sci Technol,"Xu G, et al.

33690725,Monocyte subset redistribution from blood to kidneys in patients with Puumala virus caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Innate immune cells like monocytes patrol the vasculature and mucosal surfaces, recognize pathogens, rapidly redistribute to affected tissues and cause inflammation by secretion of cytokines. We previously showed that monocytes are reduced in blood but accumulate in the airways of patients with Puumala virus (PUUV) caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). However, the dynamics of monocyte infiltration to the kidneys during HFRS, and its impact on disease severity are currently unknown. Here, we examined longitudinal peripheral blood samples and renal biopsies from HFRS patients and performed in vitro experiments to investigate the fate of monocytes during HFRS. During the early stages of HFRS, circulating CD14-CD16+ nonclassical monocytes (NCMs) that patrol the vasculature were reduced in most patients. Instead, CD14+CD16- classical (CMs) and CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes (IMs) were increased in blood, in particular in HFRS patients with more severe disease. Blood monocytes from patients with acute HFRS expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, the endothelial adhesion marker CD62L and the chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCR2, as compared to convalescence, suggesting monocyte activation and migration to peripheral tissues during acute HFRS. Supporting this hypothesis, increased numbers of HLA-DR+, CD14+, CD16+ and CD68+ cells were observed in the renal tissues of acute HFRS patients compared to controls. In vitro, blood CD16+ monocytes upregulated CD62L after direct exposure to PUUV whereas CD16- monocytes upregulated CCR7 after contact with PUUV-infected endothelial cells, suggesting differential mechanisms of activation and response between monocyte subsets. Together, our findings suggest that NCMs are reduced in blood, potentially via CD62L-mediated attachment to endothelial cells and monocytes are recruited to the kidneys during HFRS. Monocyte mobilization, activation and functional impairment together may influence the severity of disease in acute PUUV-HFRS.","['Vangeti S', 'Strandin T', 'Liu S', 'Tauriainen J', 'Räisänen-Sokolowski A', 'Cabrera L', 'Hassinen A', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O', 'Klingström J', 'Smed-Sörensen A']",2021,17,3,PLoS Pathog,"Vangeti S, et al.

33638192,Immune response during hantavirus diseases: implications for immunotherapies and vaccine design.,"Orthohantaviruses, previously named hantaviruses, cause two emerging zoonotic diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. Overall, over 200 000 cases are registered every year worldwide, with a fatality rate ranging between 0·1% and 15% for HFRS and between 20% and 40% for HCPS. No specific treatment or vaccines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat or prevent hantavirus-caused syndromes. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms at the basis of hantavirus-induced disease. However, it has been hypothesized that an excessive inflammatory response plays an essential role in the course of the disease. Furthermore, the contributions of the cellular immune response to either viral clearance or pathology have not been fully elucidated. This article discusses recent findings relative to the immune responses elicited to hantaviruses in subjects suffering HFRS or HCPS, highlighting the similarities and differences between these two clinical diseases. Also, we summarize the most recent data about the cellular immune response that could be important for designing new vaccines to prevent this global public health problem.","['Saavedra F', 'Díaz FE', 'Retamal-Díaz A', 'Covián C', 'González PA', 'Kalergis AM']",2021,163,3,Immunology,"Saavedra F, et al.

33619733,Frailty and comorbidity in predicting community COVID-19 mortality in the U.K. Biobank: The effect of sampling.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Frailty has been linked to increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence is mainly limited to hospitalized older individuals. This study aimed to assess and compare predictive abilities of different frailty and comorbidity measures for COVID-19 mortality in a community sample and COVID-19 inpatients.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed (i) the full sample of 410,199 U.K. Biobank participants in England, aged 49-86 years, and (ii) a subsample of 2812 COVID-19 inpatients with COVID-19 data from March 1 to November 30, 2020.
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was defined using the physical frailty phenotype (PFP), frailty index (FI), and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), and comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). PFP and FI were available at baseline, whereas HFRS and CCI were assessed both at baseline and concurrently with the start of the pandemic. Inpatient COVID-19 cases were confirmed by PCR and/or hospital records. COVID-19 mortality was ascertained from death registers.
RESULTS: Overall, 514 individuals died of COVID-19. In the full sample, all frailty and comorbidity measures were associated with higher COVID-19 mortality risk after adjusting for age and sex. However, the associations were stronger for the concurrent versus baseline HFRS and CCI, with odds ratios of 20.40 (95% confidence interval = 16.24-25.63) comparing high (>15) to low (<5) concurrent HFRS risk category and 1.53 (1.48-1.59) per point increase in concurrent CCI. Moreover, only the concurrent HFRS or CCI significantly improved predictive ability of a model including age and sex, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.8. When restricting analyses to COVID-19 inpatients, similar improvement in AUC was not observed.
CONCLUSION: HFRS and CCI constructed from medical records concurrent with the start of the pandemic can be used in COVID-19 mortality risk stratification at the population level, but they show limited added value in COVID-19 inpatients.","['Mak JKL', 'Kuja-Halkola R', 'Wang Y', 'Hägg S', 'Jylhävä J']",2021,69,5,J Am Geriatr Soc,"Mak JKL, et al.

During the same period, wild-caught ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) were equipped on their back with a similar miniature PAS that was deployed in the landfill along with a GPS datalogger to monitor their movements for ten days. Elevated concentrations of certain OPEs (e.g., tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate) and brominated diphenyl ether (BDE)-209 were measured in stationary PASs and AASs, although they were homogenously distributed within this landfill site. Temporal variability was observed for concentrations of BDE-209, -99 and -47 measured in AASs as well as tributyl phosphate during the 34-day deployment period. Moreover, air concentrations of BDE-209, -207 and -206 and selected OPEs (tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and tris(methylphenyl) phosphate) determined using AASs were positively correlated with ambient air temperatures. Gulls that visited a landfill at least once exhibited significantly greater concentrations of BDE-47 measured in PASs they carried on their back, suggesting that landfill air may represent a source of exposure to PBDEs for these birds, and potentially other urban-adapted wildlife using these sites for foraging.","['Kerric A', 'Okeme J', 'Jantunen L', 'Giroux JF', 'Diamond ML', 'Verreault J']",2021,271,,Environ Pollut,"Kerric A, et al.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial correlations between urban characteristics, taking into account the socio-ecological aspects, and the emergence of infectious diseases. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression between the infectious disease emergence data and 14 urban characteristics, we analyzed 225 spatial units in South Korea, where there was a re-emergence of measles and a 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As results of exploratory spatial data analysis, the emerging infectious diseases had spatial dependence and showed spatial clusters. Spatial regression models showed that urban characteristic factors had different effects according to the type of infectious disease. Common factors were characteristics related to low socioeconomic status in water or food-borne diseases and manageable infectious diseases. Intermittent infections disease epidemics are related to high-quality residential environments and the response capacity of the local government. New infectious diseases are different than other infectious diseases, which are related to the ecological environment.

We assessed the prevalence, determinants and consequences of frailty among elderly patients in a hospital setting.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study in a Swiss university hospital.
METHODS: 22,323 patients aged ≥65 years hospitalized between January 2009 and December 2017 at the internal medicine ward were included. Frailty was defined by the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and patients were categorized as low (HFRS<5), intermediate (HFRS 5-15) and high (HFRS>15) risk.
RESULTS: Overall prevalence of intermediate and high risk of frailty was 43% and 20%, respectively; prevalence was higher in women and increased with age. Prevalence of high risk of frailty increased from 11.4% in 2009 to 31% in 2012, and decreased to 19.2% in 2017.

33380352,Hospital Frailty Risk Score Outperforms Current Risk Stratification Models in Primary Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Models for risk stratification and prediction of outcome, such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the Elixhauser Comorbidity Method (ECM), the 5-factor modified Frailty Index (mFI-5), and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) have been validated in orthopedic surgery. The aim of this study is to compare the predictive power of these models in total hip and knee replacement.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 8250 patients who had undergone total joint replacement between 2011 and 2019, CCI, ECM, mFI-5, and HFRS were calculated for each patient. Receiver operating characteristic curve plots were generated and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared between each score with regard to adverse events such as transfusion, surgical, medical, and other complications. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship among risk stratification models, demographic factors, and postoperative adverse events.
RESULTS: In prediction of surgical complications, HFRS performed best (AUC: 0.719, P < .001), followed by ECM (AUC: 0.578, P < .001), mFI-5 (AUC: 0.564, P = .003), and CCI (AUC: 0.555, P = .012). With regard to medical complications, other complications, and transfusion, HFRS also was superior to ECM, mFI-5, and CCI. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed HFRS as an independent risk stratification model associated with all captured adverse events (P ≤ .001).
CONCLUSION: The HFRS is superior to current risk stratification models in the context of total joint replacement. As the HRFS derives from routinely collected administrative data, healthcare providers can identify at-risk patients without additional effort or expense.","['Meyer M', 'Parik L', 'Greimel F', 'Renkawitz T', 'Grifka J', 'Weber M']",2021,36,5,J Arthroplasty,"Meyer M, et al.

Establishing an epidemic hot spot areas and prediction model is an effective means of accurate epidemic monitoring and surveying. Objective: This study predicted hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) epidemic hot spot areas, based on multi-source environmental variable factors. We calculated the contribution weight of each environmental factor to the morbidity risk, obtained the spatial probability distribution of HFRS risk areas within the study region, and detected and extracted epidemic hot spots, to guide accurate epidemic monitoring as well as prevention and control. Methods: We collected spatial HFRS data, as well as data on various types of natural and human social activity environments in Hunan Province from 2010 to 2014. Using the information quantity method and logistic regression modeling, we constructed a risk-area-prediction model reflecting the epidemic intensity and spatial distribution of HFRS. Results: The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of training samples and test samples were 0.840 and 0.816. From 2015 to 2019, HRFS case site verification showed that more than 82% of the cases occurred in high-risk areas.
DISCUSSION: This research method could accurately predict HFRS hot spot areas and provided an evaluation model for Hunan Province. Therefore, this method could accurately detect HFRS epidemic high-risk areas, and effectively guide epidemic monitoring and surveyance.","['Chen Z', 'Liu F', 'Li B', 'Peng X', 'Fan L', 'Luo A']",2020,14,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Chen Z, et al.

This question focuses on whether predators regulate the spillover transmission of rodent-borne diseases. No clear answer has emerged because of the complex linkages across multiple trophic levels and the lack of accessible data. Although previous empirical findings have suggested ecological mechanisms, such as resource partitioning, which implies protective effects from predator species richness, epidemiological evidence is needed to bolster these arguments. Thus, we investigated the association between predator species richness and incidence of rodent-borne haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the human population using district-level longitudinal data of 13 years for South Korea. With the exception of districts with low species richness, we found a significant negative association between the incidence of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and the species richness of both avian and mammalian predators; the trends for both predator types were similar. Thus, biodiversity conservation may benefit public health.","['Min KD', 'Kim H', 'Hwang SS', 'Cho S', 'Schneider MC', 'Hwang J', 'Cho SI']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Min KD, et al.

Pregnancy complicated with HFRS is rare; however, adverse maternal and foetal outcomes may be noted. In this report, we describe a case involving a pregnant woman with HFRS who was in a state of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and was successfully treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old pregnant woman at 29 weeks of gestation was hospitalised for a fever and upper respiratory tract infection due to HFRS in winter. Persistent fever, coagulation disorder, thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalance, abnormal liver function, and renal failure were noted during the progression of the disease. The patient was treated with CRRT. She recovered after 21 days, and delivered a live infant by caesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation. Furthermore, obvious abnormalities were not detected during the follow-up of the mother and infant at 42 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the delivery.

Eighteen halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were measured in plastics and soil separated from twenty soil samples, respectively, from an abandoned e-waste recycling site. Abundances and concentrations of plastic debris ranged from 600 to 14,200 particles/kg and 0.24-153 mg/g, respectively, which were at the high end in literature. Blue, black, and red were main plastic colors, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was the main type of plastics. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) 209 was the main chemical, with median concentrations of 6.22-40.6 μg/g in soil and 28.1-47.2 μg/g in plastics, respectively. Contributions of HFRs in plastics were less than 10% in total HFR masses in bulk soil samples. Exposure values to HFRs from plastics via soil ingestion and dermal contact with soil were generally two orders of magnitude lower than those from soil. The results indicate that plastics in soil have little contribution to total HFR burden in soil and human exposure risks to HFRs in this study.

33253144,"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreaks associated with climate variability in Northwestern Argentina, 1997-2017.","BACKGROUND: Rodent-borne hantaviruses (genus Orthohantavirus) are the etiologic agents causing two human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Euroasia; and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North and South America. In South America fatality rates of HPS can reach up to 35%-50%. The transmission of pathogenic hantaviruses to humans occurs mainly via inhalation of aerosolized excreta from infected rodents. Thus, the epidemiology of HPS is necessarily linked to the ecology of their rodent hosts and the contact with a human, which in turn may be influenced by climatic variability. Here we examined the relationship between climatic variables and hantavirus transmission aim to develop an early warning system of potential hantavirus outbreaks based on ecologically relevant climatic factors.
METHODOLOGY AND MAIN FINDINGS: We compiled reported HPS cases in northwestern Argentina during the 1997-2017 period and divided our data into biannual, quarterly, and bimestrial time periods to allow annual and shorter time delays to be observed. To evaluate the relationship of hantavirus transmission with mean temperature and precipitation we used dynamic regression analysis. We found a significant association between HPS incidence and lagged rainfall and temperature with a delay of 2 to 6 months. For the biannual and quarterly models, hantavirus transmission was positively associated with lagged rainfall and temperature; whereas the bimestrial models indicate a direct relationship with the rainfall but inverse for temperature in the second lagged period.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that climate variability plays a significant role in the transmission of hantavirus in northwestern Argentina. The model developed in this study provides a basis for the forecast of potential HPS outbreaks based on climatic parameters. Our findings are valuable for the development of public health policies and prevention strategies to mitigate possible outbreaks. Nonetheless, a surveillance program on rodent population dynamics would lead to a more accurate forecast of HPS outbreaks.","['Ferro I', 'Bellomo CM', 'López W', 'Coelho R', 'Alonso D', 'Bruno A', 'Córdoba FE', 'Martinez VP']",2020,14,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ferro I, et al.

There are no licensed vaccines for the prevention of HFRS in the European Region; there are no specific therapeutic to treat orthohantavirus infections. Here we report the results of candidate polyvalent HFRS vaccine preclinical studies. The vaccine was produced on the basis of three viruses: Puumala, strain PUU-TKD/VERO, Hantaan, strain HTN-P88/VERO, and Sochi, strain DOB-SOCHI/VERO. These viruses were inactivated with β-propiolacton, purified by gel filtration and aluminum hydroxide adsorbed. 18-20 g female BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly 2 or 3 times with a 2-week intervals and blood was taken 2 weeks after immunization.

33227583,"Biomarkers, matrices and analytical methods targeting human exposure to chemicals selected for a European human biomonitoring initiative.","The major purpose of human biomonitoring is the mapping and assessment of human exposure to chemicals. The European initiative HBM4EU has prioritized seven substance groups and two metals relevant for human exposure: Phthalates and substitutes (1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester, DINCH), bisphenols, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), halogenated and organophosphorous flame retardants (HFRs and OPFRs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), arylamines, cadmium and chromium. As a first step towards comparable European-wide data, the most suitable biomarkers, human matrices and analytical methods for each substance group or metal were selected from the scientific literature, based on a set of selection criteria. The biomarkers included parent compounds of PFASs and HFRs in serum, of bisphenols and arylamines in urine, metabolites of phthalates, DINCH, OPFRs and PAHs in urine as well as metals in blood and urine, with a preference to measure Cr in erythrocytes representing Cr (VI) exposure. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was the method of choice for bisphenols, PFASs, the HFR hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), phenolic HFRs as well as the metabolites of phthalates, DINCH, OPFRs and PAHs in urine. Gas chromatographic (GC) methods were selected for the remaining compounds, e.g. GC-low resolution MS with electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) for HFRs. Both GC-MS and LC-MS/MS were suitable for arylamines. New developments towards increased applications of GC-MS/MS may offer alternatives to GC-MS or LC-MS/MS approaches, e.g. for bisphenols. The metals were best determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS, with the particular challenge of avoiding interferences in the Cd determination in urine.

33226691,Frailty Is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Undergoing Diverse Major Surgeries.,"With a rising burden of cirrhosis surgeries, understanding risk factors for postoperative mortality is more salient than ever. The role of baseline frailty has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated the association between patient frailty and postoperative risk among diverse patients with cirrhosis and determined if frailty improves prognostication of cirrhosis surgical risk scores. This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. veterans with cirrhosis identified between 2008 and 2016 who underwent nontransplant major surgery. Frailty was ascertained using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of patient frailty on postoperative mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify incremental changes in discrimination for postoperative mortality when frailty was added to the risk prediction models, including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo Risk Score (MRS), and Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated With Liver Disease (VOCAL)-Penn. A total of 804 cirrhosis surgeries were identified. The majority of patients (48.5%) had high-risk frailty at baseline (HFRS >15). In adjusted Cox regression models, categories of increasing frailty scores were associated with poorer postoperative survival. For example, intermediate-risk frailty (HFRS 5-15) conferred a 1.77-fold increased hazard relative to low-risk frailty (HFRS, <5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03). High-risk frailty demonstrated a similarly increased hazard (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P = 0.03), suggesting a threshold effect of frailty on postoperative mortality. The incorporation of frailty improved discrimination of MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP for postoperative mortality, but did not do so for the MRS or VOCAL-Penn score. Patient frailty was an additional important predictor of cirrhosis surgical risk. The incorporation of preoperative frailty assessments may help to risk stratify patients, especially in settings where the MELD-Na and CTP are commonly applied.","['Mahmud N', 'Kaplan DE', 'Taddei TH', 'Goldberg DS']",2021,27,5,Liver Transpl,"Mahmud N, et al.

33178625,Comparison of Lymphocyte Populations in Patients With Dobrava or Puumala orthohantavirus Infection.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by Dobrava (DOBV) and Puumala (PUUV) orthohantaviruses, is an endemic disease in Slovenia. DOBV is mainly responsible for a more severe disease, whereas PUUV usually causes a milder form. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine whether any differences in lymphocyte population in patients infected with these two viruses exist. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMCs) were isolated from DOBV or PUUV infected patients and different lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed with flow cytometry. Decreased concentrations of lymphocyte subpopulation were observed in DOBV and in PUUV infected patients compared with a healthy control, which was especially evident in DOBV infected patients. The lower values of T cells are likely due to the extravasation of the activated cells from the circulation to the infected tissue. Higher percentage of NK cells were detected in DOBV infected patients in comparison to PUUV infected patients, which could be associated with a more severe HFRS caused by DOBV. PUUV infected patients had a significantly higher concentration of activated T cell subsets, expressing markers CD25, CD69, and HLA-DR in comparison to DOBV infected patients. Higher activation of T cell subsets in PUUV infected patients could be a contributor to a milder HFRS. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the relation between the protective and the harmful role of activated lymphocytes subsets in HFRS pathogenesis.","['Resman Rus K', 'Kopitar AN', 'Korva M', 'Ihan A', 'Petrovec M', 'Avšič-Županc T']",2020,10,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Resman Rus K, et al.

33154421,"Glomerular filtration barrier dysfunction in a self-limiting, RNA virus-induced glomerulopathy resembles findings in idiopathic nephrotic syndromes.","Podocyte injury has recently been described as unifying feature in idiopathic nephrotic syndromes (INS). Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection represents a unique RNA virus-induced renal disease with significant proteinuria. The underlying pathomechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that PUUV infection results in podocyte injury, similar to findings in INS. We therefore analyzed standard markers of glomerular proteinuria (e.g. immunoglobulin G [IgG]), urinary nephrin excretion (podocyte injury) and serum levels of the soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a proposed pathomechanically involved molecule in INS, in PUUV-infected patients. Hantavirus patients showed significantly increased urinary nephrin, IgG and serum suPAR concentrations compared to healthy controls. Nephrin and IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with severe proteinuria than with mild proteinuria, and nephrin correlated strongly with biomarkers of glomerular proteinuria over time. Congruently, electron microcopy analyses showed a focal podocyte foot process effacement. suPAR correlated significantly with urinary nephrin, IgG and albumin levels, suggesting suPAR as a pathophysiological mediator in podocyte dysfunction. In contrast to INS, proteinuria recovered autonomously in hantavirus patients. This study reveals podocyte injury as main cause of proteinuria in hantavirus patients. A better understanding of the regenerative nature of hantavirus-induced glomerulopathy may generate new therapeutic approaches for INS.","['Nusshag C', 'Stütz A', 'Hägele S', 'Speer C', 'Kälble F', 'Eckert C', 'Brenner T', 'Weigand MA', 'Morath C', 'Reiser J', 'Zeier M', 'Krautkrämer E']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Nusshag C, et al.

33147534,Validation of hospital frailty risk score to predict hospital use in older people: Evidence from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is among the most serious global public health challenges due to the rapid increase in the ageing population and age-associated declines in health. We aimed to validate hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) for its ability to predict prolonged hospital length of stay, 28-day unplanned readmission, repeated admission, and mortality in older people over a 15-year follow-up period.
METHODS: We linked data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) with hospital admission and National Death Index datasets to identify admitted patients and death dates. This study included patients with an index unplanned admission resulting in an overnight hospital stay in 2001-2016 and aged 75-95 years at the time of admission. HFRS and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were calculated from the hospital data using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Australia Modification (ICD-10-AM) diagnostic codes.
RESULTS: Of 2740 older women aged 75 years and over with unplanned admission, the proportions of patients with low, intermediate, and high frailty risks were 77.15 % (n = 2114), 20.95 % (n = 574), and 1.90 % (n = 52), respectively. The 15-year follow-up revealed that high frailty risk patients increased 5-fold in 2015 (15.67 % patients, mean age = 92.26 years) compared to 2001 (2.56 % patients, mean age = 77.96 years). Prolonged hospital length of stay was higher in the intermediate (AOR = 2.86, 95 %CI: 2.26, 3.62) and high frailty risk group (AOR = 4.26, 95 %CI: 2.32, 7.63) compared to the low frailty risk group. Frailty risk was not associated with unplanned or repeated hospital admission. However, the intermediate frailty risk group (AHR = 1.78, 95 %CI: 1.47, 2.17) and the high frailty risk group (AHR = 4.17, 95 %CI: 2.00, 8.66) had a significant risk of mortality compared to the low frailty risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the ability of HFRS to identify older, frail people at higher risk of prolonged hospital length of stay and increased mortality risk. However, we did not observe a significant association between HFRS and 28-day unplanned readmission or repeated hospital admission.","['Shebeshi DS', 'Dolja-Gore X', 'Byles J']",2021,92,,Arch Gerontol Geriatr,"Shebeshi DS, et al.

33144850,Hantavirus Infections-Treatment and Prevention.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hantavirus infection is an emerging zoonosis and there are two main clinical presentations, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although Hantavirus infections have a worldwide distribution with a high mortality rate, a safe and effective vaccine or an antiviral drug against the Hantavirus disease is yet to be available. This review summarizes all the efforts undertaken to develop medical countermeasures in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical trials against Hantavirus infections.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple antivirals are shown to be effective with limited evidence and recent studies on immunotherapy were not very conclusive. There are multiple vaccine candidates with evidence of conferring long protective immunity against Hantaviruses. Some of these had been already trialed on humans.
SUMMARY: At present, severe HPS or HFRS case management is purely based on supportive treatments, often in an intensive care unit. Rodent control and public health education and promotion play a major role in preventing Hantavirus infection.","['Dheerasekara K', 'Sumathipala S', 'Muthugala R']",2020,12,4,Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,"Dheerasekara K, et al.

33134187,Why Hantavirus Prevalence Does Not Always Increase With Host Density: Modeling the Role of Host Spatial Behavior and Maternal Antibodies.,"For wildlife diseases, one often relies on host density to predict host infection prevalence and the subsequent force of infection to humans in the case of zoonoses. Indeed, if transmission is mainly indirect, i.e., by way of the environment, the force of infection is expected to increase with host density, yet the laborious field data supporting this theoretical claim are often absent. Hantaviruses are among those zoonoses that have been studied extensively over the past decades, as they pose a significant threat to humans. In Europe, the most widespread hantavirus is the Puumala virus (PUUV), which is carried by the bank vole and causes nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans. Extensive field campaigns have been carried out in Central Finland to shed light on this supposed relationship between bank vole density and PUUV prevalence and to identify other drivers for the infection dynamics. This resulted in the surprising observation that the relationship between bank vole density and PUUV prevalence is not purely monotonic on an annual basis, contrary to what previous models predicted: a higher vole density does not necessary result in a higher infection prevalence, nor in an increased number of humans reported having NE. Here, we advance a novel individual-based spatially-explicit model which takes into account the immunity provided by maternal antibodies and which simulates the spatial behavior of the host, both possible causes for this discrepancy that were not accounted for in previous models. We show that the reduced prevalence in peak years can be attributed to transient immunity, and that the density-dependent spatial vole behavior, i.e., the fact that home ranges are smaller in high density years, plays only a minor role. The applicability of the model is not limited to the study and prediction of PUUV (and NE) occurrence in Europe, as it could be easily adapted to model other rodent-borne diseases, either with indirect or direct transmission.","['Reijniers J', 'Tersago K', 'Borremans B', 'Hartemink N', 'Voutilainen L', 'Henttonen H', 'Leirs H']",2020,10,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Reijniers J, et al.

33119731,Does identifying frailty from ICD-10 coded data on hospital admission improve prediction of adverse outcomes in older surgical patients? A population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: frailty is a major contributor to poor health outcomes in older people, separate from age, sex and comorbidities. This population-based validation study evaluated the performance of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, coded Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) in the prediction of adverse outcomes in an older surgical population and compared its performance against the commonly used Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).
METHODS: hospitalisation and death data for all individuals aged ≥50 admitted for surgery to New South Wales hospitals (2013-17) were linked. HFRS and CCI scores were calculated using both 2- and 5-year lookback periods. To determine the influence of individual explanatory variables, several logistic regression models were fitted for each outcome of interest (30-day mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and 28-day readmission). Area under the receiving operator curve (AUC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were assessed.
RESULTS: of the 487,197 patients, 6.8% were classified as high HFRS, and 18.3% as high CCI. Although all models performed better than base model (age and sex) for prediction of 30-day mortality, there was little difference between CCI and HFRS in model discrimination (AUC 0.76 versus 0.75), although CCI provided better model fit (AIC 79,020 versus 79,910). All models had poor ability to predict prolonged LOS (AUC range 0.62-0.63) or readmission (AUC range 0.62-0.65). Using a 5-year lookback period did not improve model discrimination over the 2-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: adjusting for HFRS did not improve prediction of 30-mortality over that achieved by the CCI. Neither HFRS nor CCI were useful for predicting prolonged LOS or 28-day unplanned readmission.","['Harvey LA', 'Toson B', 'Norris C', 'Harris IA', 'Gandy RC', 'Close JJCT']",2021,50,3,Age Ageing,"Harvey LA, et al.

33089059,Protecting the most vulnerable during COVID-19 and beyond: a case report on the remote management of heart failure patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) represent an important cohort. They are at increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. We outline how remote-only management strategies, which leverage transmitted health-related data, can be used to optimize care for HF patients with a CIED during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old man with HF, stable on medical therapy, underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in 2016. Modern CIEDs facilitate remote monitoring by providing real-time physiological data (thoracic impedance, heart rate and rhythm, etc.). The 'Triage Heart Failure Risk Score' (Triage-HFRS), available on Medtronic CIEDs, integrates several monitored physiological parameters into a risk prediction model classifying patients as low, medium, or high risk of HF events within 30 days. In November 2019, the patient was enrolled in an innovative clinical pathway (Triage-HF Plus) whereby any 'high' Triage-HF risk status transmission prompts a phone call-based virtual consultation. A high-risk alert was received via remote transmission on 11 March, triggering a phone call assessment. Upon reporting increasing breathlessness, diuretics were initiated. The prescription was remotely issued and delivered to the patient's home. This approach circumvented the need for all face-to-face reviews, delivering care in an entirely remote manner.
DISCUSSION: The challenges posed by COVID-19 have prompted us to think differently about how we deliver care for patients, both now and following the pandemic. Contemporary CIEDs facilitate the ability to remotely monitor HF patients by providing rich physiological data that can help identify individuals at elevated risk of decompensation using automated device-generated alerts.","['Ahmed FZ', 'Crosbie C', 'Kahn M', 'Motwani M']",2020,4,FI1,Eur Heart J Case Rep,"Ahmed FZ, et al.

33084078,Rare case of intracranial hemorrhage associated with seoul virus infection diagnosed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Seoul virus (SEOV) is a Hantavirus and the causative pathogen of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS). Diagnosing SEOV infection is difficult because the clinical presentations are often undistinguishable from other viral or bacterial infections. In addition, diagnostic tools including serological and molecular assays are not readily available in the clinical settings.
CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old male presented with fever and a sudden loss of consciousness in November 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed subdural hematoma, subfalcine herniation, and brain infarction. He developed thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases, but no rashes or obvious kidney damage. He reported having a rat bite. HFRS was suspected. The Hantavirus IgG was positive, and the metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) detected SEOV sequences directly in the blood.
CONCLUSION: This report highlights the importance of suspecting SEOV infection in febrile patients with thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes despite the absence of hemorrhagic manifestations of skin and renal syndromes. Next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for pathogen detection. Intracranial hemorrhage and brain infarction as extrarenal manifestations of HFRS are rare but possible as demonstrated in this case.","['Xie D', 'Xu W', 'Xian Y', 'Yuan X', 'Huang Z', 'You J', 'Bi X']",2021,35,2,J Clin Lab Anal,"Xie D, et al.

Viral genome-based surveillance at new expansion sites to identify HFRS risks plays a critical role in tracking the infection source of orthohantavirus outbreak. In the Republic of Korea (ROK), most studies demonstrated the serological prevalence and genetic diversity of orthohantaviruses collected from HFRS patients or rodents in Gyeonggi Province. Gangwon Province is a HFRS-endemic area with a high incidence of patients and prevalence of infected rodents, ROK. However, the continued epidemiology and surveillance of orthohantavirus remain to be investigated.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Whole-genome sequencing of HTNV was accomplished in small mammals collected in Gangwon Province during 2015-2018 by multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing. To elucidate the geographic distribution and molecular diversity of viruses, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of HTNV tripartite genomes. We inferred the hybrid zone using cline analysis to estimate the geographic contact between two different HTNV lineages in the ROK. The graph incompatibility based reassortment finder performed reassortment analysis. A total of 12 HTNV genome sequences were completely obtained from A. agrarius newly collected in Gangwon Province. The phylogenetic and cline analyses demonstrated the genetic diversity and hybrid zone of HTNV in the ROK. Genetic exchange analysis suggested the possibility of reassortments in Cheorwon-gun, a highly HFRS-endemic area.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence and distribution of HTNV in HFRS-endemic areas of Gangwon Province enhanced the phylogeographic map for orthohantavirus outbreak monitoring in ROK. This study revealed the hybrid zone reflecting the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of HTNV circulating in Gangwon Province.

33010546,Human exposure to halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants through informal e-waste handling activities - A critical review.,"Informal electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) handling activities constitute a potentially important source of halogenated (HFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) to the environment and humans. In this review, two electronic databases (ScienceDirect and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for papers that addressed this topic. A total of 82 relevant studies (including 72 studies selected from the two databases and 10 studies located from the references of the first 72 selected studies) were identified that reported on human external and internal exposure to HFRs and OPFRs arising as a result of informal e-waste handling activities. Compared to the general population, higher levels of external exposure (i.e., inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption) and internal exposure (i.e., blood serum, hair, breast milk, urine, and other human matrices) to HFRs and OPFRs were identified for e-waste recyclers and residents inhabiting e-waste dismantling and recycling zones, especially for younger adults and children. Food intake and dust ingestion were the dominant exposure pathways for the majority of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and dechlorane plus (DP); while inhalation was identified as the most significant pathway of human exposure to OPFRs in informal e-waste sites. The majority of research to date has focused on China and thus future studies should be conducted in other regions such as Africa and South Asia. Other suggested foci of future research are: examination of exposure via dermal contact with e-waste, dietary exposure of local populations to OPFRs, confirmation of the existence of and cause(s) of the higher body burdens of females compared with males amongst populations impacted by informal e-waste handling, and characterisation of exposure of such populations to chlorinated paraffins.","['Ma Y', 'Stubbings WA', 'Cline-Cole R', 'Harrad S']",2021,268,Pt A,Environ Pollut,"Ma Y, et al.

33004084,"Investigation on risk factors of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Xuancheng City in Anhui Province, Mainland China.","Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease, is a major public health concern in both developed and developing countries. China is the most severe endemic country in the world, constituting 90% of the cases. Although the incidence of HFRS has substantively decreased in most areas of China, HFRS has rebounded remarkably in some epidemic areas. Xuancheng is one of these areas. In this study, we collected the case data reported recently in Xuancheng and designed a 1:3 case-control study. The Chi-square test, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. In all cases, farmers made up the highest proportion of occupations. And there were 20 variables with statistical significance including indoor hygienic conditions; the surrounding environment; whether bitten by rats at work and other criteria. In addition, exposure to rodents and rats bites is a high-risk factor for HFRS. Rodent density was calculated at 20.9% (159/760), the virus carrier rate was 9.4% (15/159) and the index of rats with a virus was about 2.0%. Exposure to rodents and insect bites is also high-risk factors for HFRS among local residents in Xuancheng. More importantly, during the flood years, the increased density of rodents led to an increased risk of human exposure to rodents. As our statistical analysis proves, targeted strategies should be developed and implemented to reduce the incidence of local diseases in the future.","['Wu G', 'Xia Z', 'Wang F', 'Wu J', 'Cheng D', 'Chen X', 'Liu H', 'Du Z']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Wu G, et al.

This study aims to using seasonal autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (SARFIMA) model to predict the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and comparing with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to evaluate its prediction effect.
METHODS: Data on notified HFRS cases in Weifang city, Shandong Province were collected from the official website and Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2018. The SARFIMA model considering both the short memory and long memory was performed to fit and predict the HFRS series. Besides, we compared accuracy of fit and prediction between SARFIMA and SARIMA which was used widely in infectious diseases.
RESULTS: Model assessments indicated that the SARFIMA model has better goodness of fit (SARFIMA (1, 0.11, 2)(1, 0, 1)
CONCLUSIONS: The SARFIMA model produces superior forecast performance than the SARIMA model for HFRS. Hence, the SARFIMA model may help to improve the forecast of monthly HFRS incidence based on a long-range dataset.","['Qi C', 'Zhang D', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu L', 'Li C', 'Wang Z', 'Li X']",2020,20,1,BMC Med Res Methodol,"Qi C, et al.

32993044,How Bank Vole-PUUV Interactions Influence the Eco-Evolutionary Processes Driving Nephropathia Epidemica Epidemiology-An Experimental and Genomic Approach.,"In Europe, Puumala virus (PUUV) is responsible for nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Despite the presence of its reservoir, the bank vole, on most of French territory, the geographic distribution of NE cases is heterogeneous and NE endemic and non-endemic areas have been reported. In this study we analyzed whether bank vole-PUUV interactions could partly shape these epidemiological differences. We performed crossed-experimental infections using wild bank voles from French endemic (Ardennes) and non-endemic (Loiret) areas and two French PUUV strains isolated from these areas. The serological response and dynamics of PUUV infection were compared between the four cross-infection combinations. Due to logistical constraints, this study was based on a small number of animals. Based on this experimental design, we saw a stronger serological response and presence of PUUV in excretory organs (bladder) in bank voles infected with the PUUV endemic strain. Moreover, the within-host viral diversity in excretory organs seemed to be higher than in other non-excretory organs for the NE endemic cross-infection but not for the NE non-endemic cross-infection. Despite the small number of rodents included, our results showed that genetically different PUUV strains and in a lesser extent their interaction with sympatric bank voles, could affect virus replication and diversity. This could impact PUUV excretion/transmission between rodents and to humans and in turn at least partly shape NE epidemiology in France.","['Madrières S', 'Tatard C', 'Murri S', 'Vulin J', 'Galan M', 'Piry S', 'Pulido C', 'Loiseau A', 'Artige E', 'Benoit L', 'Leménager N', 'Lakhdar L', 'Charbonnel N', 'Marianneau P', 'Castel G']",2020,9,10,Pathogens,"Madrières S, et al.

DESIGN: Single-center observational study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to geriatric care in a large hospital in Sweden between March 1 and June 11, 2020; 250 were treated for COVID-19 and 717 for other diagnoses.
METHODS: COVID-19 diagnosis was clinically confirmed by positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test or, if negative, by other methods. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records, which included Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and were further used for assessments of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). In-hospital mortality and home discharge were followed up for up to 25 and 28 days, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex were used.
RESULTS: Among the patients with COVID-19, in-hospital mortality rate was 24% and home discharge rate was 44%. Higher age was associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 per each year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01‒1.08) and lower probability of home discharge (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95‒0.99). CFS (>5) and CCI, but not HFRS, were predictive of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02‒3.65 and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02‒1.58, respectively). Patients with CFS >5 had a lower probability of being discharged home (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25‒0.58). CCI and HFRS were not associated with home discharge. In general, effects were more pronounced in men. Acute kidney injury was associated with in-hospital mortality and hypertension with discharge to home. Other comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, chronic kidney disease and dementia) were not associated with either outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Of all geriatric patients with COVID-19, 3 out of 4 survived during the study period. Our results indicate that in addition to age, the level of frailty is a useful predictor of short-term COVID-19 outcomes in geriatric patients.","['Hägg S', 'Jylhävä J', 'Wang Y', 'Xu H', 'Metzner C', 'Annetorp M', 'Garcia-Ptacek S', 'Khedri M', 'Boström AM', 'Kadir A', 'Johansson A', 'Kivipelto M', 'Eriksdotter M', 'Cederholm T', 'Religa D']",2020,21,11,J Am Med Dir Assoc,"Hägg S, et al.

In this review we will provide a comprehensive analysis of orthohantaviruses distribution and circulation in Eurasia and address the genetic diversity and evolution of Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV), which causes HFRS in this region. Current data indicate that the geographical location and migration of the natural hosts can lead to the orthohantaviruses genetic diversity as the rodents adapt to the new environmental conditions. The data shows that a high level of diversity characterizes the genome of orthohantaviruses, and the PUUV genome is the most divergent. The reasons for the high genome diversity are mainly caused by point mutations and reassortment, which occur in the genome segments. However, it still remains unclear whether this diversity is linked to the disease's severity.

32944684,Early Chest Imaging in Patients with Puumala Hantavirus Infection.,"PURPOSE: To describe early chest imaging abnormalities in patients with acute Puumala virus infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study (2005-2017) comprised 64 patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a Belgian hospital. These patients were diagnosed with serologically confirmed acute Puumala virus infection and had at least one chest X-ray (CRX). Imaging studies were evaluated by two experienced chest radiologists reaching agreement by consensus, and abnormalities were reported according to the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging. When a patient underwent multiple CRX, only the findings of the first were recorded. Six patients underwent chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
RESULTS: CRX showed abnormal findings in 33 patients (51.5%). Most common findings were linear atelectasis (29.7%) and small pleural effusion (20.3%). HRCT showed interlobular septal thickening in four patients and crazy-paving pattern with consolidations in one patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Early CRX commonly showed linear atelectasis and small pleural effusion in Puumala virus infected patients above 30 years of age. Chest HRCT most frequently showed atelectasis and smooth interlobular septal thickening. While uncommon, early and severe pulmonary involvement can be associated with Puumala virus infection, albeit these findings are not specific.","['Lebecque O', 'Falticeanu A', 'Abraham C', 'Dupont M']",2020,104,1,J Belg Soc Radiol,"Lebecque O, et al.

32936395,Heterozygous TLR3 Mutation in Patients with Hantavirus Encephalitis.,"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is common in Northern Europe; this infection is usually self-limited and severe complications are uncommon. PUUV and other hantaviruses, however, can rarely cause encephalitis. The pathogenesis of these rare and severe events is unknown. In this study, we explored the possibility that genetic defects in innate anti-viral immunity, as analogous to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mutations seen in HSV-1 encephalitis, may explain PUUV encephalitis. We completed exome sequencing of seven adult patients with encephalitis or encephalomyelitis during acute PUUV infection. We found heterozygosity for the TLR3 p.L742F novel variant in two of the seven unrelated patients (29%, p = 0.0195). TLR3-deficient P2.1 fibrosarcoma cell line and SV40-immortalized fibroblasts (SV40-fibroblasts) from patient skin expressing mutant or wild-type TLR3 were tested functionally. The TLR3 p.L742F allele displayed low poly(I:C)-stimulated cytokine induction when expressed in P2.1 cells. SV40-fibroblasts from three healthy controls produced increasing levels of IFN-λ and IL-6 after 24 h of stimulation with increasing concentrations of poly(I:C), whereas the production of the cytokines was impaired in TLR3 L742F/WT patient SV40-fibroblasts. Heterozygous TLR3 mutation may underlie not only HSV-1 encephalitis but also PUUV hantavirus encephalitis. Such possibility should be further explored in encephalitis caused by these and other hantaviruses.","['Partanen T', 'Chen J', 'Lehtonen J', 'Kuismin O', 'Rusanen H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Anttila VJ', 'Bode M', 'Hautala N', 'Vuorinen T', 'Glumoff V', 'Kraatari M', 'Åström P', 'Saarela J', 'Kauma H', 'Lorenzo L', 'Casanova JL', 'Zhang SY', 'Seppänen M', 'Hautala T']",2020,40,8,J Clin Immunol,"Partanen T, et al.

32903721,Orthohantavirus Pathogenesis and Cell Tropism.,"Orthohantaviruses are zoonotic viruses that are naturally maintained by persistent infection in specific reservoir species. Although these viruses mainly circulate among rodents worldwide, spill-over infection to humans occurs. Orthohantavirus infection in humans can result in two distinct clinical outcomes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). While both syndromes develop following respiratory transmission and are associated with multi-organ failure and high mortality rates, little is known about the mechanisms that result in these distinct clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify which cell types and tissues play a role in the differential development of pathogenesis in humans. Here, we review current knowledge on cell tropism and its role in pathogenesis during orthohantavirus infection in humans and reservoir rodents. Orthohantaviruses predominantly infect microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) of a variety of organs (lungs, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen) in humans. However, in this review we demonstrate that other cell types (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, and tubular epithelium) are infected as well and may play a role in the early steps in pathogenesis. A key driver for pathogenesis is increased vascular permeability, which can be direct effect of viral infection in ECs or result of an imbalanced immune response in an attempt to clear the virus. Future studies should focus on the role of identifying how infection of organ-specific endothelial cells as well as other cell types contribute to pathogenesis.","['Noack D', 'Goeijenbier M', 'Reusken CBEM', 'Koopmans MPG', 'Rockx BHG']",2020,10,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Noack D, et al.

32892457,"Frailty status, timely goals of care documentation and clinical outcomes in older hospitalised medical patients.","BACKGROUND: Hospitalised frail older patients are at risk of clinical deterioration. Early goals of care (GOC) documentation is vital to avoid futile/unwarranted interventions in the event of deterioration.
AIMS: To investigate the impact of frailty on timely GOC and its association with clinical outcomes in hospitalised older patients.
METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study of all medical patients aged ≥80 years admitted to the acute medical unit between 1/3/2015 and 31/8/2015, with GOC derived from electronic records. Frailty was measured using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) derived from hospital coding data. Primary outcome compared proportions of timely GOC within 72-h between frail (HFRS ≥ 5) and non-frail (HFRS < 5) patients. Exploratory secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, rapid response calls (RRC), prolonged length of stay (LOS) and 28-day readmission rates.
RESULTS: Of the 1118 admitted patients, 529 (47.3%) were frail. Timely GOC occurred in 50% (559/1118), more commonly in frail patients (283/529, 53.5%) than non-frail patients (276/589, 46.9%), P = 0.027. Frailty was positively associated with timely GOC independent of age and gender (odds ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-163; P = 0.041). In univariable analyses, timely GOC was associated with greater in-hospital mortality, RRC, and hospital LOS in both frail and non-frail patients (all P < 0.05) and greater 28-day readmissions only among frail patients (P = 0.028). Multivariable regression demonstrated that timely GOC was associated only with in-hospital mortality in both frail and non-frail patients, independent of age and gender.
CONCLUSION: Older frail hospitalised patients were more likely to have timely GOC than older non-frail patients. Timely GOC in such patients may avoid burdensome treatments.","['Subramaniam A', 'Tiruvoipati R', 'Green C', 'Srikanth V', 'Soh L', 'Yeoh AC', 'Hussain F', 'Bailey M', 'Pilcher D']",2021,51,12,Intern Med J,"Subramaniam A, et al.

The incidence of NE is highly heterogeneous spatially, whereas the geographic distribution of the wild reservoir of PUUV, the bank vole, is essentially homogeneous. Our understanding of the processes driving this heterogeneity remains incomplete due to gaps in knowledge. Little is known about the current distribution and genetic variation of PUUV in the areas outside the well-identified zones of NE endemicity. We trapped bank voles in four forests in French regions in which NE is considered non-endemic, but sporadic NE cases have been reported recently. We tested bank voles for anti-PUUV IgG and characterized the S segment sequences of PUUV from seropositive animals. Phylogenetic analyses revealed specific amino-acid signatures and genetic differences between PUUV circulating in non-endemic and nearby NE-endemic areas. We also showed, in temporal surveys, that the amino-acid sequences of PUUV had undergone fewer recent changes in areas non-endemic for NE than in endemic areas. The evolutionary history of the current French PUUV clusters was investigated by phylogeographic approaches, and the results were considered in the context of the history of French forests. Our findings highlight the need to monitor the circulation and genetics of PUUV in a larger array of bank vole populations, to improve our understanding of the risk of NE.","['Murri S', 'Madrières S', 'Tatard C', 'Piry S', 'Benoit L', 'Loiseau A', 'Pradel J', 'Artige E', 'Audiot P', 'Leménager N', 'Lacôte S', 'Vulin J', 'Charbonnel N', 'Marianneau P', 'Castel G']",2020,9,9,Pathogens,"Murri S, et al.

In this part, we explored whether Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection could induce ER stress in differentiated THP-1 (dTHP-1) cells. It showed that the mRNA and protein levels of ER stress-related 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78, HSPA5) and mRNA levels of X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), activating transcription factor 6(ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) after HTNV infection, were significantly higher than that in uninfected control group. However, the mRNA levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94, HSPC4), and inositol-requiring enzyme1 (IRE1) were not significantly different between the infected group and the untreated group in 2 h after virus infection. It is unusual in activating GRP78 but not GRP94. Meanwhile, dTHP-1 cells infected with HTNV at 12 h did not show obvious apoptosis. These results indicated that the HTNV infection could induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) in dTHP-1 cells, without directly leading to cell apoptosis during 12 h after virus infection.","['Li Z', 'Shen Y', 'Song Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang F', 'Chen L']",2021,26,1,Cell Stress Chaperones,"Li Z, et al.

The higher risk areas of the HFRS outbreak were mainly located in Jiangxi northern hilly state, spreading to Wuyi mountain hilly state as time advanced. This study provided valuable information for local public health authorities to design and implement effective measures for the control and prevention of HFRS.","['Yang S', 'Gao Y', 'Liu X', 'Liu X', 'Liu Y', 'Metelmann S', 'Yuan C', 'Yue Y', 'Chen S', 'Liu Q']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Yang S, et al.

32824680,Cystatin C and α-1-Microglobulin Predict Severe Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"Puumala orthohantavirus causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI), an abrupt decrease in renal function. Creatinine is routinely used to detect and quantify AKI; however, early AKI may not be reflected in increased creatinine levels. Therefore, kidney injury markers that can predict AKI are needed. The potential of the kidney injury markers urea, cystatin C, α1-microglobulin (A1M) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to detect early AKI during HFRS was studied by quantifying the levels of these markers in consecutively obtained plasma (P) and urine samples (U) for 44 HFRS patients. P-cystatin C and U-A1M levels were significantly increased during early HFRS compared to follow-up. In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, P-cystatin C, U-A1M and P-urea predicted severe AKI with area under the curve 0.72, 0.73 and 0.71, respectively, whereas the traditional kidney injury biomarkers creatinine and U-albumin did not predict AKI. Nearly half of the HFRS patients (41%) fulfilled the criteria for shrunken pore syndrome, which was associated with the level of inflammation as measured by P-CRP. P-cystatin C and U-A1M are more sensitive and earlier markers compared to creatinine in predicting kidney injury during HFRS.","['Hansson M', 'Gustafsson R', 'Jacquet C', 'Chebaane N', 'Satchell S', 'Thunberg T', 'Ahlm C', 'Fors Connolly AM']",2020,9,8,Pathogens,"Hansson M, et al.

32817670,Genetic diversity and evolution of Hantaan virus in China and its neighbors.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV; family Hantaviridae, order Bunyavirales) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which has raised serious concerns in Eurasia, especially in China, Russia, and South Korea. Previous studies reported genetic diversity and phylogenetic features of HTNV in different parts of China, but the analyses from the holistic perspective are rare.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand HTNV genetic diversity and gene evolution, we analyzed all available complete sequences derived from the small (S) and medium (M) segments with bioinformatic tools. Eleven phylogenetic groups were defined and showed geographic clustering; 42 significant amino acid variant sites were found, and 19 of them were located in immune epitopes; nine recombinant events and eight reassortments with highly divergent sequences were found and analyzed. We found that sequences from Guizhou showed high genetic divergence, contributing to multiple lineages of the phylogenetic tree and also to the recombination and reassortment events. Bayesian stochastic search variable selection analysis revealed that Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, and Guizhou played important roles in HTNV evolution and migration; the virus may originate from Zhejiang Province in the eastern part of China; and the virus population size expanded from the 1980s to 1990s.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings revealed the original and evolutionary features of HTNV, which will help to illustrate hantavirus epidemic trends, thus aiding in disease control and prevention.","['Li N', 'Li A', 'Liu Y', 'Wu W', 'Li C', 'Yu D', 'Zhu Y', 'Li J', 'Li D', 'Wang S', 'Liang M']",2020,14,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Li N, et al.

32808389,Exosomal miR-145-5p derived from orthohantavirus-infected endothelial cells inhibits HTNV infection.,"Human infection of orthohantavirus can cause potentially fatal diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) in Eurasia. Exosomes are new carriers for information exchange between cells. Cumulative findings suggest that exosomes released from parental infected cells can block or promote viral infection in recipient cells, but the role of exosomes in hantavirus infection is poorly understood. In our study, we identified the exosomes derived from HTNV-infected human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Exo-HV) and found the antiviral properties of Exo-HV in the uninfected recipient cells. High-throughput sequencing revealed the distinctly expressed miRNAs transcriptomes in Exo-HV. MiR-145-5p, one of the abundant miRNAs packaged into Exo-HV, was found to be able to transferred to recipient cells and functioned by directly targeting M RNA of HTNV 76-118 and inducing type I interferon (IFN-I) response, thus, blocking the viral replication. Concluding, this study indicated that exosomes released by HTNV-infected HUVECs were able to transfer active molecules, miR-145-5p as a proving sample, to mediate novel anti-HTNV activity in the neighboring uninfected cells, which will help us to explore new strategies for the treatment of infectious disease utilizing exosomes with miRNA.","['Wang X', 'Chen QZ', 'Zan YX', 'Wang MR', 'Yan J', 'Guo WW', 'Li KJ', 'Liu YY', 'Luo F', 'Feng Y', 'Hou W', 'Xiong HR']",2020,34,10,FASEB J,"Wang X, et al.

32801786,Exploring the Dynamics of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome Incidence in East China Through Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the dynamics of incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) from 2000 to 2017 in Anqiu City, a city located in East China, and find the potential factors leading to the incidence of HFRS.
METHODS: Monthly reported cases of HFRS and climatic data from 2000 to 2017 in the city were obtained. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were used to fit the HFRS incidence and predict the epidemic trend in Anqiu City. Univariate and multivariate generalized additive models were fit to identify and characterize the association between the HFRS incidence and meteorological factors during the study period.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis results indicate that the annualized average incidence at the town level ranged from 1.68 to 6.31 per 100,000 population among 14 towns in the city, and the western towns exhibit high endemic levels during the study periods. With high validity, the optimal SARIMA(0,1,1,)(0,1,1)
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the SARIMA models can be used to characterize the fluctuations in HFRS incidence. Our findings add to the knowledge of the role played by climate factors in HFRS transmission and can assist local health authorities in the development and refinement of a better strategy to prevent HFRS transmission.","['Shi F', 'Yu C', 'Yang L', 'Li F', 'Lun J', 'Gao W', 'Xu Y', 'Xiao Y', 'Shankara SB', 'Zheng Q', 'Zhang B', 'Wang S']",2020,13,,Infect Drug Resist,"Shi F, et al.

32775816,The Clinical and Histopathological Feature of Renal Manifestation of TAFRO Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome is a severe subtype of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease, characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis, and organomegaly. Renal complication of this disease can be life-threatening and sometimes requires hemodialysis, but it has not been elucidated in detail.
METHODS: Case-series was designed to evaluate the renal histology of patients with TAFRO syndrome treated at our hospital.
RESULTS: Seven patients were eligible to the criteria. All of them had severe diuretic-resistant anasarca and 6 of 7 had mild proteinuria (<1 g daily). On light microscopy, all patients showed glomerular endotheliopathy characterized by endothelial cell swelling and a double contour of the glomerular basement membrane with mesangiolysis or mesangial loosening. Immunofluorescent staining and electron microscopy did not detect immune deposits in any patient. Electron microscopy revealed endothelial cell swelling with diffuse expansion of the subendothelial space, loss of mesangial architecture, and loss of endothelial cell fenestrations. Treatment with glucocorticoids and molecular-targeting agents, including tocilizumab and rituximab, improved renal dysfunction and anasarca. In 4 of 7 patients with persistent thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic events occurred despite platelet transfusion or thrombopoietin receptor antagonist therapy.
CONCLUSION: Severe diuretic-resistant anasarca with mild proteinuria and severe glomerular endotheliopathy were common characteristics of renal dysfunction due to TAFRO syndrome. In addition, endothelial changes mediated via interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that lead to vascular hyperpermeability and water leakage might contribute to anasarca, because molecular-targeting therapy directed against IL-6 or VEGF improved renal dysfunction and severe endothelial damage.","['Mizuno H', 'Sawa N', 'Watanabe S', 'Ikuma D', 'Sekine A', 'Kawada M', 'Yamanouchi M', 'Hasegawa E', 'Suwabe T', 'Hoshino J', 'Takaichi K', 'Kinowaki K', 'Fujii T', 'Ohashi K', 'Nagata M', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Ubara Y']",2020,5,8,Kidney Int Rep,"Mizuno H, et al.

32731475,Flash-Like Albuminuria in Acute Kidney Injury Caused by Puumala Hantavirus Infection.,"Transient proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI) are characteristics of Puumala virus (PUUV) infection. Albuminuria peaks around the fifth day and associates with AKI severity. To evaluate albuminuria disappearance rate, we quantified albumin excretion at different time points after the fever onset. The study included 141 consecutive patients hospitalized due to acute PUUV infection in Tampere University Hospital, Finland. Timed overnight albumin excretion (cU-Alb) was measured during the acute phase in 133 patients, once or twice during the convalescent phase within three months in 94 patients, and at six months in 36 patients. During hospitalization, 30% of the patients had moderately increased albuminuria (cU-Alb 20-200 μg/min), while 57% presented with severely increased albuminuria (cU-Alb >200 μg/min). Median cU-Alb was 311 μg/min (range 2.2-6460) ≤7 days after fever onset, 235 μg/min (range 6.8-5479) at 8-13 days and 2.8 μg/min (range 0.5-18.2) at 14-20 days. After that, only one of the measurements showed albuminuria (35.4 μg/min at day 44). At six months, the median cU-Alb was 2.0 μg/min (range 0.6-14.5). Albuminuria makes a flash-like appearance in PUUV infection and returns rapidly to normal levels within 2-3 weeks after fever onset. In the case of AKI, this is a unique phenomenon.","['Mantula P', 'Tietäväinen J', 'Clement J', 'Niemelä O', 'Pörsti I', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen J', 'Mäkelä S', 'Outinen T']",2020,9,8,Pathogens,"Mantula P, et al.

Numerous factors modify the risk of hantavirus transmission. This study explored the epidemiological characteristics, differences, and trends in terms of gender, age, season, and living areas of those diagnosed with domestically acquired HFRS in Taiwan from 2001 to 2019.
METHODS: We examined publicly available annual summary data on the domestic cases with HFRS from 2001 to 2019; these data were obtained from the web database of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
RESULTS: This study analyzed 21 domestic cases with HFRS from Taiwan's CDC databases. In this study of the cases of HFRS in Taiwan, a gradual increase in the cases of those aged ≥40 years acquiring the disease was noted, and a distinct pattern of seasonal variation (spring) was observed. Furthermore, more men had domestically acquired HFRS, and living in Taipei metropolitan area (6 cases [28.6%]) and the rural areas (Gao-Ping region, 9 cases [42.9%]) was identified as a potential risk factor. This study represents the first report of confirmed cases of domestically acquired HFRS from surveillance data from Taiwan's CDC, 2001-2019.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of longitudinal studies covering a wide geographical area, particularly for highly fluctuating pathogens, to understanding the implications of the transmission of zoonotic diseases in human populations.

Thus, it is necessary to pay attention to the three HFR potential development toxicity, which has not been conclusively addressed yet. The liver is the main organ that detoxifies our body; TBBPA exposure may lead to increased liver weight in rodents. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the developmental hepatic toxicity of the three HFRs with a human embryonic stem cell hepatic differentiation-based system and transcriptomics analyses. We mostly evaluated lineage fate alterations and demonstrated the three HFRs may have common disruptive effects on hepatic differentiation, with TCBPA being significantly more potent. More specifically, the three HFRs up-regulated genes related to cell cycle and FGF10 signaling, at late stages of the hepatic differentiation. This indicates the three chemicals promoted hepatoblast proliferation likely via up-regulating the FGF10 cascade. At the same time, we also presented a powerful way to combine in vitro differentiation and in silico transcriptomic analyses, to efficiently evaluate hazardous materials' adverse effects on lineage fate decisions during early development.","['Yang R', 'Liu S', 'Liang X', 'Yin N', 'Jiang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Faiola F']",2021,401,,J Hazard Mater,"Yang R, et al.

The pathogenesis of HFRS is complex and involves capillary leakage due to the infection of vascular endothelial cells. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hantavirus can induce apoptosis in many cells, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our studies showed that Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection could induce TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and sensitize host cells toward TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, TRAIL interference could inhibit apoptosis and enhance the production of HTNV as well as reduce IFN-β production, while exogenous TRAIL treatment showed reverse outcome: enhanced apoptosis and IFN-β production as well as a lower level of viral replication. We also observed that nucleocapsid protein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP) of HTNV could promote the transcriptions of TRAIL and its receptors. Thus, TRAIL was upregulated by HTNV infection and then exhibited significant antiviral activities ","['Chen QZ', 'Wang X', 'Luo F', 'Li N', 'Zhu N', 'Lu S', 'Zan YX', 'Zhong CJ', 'Wang MR', 'Hu HT', 'Zhang YZ', 'Xiong HR', 'Hou W']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Chen QZ, et al.

High internal exposure levels of PCBs and HFRs are harmful to human thyroid hormone (TH) equilibrium. To examine their disrupting effects on TH, we conducted a study on children (n = 114) of an e-waste recycling and a control area in South China. Concentrations of PCBs, HFRs, and TH levels were determined in serum samples. TH related proteins and their corresponding gene were also monitored as markers of such disruption. Levels of these chemicals in the exposed group were much greater than those in the control group. Results of the linear regression and generalized additive model indicated the presence of close relationships between the internal exposure levels and the responses of TH related proteins, gene expression. More extensive exposure concentrations of these chemicals led to higher expression of iodothyronine deiodinase I and decreased the concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone, expression of TH receptor α, indicating the exertion of discrepant and even contrary influences on equilibrium of TH, and a compensation of these mechanisms may kept the homeostasis of TH. These results for children warrant further investigation on the health risks of PCBs and HFRs exposure in e-waste area.","['Guo LC', 'Liu T', 'Yang Y', 'Yu S', 'Gao Y', 'Huang W', 'Xiao J', 'Ma W', 'Rutherford S', 'Zhang Y']",2020,742,,Sci Total Environ,"Guo LC, et al.

32542353,Utility of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score for Predicting Adverse Outcomes in Degenerative Spine Surgery Cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: As spine surgery becomes increasingly common in the elderly, frailty has been used to risk stratify these patients. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a novel method of assessing frailty using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. However, HFRS utility has not been evaluated in spinal surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of HFRS in predicting adverse outcomes of surgical spine patients.
METHODS: Patients undergoing elective spine surgery at a single institution from 2008 to 2016 were reviewed, and those undergoing surgery for tumors, traumas, and infections were excluded. The HFRS was calculated for each patient, and rates of adverse events were calculated for low, medium, and high frailty cohorts. Predictive ability of the HFRS in a model containing other relevant variables for various outcomes was also calculated.
RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) stays were more prevalent in high HFRS patients (66%) than medium (31%) or low (7%) HFRS patients. Similar results were found for nonhome discharges and 30-d readmission rates. Logistic regressions showed HFRS improved the accuracy of predicting ICU stays (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87), nonhome discharges (AUC = 0.84), and total complications (AUC = 0.84). HFRS was less effective at improving predictions of 30-d readmission rates (AUC = 0.65) and emergency department visits (AUC = 0.60).
CONCLUSION: HFRS is a better predictor of length of stay (LOS), ICU stays, and nonhome discharges than readmission and may improve on modified frailty index in predicting LOS. Since ICU stays and nonhome discharges are the main drivers of cost variability in spine surgery, HFRS may be a valuable tool for cost prediction in this specialty.","['Hannah TC', 'Neifert SN', 'Caridi JM', 'Martini ML', 'Lamb C', 'Rothrock RJ', 'Yuk FJ', 'Gilligan J', 'Genadry L', 'Gal JS']",2020,87,6,Neurosurgery,"Hannah TC, et al.

Early detection for its future epidemic trends plays a pivotal role in combating this threat. In this scenario, our study investigates the suitability for application in analyzing and forecasting the epidemic tendencies based on the monthly HFRS morbidity data from 2005 through 2019 using the nonlinear model-based self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and logistic smooth transition autoregressive (LSTAR) methods. The experimental results manifested that the SETAR and LSTAR approaches presented smaller values among the performance measures in both two forecasting subsamples, when compared with the most extensively used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method, and the former slightly outperformed the latter. Descriptive statistics showed an epidemic tendency of downturn with average annual percent change (AAPC) of -5.640% in overall HFRS, however, an upward trend with an AAPC = 1.213% was observed since 2016 and according to the forecasts using the SETAR, it would seemingly experience an outbreak of HFRS in China in December 2019. Remarkably, there were dual-peak patterns in HFRS incidence with a strong one occurring in November until January of the following year, additionally, a weak one in May and June annually. Therefore, the SETAR and LSTAR approaches may be a potential useful tool in analyzing the temporal behaviors of HFRS in China.","['Wang Y', 'Xu C', 'Wu W', 'Ren J', 'Li Y', 'Gui L', 'Yao S']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Wang Y, et al.

32484879,Seoul Virus Infection and Spread in United States Home-Based Ratteries: Rat and Human Testing Results From a Multistate Outbreak Investigation.,"BACKGROUND: During 2017, a multistate outbreak investigation occurred after the confirmation of Seoul virus (SEOV) infections in people and pet rats. A total of 147 humans and 897 rats were tested.
METHODS: In addition to immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM serology and traditional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), novel quantitative RT-PCR primers/probe were developed, and whole genome sequencing was performed.
RESULTS: Seventeen people had SEOV IgM, indicating recent infection; 7 reported symptoms and 3 were hospitalized. All patients recovered. Thirty-one facilities in 11 US states had SEOV infection, and among those with ≥10 rats tested, rat IgG prevalence ranged 2%-70% and SEOV RT-PCR positivity ranged 0%-70%. Human laboratory-confirmed cases were significantly associated with rat IgG positivity and RT-PCR positivity (P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). Genomic sequencing identified >99.5% homology between SEOV sequences in this outbreak, and these were >99% identical to SEOV associated with previous pet rat infections in England, the Netherlands, and France. Frequent trade of rats between home-based ratteries contributed to transmission of SEOV between facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Pet rat owners, breeders, and the healthcare and public health community should be aware and take steps to prevent SEOV transmission in pet rats and to humans. Biosecurity measures and diagnostic testing can prevent further infections.","['Knust B', 'Brown S', 'de St Maurice A', 'Whitmer S', 'Koske SE', 'Ervin E', 'Patel K', 'Graziano J', 'Morales-Betoulle ME', 'House J', 'Cannon D', 'Kerins J', 'Holzbauer S', 'Austin C', 'Gibbons-Burgener S', 'Colton L', 'Dunn J', 'Zufan S', 'Choi MJ', 'Davis WR', 'Chiang CF', 'Manning CR', 'Roesch L', 'Shoemaker T', 'Purpura L', 'McQuiston J', 'Peterson D', 'Radcliffe R', 'Garvey A', 'Christel E', 'Morgan L', 'Scheftel J', 'Kazmierczak J', 'Klena JD', 'Nichol ST', 'Rollin PE', 'Multistate Seoul Virus Outbreak Investigation Team']",2020,222,8,J Infect Dis,"Knust B, et al.

32417577,"Halogenated organic contaminants of concern in urban-influenced waters of Lake Ontario, Canada: Passive sampling with targeted and non-targeted screening.","Passive samplers are useful tools for monitoring hydrophobic, persistent, and potentially bioaccumulative contaminants in the environment. In this study, low density polyethylene passive samplers were deployed in urban-influenced and background nearshore freshwaters of northwestern Lake Ontario and analyzed for a broad range of both legacy halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). Non-targeted analysis was conducted for screening additional halogenated substances. For most compounds, concentrations were greatest in the industrialized Hamilton Harbour and more generally at sites that have stronger influences of wastewater effluent discharges and stormwater run-off through rivers and creeks. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain the dominant class of HOCs in water, with dissolved-phase concentrations ranging from 10 to 4100 pg/L (ΣPCBs), followed by polybrominated diphenylethers (ΣPBDEs; 14-960 pg/L) and the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; 22-290 pg/L). Several non-PBDE brominated flame retardants (nBFRs) and chlorinated Dechlorane-related compounds were detected, with hexabromocyclododecanes (ΣHBCDD; sum of 3 diastereoisomers) the most abundant (1.0-21 pg/L). Non-targeted screening of samples by high resolution mass spectrometry using Kendrick mass defect plots for data analysis indicated that several other halogenated compounds were present in waters at relatively high abundances compared to the flame retardants, based on semi-quantitative estimates. These included methyl-triclosan, four halogenated anisoles (2,4,6-tribromoanisole, dimethyl-trichloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and pentachlorothioanisole), and pentachloro-aniline. Dissolved-phase methyl-triclosan was estimated to contribute up to approximately 40% of the summed target HOC concentrations. Polyethylene passive samplers provided an excellent medium for both non-targeted screening of HOCs not currently included in monitoring programs and tracking brominated and chlorinated chemicals slated for reductions in uses and emissions through international (Stockholm Convention) and binational (Great Lakes) agreements.","['Zhang X', 'Robson M', 'Jobst K', 'Pena-Abaurrea M', 'Muscalu A', 'Chaudhuri S', 'Marvin C', 'Brindle ID', 'Reiner EJ', 'Helm P']",2020,264,,Environ Pollut,"Zhang X, et al.

The relationship between Hantaan virus infection and empty Sella syndrome (ESS) has rarely been reported.
PATIENT CONCERNS: This patient was a 54-year-old previously healthy Chinese male. He presented with fever, headache, and backache with dizziness and oliguria. Physical examination was notable for hypotension and the signs of conjunctival suffusion. His platelets decreased, and his urine protein was positive. Hantaan virus IgM and virus RNA were positive.
DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed as having HFRS. In his diuretic phase, his 24-hour urine volume was maintained at 10,000 mL, and his blood pressure was higher for a week. Then, he was diagnosed as having ESS after a series of examinations.
INTERVENTIONS: Hormone replacement therapy was given to this patient after the diagnosis ""ESS"" was made.
OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms improved, and he was discharged from the hospital soon after hormone replacement therapy.
LESSONS: Pituitary function examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) need to be considered to scan for ESS and panhypopituitarism in the patients with HFRS accompanied by diabetes insipidus.","['Chen H', 'Li Y', 'Zhang P', 'Wang Y']",2020,99,14,Medicine (Baltimore),"Chen H, et al.

32232013,RNA-Seq Revealed a Circular RNA-microRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network in Hantaan Virus Infection.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV), a Hantavirus serotype that is prevalent in Asia, causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with high mortality in human race. However, the pathogenesis of HTNV infection remains elusive. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in various pathogenic processes. Nevertheless, circRNA expression profiles and their effects on pathogenesis of HTNV infection are still completely unknown. In the present study, RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the circRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA expression profiles in HTNV-infected and mock-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A total of 70 circRNAs, 66 miRNAs, and 788 mRNAs were differently expressed. Several differentially expressed RNAs were validated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, we verified that some differentially expressed RNAs, such as circ_0000479, miR-149-5p, miR-330-5p, miR-411-3p, RIG-I, CMPK2, PARP10, and GBP1, promoted or inhibited HTNV replication. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis demonstrated that the host genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were principally involved in the innate immune response, the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, and the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was integrally analyzed. The data showed that there were many circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions in HTNV infection. By dual-luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed that circ_0000479 indirectly regulated RIG-I expression by sponging miR-149-5p, hampering viral replication. This study for the first time presents a comprehensive overview of circRNAs induced by HTNV and reveals that a network of enriched circRNAs and circRNA-associated competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) is involved in the regulation of HTNV infection, thus offering new insight into the mechanisms underlying HTNV-host interaction.","['Lu S', 'Zhu N', 'Guo W', 'Wang X', 'Li K', 'Yan J', 'Jiang C', 'Han S', 'Xiang H', 'Wu X', 'Liu Y', 'Xiong H', 'Chen L', 'Gong Z', 'Luo F', 'Hou W']",2020,10,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Lu S, et al.

32193903,Clinical Score System to Differentiate Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Patients from Patients with Scrub Typhus or Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with high mortality in East Asia. This study aimed to develop, for primary care providers, a prediction score using initial symptoms and basic laboratory blood tests to differentiate between SFTS and other endemic zoonoses in Korea.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with endemic zoonoses during a 3-year period (between January 2015 and December 2017) were retrospectively enrolled from 4 tertiary university hospitals. A prediction score was built based on multivariate logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Of 84 patients, 35 with SFTS and 49 with other endemic zoonoses were enrolled. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of SFTS included neurologic symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 12.915; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.173-76.747), diarrhea (OR, 10.306; 95% CI, 1.588-66.895), leukopenia (< 4,000/mm³) (OR, 19.400; 95% CI, 3.290-114.408), and normal C-reactive protein (< 0.5 mg/dL) (OR, 24.739; 95% CI, 1.812-337.742). We set up a prediction score by assigning one point to each of these four predictors. A score of ≥ 2 had 82.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 71.7%-87.5%) and 95.9% specificity (95% CI, 88.0%-99.2%). The area under the curve of the clinical prediction score was 0.950 (95% CI, 0.903-0.997).
CONCLUSION: This study finding suggests a simple and useful scoring system to predict SFTS in patients with endemic zoonoses.

32055888,Treatment of Ebola-related critical illness.,"PURPOSE: To explore contemporary clincial case management of patients with Ebola virus disease.
METHODS: A narrative review from a clinical perspective of clinical features, diagnostic tests, treatments and outcomes of patients with Ebola virus disease.
RESULTS: Substantial advances have been made in the care of patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), precipitated by the unprecedented extent of the 2014-2016 outbreak. There has been improved point-of-care diagnostics, improved characterization of the clinical course of EVD, improved patient-optimized standards of care, evaluation of effective anti-Ebola therapies, administration of effective vaccines, and development of innovative Ebola treatment units. A better understanding of the Ebola virus disease clinical syndrome has led to the appreciation of a central role for critical care clinicians-over 50% of patients have life-threatening complications, including hypotension, severe electrolyte imbalance, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure. Accordingly, patients often require critical care interventions such as monitoring of vital signs, intravenous fluid resuscitation, intravenous vasoactive medications, frequent diagnostic laboratory testing, renal replacement therapy, oxygen and occasionally mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: With advanced training and adherence to infection prevention and control practices, clinical interventions, including critical care, are feasible and safe to perform in critically ill patients.

32019494,A case-control study on the risk factors for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an endemic communicable disease in China, accounting for 90% of total reported cases worldwide. In this study, the authors want to investigate the risk factors for HFRS in recent years to provide the prevention and control advices.
METHODS: A community-based, 1:2 matched case-control study was carried out to investigate the risk factors for HFRS. Cases were defined as laboratory-confirmed cases that tested positive for hantavirus-specific IgM antibodies. Two neighbourhood controls of each case were selected by sex, age and occupation. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information and identify the risk factors for HFRS.
RESULTS: Eighty-six matched pairs were investigated in the study. The median age of the cases was 55.0 years, 72.09% were male, and 73.26% were farmers. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, cleaning spare room at home (OR = 3.310, 95%CI 1.335-8.210) was found to be risk factor for infection; storing food and crops properly (OR = 0.279 95%CI 0.097-0.804) provided protection from infection.
CONCLUSION: Storing food and crops properly seemed to be protective factor, which was important for HFRS prevention and control. More attention should be paid to promote comprehensive health education and behaviour change among high-risk populations in the HFRS endemic area.","['Wang X', 'Shen W', 'Qin Y', 'Ying L', 'Li H', 'Lu J', 'Lu J', 'Zhang N', 'Li Z', 'Zhou W', 'Tang F', 'Zhu F', 'Hu J', 'Bao C']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Wang X, et al.

32005266,Design and synthesis of HLA-A*02-restricted Hantaan virus multiple-antigenic peptide for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans with severe morbidity and high mortality. Although inactivated HFRS vaccines are given annually for prevention in populations, China still has the highest number of HFRS cases and deaths worldwide. Consequently, vaccination for HFRS requires the development of novel, more effective vaccines. Epitope peptide vaccines have been developed rapidly in recent years and are considered a novel approach for the prevention of infection. Specifically, the multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) design with preferable immunogenicity can arouse a satisfactory immune response for vaccination. However, there are few reports on the design and evaluation of MAP for HTNV.
METHODS: Three HLA-A*02-restricted 9-mer cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes on HTNV glycoprotein and one HLA-A*02-restricted 9-mer CTL epitope on the HTNV nucleocapsid, which have been proven to be immunoprotective in our previous study, were selected for the design of HTNV MAP. A four-branched HTNV MAP was evaluated by the IFN-γ-secreting enzyme-linked immunospot assay and proliferation induction capacity of CD8
RESULTS: The macromolecular HTNV MAP was designed with a polylysine core and four radially branched single CTL epitope chains. Importantly, HTNV MAP could stimulate CD8
CONCLUSIONS: The designed HTNV MAP could induce CTL responses ex vivo and may be considered a candidate for the design and development of novel HTNV peptide vaccines.","['Ma Y', 'Tang K', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y']",2020,17,1,Virol J,"Ma Y, et al.

32000399,Clinical analysis of patients with acute pancreatitis complicated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and acute biliary pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare complication of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and is difficult to diagnose. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 7 cases of HFRS complicated with AP and 105 cases of acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP).Medical records of 83 hospitalized patients with HFRS and 105 hospitalized patients with ABP in the affiliated Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College were reviewed. The comparative analysis of patients between the 2 groups was conducted in terms of sex, age, duration of hospital stay, fever, hemorrhage, proteinuria, oliguria, laboratory results, radiologic examinations, and prognosis.A total of 83 patients were diagnosed with HFRS during study period. Only 8.43% (7/83) of the total HFRS patients were diagnosed with AP. The differences in the gender, age, and duration of hospital stay between the 2 investigated groups of patients were not statistically significant. The major symptoms for all 7 patients with HFRS complicated with AP and 105 patients with ABP were fever and upper abdominal pain. During the disease course of HFRS complicated with AP, 6 patients experienced hemorrhaging, and 7 patients underwent an oliguric stage, but none of the ABP patients experienced hemorrhaging and oliguria. Among the laboratory results of all patients, the differences in alanine aminotransferase and glycemia were not statistically significant. The other laboratory results (leucocyte count, platelet count, amylase, lipase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and serum calcium level) were significantly different during hospitalization. All 7 patients with HFRS complicated with AP received conservative medical treatment and hemodialysis. In the patients with ABP, 21 patients were discharged from the hospital after conservative treatment, 53 patients were treated by endoscopic invasive treatment after stabilization, and 31 patients were treated by surgery after stabilization.AP is not a frequent complication in patients with HFRS. There are differences in clinical manifestations and laboratory findings between the HFRS complicated with AP group and the ABP group; these differences may help in the differential diagnosis and treatment of these 2 types of pancreatitis.","['Wang WJ', 'Zhao J', 'Yang JS', 'Liang MM', 'Ni MY', 'Yang JH']",2020,99,5,Medicine (Baltimore),"Wang WJ, et al.

31957260,Serological investigation of orthohantaviruses in patients with fever of unknown origin in Kazakhstan.,"OBJECTIVE: Orthohantaviruses are geographically widely distributed and present various clinical manifestations from mild symptoms to the severe form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. Official registration of HFRS in Kazakhstan started in the year 2000. However, the true prevalence of human infections by orthohantaviruses within Kazakhstan is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate of the seroprevalence of orthohantavirus infections in patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) in two regions, Almaty and Kyzylorda region.
METHODS: Paired serum samples from 802 patients with FUO were screened for the presence of orthohantavirus IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA. Positive samples were further tested by immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence tests (IIFT) to determine the respective orthohantavirus serotypes. Suspected acute serum samples were additionally checked by a RT-PCR to identify viral RNA.
RESULTS: In total 178/802 (22.2%) serum samples reacted with orthohantavirus IgG antibodies and 4/802 (0.5%) with IgM antibodies. All positive samples were tested by immunoblotting which resulted in 2.9% positive samples with IgG antibodies against Puumala (PUUV), Hantaan (HTNV) and Dobrava (DOBV) virus serotypes in Almaty region and 5.4% to PUUV and DOBV serotypes in Kyzylorda region, respectively. In the IFFT, 1.9% positive samples from Almaty and 3.1% from Kyzylorda were confirmed for PUUV and DOBV serotypes. Out of four IgM ELISA positive samples only three were positive against PUUV in the immunoblot and showed weak positive reactivity for the Saaremaa (SAAV), PUUV and HTNV serotypes in the IFFT.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the presence of orthohantavirus infections among patients with FUO in Kazakh regions that were so far considered as non-endemic. The healthcare system needs to be prepared accordingly in order to be capable of detecting cases and providing adequate management of patients.","['Tukhanova N', 'Shin A', 'Abdiyeva K', 'Turebekov N', 'Yeraliyeva L', 'Yegemberdiyeva R', 'Shapiyeva Z', 'Froeschl G', 'Hoelscher M', 'Wagner E', 'Rösel K', 'Zhalmagambetova A', 'Musralina L', 'Frey S', 'Essbauer S']",2020,67,3,Zoonoses Public Health,"Tukhanova N, et al.

With more and more cases reported in countries with atypical morbidity, it is necessarily urgent to know some atypical symptoms and signs of Hantavirus infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a 44-year old male with a complaint of fever and diffuse abdominal pain, initially suspiciously diagnosed with acute peritonitis. The patient was eventually diagnosed as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and enhanced CT scan showed peritonitis. The clinical condition of the patient was relatively mild and he was recovered 9 days later.
CONCLUSION: Peritonitis secondary to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is rare in clinically practice.

31916559,Positive matrix factorization on source apportionment for typical pollutants in different environmental media: a review.,"A bibliometric analysis of published papers with the key words ""positive matrix factorization"" and ""source apportionment"" in 'Web of Science', reveals that more than 1000 papers are associated with this research and that approximately 50% of these were produced in Asia. As a receptor-based model, positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been widely used for source apportionment of various environmental pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as inorganic cations and anions in the last decade. In this review, based on the papers mainly from 2008 to 2018 that focused on source apportionment of pollutants in different environmental media, we provide a comparison and summary of the source categories of typical environmental pollutants, with a special focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), apportioned using PMF. Based on the statistical average, coal combustion and vehicular emission, are shown to be the two most common sources of PAHs, and contribute much more to emissions than other sources, such as biomass burning, biogenic sources and waste incineration. Heavy metals were mainly from agricultural activities, industrial and vehicular emissions and mining activities. Quantitative source apportionment on pollutants such as VOCs and particulate matter were also apportioned, showing a prominent contribution from fossil-fuel combustion. We conclude that, aside from natural sources, abatement strategies should be focused on changes in energy structure and industrial activities, especially in China. Source apportionment of typical POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) is less comprehensive and further study is required.","['Sun X', 'Wang H', 'Guo Z', 'Lu P', 'Song F', 'Liu L', 'Liu J', 'Rose NL', 'Wang F']",2020,22,2,Environ Sci Process Impacts,"Sun X, et al.

31864027,Changes in plasma biochemistry in breeding ring-billed gulls: Effects of anthropogenic habitat use and contaminant exposure.,"Gulls (Larids) have become successful at exploiting anthropogenic areas for foraging. However, little is known on the health implications of using anthropogenic habitats and on the associated exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly with respect to plasma biochemistry that is routinely used to diagnose physiological disorders and diseases. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of anthropogenic habitat use and exposure to ubiquitous halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) on plasma biochemistry of urban-breeding ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) from one of the largest colonies in North America. Miniature GPS dataloggers were used to characterize foraging habitat use of individual gulls (n = 39) at the regional scale (urban, waste management facilities, agricultural fields, and St. Lawrence River) in the Montreal area (QC, Canada), and plasma was analyzed for a suite of biochemical measures (waste products, lipids, glucose, ions, proteins, and enzymes) and HFRs. Several confounding biological and environmental variables were also assessed including sex, body condition, time spent fasting while incubating, plasma thyroid hormone levels, time of day, capture date, and ambient temperature. As ring-billed gulls (males and females combined) spent more time foraging in urban areas, their plasma concentrations of cholesterol, albumin and activity of alkaline phosphatase increased significantly. Moreover, as the gulls spent more time foraging in agricultural fields, their plasma concentrations of phosphorous and activity of aspartate aminotransferase increased significantly. Only the activity of aspartate aminotransferase was significantly positively related to plasma HFR concentrations (PBDEs and dechlorane-related compounds). Time spent fasting while incubating, plasma thyroid hormone levels, body condition, time of day, and capture date were significantly related to certain plasma biochemical measures. The present results suggest that both the use of anthropogenic habitats for foraging and exposure to HFRs may affect the plasma biochemistry of ring-billed gulls breeding in the densely-populated Montreal area, suggesting potential adverse health effects for avian wildlife living in highly urbanized environments.","['Marteinson SC', 'Verreault J']",2020,135,,Environ Int,Marteinson SC and Verreault J.

31841804,Landfills represent significant atmospheric sources of exposure to halogenated flame retardants for urban-adapted gulls.,"Halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) are contaminants that are abundantly emitted from waste management facilities (WMFs) and that became ubiquitous in air of urbanized regions. Urban birds including gulls have adapted to exploiting human food resources (refuse) in WMFs, and have thus experienced population explosions worldwide. However, foraging in WMFs for birds may result in exposure to HFRs that have been shown to be toxic for animals. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of foraging near or in various WMFs on the atmospheric exposure of birds to HFRs, and to localize other sources of HFRs at the regional scale in a highly urbanized environment. We measured the atmospheric exposure to HFRs in one of the most abundant gull species in North America, the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), breeding in the densely-populated Montreal area (Canada) using a novel approach combining bird-borne GPS dataloggers and miniature passive air samplers (PASs). We determined concentrations of 11 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and three emerging HFRs of high environmental concern in PASs carried by gulls. We show that the daily sampling rates (pg/day) of PBDEs in PASs were highest in gulls foraging in or around landfills, but were not influenced by meteorological variables. In contrast, the daily sampling rates of emerging HFRs were lower compared to PBDEs and were not influenced by the presence of gulls in or near WMFs. This study demonstrates that atmospheric exposure to HFRs and perhaps other semi-volatile contaminants is underestimated, yet important for birds foraging in landfills.","['Sorais M', 'Mazerolle MJ', 'Giroux JF', 'Verreault J']",2020,135,,Environ Int,"Sorais M, et al.

31841521,Identification and validation of specific B-cell epitopes of hantaviruses associated to hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Orthohantavirus infection is a neglected global health problem affecting approximately 200,000 people/year, spread by rodent hosts and associated to fatal human diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Circulation of HFRS-associated orthohantaviruses, such as Seoul, Gou, Amur, Dobrava and Hantaan, are supposed to be restricted to Eurasian countries even though their hosts can be a worldwide distribution. Few confirmed HFRS orthohantavirus infections in humans have been reported in American countries, but due to lower medical awareness of the symptoms of this zoonosis, it could be associated to viral underreporting or to misdiagnosis with several tropical hemorrhagic diseases. Serological evidence of orthohantavirus infections, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of immunoglobulin M and G against recombinant nucleoprotein protein, remains as an essential assay for viral surveillance. In this study, we aimed to identify in silico immunogenic B-cell linear epitopes present on orthohantavirus nucleoprotein that are exclusive to HFRS-related species.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In silico analysis were performed using Seoul orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (SHNP) sequence as a model. Linear B-cell-epitopes on SHNP and its immunogenicity were predicted by BepiPred-2.0 and Vaxijen algorithms, respectively. The conservancy of predicted epitopes was compared with the most clinically relevant HFRS or HCPS-associated orthohantavirus, aiming to identify specific sequences from HFRS-orthohantavirus. Peptide validation was carried out by ELISA using Balb/c mice sera immunized with purified recombinant rSHNP. Peptides cross-reactivity against HCPS orthohantavirus were evaluated using immunized sera from mice injected with recombinant Juquitiba orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (rJHNP).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In silico analysis revealed nine potential immunogenic linear B-cell epitopes from SHNP; among them, SHNP(G72-D110) and SHNP(P251-D264) showed a high degree of sequence conservation among HFRS-related orthohantavirus and were experimentally validated against rSHNP-IMS and negatively validated against rJHNP-IMS. Taken together, we identified and validated two potential antigenic B-cell epitopes on SHNP, which were conserved among HFRS-associated orthohantavirus and could be applied to the development of novel immunodiagnostic tools for orthohantavirus surveillance.","['Conte FP', 'Tinoco BC', 'Santos Chaves T', 'Oliveira RC', 'Figueira Mansur J', 'Mohana-Borges R', 'Lemos ERS', 'Neves PCDC', 'Rodrigues-da-Silva RN']",2019,13,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Conte FP, et al.

31838397,"Dietary intake of legacy and emerging halogenated flame retardants using food market basket estimations in Nanjing, eastern China.","Food products are inevitably contaminated by flame retardants throughout their lifecycle (i.e., during production, use, and disposal). In order to evaluate the dietary intake of legacy and emerging halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in typical market food in China, we investigate the distribution and profile of 27 legacy polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 16 emerging HFRs (EHFRs) in 9 food categories (meat, poultry, aquatic food, eggs, dairy products, cereals, vegetables, nuts and fruits, and sugar). A total of 105 food samples collected from three markets in Nanjing, eastern China were included for evaluation. The highest concentrations of PBDEs and EHFRs were found in aquatic foods (means of 0.834 ng/g wet weight (ww) and 0.348 ng/g ww, respectively), and the lowest concentrations were found in sugar (means of 0.020 ng/g ww for PBDEs and 0.014 ng/g ww for EHFRs). 2,2',4-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE-17), a legacy HFR, and hexabromobenzene (HBBz), an EHFR, were the predominant pollutants in the investigated food samples. Concentrations of HBBz and 2,3-dibromopropyl tribromophenyl ether (DPTE) were comparable to those of some PBDEs in certain food samples. The concentrations of the total EHFRs and total PBDEs found in animal-based food samples were significantly greater than those in plant-based food samples. Comparison of the estimated total dietary intake of HFRs and their corresponding non-cancer reference dose (United States Environmental Protection Agency) suggests a low overall health risk. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to simultaneously determine 27 PBDEs and 16 EHFRs in representative foods from Chinese markets. BDE-17, HBBz, and DPTE were the predominant congeners among the 43 investigated HFRs and meat and aquatic foods were the primary sources of PBDEs and EHFRs to the total local dietary intake.","['Jian K', 'Zhao L', 'Ya M', 'Zhang Y', 'Su H', 'Meng W', 'Li J', 'Su G']",2020,258,,Environ Pollut,"Jian K, et al.

31794140,Triage-HF Plus: a novel device-based remote monitoring pathway to identify worsening heart failure.,"AIMS: Remote monitoring of patients with physiological data derived from cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs) offers potential to reconfigure clinical services. The 'Heart Failure Risk Score' (HFRS) uses input from integrated device physiological monitoring to risk-stratify patients as low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk of a heart failure event in the next 30 days. This study aimed to evaluate a novel clinical pathway utilizing a combination of CIED risk-stratification and telephone triage to identify patients with worsening heart failure (WHF).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, single-centre, real-world evaluation of the 'Triage-HF Plus' clinical pathway (HFRS in combination with telephone triage) over a 27 month period. One hundred and fifty-seven high-risk HFRS transmissions were referred for telephone triage assessment. Interventions were at the discretion of the clinical assessor acting in accordance with clinical guidelines. An additional 3month consecutive sample of low and medium HFRS transmissions (control group) were also contacted for telephone triage assessment (n = 98). Successful telephone contact was made in 127 (81%) of referred high-risk HFRS cases: 71 (55.9%) were confirmed to have WHF requiring intervention; 19 (14.9%) had an alternative acute medical problem; one patient had been recently discharged from hospital with WHF; and 36 (28.0%) had no apparent cause for the high score. In the control group, only one patient had symptoms of WHF. The sensitivity and specificity of CIED-based remote monitoring to identify WHF 98.6% (92.5-100.0%) and 63.4% (55.2-71.0%), respectively.

This study examines a national cohort of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) regarding the prevalence of frailty, changes over time, and associated outcomes. The National Inpatients Sample was used to identify adults who underwent PCI procedures between 2004 and 2014. Frailty risk was measured using a validated Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) using the cutoffs <5, 5-15 and >15 for low, intermediate and high HFRS. From 7,306,007 admissions, a total of 94.58% of admissions were for patients who had a low HFRS(<5), 5.39% had an intermediate HFRS(5-15) and 0.03% had a high HFRS(>15). The prevalence of intermediate or high frailty risk patients has increased over time from 1.9% in 2004 to 11.7% in 2014. The incidence of in-hospital death increased from 1.0% with low HFRS to 13.9% with high HFRS. Mean length of stay also increased from 2.9 days to 17.1 days from low to high HFRS. High frailty risk was independently associated with an OR 9.91 95%CI 7.17-13.71 for in-hospital death, OR 4.99 95%CI 3.82-6.51 for bleeding and OR 3.96 95%CI 3.00-5.23 for vascular injury as compared to patients with low risk of HFRS.

In humans, orthohantavirus infection causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Whole-genome sequencing of the virus helps in identification and characterization of emerging or re-emerging viruses. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a potent method to sequence the viral genome, using molecular enrichment methods, from clinical specimens containing low virus titers. Hence, a comparative study on the target enrichment NGS methods is required for whole-genome sequencing of orthohantavirus in clinical samples. In this study, we used the sequence-independent, single-primer amplification, target capture, and amplicon NGS for whole-genome sequencing of Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) from rodent specimens. We analyzed the coverage of the HTNV genome based on the viral RNA copy number, which is quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Target capture and amplicon NGS demonstrated a high coverage rate of HTNV in Apodemus agrarius lung tissues containing up to 10","['No JS', 'Kim WK', 'Cho S', 'Lee SH', 'Kim JA', 'Lee D', 'Song DH', 'Gu SH', 'Jeong ST', 'Wiley MR', 'Palacios G', 'Song JW']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"No JS, et al.

31661589,The hospital frailty risk score in patients with heart failure is strongly associated with outcomes but less so with pharmacotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Although frailty is known to be an important prognostic factor in heart failure (HF), HF risk-adjustment models do not incorporate frailty measures and the interplay between frailty, age and pharmacotherapy is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships between frailty, pharmacotherapy and outcomes in heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all adults in Alberta, Canada hospitalized for the first time for HF between 2004 and 2016. Frailty was defined using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS).
RESULTS: In 26 626 patients (mean age 77.4 years), the 8887 (33.4%) defined as frail (HFRS ≥ 5) were older, had higher Charlson scores and more prior emergency department visits or hospitalizations. The HFRS and the Charlson Score were only weakly correlated (r = 0.35). Whilst more common in older patients (41.4% of patients 80 or older), frailty was present in 22.4% of patients younger than 65. Frail patients had longer lengths of stay and worse outcomes postdischarge, but adding the HFRS to age, sex and Charlson score did not improve prediction of events (c-statistics 0.69 for 30-day mortality after admission, and 0.54 for 30-day readmission/ED visit/or death after discharge). Frail patients younger than 65 were significantly more likely than nonfrail patients 80 or older to be prescribed high-dose evidence-based HF therapies (27.1% vs. 22.2%, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Although the HFRS reflects aspects of frailty that patient age and Charlson scores do not, the addition of the HFRS to standard risk prediction equations provides little additional information. Prescribing practices correlate more with patient age than frailty status.","['McAlister FA', 'Savu A', 'Ezekowitz JA', 'Armstrong PW', 'Kaul P']",2020,287,3,J Intern Med,"McAlister FA, et al.

31635002,Distribution of flame retardants in smartphones and identification of current-use organic chemicals including three novel aryl organophosphate esters.,"Smartphones have become an integral tool of society; in the year 2017, approximately 30% of the global population used smartphones. After their life cycle of use, most smartphones are not recycled and are instead discarded as e-waste, which increases the probability that chemicals they contain will eventually be released into the natural environment. In this study, the concentration and distribution of 52 major flame retardant (FR) chemicals were measured in eight components of seven models of largely produced smartphones. The results demonstrated that organophosphate esters (OPEs) were the principal FRs in these smartphone devices, while a suite of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), including 25 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were not detected. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) was the primary FR in the smartphones, followed by tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), triethyl phosphate (TEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), respectively.

This study examined the linkages between blubber concentrations of POPs and emerging HFRs, and transcription in skin of genes involved in the regulation of thyroid and steroid axes in belugas and minke whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary. In belugas, concentrations of PCBs, OCs and hexabromobenzene (HBB) were positively correlated with the transcription of thyroid- and/or steroid-related genes, while Dec-604 CB concentrations were negatively associated with the transcription of glucocorticoid and thyroid genes. In minke whales, PBDE concentrations changed positively with Esrβ transcript levels and HBB concentrations negatively with Nr3c1 transcripts.

While the goal of vaccinomics is to develop equations to describe and predict the immune response, it could also serve as a tool for developing new vaccine candidates and individualized approaches to vaccinology.

31564731,Viral haemorrhagic fevers in the Middle East.,"Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of infectious, devastating and severe diseases caused by enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The endemicity, emergence or re-emergence of different VHF viruses and lack of vaccines and antiviral therapy for most VHFs result in a significant global threat. Most VHF viruses are restricted to specific parts of the world, and the dramatic expansion of their geographical distribution beyond their original habitats would greatly affect global public health. In the past few decades alone, several outbreaks have affected the Middle East, a part of the world containing arid to semi-arid, hot and water-scarce countries. Political instability, natural and humanitarian crises, direct contact with domesticated animals and climate change are the main factors in the dissemination of different zoonotic diseases, including vector-borne diseases. Some VHF viruses have been introduced into the Middle East (e.g. Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever) and others have been re-introduced and have become endemic in the region. Dengue fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever and hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome are examples of re-emerging or endemic viruses in the region. The temporal and spatial extension of VHF distribution mandates a particular engagement from all the actors in the fields of animal, human and environmental health. The One Health concept is a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach for promoting collaboration, coordination and communication among different nations, sectors and disciplines, which is highly relevant to the fight against endemic, emerging and re-emerging infectious agents at the human-animal-environment interface. The adoption of the One Health approach is a promising solution to addressing public health threats in the Middle East.","['Zakham F', 'Alaloui A', 'Levanov L', 'Vapalahti O']",2019,38,1,Rev Sci Tech,"Zakham F, et al.

31553402,"Association of Frailty With 30-Day Outcomes for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia Among Elderly Adults.","IMPORTANCE: The addition of a claims-based frailty metric to traditional comorbidity-based risk-adjustment models for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia improves the prediction of 30-day mortality and readmission. This may have important implications for hospitals that tend to care for frail populations and participate in Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services value-based payment programs, which use these risk-adjusted metrics to determine reimbursement.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the addition of frailty measures to traditional comorbidity-based risk-adjustment models improved prediction of outcomes for patients with AMI, HF, and pneumonia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide cohort study included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years and older in the United States between January 1 and December 1, 2016. Analysis began August 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of mortality within 30 days of admission and 30 days of discharge, as well as 30-day readmission rates by frailty group. We evaluated the incremental effect of adding the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) to current comorbidity-based risk-adjustment models for 30-day outcomes across all conditions.
RESULTS: For 785 127 participants, there were 166 200 hospitalizations [21.2%] for AMI, 348 619 [44.4%] for HF, and 270 308 [34.4%] for pneumonia. The mean (SD) age at the time of hospitalization was 79.2 (8.9) years; 656 315 (83.6%) were white and 402 639 (51.3%) were women. The mean (SD) HFRS was 7.3 (7.4) for patients with AMI, 10.8 (8.3) for patients with HF, and 8.2 (5.7) for patients with pneumonia. Among patients hospitalized for AMI, an HFRS more than 15 (compared with an HFRS <5) was associated with a higher risk of 30-day postadmission mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.6; 95% CI, 3.4-3.8), 30-day postdischarge mortality (aOR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.7-4.3), and 30-day readmission (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.9-3.1) after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, race, and comorbidities. Similar patterns were observed for patients hospitalized with HF (30-day postadmission mortality: aOR, 3.5; 95% CI, 3.4-3.7; 30-day postdischarge mortality: aOR, 3.5; 95% CI, 3.3-3.6; and 30-day readmission: aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.8-3.0) and among patients with pneumonia (30-day postadmission mortality: aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.3-2.6; 30-day postdischarge mortality: aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.9-3.2; and 30-day readmission: aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.7-2.9). The addition of HFRS to traditional comorbidity-based risk-prediction models improved discrimination to predict outcomes for all 3 conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, frailty as measured by the HFRS was associated with mortality and readmissions among patients hospitalized for AMI, HF, or pneumonia. The addition of HFRS to traditional comorbidity-based risk-prediction models improved the prediction of outcomes for all 3 conditions.","['Kundi H', 'Wadhera RK', 'Strom JB', 'Valsdottir LR', 'Shen C', 'Kazi DS', 'Yeh RW']",2019,4,11,JAMA Cardiol,"Kundi H, et al.

31545808,Intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of transmission dynamics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Seoul hantavirus.,"Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) has recently raised concern by causing geographic range expansion of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). SEOV infections in humans are significantly underestimated worldwide and epidemic dynamics of SEOV-related HFRS are poorly understood because of a lack of field data and empirically validated models. Here, we use mathematical models to examine both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of disease transmission from animal (the Norway rat) to humans in a SEOV-endemic area in China. We found that rat eradication schemes and vaccination campaigns, but below the local elimination threshold, could diminish the amplitude of the HFRS epidemic but did not modify its seasonality. Models demonstrate population dynamics of the rodent host were insensitive to climate variations in urban settings, while relative humidity had a negative effect on the seasonality in transmission. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of SEOV-related HFRS, demonstrates asynchronies between rodent population dynamics and transmission rate, and identifies potential drivers of the SEOV seasonality.","['Li Y', 'Cazelles B', 'Yang G', 'Laine M', 'Huang ZXY', 'Cai J', 'Tan H', 'Stenseth NC', 'Tian H']",2019,13,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Li Y, et al.

31540199,"Dendritic Cells (DCs) as ""Fire Accelerants"" of Hantaviral Pathogenesis.","Hantaviruses are widespread zoonotic pathogens found around the globe. Depending on their geographical location, hantaviruses can cause two human syndromes, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS and HFRS have many commonalities amongst which excessive activation of immune cells is a prominent feature. Hantaviruses replicate in endothelial cells (ECs), the major battlefield of hantavirus-induced pathogenesis, without causing cytopathic effects. This indicates that a misdirected response of human immune cells to hantaviruses is causing damage. As dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate antiviral immune responses, they are in the focus of research analysing hantavirus-induced immunopathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the interplay between hantaviruses and DCs and the immunological consequences thereof.","['Schönrich G', 'Raftery MJ']",2019,11,9,Viruses,"Schönrich G and Raftery MJ.

31540120,Puumala and Tula Virus Differ in Replication Kinetics and Innate Immune Stimulation in Human Endothelial Cells and Macrophages.,"Old world hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) upon zoonotic transmission to humans. In Europe, the Puumala virus (PUUV) is the main causative agent of HFRS. Tula virus (TULV) is also widely distributed in Europe, but there is little knowledge about the pathogenicity of TULV for humans, as reported cases are rare. We studied the replication of TULV in different cell types in comparison to the pathogenic PUUV and analyzed differences in stimulation of innate immunity. While both viruses replicated to a similar extent in interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero E6 cells, TULV replication in human lung epithelial (A549) cells was slower and less efficient when compared to PUUV. In contrast to PUUV, no replication of TULV could be detected in human microvascular endothelial cells and in macrophages. While a strong innate immune response towards PUUV infection was evident at 48 h post infection, TULV infection triggered only a weak IFN response late after infection of A549 cells. Using appropriate in vitro cell culture models for the orthohantavirus infection, we could demonstrate major differences in host cell tropism, replication kinetics, and innate immune induction between pathogenic PUUV and the presumably non- or low-pathogenic TULV that are not observed in Vero E6 cells and may contribute to differences in virulence.","['Bourquain D', 'Bodenstein C', 'Schürer S', 'Schaade L']",2019,11,9,Viruses,"Bourquain D, et al.

31527480,The Impacts of Climatic Factors and Vegetation on Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome Transmission in China: A Study of 109 Counties.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne infectious disease caused by hantaviruses. About 90% of global cases were reported in China. We collected monthly data on counts of HFRS cases, climatic factors (mean temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity), and vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) in 109 Chinese counties from January 2002 to December 2013. First, we used a quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model to assess the impacts of these four factors on HFRS in 109 counties, separately. Then we conducted a multivariate meta-analysis to pool the results at the national level. The results of our study showed that there were non-linear associations between the four factors and HFRS. Specifically, the highest risks of HFRS occurred at the 45th, 30th, 20th, and 80th percentiles (with mean and standard deviations of 10.58 ± 4.52 °C, 18.81 ± 17.82 mm, 58.61 ± 6.33%, 198.20 ± 22.23 at the 109 counties, respectively) of mean temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and NDVI, respectively. HFRS case estimates were most sensitive to mean temperature amongst the four factors, and the lag patterns of the impacts of these factors on HFRS were heterogeneous. Our findings provide rigorous scientific support to current HFRS monitoring and the development of early warning systems.","['He J', 'Wang Y', 'Mu D', 'Xu Z', 'Qian Q', 'Chen G', 'Wen L', 'Yin W', 'Li S', 'Zhang W', 'Guo Y']",2019,16,18,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"He J, et al.

31517148,Glucosuria Predicts the Severity of Puumala Hantavirus Infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes a mild type of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI), increased capillary leakage, and thrombocytopenia. Albuminuria and hematuria in dipstick urine test at hospital admission are known to predict the severity of upcoming AKI.
METHODS: We analyzed dipstick urine glucose in 195 patients with acute PUUV infection at hospital admission, and divided them into 2 categories according to the presence or absence of glucose in the dipstick urine test. Determinants of disease severity were analyzed in glucosuric and nonglucosuric patients.
RESULTS: Altogether, 24 of 195 patients (12%) had glucosuria. The patients with glucosuria had more severe AKI than patients without glucosuria (median maximum creatinine concentration 459 μmol/l, range 78-1041 μmol/l vs. 166 μmol/l, range 51-1499 μmol/l; 
CONCLUSION: Glucosuria is relatively rare, but when present it predicts a more severe disease course in patients with acute PUUV infection.","['Tietäväinen J', 'Mantula P', 'Outinen T', 'Huhtala H', 'Pörsti IH', 'Niemelä O', 'Vaheri A', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J']",2019,4,9,Kidney Int Rep,"Tietäväinen J, et al.

Although AACs caused by viral infections are rare, various viruses have been revealed to cause AAC. Here we present a case in which a man suffered from AAC caused by a Hantaan virus infection. A 35-year-old man was referred to the emergency room for myalgia and fever that began 4 days ago. He suffered oliguria and abdominal pain for 2 days. At the time of his visit to the emergency room, he experienced a fever that spiked up to 38.3℃.

31480594,Urine and Free Immunoglobulin Light Chains as Analytes for Serodiagnosis of Hantavirus Infection.,"Rapid point-of-care testing is a megatrend in infectious disease diagnosis. We have introduced a homogeneous immunoassay concept, which is based on the simultaneous binding of antigen and protein L to a given immunoglobulin molecule. The complex formation is detected utilizing time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer between antigen-attached donor and acceptor-labeled protein L, hence the name LFRET. Here, we demonstrate that urine can be used as a sample matrix in LFRET-based serodiagnostics. We studied urine samples collected during the hospitalization and recovery of patients with acute Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) infection. We compared PUUV antibody-specific LFRET signals in urine to those in plasma, and found excellent correlation in the test outcomes The LFRET test from urine was positive in 40/40 patients with acute PUUV infection. PUUV causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, characterized by acute kidney injury and proteinuria. Immunofluorescence and western blotting demonstrated PUUV-IgG and -IgA in urine, however, the presence of intact immunoglobulins did not fully explain the LFRET signals. We purified free light chains (FLCs) from both urine and serum of healthy volunteers and patients with acute PUUV infection, and verified the presence of antigen-specific FLCs. Antigen-specific FLCs provide a new means for non-invasive antibody detection and disease diagnosis.","['Hepojoki S', 'Kareinen L', 'Strandin T', 'Vaheri A', 'Holthöfer H', 'Mustonen J', 'Mäkelä S', 'Hedman K', 'Vapalahti O', 'Hepojoki J']",2019,11,9,Viruses,"Hepojoki S, et al.

31477045,"Long-term retrospective observation reveals stabilities and variations of hantavirus infection in Hebei, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by hantaviruses which circulate worldwide. So far, it was still considered as one of serious public health problems in China. The present study aimed to reveal the stabilities and variations of hantavirus infection in Hebei province located in North China through a long-term retrospective observation.
METHODS: The epidemiological data of HFRS cases from all 11 cities of Hebei province since 1981 through 2016 were collected and descriptively analyzed. The rodent densities, species compositions and virus-carrying rates of different regions were collected from six separated rodent surveillance points which set up since 2007. The molecular diversity and phylogenetic relationship of hantaviruses circulating among rodents were analyzed based on partial viral glycoprotein gene.
RESULTS: HFRS cases have been reported every year in Hebei province, since the first local case was identified in 1981. The epidemic history can be artificially divided into three phases and a total of 55,507 HFRS cases with 374 deaths were reported during 1981-2016. The gender and occupational factors of susceptible population were invarible throughout, however age of that was gradually aging. The annual outbreak peak always present in spring, while the main epidemic region had gradully altered from south to northeast. Surveillance of rodents revealed that residential rodents significantly possessed higher density and virus-carring rate than field rodents. The house rat, Rattus norvegicus, was the dominant rodent species and Seoul virus S3 sub-genotype which is continued but slightly evolving perhaps to be the sole pathogen for local HFRS cases of Hebei province.
CONCLUSIONS: This long-term province-wide surveillance and epidemiological analysis has revealed the stabilities and variations of hantavirus infection in North China. In order to improve current prevention and control strategies of HFRS in China, all surveillance should be continuously enhanced and variations should be paid more attentions.","['Liu S', 'Wei Y', 'Han X', 'Cai Y', 'Han Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Qi S', 'Li Q']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Liu S, et al.

31455867,Revisiting the genetic diversity of emerging hantaviruses circulating in Europe using a pan-viral resequencing microarray.,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic agents transmitted from small mammals, mainly rodents, to humans, where they provoke diseases such as Hemorrhagic fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) and its mild form, Nephropathia Epidemica (NE), or Hantavirus Cardio-Pulmonary Syndrome (HCPS). Hantaviruses are spread worldwide and monitoring animal reservoirs is of primary importance to control the zoonotic risk. Here, we describe the development of a pan-viral resequencing microarray (PathogenID v3.0) able to explore the genetic diversity of rodent-borne hantaviruses endemic in Europe. Among about 800 sequences tiled on the microarray, 52 correspond to a tight molecular sieve of hantavirus probes covering a large genetic landscape. RNAs from infected animal tissues or from laboratory strains have been reverse transcribed, amplified, then hybridized to the microarray. A classical BLASTN analysis applied to the sequence delivered through the microarray allows to identify the hantavirus species up to the exact geographical variant present in the tested samples. Geographical variants of the most common European hantaviruses from France, Germany, Slovenia and Finland, such as Puumala virus, Dobrava virus and Tula virus, were genetically discriminated. Furthermore, we precisely characterized geographical variants still unknown when the chip was conceived, such as Seoul virus isolates, recently emerged in France and the United Kingdom.","['Filippone C', 'Castel G', 'Murri S', 'Ermonval M', 'Korva M', 'Avšič-Županc T', 'Sironen T', 'Vapalahati O', 'McElhinney LM', 'Ulrich RG', 'Groschup MH', 'Caro V', 'Sauvage F', 'van der Werf S', 'Manuguerra JC', 'Gessain A', 'Marianneau P', 'Tordo N']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Filippone C, et al.

In addition to Europe, TULV was also identified in the Microtus arvalis obscurus voles sampled from Kazakhstan, which shares borders with China. To gain more insight into the molecular epidemiology of TULV, a total of 365 rodents representing 7 species of 4 subfamily (Arvicolinae, Murinae, Gerbillinae, and Cricetinae) were captured in Qapqal county, Xinjiang, northwest China. Hantavirus RNA was recovered from 40 lung tissue samples of M. arvalis obscurus, with the prevalence of 10.96%. Genetic analysis revealed that all recovered viral sequences were most closely related to those of TULV, but exhibited >11% nucleotide differences from all currently known TULV, suggesting that they may represent a new subtype of TULV. In the S tree, the newly identified viruses formed a distinct lineage and showed a close evolutionary relationship with those sampled from Southwestern Siberia and Kazakhstan. However, they exhibited a different clustering pattern in both the M and the L trees, suggesting the possibility of genetic reassortment. Finally, the recombination event was also observed in Xinjiang TULV viruses. In sum, all these data reveal a complex evolutionary history of TULV in Central Asia.","['Chen JT', 'Qin J', 'Li K', 'Xu QY', 'Wang XP', 'Plyusnin A', 'Hou W', 'Zhang YZ']",2019,75,,Infect Genet Evol,"Chen JT, et al.

Thus, a thorough collection and analysis of data related to the epidemic status of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and the association between HFRS incidence and meteorological factors, such as air temperature, is necessary for the disease control and prevention.
METHODS: Journal articles and theses in both English and Chinese from Jan 2014 to Feb 2019 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP Info. All identified studies were subject to the six criteria established to ensure the consistency with research objectives, (i) they provided the data of the incidence of HFRS in mainland China; (ii) they provided the type of air temperature indexes; (iii) they indicated the underlying geographical scale information, temporal data aggregation unit, and the data sources; (iv) they provided the statistical analysis method that had been used; (v) from peer-reviewed journals or dissertation; (vi) the time range for the inclusion of data exceeded two consecutive calendar years.
RESULTS: A total of 27 publications were included in the systematic review, among them, the correlation between HFRS activity and air temperature was explored in 12 provinces and autonomous regions and also at national level. The study period ranged from 3 years to 54 years with a median of 10 years, 70.4% of the studies were based on the monthly HFRS incidence data, 21 studies considered the lagged effect of air temperature factors on the HFRS activity and the longest lag period considered in the included studies was 34 weeks. The correlation between HFRS activity and air temperature varied widely, and the effect of temperature on the HFRS epidemic was seasonal.
CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review described the heterogeneity of geographical scale, data aggregation unit and study period chosen in the ecological studies that seeking the correlation between air temperature indexes and the incidence of HFRS in mainland China during the period from January 2014 to February 2019. The appropriate adoption of geographical scale, data aggregation unit, the length of lag period and the length of incidence collection period should be considered when exploring the relationship between HFRS incidence and meteorological factors such as air temperature. Further investigation is warranted to detect the thresholds of meteorological factors for the HFRS early warning purposes, to measure the duration of lagged effects and determine the timing of maximum effects for reducing the effects of meteorological factors on HFRS via continuous interventions and to identify the vulnerable populations for target protection.","['Bai XH', 'Peng C', 'Jiang T', 'Hu ZM', 'Huang DS', 'Guan P']",2019,13,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Bai XH, et al.

Recent PUUV outbreaks raised questions concerning increasing frequency of outbreaks and expansion of PUUV endemic areas.AimsTo describe the epidemiology of human PUUV and DOBV infections in Germany.MethodsWe conducted an observational retrospective study analysing national hantavirus surveillance data notified to the national public health institute and hantavirus nucleotide sequences from patients collected at the national consultation laboratory between 2001 and 2017. Matching molecular sequences with surveillance data, we conducted epidemiological, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses.ResultsIn total, 12,148 cases of symptomatic hantavirus infection were notified 2001-17 (mean annual incidence: 0.87/100,000; range: 0.09-3.51). PUUV infections showed a highly variable space-time disease incidence pattern, causing large outbreaks every 2-3 years with peaks in early summer and up to 3,000 annually reported cases. Sex-specific differences in disease presentation were observed. Of 202 PUUV nucleotide sequences obtained from cases, 189 (93.6%) fall into well-supported phylogenetic clusters corresponding to different endemic areas in Germany. DOBV infections caused few, mostly sporadic cases in autumn and winter in the north and east of Germany.ConclusionsThe frequency of PUUV outbreaks increased between 2001 and 2017 but our data does not support the suggested expansion of endemic areas. The epidemiology of PUUV and DOBV-Kurkino infections differs in several aspects. Moreover, the latter are relatively rare and combining efforts and data of several countries to identify risk factors and develop specific recommendations for prevention could be worthwhile.","['Faber M', 'Krüger DH', 'Auste B', 'Stark K', 'Hofmann J', 'Weiss S']",2019,24,32,Euro Surveill,"Faber M, et al.

31357521,Characterization of Biomarker Levels in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hantavirus Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) are important viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), especially in the Balkan region. Infections with Dobrava or Puumala orthohantavirus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus can vary from a mild, nonspecific febrile illness, to a severe disease with a fatal outcome. The pathogenesis of both diseases is poorly understood, but it has been suggested that a host's immune mechanism might influence the pathogenesis of the diseases and survival. The aim of our study is to characterize cytokine response in patients with VHF in association with the disease progression and viral load. Forty soluble mediators of the immune response, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction were measured in acute serum samples in 100 HFRS patients and 70 CCHF patients. HFRS and CCHF patients had significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-12p70, IP-10, INF-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MCP-3, and MIP-1b in comparison to the control group. Interestingly, HFRS patients had higher concentrations of serum MIP-1α, MIP-1β, which promote activation of macrophages and NK cells. HFRS patients had increased concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α, while CCHF patients had significantly higher concentrations of IFN-α and IL-8. In both, CCHF and HFRS patients' viral load significantly correlated with IP-10. Patients with fatal outcome had significantly elevated concentrations of IL-6, IFN-α2 and MIP-1α, while GRO-α, chemokine related to activation of neutrophils and basophils, was downregulated. Our study provided a comprehensive characterization of biomarkers released in the acute stages of CCHF and HFRS.","['Korva M', 'Rus KR', 'Pavletič M', 'Saksida A', 'Knap N', 'Jelovšek M', 'Smrdel KS', 'Jakupi X', 'Humolli I', 'Dedushaj J', 'Petrovec M', 'Avšič-Županc T']",2019,11,8,Viruses,"Korva M, et al.

It causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome also known as nephropathia epidemica (NE) with clinical picture ranging from mild to severe. Currently, the laboratory diagnosis of NE is mainly based on serology. Here, we evaluated a real-time one-step qRT-PCR (PUUV-qRT-PCR) for detection of PUUV with 238 consecutive diagnostic serum samples from patients with suspected PUUV infection. The PUUV-qRT-PCR was both specific and sensitive for PUUV RNA. The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) was estimated to be four copies of PUUV per reaction. Altogether 28 out of 30 (93%) PUUV IgM positive samples were positive also for PUUV RNA. No false positives were detected and the specificity was thus 100%. Interestingly, one sample was found positive in PUUV-qRT-PCR prior to subsequent IgM and IgG seroconversion.

31309365,Population Dynamics of Bank Voles Predicts Human Puumala Hantavirus Risk.,"Predicting risk of zoonotic diseases, i.e., diseases shared by humans and animals, is often complicated by the population ecology of wildlife host(s). We here demonstrate how ecological knowledge of a disease system can be used for early prediction of human risk using Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which causes Nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, as a model system. Bank vole populations at northern latitudes exhibit multiannual fluctuations in density and spatial distribution, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, existing studies predict NE incidence only a few months before an outbreak. We used a time series on cyclic bank vole population density (1972-2013), their PUUV infection rates (1979-1986; 2003-2013), and NE incidence in Sweden (1990-2013). Depending on the relationship between vole density and infection prevalence (proportion of infected animals), either overall density of bank voles or the density of infected bank voles may be used to predict seasonal NE incidence. The density and spatial distribution of voles at density minima of a population cycle contribute to the early warning of NE risk later at its cyclic peak. When bank voles remain relatively widespread in the landscape during cyclic minima, PUUV can spread from a high baseline during a cycle, culminating in high prevalence in bank voles and potentially high NE risk during peak densities.","['Khalil H', 'Ecke F', 'Evander M', 'Bucht G', 'Hörnfeldt B']",2019,16,3,Ecohealth,"Khalil H, et al.

31293096,"Dynamics of Puumala hantavirus outbreak in Black Sea Region, Turkey.","BACKGROUND: Some of the hantavirus species in Euro-Asia cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. The first documented human hantavirus infection in Turkey was diagnosed in 2009. This report describes the dynamics of the first hantavirus outbreak that emerged in humans in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey.
METHODS: All the suspected cases of hantavirus infection were admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Department at the Zonguldak Bülent Ecevit University Hospital in Zonguldak, Turkey. The patients were carefully interviewed, examined and evaluated using routine laboratory tests and hantavirus diagnostic tools. Hantavirus-reactive antibodies (IgM and IgG) in serum samples were detected via enzyme immune assay (EIA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in the acute and convalescence stages of the disease. The presence of hantavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) was analysed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in serum and urine samples. A focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) was performed to confirm specific hantavirus serotypes. In addition, a case-control study was conducted to identify possible risk factors for hantavirus transmission in the outbreak area. A control group was composed of asymptomatic individuals who were seronegative for hantavirus IgM and IgG and living in the outbreak area.
RESULTS: A total of 55 suspected cases of hantavirus infection were admitted to the inpatient clinic between February and June of 2009. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with acute HFRS via EIA or IFA. In 22 of the 24 infected patients, Puumala virus (PUUV) was identified as the causative hantavirus type by detecting IgM in the acute stage and an increase in the IgG level in follow-up serum samples. PUUV was also verified as the infecting agent by FRNT in two of the 24 cases. Among the 24 laboratory-confirmed HFRS cases, 21 (87.5%) were males and 3 (12.5%) were females, and the mean age was 45.92 years (standard deviation ± 16.90 years). Almost all these individuals were living in villages or rural areas. The 24 HFRS cases were matched with 26 healthy controls for statistical analyses and according to binary logistic regression analysis, and dealing with rodent control activities in gardens or in annexes of their homes (p = 0.021 and Odds ratio [OR] = 17.11) and being male (p = 0.019 and OR = 22.37) were detected as statistically significant risk factors for hantavirus infection. The most commonly observed clinical complaints were fatigue (95.8%), shivering (91.7%), fever (87.1%), headache (70.8%) and nausea (70.8%). Haemodialysis was required for four patients (16.7%). Except for the first case diagnosed with acute hantavirus infection, no patient died. The mean delay time to hospital admission from initiation of symptoms was 5.3 days, the mean duration of febrile days was 2.6 days, and the mean duration of hospital stay was 8.5 days.
CONCLUSION: Hantaviruses are circulating in Turkey and causing sporadic or epidemic infection in humans. Additional investigations are needed to better understand the dynamics of hantaviruses in this country.","['Çelebi G', 'Öztoprak N', 'Öktem İMA', 'Heyman P', 'Lundkvist Å', 'Wahlström M', 'Köktürk F', 'Pişkin N']",2019,66,7,Zoonoses Public Health,"Çelebi G, et al.

Significant and positive correlations between the concentrations of PBDE congeners as well as between Dec 602 and Dec 603 were observed. Concentrations of PBDE congeners also showed significant and positive correlations in paired samples from family members (child-mother-father), while Dec 602 was the only hexachloronorbornene-based flame retardant whose concentrations correlated between family members, and only in mother-father paired samples. This is the largest study to date focusing on measuring and correlating HRFs in children and their parents living in the same household.

Infectious disease prediction may help in disease prevention despite some uncontrollable influence factors. This study conducted a comparison between a hybrid model and two single models in forecasting the monthly incidence of HFRS in China.
DESIGN: Time-series study.
SETTING: The People's Republic of China.
METHODS: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, generalised regression neural network (GRNN) model and hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model were constructed by R V.3.4.3 software. The monthly reported incidence of HFRS from January 2011 to May 2018 were adopted to evaluate models' performance. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were adopted to evaluate these models' effectiveness. Spatial stratified heterogeneity of the time series was tested by month and another GRNN model was built with a new series.
RESULTS: The monthly incidence of HFRS in the past several years showed a slight downtrend and obvious seasonal variation. A total of four plausible ARIMA models were built and ARIMA(2,1,1) (2,1,1)
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model was better than single ARIMA and basic GRNN model in forecasting monthly incidence of HFRS in China.

31181690,Seoul Virus Tropism and Pathology in Naturally Infected Feeder Rats.,"Seoul virus (SEOV) is a zoonotic orthohantavirus carried by black and brown rats, and can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. Human cases of SEOV virus infection have most recently been reported in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats. Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis. In conclusion, natural SEOV infection results in mild inflammation of the liver in the absence of clinical disease.","['Maas M', 'van Heteren M', 'de Vries A', 'Kuiken T', 'Hoornweg T', 'Veldhuis Kroeze E', 'Rockx B']",2019,11,6,Viruses,"Maas M, et al.

About one month following the gastrectomy, the patient presented with fever and acute inflammatory syndrome. Severe aortic insufficiency, aortic valvular vegetations, and positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus saprophytic were found. The diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on the aortic valve was established (positive blood cultures with echocardiographic features of vegetations, fever), and antibiotic treatment with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin was initiated. The evolution was favorable with the remission of the inflammatory syndrome and quick cessation of fever. However, the hemodynamic aspect showed progressive heart failure with acute pulmonary edema. The transesophageal echocardiographic examination confirmed the existence of severe aortic insufficiency and valvular vegetations with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 38%. The coronary angiography revealed double vessel disease. The calculated Euroscore II was 33.4%. Aortic valve replacement with porcine xenograft and double coronary artery bypass graft surgery was performed. The patient had a favorable postoperative course remaining afebrile and out of heart failure, with the markers of inflammation largely within normal limits. The left ventricular ejection fraction increased to 50%. The successful outcome of this case, represented by a rare association of cancer, endocarditis, and coronary disease, reveals the importance of the multidisciplinary teams involved in this case: gastroenterology, general surgery, cardiology, infectious diseases, cardiac surgery, and intensive care.

31144552,"Analyzing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Hubei Province, China: a space-time cube-based approach.","OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a natural–focal infectious disease caused by hantaviruses, resulted in 37 deaths between 2011 and 2015 in Hubei Province, China. HFRS outbreaks are seasonally distributed, exhibiting heterogeneity in space and time. We aimed to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics of HFRS epidemics and their probable influencing factors.
METHODS: We used the space–time cube (STC) method to investigate HFRS epidemics in different space–time locations. STC can be used to visualize the trajectories of moving objects (or changing tendencies) in space and time in three dimensions. We applied space–time statistical methods, including space–time hot spot and space–time local outlier analyses, based on a calculated STC model of HFRS cases, to identify spatial and temporal hotspots and outlier distributions. We used the space–time gravity center method to reveal associations between possible factors and HFRS epidemics.
RESULTS: In this research, HFRS cases for each space–time location were defined by the STC model, which can present the dynamic characteristics of HFRS epidemics. The STC model delivered accurate and detailed results for the spatiotemporal patterns of HFRS epidemics.
CONCLUSION: The methods in this paper can potentially be applied for infectious diseases with similar spatial and temporal patterns.","['Zhao Y', 'Ge L', 'Liu J', 'Liu H', 'Yu L', 'Wang N', 'Zhou Y', 'Ding X']",2019,47,7,J Int Med Res,"Zhao Y, et al.

31126713,A case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly syndrome complicated with pyometra: tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome complicated with pyometra and explain tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy.
DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the technique with the use of video (Canadian Task Force Classification III). Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained.
SETTING: OHVIRA syndrome is characterized by the triad of uterovaginal duplication, obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis (1). Patients with OHVIRA syndrome usually present with dysmenorrhea and a vaginal or a pelvic mass. Renal, uterine, and vaginal pathologies can be diagnosed with the use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (2). In cases in which the diagnosis is not delayed, treatment consists of vaginal septostomy (3). Delayed diagnosis may lead to pelvic infections in patients with microperforations in the septum, which may lead to abscess formation, pelvic inflammatory disease, pyometra, and subsequent need for hemihysterectomy and adnexectomy (4).
PATIENT(S): A 21-year-old G2 P2 patient who had a history of hospitalization with the diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess three times previously presented to the emergency department with pelvic pain, nausea, high fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. On physical examination, a pelvic abscess draining to the left vaginal wall and a 10-12-cm left adnexal mass were noticed. A diagnosis of OHVIRA syndrome and pyometra was made after evaluation of ultrasonographic and MRI findings. Longitudinal vaginal septum excision and drainage of the abscess was performed. Ten cubic centimeters of purulent abscess material was drained by incising the left vaginal wall. However, the mass extending from the left vaginal wall to the left adnexal area could not be drained. On hysteroscopy, no cervix was visualized belonging to the obstructed hemivagina and the left uterine cavity could not be entered. On reexamination of the MR images, the presence of a transverse vaginal septum overlying the left hemivagina was detected, preventing access to the left hemiuterine cavity. The transverse vaginal septum could have been excised and the pyometra drained; however, owing to the presence of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, and a history of three failed previous attempts at treatment, the decision to perform hemihysterectomy was made.
INTERVENTION(S): A laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed in the patient, who was diagnosed as having OHVIRA syndrome complicated with pyometra. Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained for this report.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): On laparoscopy, the left hemiuterus on the same side as the obstructed hemivagina appeared three to four times larger than the normal hemiuterus, in which two pregnancies had occurred, and dense adhesions were present between this hemiuterus and the bowel. The left hemiuterus was densely adherent to the pelvic side wall. Laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed. A monofilament barbed suture were used for the repair of the paracervical area and left hemivagina. A transverse septum and cervical atresia was noticed at the distal end of the left hemiuterus. The surgical challenges encountered during treatment of this case were the difficulty in recognizing anatomic structures owing to chronic inflammatory changes, dissecting dense adhesions without injuring neighboring pelvic organs, providing adequate hemostasis during dissection of fragile and hemorrhagic tissues, gaining optimal visualization of the surgical field owing to hampered hemostasis, obtaining adequate exposure of the surgical site owing to the inability to use a uterine manipulator, and the difficulty in dissecting the left hemiuterus without damaging the right hemiuterus for fertility preservation. The ultrasonic scalpel is an energy modality that is known to cause the least amount of collateral thermal tissue damage. In the present case, an ultrasonic scalpel was used to dissect dense adhesions between the left hemiuterus and the urinary bladder to minimize the risk of thermal injury to the urinary bladder. The ultrasonic scalpel was also used when dissecting the unhealthy hemiuterus from the healthy hemiuterus owing to its ergonomic tip and to avoid thermal damage to the cervix of the healthy hemiuterus. In areas of dense adhesions and distorted anatomy, the broad tips of bipolar forceps are also helpful for blunt dissection and the creation of tissue planes, and it is also used for effective concomitant hemostasis. A vessel sealer is the most appropriate energy modality for providing effective hemostasis during dissection of the uterine artery while causing minimal collateral tissue damage (5, 6). When deciding the kind of energy modality to be used during operative laparoscopy, the source that minimized thermal injury while providing optimal hemostasis was preferred. Furthermore, additional features such as rotation, dissection, grasping, and the ergonomics of the tip of the device were also considered when choosing the energy source to be used.
RESULT(S): The patient was discharged 48 hours postoperatively with no complications. No symptoms of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia were present at the end of the third month after surgery.
CONCLUSION(S): Understanding the exact nature of the uterine anomaly before hemihysterectomy is of paramount importance for a successful surgery. Laparoscopy is a safe and effective treatment modality even in the presence of dense pelvic adhesions and distorted pelvic anatomy.","['Huseyin K', 'Lale TS', 'Burak Y', 'Tolga K', 'Pinar K', 'Kerem SD']",2019,112,1,Fertil Steril,"Huseyin K, et al.

For analytes with available isotopically labeled surrogates, recoveries in the range of 70-120% and repeatability rates below 20% were observed, while for compounds quantitated using absolute calibration the values of recovery ranged from 59 to 153% and the repeatability in terms of RSDs was in the range of 1-26%. The values measured for the four analyzed RMs agreed with the provided consensus values, revealing that the recovery of reference concentrations for compounds with assigned consensus values was in 72-119% range. The elaborated method met the sensitivity criteria according to the Commission Recommendation, 2014/118/EU on the monitoring of BFRs in food products. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of numerous food samples. The analyses revealed ubiquitous presence of PBDEs and the majority of DRCs in the analyzed samples, while alternative BFRs were detected only occasionally.","['Zacs D', 'Perkons I', 'Volkovs V', 'Bartkevics V']",2019,230,,Chemosphere,"Zacs D, et al.

31107874,"The characteristics of current natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Shandong Province, China, 2012-2015.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), an infectious disease caused by hantaviruses, is endemic in China and remains a serious public health problem. Historically, Shandong Province has had the largest HFRS burden in China. However, we do not have a comprehensive and clear understanding of the current epidemic foci of HFRS in Shandong Province.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The incidence and mortality rates were calculated, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed after laboratory testing of the virus in rodents. Spatial epidemiology analysis was applied to investigate the epidemic foci, including their sources. A total of 6,206 HFRS cases and 59 related deaths were reported in Shandong Province. The virus carriage rates of the rodents Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus agrarius and Mus musculus were 10.24%, 6.31% and 0.27%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that two novel viruses obtained from R. norvegicus in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City were dissimilar to the other strains, but closely related to strains previously isolated in northeastern China. Three epidemic foci were defined, two of which were derived from the Jining and Linyi epidemic foci, respectively, while the other was the residue of the Jining epidemic focus.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The southeastern and central Shandong Province are current key HFRS epidemic foci dominated by A. agrarius and R. norvegicus, respectively. Our study could help local departments to strengthen prevention and control measures in key areas to reduce the hazards of HFRS.","['Zheng Z', 'Wang P', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang D', 'Wang X', 'Zuo S', 'Li X']",2019,13,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zheng Z, et al.

Here, we investigated the occurrence of 21 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 14 current use pesticides (CUPs), 47 halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), and 19 organophosphate esters (OPEs) in air around Las Cruces (LC) and La Selva (LS) Biological Stations, Costa Rica, and Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda using passive air samplers (PAS) with polyurethane foam (PUF) discs (PAS-PUF). Significantly higher concentrations of CUPs were observed around LS, while LC had a higher concentration of OCPs. Land use analysis indicated that LS had a higher fraction of agriculture than LC (33% vs 14%), suggesting the higher CUPs concentration at LS was related to pesticide intensive crops, while higher OCPs concentration at LC may be attributed to the area's long agricultural history characterized by small-scale subsistence farming or long-range transport. In Uganda, CUPs and OCPs were generally lower than in Costa Rica, but high concentrations of HFRs were observed inside KNP, possibly due to human activity at research camps near the protected forest. This is the first study that documented the occurrence of anthropogenic chemicals in the air at protected areas with tropical forests.","['Wang S', 'Steiniche T', 'Romanak KA', 'Johnson E', 'Quirós R', 'Mutegeki R', 'Wasserman MD', 'Venier M']",2019,53,11,Environ Sci Technol,"Wang S, et al.

31075144,Three asymptomatic animal infection models of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantaviruses.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics. In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a ~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID99) of HTNV by the intramuscular and ~1 ID99 of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with ~2 ID99 of PUUV by the intramuscular or ~1 ID99 of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets.","['Perley CC', 'Brocato RL', 'Kwilas SA', 'Daye S', 'Moreau A', 'Nichols DK', 'Wetzel KS', 'Shamblin J', 'Hooper JW']",2019,14,5,PLoS One,"Perley CC, et al.

This study aims to investigate the distribution of these halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and the correlations between HFRs and microbial community structure in mangrove sediments. Concentrations of PBDEs, DBDPE, BTBPE, TBBPA, HBCDD and DP in mangrove sediments ranged from 6.97 to 216.1, 3.70-26.0, 0.02-0.73, 0.02-37.5, 0.44-127.5 and 0.07-2.23 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Higher levels of PBDEs, BTBPE, HBCDD and DP were observed in sediments from Futian mangrove wetland of Shenzhen, the only nature reserve located in the downtown of China. The highest concentration of TBBPA found in mangrove sediments from Guangzhou was proximate to a ferry terminal and a dockyard where TBBPA is widely used in the coatings. PBDEs were the predominant HFRs in mangrove sediments, with an average contribution of 63.0%. Mangrove sediments from Guangzhou and Zhuhai showed an enrichment of (-)-α-HBCDD, (-)-β-HBCDD and (-)-γ-HBCDD. Concentrations of HFRs in mangrove sediments from Guangzhou increased significantly from 2012 to 2015, which was probably due to the establishment and rapid development of Nansha Free Trade Zone of Guangzhou. Redundancy analysis showed that HFRs may cause a shift of microbial community structure in mangrove sediments and the variations were significantly correlated with TBBPA, syn-DP and BTBPE.","['Hu Y', 'Pei N', 'Sun Y', 'Xu X', 'Zhang Z', 'Li H', 'Wang W', 'Zuo L', 'Xiong Y', 'Zeng Y', 'He K', 'Mai B']",2019,227,,Chemosphere,"Hu Y, et al.

30972451,"Hepatotoxicity risk factors and acetaminophen dose adjustment, do prescribers give this issue adequate consideration? A French university hospital study.","BACKGROUND: The hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen is recognised worldwide. Unfavourable prognoses relating to overdose include liver transplantation and/or death. Several hepatotoxicity risk factors (HRFs) should motivate the adjustment of acetaminophen daily intake (to < 4 g/day): advanced age, weight < 50 kg, malnutrition, chronic alcoholism, chronic hepatitis B and C and HIV infection, severe chronic renal failure and hepatocellular insufficiency.
METHOD: Over a 7-day period in Rennes University Hospital in December 2017, using DxCare® software, with an odds ratio estimation, we analysed all acetaminophen prescriptions, to assess to what extent the presence of HRFs altered the prescribers' choice of acetaminophen dose (< 4 g/day versus 4 g/day).
RESULTS: Among 1842 patients, considering only the first acetaminophen prescription, 73.7% were on 4 g/day. Almost half this population had at least 1 HRF. Whereas around 80% of the prescriptions in the < 4 g/day group were for patients with at least 1 HFR, only 53% of the prescriptions in the 4 g/day group concerned patients without HFRs (p < 0.001). Age > 75 and low weight were associated with the prescriber's choice of dose. Neither chronic alcoholism nor hepatocellular insufficiency influenced the acetaminophen doses prescribed.
CONCLUSION: Considering the widespread use of acetaminophen and its favourable safety profile compared with other analgesic drugs, it appears urgent to remind prescribers of the maximum daily dose recommendations for acetaminophen for patients with HRFs, especially those with chronic alcoholism and hepatocellular insufficiency.","['Bacle A', 'Pronier C', 'Gilardi H', 'Polard E', 'Potin S', 'Scailteux LM']",2019,75,8,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,"Bacle A, et al.

METHODS: Brown rats (n=68) were trapped from a variety of peridomestic locations, with a focus on pig farms. Kidney and lung tissues were tested for viral RNA using a pan-hantavirus RT-PCR assay followed by Sanger sequencing and analysis.
RESULTS: SEOV RNA was detected in 19 per cent (13/68, 95% CI 11 to 30) of rats and all sequences fell within SEOV lineage 9. Twelve sequences were highly similar to each other and to the previously reported GB Humber strain of SEOV (98 per cent). One rat SEOV sequence was more distant. The SEOV prevalence in rats from pig farms was significantly greater (p=0.047) than other sites sampled. No significant sex or age differences were observed among positive and negative rats.
DISCUSSION: The results from this study suggest that SEOV could be widespread in wild rats in GB and therefore pose a potential risk to public health.","['Murphy EG', 'Williams NJ', 'Bennett M', 'Jennings D', 'Chantrey J', 'McElhinney LM']",2019,184,17,Vet Rec,"Murphy EG, et al.

30946330,Influenza A with hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome in an adult: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) is a type of acute encephalopathy mainly seen in infants. It is a syndrome encompassing an onset of high fever, disturbance of consciousness, convulsion, and shock that rapidly progresses to watery diarrhea and liver and renal dysfunctions. It is extremely rare in adults, and the number of reports is limited worldwide. We report the case of an adult patient with HSES, which occurred after influenza A infection.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old man visited his family doctor 2 days after he noticed fever and was diagnosed with influenza A using an influenza rapid diagnosis kit; he underwent treatment on an outpatient basis. He was immediately hospitalized after developing fever, abdominal pain, malaise, and shock 16 hours after the commencement of the treatment. Abrupt acute brain swelling was noted 24 hours after hospitalization.
DIAGNOSES: The antibody titer to influenza A (H3N2) was 1:40. Computed tomography obtained 24 hours after treatment initiation confirmed acute cerebral edema and cerebral herniation. Electroencephalogram at that time showed a flat line.
INTERVENTIONS: For the treatment of influenza A, laninamivir 150 mg was started immediately after the diagnosis by the family doctor, and 600 mg dose was given daily after hospitalization (or since 24 hours after the treatment initiation). For the management of shock, dobutamine 3 μg/kg/min and noradrenaline up to 0.2 μg/kg/min were used together with bolus infusion.
OUTCOMES: The patient was declared brain dead on his 6th hospital day and he died on his 27th hospital day.
CONCLUSION: Drastic courses such as that in our case with HSES can follow influenza infections even in adults.","['Fukuda M', 'Yoshida T', 'Moroki M', 'Hirayu N', 'Nabeta M', 'Nakamura A', 'Uzu H', 'Takasu O']",2019,98,14,Medicine (Baltimore),"Fukuda M, et al.

30928856,The impact of climate variability on infectious disease transmission in China: Current knowledge and further directions.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change may lead to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and pose public health challenges to human health and the already overloaded healthcare system. It is therefore important to review current knowledge and identify further directions in China, the largest developing country in the world.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the relationship between climate variability and infectious disease transmission in China in the new millennium. Literature was identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: climatic variables [temperature, precipitation, rainfall, humidity, etc.] and infectious disease [viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases].
RESULTS: Fifty-eight articles published from January 1, 2000 to May 30, 2018 were included in the final analysis, including bacterial diarrhea, dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, HFRS, HFMD, Schistosomiasis. Each 1 °C rise may lead to 3.6%-14.8% increase in the incidence of bacillary dysentery disease in south China. A 1 °C rise was corresponded to an increase of 1.8%-5.9% in the weekly notified HFMD cases in west China. Each 1 °C rise of temperature, 1％ rise in relative humidity and one hour rise in sunshine led to an increase of 0.90%, 3.99% and 0.68% in the monthly malaria cases, respectively. Climate change with the increased temperature and irregular patterns of rainfall may affect the pathogen reproduction rate, their spread and geographical distribution, change human behavior and influence the ecology of vectors, and increase the rate of disease transmission in different regions of China.
CONCLUSION: Exploring relevant adaptation strategies and the health burden of climate change will assist public health authorities to develop an early warning system and protect China's population health, especially in the new 1.5 °C scenario of the newly released IPCC special report.","['Yi L', 'Xu X', 'Ge W', 'Xue H', 'Li J', 'Li D', 'Wang C', 'Wu H', 'Liu X', 'Zheng D', 'Chen Z', 'Liu Q', 'Bi P', 'Li J']",2019,173,,Environ Res,"Yi L, et al.

A number of hantavirus species is known to be present in Europe. In Serbia, existing data on hantavirus presence and prevalence rely in serological findings. In this study, molecular analysis was performed in order to characterize HFRS causing hantaviruses in Serbia.
METHODS: Sixty four serum samples of HFRS cases, previously found seropositive to anti-hantaviral antibodies, were included in the study. Partial hantaviral L and S segments were PCR amplified producing 390nt and 598nt amplicons, respectively, in parallel with human beta-actin mRNA as external reverse transcription positive control. Hantavirus specific PCR products were DNA sequenced in both direction and the obtained sequences phylogenetically confirmed and analyzed.
RESULTS: PCR detection of hantavirus L and S genome segments was positive in 18/64 and 11/64 tested samples, respectively. Positive PCR results involved samples obtained from different locations, mostly from central and southern parts of Serbia. All the obtained sequences were identified as Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV).

30891596,Active Targeted Surveillance to Identify Sites of Emergence of Hantavirus.,"BACKGROUND: Endemic outbreaks of hantaviruses pose a critical public health threat worldwide. Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Using comparative genomic analyses of partial and nearly complete sequences of HTNV from humans and rodents, we were able to localize, with limitations, the putative infection locations for HFRS patients. Partial sequences might not reflect precise phylogenetic positions over the whole-genome sequences; finer granularity of rodent sampling reflects more precisely the circulation of strains.
METHODS: Five HFRS specimens were collected. Epidemiological surveys were conducted with the patients during hospitalization. We conducted active surveillance at suspected HFRS outbreak areas. We performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing to obtain the genomic sequence of HTNV from patients and rodents. The phylogeny of human- and rodent-derived HTNV was generated using the maximum likelihood method. For phylogeographic analyses, the tracing of HTNV genomes from HFRS patients was defined on the bases of epidemiological interviews, phylogenetic patterns of the viruses, and geographic locations of HTNV-positive rodents.
RESULTS: The phylogeographic analyses demonstrated genetic clusters of HTNV strains from clinical specimens, with HTNV circulating in rodents at suspected sites of patient infections.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a major shift in molecular epidemiological surveillance of HTNV. Active targeted surveillance was performed at sites of suspected infections, allowing the high-resolution phylogeographic analysis to reveal the site of emergence of HTNV. We posit that this novel approach will make it possible to identify infectious sources, perform disease risk assessment, and implement preparedness against vector-borne viruses.","['Kim WK', 'No JS', 'Lee D', 'Jung J', 'Park H', 'Yi Y', 'Kim JA', 'Lee SH', 'Kim Y', 'Park S', 'Cho S', 'Lee GY', 'Song DH', 'Gu SH', 'Park K', 'Kim HC', 'Wiley MR', 'Chain PSG', 'Jeong ST', 'Klein TA', 'Palacios G', 'Song JW']",2020,70,3,Clin Infect Dis,"Kim WK, et al.

30886186,A Systems Vaccinology Approach Reveals the Mechanisms of Immunogenic Responses to Hantavax Vaccination in Humans.,"Hantavax is an inactivated vaccine for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The immunogenic responses have not been elucidated yet. Here we conducted a cohort study in which 20 healthy subjects were administered four doses of Hantavax during 13-months period. Pre- and post- vaccinated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sera were analysed by transcriptomic and metabolomic profilings, respectively. Based on neutralizing antibody titers, subjects were subsequently classified into three groups; non responders (NRs), low responders (LRs) and high responders (HRs). Post vaccination differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with innate immunity and cytokine pathways were highly upregulated. DEG analysis revealed a significant induction of CD69 expression in the HRs. High resolution metabolomics (HRM) analysis showed that correlated to the antibody response, cholesteryl nitrolinoleate, octanoyl-carnitine, tyrosine, ubiquinone-9, and benzoate were significantly elevated in HRs, while chenodeoxycholic acid and methyl palmitate were upregulated in NRs and LRs, compared with HRs. Additionally, gene-metabolite interaction revealed upregulated gene-metabolite couplings in, folate biosynthesis, nicotinate and nicotinamide, arachidonic acid, thiamine and pyrimidine metabolism in a dose dependent manner in HR group.

30874941,Clinical course of hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica in children compared to adults in Germany-analysis of 317 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus infections are endemic worldwide, and its incidence in Europe has been steadily increasing. In Western Europe, hantavirus infections are typically caused by Puumala hantavirus and cause nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Up to now, there is only little data about the course of acute NE in children, but it has been suggested that hantavirus infections take a lighter course in children when compared to adults. We performed a retrospective analysis of adults and children diagnosed with acute NE in two counties in South-Western Germany to investigate if there are differences in the course of the disease.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 295 adults and 22 children with acute NE regarding clinical presentation, laboratory findings, complications and outcome.
RESULTS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombocytopenia occurred at similar frequencies and severity in both groups. Sudden onset of fever and back/loin pain were two of the three most common symptoms in both adults and children. However, adults presented more frequently with arthralgia and visual disturbances, whereas abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting could be detected more often in children. No significant differences were found in the incidence of complications (haemodialysis, long-term outcome of kidney function, length of hospital stay).
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of acute NE was similar in adults and children with high frequency of AKI as well as thrombocytopenia, but with full recovery of all patients.","['Echterdiek F', 'Kitterer D', 'Alscher MD', 'Schwenger V', 'Ruckenbrod B', 'Bald M', 'Latus J']",2019,34,7,Pediatr Nephrol,"Echterdiek F, et al.

30810003,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Poland.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral zoonosis occurring due to the hantavirus infection. On the territory it constitutes the only case of viral hemorrhagic fever. The infections occurring in Poland are mainly caused by the Puumala and Dobrava serotypes. The pathogenetic influence of other Hanta serotypes such as Boginia, Nova and Seewis on humans is still unknown. The endemic territory of the occurrence of the hantavirus infections in Poland is the Podkarpacie region. The morbidity is not high and ranges between 0.02 and 0.14 in every 100 000 but professional literature suggests that the data concerning the territory of Poland is underestimated. So far hantavirus infections have not been reported in other areas of Poland yet the presence of the virus may be excluded. In view of literature and the significant occurrence of Hanta antibodies in patients included in the risk group, it may be claimed that the diseases caused by Hanta virus constitute a significant factor influencing the medical status of the group in focus all over the country.","['Gut AK', 'Gut R', 'Rymarz A', 'Woźniak-Kosek A']",2018,72,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Gut AK, et al.

30787344,"Spatial dynamics of a zoonotic orthohantavirus disease through heterogenous data on rodents, rodent infections, and human disease.","Zoonotic diseases are challenging to study from the ecological point of view as, broadly speaking, datasets tend to be either detailed on a small spatial extent, or coarse on a large spatial extent. Also, there are many ways to assess zoonotic disease transmission systems, from pathogens to hosts to humans. We explore the complementarity of datasets considering the pathogen in its host, the host and human cases in the context of Puumala orthohantavirus infection in Germany. We selected relevant environmental predictors using a conceptual framework based on resource-based habitats. This framework assesses the functions, and associated environmental resources of the pathogen and associated host. A resource-based habitat framework supports variable selection and result interpretation. Multiplying 'keyholes' to view a zoonotic disease transmission system is valuable, but requires a strong conceptual framework to select and interpret environmental explanatory variables. This study highlights the usefulness of a structured, ecology-based approach to study drivers of zoonotic diseases at the level of virus, host, and human - not only for PUUV but also for other zoonotic pathogens. Our results show that human disease cases are best explained by a combination of variables related to zoonotic pathogen circulation and human exposure.","['Vanwambeke SO', 'Zeimes CB', 'Drewes S', 'Ulrich RG', 'Reil D', 'Jacob J']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Vanwambeke SO, et al.

30760218,Epidemiologic study on changes in occurrence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Republic of Korea for 17 years according to age group: 2001-2017.,"BACKGROUND: The potential effect of the inactivated hantavirus vaccine (IHV) remains controversial; however, it appears to be moderately effective for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). This study of the epidemiology of HFRS from 2001 to 2017 aimed to examine those at high risk of HFRS in the Republic of Korea (ROK), particularly in terms of disease distribution according to age.
METHODS: Raw data of HFRS patients recorded in Korea from 2001 to 2017 were obtained from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients were divided into three age groups: ≤39, 40-69, and ≥ 70 years. The incidence rate per 100,000 individuals in each age group was calculated using population data. The 12-month year was divided into three-month quarters, and the number and proportion of patients corresponding to each quarter were calculated. The effects of time, sex, and quarter on HFRS incidence were assessed in a Poisson regression analysis.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2017, 7048 HFRS patients were recorded nationwide. Among these patients, the proportion of patients aged ≥70 years increased gradually from 16.4% in 2001 to 43.9% in 2017. Regarding the quarter-year periods, the fourth quarter contained a significantly higher proportion of patients in the ≥70 years group (69.4%) compared to the other age groups. In the Poisson regression analysis, patients aged ≥70 years had a significantly higher relative risk of HFRS incidence within each quartile compared to those in the other age groups (2.102- and 10.029-fold in the third and fourth quarters, respectively). An analysis of disease incidence revealed a more distinct pattern in seasonal variation among those aged ≥70 years compared with other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of the incidence of HFRS in the ROK, subjects aged ≥70 years exhibited a gradual increase in incidence and a distinct pattern of seasonal variation. These results may be important to identify individuals in Korea who are at high risk of developing HFRS. In future, active immunization programs will be needed to control HFRS among these high-risk groups in Korea.",['Park Y'],2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,Park Y.

30703095,Probabilistic logic analysis of the highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal HFRS incidence distribution in Heilongjiang province (China) during 2005-2013.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis caused by hantavirus (belongs to Hantaviridae family). A large amount of HFRS cases occur in China, especially in the Heilongjiang Province, raising great concerns regarding public health. The distribution of these cases across space-time often exhibits highly heterogeneous characteristics. Hence, it is widely recognized that the improved mapping of heterogeneous HFRS distributions and the quantitative assessment of the space-time disease transition patterns can advance considerably the detection, prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks.
METHODS: A synthesis of space-time mapping and probabilistic logic is proposed to study the distribution of monthly HFRS population-standardized incidences in Heilongjiang province during the period 2005-2013. We introduce a class-dependent Bayesian maximum entropy (cd-BME) mapping method dividing the original dataset into discrete incidence classes that overcome data heterogeneity and skewness effects and can produce space-time HFRS incidence estimates together with their estimation accuracy. A ten-fold cross validation analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed cd-BME implementation compared to the standard class-independent BME implementation. Incidence maps generated by cd-BME are used to study the spatiotemporal HFRS spread patterns. Further, the spatiotemporal dependence of HFRS incidences are measured in terms of probability logic indicators that link class-dependent HFRS incidences at different space-time points. These indicators convey useful complementary information regarding intraclass and interclass relationships, such as the change in HFRS transition probabilities between different incidence classes with increasing geographical distance and time separation.
RESULTS: Each HFRS class exhibited a distinct space-time variation structure in terms of its varying covariance parameters (shape, sill and correlation ranges). Given the heterogeneous features of the HFRS dataset, the cd-BME implementation demonstrated an improved ability to capture these features compared to the standard implementation (e.g., mean absolute error: 0.19 vs. 0.43 cases/105 capita) demonstrating a point outbreak character at high incidence levels and a non-point spread character at low levels. Intraclass HFRS variations were found to be considerably different than interclass HFRS variations. Certain incidence classes occurred frequently near one class but were rarely found adjacent to other classes. Different classes may share common boundaries or they may be surrounded completely by another class. The HFRS class 0-68.5% was the most dominant in the Heilongjiang province (covering more than 2/3 of the total area). The probabilities that certain incidence classes occur next to other classes were used to estimate the transitions between HFRS classes. Moreover, such probabilities described the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of HFRS patches occupied by the incidence classes. The HFRS transition probabilities also suggested the presence of both positive and negative relations among the main classes. The HFRS indicator plots offer complementary visualizations of the varying probabilities of transition between incidence classes, and so they describe the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different classes.
CONCLUSIONS: The cd-BME method combined with probabilistic logic indicators offer an accurate and informative quantitative representation of the heterogeneous HFRS incidences in the space-time domain, and the results thus obtained can be interpreted readily. The same methodological combination could also be used in the spatiotemporal modeling and prediction of other epidemics under similar circumstances.","['He J', 'Christakos G', 'Wu J', 'Jankowski P', 'Langousis A', 'Wang Y', 'Yin W', 'Zhang W']",2019,13,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"He J, et al.

TTP is usually caused by deficient activity of von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13), due to either gene mutations or acquired via anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. It can be triggered by bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, cardiothoracic-, abdominal-, and orthopedic surgeries, infections including very rarely Helicobacter pylori infection. CASE REPORT Here we report a case of a 16-year-old male with TTP, who presented with thrombocytopenia before an appendectomy. Seven days after surgery, our patient started to vomit, developed melena, and was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with clinical presentation of shock. Gastroscopy revealed H. pylori positive hemorrhagic gastritis. The patient was treated by erythrocyte transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, human albumin, glucose-electrolyte solutions, vitamin K, platelet transfusion before implantation of central venous catheter, and antibiotics. After 36 hours, we started plasma exchange (PEX). Blood tests showed deficiency of ADAMTS13. Due to the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, rituximab was administered. Due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, he was artificially ventilated. Brain MR angiography showed small ischemic cerebro-vascular insult in the arteria cerebri media region. Despite immunosuppressive therapy and PEX, the patient did not improve completely until the H. pylori infection was eradicated. After which, he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of TTP accompanied with appendicitis and gastritis caused by H. pylori, where TTP improvement was dependent on H. pylori infection eradication.","['Arapović A', 'Prgomet S', 'Saraga M', 'Kovačević T', 'Prohászka Z', 'Despot R', 'Marušić E', 'Radić J']",2019,20,,Am J Case Rep,"Arapović A, et al.

In this study, we investigated the glycoproteins of Puumala, the most abundant Hantavirus species in Europe, using fluorescently labeled wild-type constructs and cytoplasmic tail (CT) mutants. We analyzed their intracellular distribution, co-localization and oligomerization, applying comprehensive live, single-cell fluorescence techniques, including confocal microscopy, imaging flow cytometry, anisotropy imaging and Number&Brightness analysis. We demonstrate that Gc is significantly enriched in the Golgi apparatus in absence of other viral components, while Gn is mainly restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Importantly, upon co-expression both glycoproteins were found in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we show that an intact CT of Gc is necessary for efficient Golgi localization, while the CT of Gn influences protein stability. Finally, we found that Gn assembles into higher-order homo-oligomers, mainly dimers and tetramers, in the ER while Gc was present as mixture of monomers and dimers within the Golgi apparatus. Our findings suggest that PUUV Gc is the driving factor of the targeting of Gc and Gn to the Golgi region, while Gn possesses a significantly stronger self-association potential.","['Sperber HS', 'Welke RW', 'Petazzi RA', 'Bergmann R', 'Schade M', 'Shai Y', 'Chiantia S', 'Herrmann A', 'Schwarzer R']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Sperber HS, et al.

30663801,Innate and adaptive immune responses against human Puumala virus infection: immunopathogenesis and suggestions for novel treatment strategies for severe hantavirus-associated syndromes.,"Two related hyperinflammatory syndromes are distinguished following infection of humans with hantaviruses: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) seen in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) seen in the Americas. Fatality rates are high, up to 10% for HFRS and around 35%-40% for HPS. Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most common HFRS-causing hantavirus in Europe. Here, we describe recent insights into the generation of innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses following clinical infection with PUUV. First described are studies demonstrating a marked redistribution of peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) to the airways, a process that may underlie local immune activation at the site of primary infection. We then describe observations of an excessive natural killer (NK) cell activation and the persistence of highly elevated numbers of NK cells in peripheral blood following PUUV infection. A similar vigorous CD8 Tcell response is also described, though Tcell responses decline with viraemia. Like MNPs, many NK cells and CD8 T cells also localize to the lung upon acute PUUV infection. Following this, findings demonstrating the ability of hantaviruses, including PUUV, to cause apoptosis resistance in infected target cells, are described. These observations, and associated inflammatory cytokine responses, may provide new insights into HFRS and HPS disease pathogenesis.

30657443,Incorporation of CD40 ligand or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor into Hantaan virus (HTNV) virus-like particles significantly enhances the long-term immunity potency against HTNV infection.,"PURPOSE: Hantavirus infections cause severe haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans and are associated with high fatality rates. In 2017, numerous outbreaks were reported in China and Germany. This represents a significant public-healthcare issue with no effective HFRS vaccines that offer a long-term immune response. In this study, we investigated the long-term humoral and cellular immune responses and protective immunity of Hantaan virus (HTNV) granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) virus-like particles (VLPs) in mice.
METHODOLOGY: GM-CSF and CD40L VLPs were constructed via co-transfection of pCI-S and pCI-M-CD40L, and pCI-S and pCI-M-GM-CSF, into dihydrofolatereductase (dhfr)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively. Mice were immunized with HTNV VLPs 2 weeks apart. The animals were challenged 6 months after immunization. Specific and neutralizing antibodies were assessed by ELISA; IFN-γ was measured by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay and effectiveness by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity assays. Nucleic acid loads of HTNV were tested by quantitative real-time PCR and viral antigen was detected via indirect ELISA. Pathological alterations were detected via haematoxylin-eosin staining.
RESULTS: GM-CSF and CD40L VLPs provided stable, long-term protection with a high titre of neutralizing antibody in mice 6 months after immunization. Furthermore, VLPs increased HTNV-specific cellular immune responses via higher expression of IFN-γ and CTL responses. HTNV challenge assay results showed long-term protection against HFRS. No significant pathological alteration was observed in the organs of mice after immunization.
CONCLUSION: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report demonstrating the long-term potency of HTNV VLP vaccines against HTNV infection and offers new insights into HTNV vaccine development.","['Dong Y', 'Ma T', 'Zhang X', 'Ying Q', 'Han M', 'Zhang M', 'Yang R', 'Li Y', 'Wang F', 'Liu R', 'Wu X']",2019,68,3,J Med Microbiol,"Dong Y, et al.

30643674,Simultaneous rapid detection of Hantaan virus and Seoul virus using RT-LAMP in rats.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is in most cases caused by the Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV). To develop and apply reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect HTNV and SEOV simultaneously, which was faster, more cost effective, and easier to perform as the target gene amplified rapidly. In this article an assay based on LAMP is demonstrated, which only employs such apparatus as a water bath or a heat block.
METHODS: A chromogenic method using the calcein/Mn
RESULTS: The detection limit of RT-LAMP to HNTV and SEOV was as low as 10 copies/μL with optimized reaction conditions, which was much more sensitive than the RT-PCR method (100-1,000 copies/μL). At the same time, the detection results of 23 clinical specimens have also illustrated the agreement between this the RT-LAMP assay with RT-PCR and IFT.
DISCUSSION: This RT-LAMP assay could be used to perform simultaneous and rapid detection of HTNV and SEOV to the clinical specimens.","['Sui X', 'Zhang X', 'Fei D', 'Zhang Z', 'Ma M']",2019,6,,PeerJ,"Sui X, et al.

30635845,Molecular detection of viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers in rodents in the south-west of Korea.,"Many pathogens causing hemorrhagic fevers of medical and veterinary importance have been identified and isolated from rodents in the Republic of Korea (ROK). We investigated the occurrence of emerging viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and flaviviruses, from wild rodents. Striped field mice, Apodemus agrarius (n = 39), were captured during 2014-2015 in the south-west of ROK. Using molecular methods, lung samples were evaluated for SFTS virus, hantavirus, and flavivirus, and seropositivity was evaluated in the blood. A high positive rate of hantavirus (46.2%) was detected in A. agrarius lungs by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-N-PCR). The monthly occurrence of hantavirus was 16.7% in October, 86.7% in November, and 25% in August of the following year (p < 0.001). Moreover, 17.9% of blood samples were serologically positive for hantavirus antibodies. The most prevalent strain in A. agrarius was Hantaan virus. All samples were positive for neither SFTS virus nor flavivirus. Hantaan virus was detected in 86.7% of A. agrarius in November (autumn), and thus, virus shedding from A. agrarius can increase the risk of humans contracting HFRS. These findings may help to predict and prevent disease outbreaks in ROK.","['Jalal S', 'Jha B', 'Kim CM', 'Kim DM', 'Yun NR', 'Kim YS', 'Park JW', 'Chung JK']",2019,25,2,J Neurovirol,"Jalal S, et al.

30619692,Effectiveness of inactivated hantavirus vaccine on the disease severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: An inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine (iHV) has been broadly used as a preventive strategy for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) by the South Korean Army. After the vaccination program was initiated, the overall incidence of HFRS cases was reduced in the military population. While there are about 400 HFRS cases annually, few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the iHV in field settings. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the iHV efficacy on HFRS severity.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2017, HFRS cases were collected in South Korean Army hospitals along with patients' vaccination history. HFRS patients were classified retrospectively into two groups according to vaccination records: no history of iHV vaccination and valid vaccination. Vaccine efficacy on the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) stage and dialysis events were investigated.
RESULTS: The effects of the iHV on renal injury severity in between 18 valid vaccinated and 110 non-vaccinated patients were respectively evaluated. In the valid vaccination group, six of the 18 HFRS patients (33.3%) had stage 3 AKI, compared to 60 of the 110 (54.5%) patients in the non-vaccination group. The iHV efficacy against disease progression (VE
CONCLUSION: The iHV efficacy against the progression of HFRS failed to demonstrate statistically significant protection. However, different severity profiles were observed between the iHV and non-vaccination groups.

Methods The plasma samples were collected from 14 HFRS patients at acute stage or convalescent stage and 14 normal controls. After extraction, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) was used to detect the content of MLT in the plasma. The plasma MTL levels were compared between different severities or stages of HFRS patients and the normal controls. Meanwhile, the relationships between the MLT level and clinical indicators such as white blood cell (WBC) count were analyzed. Results The plasma MLT level of HFRS patients at the acute stage were significantly lower than that of the normal controls, and also significantly lower than that at the convalescence of HFRS. At the acute stage, the plasma MLT level of mild/severe HFRS patients was lower than that of critical patients. Moreover, the level of plasma MLT was negatively correlated with WBC count in HFRS patients at acute or convalescence stages. Conclusion MLT may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses in HFRS patients, which may affect the pathogenesis and disease progression of HFRS.","['Ma Y', 'Tang K', 'Song C', 'Fan L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y']",2018,34,11,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Ma Y, et al.

30541481,Motility of human renal cells is disturbed by infection with pathogenic hantaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by pathogenic hantaviruses in Europe and Asia is often characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI) with massive proteinuria. Renal filtration depends on the integrity of epithelial and endothelial monolayers in the tubular and glomerular apparatus. Tubular and glomerular cells represent target cells of hantavirus infection. However, the detailed mechanisms of renal impairment induced by hantaviruses are not well understood.
METHODS: We analyzed the cellular consequences of hantavirus infection by measuring adhesion and migration capacity of human renal cells infected with Puumala (PUUV) or Hantaan (HTNV) virus. The impact of hantaviral nucleocapsid proteins (N proteins) on motility was examined by transfection of podocytes.
RESULTS: Infection of kidney cells with hantavirus species PUUV and HTNV causes a significant reduction of migration capacity. The impaired motility depends on viral replication and transfection of podocytes with N protein of PUUV or HTNV reveals that the expression of N protein alone is sufficient to deteriorate podocyte function. The cellular effects are more pronounced for the more pathogenic HTNV than for PUUV that causes a milder form of HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The direct impairment of migration capacity of renal cells by hantaviral N proteins may contribute substantially to proteinuria observed in the clinical picture of hantavirus infection.","['Hägele S', 'Müller A', 'Nusshag C', 'Reiser J', 'Zeier M', 'Krautkrämer E']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Hägele S, et al.

We conducted an epizootiologic investigation and phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses to infer the phylogenetic relationships of hantaviruses in space and time, and gain further insights into their evolutionary dynamics in Shandong Province. Our data indicated that the Seoul virus (SEOV) is distributed throughout Shandong, whereas Hantaan virus (HTNV) co-circulates with SEOV in the eastern and southern areas of Shandong. Their distribution showed strong geographic clustering. In addition, our analyses indicated multiple evolutionary paths, long-distance transmission, and demographic expansion events for SEOV in some areas. Selection pressure analyses revealed that negative selection on hantaviruses acted as the principal evolutionary force, whereas a little evidence of positive selection exists. We found that several positively selected sites were located within major functional regions and indicated the importance of these residues for adaptive evolution of hantaviruses.","['Zuo SQ', 'Li XJ', 'Wang ZQ', 'Jiang JF', 'Fang LQ', 'Zhang WH', 'Zhang JS', 'Zhao QM', 'Cao WC']",2018,9,,Front Microbiol,"Zuo SQ, et al.

30508604,Virus- and cell type-specific effects in orthohantavirus infection.,"Orthohantaviruses Hantaan (HTNV) and Puumala (PUUV) virus cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), that is characterized by acute renal failure with often massive proteinuria and by morphological changes of the tubular and glomerular apparatus. Orthohantaviral N protein is found in renal cells and plays a key role in replication. However, the replication in human renal cells is not well characterized. Therefore, we examined the orthohantaviral infection in different human renal cells. Differences in localization of N protein, release of particles, and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton between both virus species are observed in human renal cells. A substantial portion of HTNV N protein demonstrates a filamentous pattern in addition to the typical punctate pattern. Release of HTNV depends on an intact actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. In contrast, PUUV N protein is generally localized in a punctate pattern and release of PUUV does not require an intact actin cytoskeleton. Infection of podocytes results in cytoskeletal rearrangements that are more pronounced for HTNV. Analyzing Vero E6 cells revealed differences compared to human renal cells. The pattern of N proteins is strictly punctate, release does not depend on an intact actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal rearrangements are not present. No virus-specific variations between HTNV and PUUV are observed in Vero E6 cells. Using human renal cells as cell culture model for orthohantavirus infection demonstrates virus-specific differences and orthohantavirus-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements that are not observed in Vero E6 cells. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate cell culture system is a prerequisite to study orthohantavirus pathogenicity.","['Hägele S', 'Müller A', 'Nusshag C', 'Reiser J', 'Zeier M', 'Krautkrämer E']",2019,260,,Virus Res,"Hägele S, et al.

30503652,Severe Sinus Bradycardia in Puumala virus infection.,"Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) is the most prevalent of the four species of zoonotic hantaviruses found in Europe, causing nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with acute kidney injury that presents with elevated serum creatinine level, proteinuria and hematuria. The febrile phase of the infection begins with flu-like syndrome and visual disturbance. Laboratory results can show thrombocytopenia. The oliguric phase with elevated serum creatinine level then occurs. Cardiac involvement is sometimes observed, especially ECG abnormality: transient T-waves inversion, generally in the lateral or inferior leads. Marked bradycardia has been exceptionally described. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with acute PUUV infection. Two days after admission, the patient presented a sinus bradycardia at 25/min. The bradycardia was asymptomatic, persisted one week and resolved spontaneously. Cardiac involvement in Puumala virus infection seems not to be associated with a bad prognosis. Bradycardia in the course of an influenza-like illness in endemic areas should suggest several pathogens such as legionella, Q fever or PUUV virus infection.","['Pastissier A', 'Humbert S', 'Naudion P', 'Meaux-Ruault N', 'Badoz M', 'Magy-Bertrand N']",2019,79,,Int J Infect Dis,"Pastissier A, et al.

30517161,High plasma resistin associates with severe acute kidney injury in Puumala hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infected patients typically suffer from acute kidney injury (AKI). Adipokines have inflammation modulating functions in acute diseases including AKI. We examined plasma levels of three adipokines (resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in acute PUUV infection and their associations with disease severity.
METHODS: This study included 79 patients hospitalized due to acute PUUV infection. Plasma resistin, leptin, adiponectin, as well as IL-6 and CRP, were measured at the acute phase, recovery phase and one year after hospitalization.
RESULTS: Plasma resistin levels were significantly higher in the acute phase compared to the recovery phase and one year after (median resistin 28 pg/mL (11-107) vs. 17 pg/mL (7-36) vs. 14 pg/mL (7-31), p<0.001). Maximum resistin concentration correlated with maximum plasma creatinine levels (r = 0.63; p<0.001). The higher the amount of albuminuria in the urine dipstick test (0-1+, 2+ or 3+) at admission, the higher the median of maximum resistin (24.7 pg/mL, 25.4 pg/mL and 39.6 pg/mL, respectively, p = 0.002). High resistin was also an independent risk factor for severe AKI (creatinine ≥353.6μmol/L) (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14). Neither plasma leptin nor adiponectin level had any correlation with creatinine concentration or the amount of albuminuria.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma resistin independently associates with the severity of AKI in acute PUUV infection. The association of resistin with the amount of albuminuria suggests that the level of plasma resistin is not only influenced by renal clearance but could have some role in the pathogenesis of AKI during PUUV infection.","['Mantula PS', 'Outinen TK', 'Jaatinen P', 'Hämäläinen M', 'Huhtala H', 'Pörsti IH', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen JT', 'Mäkelä SM']",2018,13,12,PLoS One,"Mantula PS, et al.

30411470,Frailty is associated with reduced prospect of discharge home after in-hospital cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is common among acute hospital patients and might adversely affect recovery from inpatient cardiac arrest.
AIM: To assess the relationship between hospital admission characteristics, including frailty, and discharge outcome after in-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data were retrospectively analysed for all separations from a tertiary hospital during 2008-2017 that involved rapid response team attendance for cardiac arrest. Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and Charlson index of comorbidity were calculated from 'primary' and 'associated' International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Australian Modification diagnoses. HFRS ≥5 was taken to signify frailty. Discharge home from hospital and death in hospital were modelled using logistic regression.
RESULTS: There were 388 in-hospital arrest patients: 91% were aged ≥50 years, 34% were previously discharged in the past 6 months, 66% were unplanned admissions, 63% were non-cardiology-cardiothoracic admissions, 45% had a Charlson comorbidity index ≥2 and 19% were identified as frail. Discharge home occurred in 22%, discharge to another hospital 17% and death 62%. Of the frail patients, only 3 (4%) were discharged home, 12 (17%) were discharged to another hospital and 57 (79%) died in hospital. Fewer frail patients were discharged home compared with non-frail patients (4 vs 26%; odds ratio (OR) 0.13, P = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, patients were less likely to be discharged home if they had frailty (OR 0.24, P = 0.02), age ≥ 50 years (OR 0.36, P = 0.01), non-cardiology-cardiothoracic unit admission (OR 0.40, P = 0.001) and unplanned admission (OR 0.57, P = 0.04). Frail patients discharged to another hospital spent a median of 15 days (interquartile range 11-23) in the hospital post-arrest before leaving to continue inpatient care elsewhere. Frailty was associated with death in hospital on univariate analysis (79 vs 58%; OR 2.80, P = 0.001) but not after controlling for other factors.
CONCLUSION: Frail patients are unlikely to make a good recovery after in-hospital arrest.

Thus, frail patients are not readily apparent from a systems perspective for those interested in implementing quality improvement measures to optimise their outcomes. This study was designed to externally validate and compare two recently described tools using administrative data as potential markers for frailty: the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the Hospital-patient One-year Mortality Risk (HOMR) Score.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.

RESULTS: In 452 785 patients (25.9% with intermediate or high-risk HFRS), increased HFRS was associated with higher Charlson scores, older age and decreased likelihood of baseline independence. Patients with high or intermediate HFRS had significantly increased risks of prolonged hospitalisation (70.0% (OR 8.64, 95%  CI 8.30 to 8.99) or 49.7% (OR 3.66, 95%  CI 3.60 to 3.71) vs 21.3% in low-risk HFRS group) and 30-day mortality (15.5% (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.33) or 16.8% (OR 1.39, 95%  CI 1.36 to 1.41) vs 12.7% in low-risk), but 
CONCLUSIONS: The HFRS best identified hospitalised older patients at higher risk of prolonged length of stay and the HOMR score better predicted 30-day mortality. However, neither score was suitable for predicting risk of readmission or ED visit in the 30 days after discharge. Thus, a single score is inadequate to prognosticate for all outcomes associated with frailty.","['McAlister F', 'van Walraven C']",2019,28,4,BMJ Qual Saf,McAlister F and van Walraven C.

30321706,Is the urban-adapted ring-billed gull a biovector for flame retardants?,"Birds may act as biovectors of nutrients and contaminants at the regional scale and potentially increase the exposure to such substances in ecosystems frequented by these birds. However, no study has estimated biotransport of contaminants by individual birds through their feces (guano). Elevated concentrations of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) have been reported in ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) breeding near Montreal (QC, Canada)- a known hotspot for HFRs. The objective of the present study was to investigate the concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and selected emerging HFRs (e.g., Dechlorane-related compounds) in guano of individual ring-billed gulls, and to assess the relative accumulation of these HFRs by comparing concentrations in plasma (absorbed) versus guano (excreted). A second objective was to determine the importance of one of the largest ring-billed gull colony (Deslauriers Island) in North America located near Montreal as a vector of HFR biotransport at the regional scale. Elevated concentrations of PBDEs and Dechlorane plus were determined in guano and plasma of ring-billed gulls, although in general no difference was found between males and females. However, plasma to guano concentration ratios were significantly greater in females for the highly hydrophobic BDE-209 and Dechlorane plus compared to males. Overall, for both sexes combined, the total amount of HFRs (sum of the 16 major PBDEs and five emerging HFRs) deposited by this entire colony (64,980 gulls) in the Montreal area through guano during the 28-days incubation period was estimated to 1 g. This study showed that urban-adapted ring-billed gulls from this large colony represent an underestimated biovector of HFRs, which may contribute to augment exposure to these toxic compounds in nearby ecosystems.","['Desjardins CF', 'Mazerolle MJ', 'Verreault J']",2019,244,,Environ Pollut,"Desjardins CF, et al.

30293532,"The first case of thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome with unilateral adrenal necrosis: a case report.","BACKGROUND: TAFRO syndrome, which was first reported in 2010 in Japan, is a relatively rare disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Although this disease is considered similar to multicentric Castleman disease, some of the clinical features, such as thrombocytopenia, are different from typical cases of multicentric Castleman disease. In addition, the etiology of TAFRO syndrome remains unknown and controversial. There have only been a few cases of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal gland lesions, and all of them have had hemorrhagic involvement.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the case of a 46-year-old Asian man who presented with fever, epigastric pain, and back pain for 1 month. A computed tomographic scan revealed ascites, mild lymphadenopathy, and left adrenal necrosis without hemorrhage. A blood test showed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine levels. Based on the edema, severe thrombocytopenia, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis shown by bone marrow biopsy, mild lymphadenopathy, and progressive renal insufficiency, we diagnosed this patient as having TAFRO syndrome. He was successfully treated by immediate administration of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: There have been no previous reports of a case of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal necrosis. Because the biopsy of the left adrenal gland revealed necrosis without any evidence of hemorrhage, we concluded that the unilateral adrenal necrosis in this case was caused by either ischemia from infarction or organomegaly itself under severe hypercytokinemia. This unusual clinical course is useful for further analysis of the etiology of TAFRO syndrome.","['Fujiwara Y', 'Ito K', 'Takamura A', 'Nagata K']",2018,12,1,J Med Case Rep,"Fujiwara Y, et al.

30283445,Neutrophil Activation in Acute Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal Syndrome Is Mediated by Hantavirus-Infected Microvascular Endothelial Cells.,"Hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans. Both diseases are considered to be immunologically mediated but the exact pathological mechanisms are still poorly understood. Neutrophils are considered the first line of defense against invading microbes but little is still known of their role in virus infections. We wanted to study the role of neutrophils in HFRS using blood and tissue samples obtained from Puumala hantavirus (PUUV)-infected patients. We found that neutrophil activation products myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase, together with interleukin-8 (the major neutrophil chemotactic factor in humans), are strongly elevated in blood of acute PUUV-HFRS and positively correlate with kidney dysfunction, the hallmark clinical finding of HFRS. These markers localized mainly in the tubulointerstitial space in the kidneys of PUUV-HFRS patients suggesting neutrophil activation to be a likely component of the general immune response toward hantaviruses. We also observed increased levels of circulating extracellular histones at the acute stage of the disease supporting previous findings of neutrophil extracellular trap formation in PUUV-HFRS. Mechanistically, we did not find evidence for direct PUUV-mediated activation of neutrophils but instead primary blood microvascular endothelial cells acquired a pro-inflammatory phenotype and promoted neutrophil degranulation in response to PUUV infection ","['Strandin T', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Vaheri A']",2018,9,,Front Immunol,"Strandin T, et al.

The Hebei province, one of areas with the highest prevalence, has reported HFRS cases every year in the last two decades. This study describes the spatiotemporal patterns of HFRS in the Hebei province from 2001 to 2016, detects the high-risk spatiotemporal clusters of HFRS, and provides valuable information for planning and implementation of local preventive measures. For the purpose of the analysis, HFRS cases recorded during the sixteen years in the Hebei province were aggregated into three temporal periods (2001-2006, 2007-2012, and 2013-2016). Spatiotemporal analyses, including Global spatial autocorrelation analysis and Kulldorff's scan statistical analysis, were applied to analyze te spatiotemporal clusters of HFRS at the county level. The results revealed that the spatial extent of the HFRS epidemic in the Hebei province changed dynamically from 2001 to 2016, which indicated that a comprehensive preventative strategy should be implemented in the northeastern regions of the Hebei province in spring.","['Cai Y', 'Wei Y', 'Han X', 'Han Z', 'Liu S', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Qi S', 'Li Q']",2019,91,3,J Med Virol,"Cai Y, et al.

30114480,Two cases of imported hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and systematic review of literature.,"Many factors are involved in the epidemiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Imported cases, as well as those by emigrants, have been reported in literature worldwide. Our goal is to document two cases of HFRS, imported by two immigrants from two countries, and to make a review of the imported HFRS literature data. We performed a systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) of imported cases of HFRS and herein describe our two clinical cases. We found 20 published papers, with 16 of them in English and 4 in other languages. Twenty-three patients with travel- or immigration-associated HFRS, including our two cases, were identified. We included only papers that were in English. The average age of the patients was 35.9 ± 15.13 years, and the ratio of male to female was 8:1. Imported disease from Europe to Europe occurred in seven cases, America to Europe occurred in four cases, Europe to America occurred in two cases, America to America occurred in two cases, Asia to Asia in one case, Asia to Europe in one case, and Europe to Asia in one case. The results of the two cited cases are based on the clinical-laboratory, anamnestic, and serologic data for both the patients who tested positive for HFRS. Our systematic analysis shows that international travelers are important sources of infectious diseases. HFRS related to travel and immigration is a rare event. Principal risk factors for travelers and immigrants are camping outside recommended areas or under unsuitable conditions. In recent years, various publications have shown that international travelers and immigrants have expanded the spectrum of imported infectious diseases.

The estimated effects of mean temperature and DTR on HFRS were non-linear. The immediate and strong effect of low temperature and high DTR on HFRS was found. The lowest temperature -8.86°C at lag 0 days indicated the largest related relative risk (RRs) with the reference (14.85 °C), respectively, 1.46 (95% CI 1.11-1.90) for total cases, 1.33 (95% CI 1.00-1.78) for the males and 1.76 (95% CI 1.12-2.79) for the females. Highest DTR was associated with a higher risk on HFRS, the largest RRs (95% CI) were obtained when DTR = 15.97 °C with a reference at 8.62 °C, with 1.26 (0.96-1.64) for total cases and 1.52 (0.97-2.38) for the female at lag 0 days, 1.22 (1.05-1.41) for the male at lag 5 days. Non-linear lag effects of mean temperature and DTR on HFRS were identified and there were slight differences for different sexes.","['Xu Q', 'Li R', 'Rutherford S', 'Luo C', 'Liu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Li X']",2018,146,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Xu Q, et al.

29968979,Absence of a Seasonal Variation of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome in Yeoncheon Compared to Nationwide Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Yeoncheon is an endemic region for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and has been reporting HFRS cases intermittently in other seasons, including autumn. This study was conducted to determine whether a seasonal variation pattern of HFRS exists in Yeoncheon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2016, raw data of the number of patients with HFRS in Yeoncheon and nationwide was collected from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention. On the basis of the raw data, the incidence per 100,000 population was calculated for each month of the year. The twelve months were divided into four quarters, and the proportion of the disease by each quarter was calculated. The effects of sex, age, quarter, and time on HFRS occurrence were analyzed by Poisson regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 6,132 HFRS cases occurred nationwide, and 62 cases occurred in Yeoncheon. The incidence of the disease in Yeoncheon (9.07/100,000) was statistically higher than that nationwide (0.81/100,000). The quarterly incidence showed that occurrence proportion of HFRS was high in the third and fourth quarters (12.9%, 67.5%) nationwide, whereas it was relatively similar in all quarters in Yeoncheon (17.7%, 21.0%, 25.8%, 35.5%). The Poisson regression model showed that the relative risk of HFRS nationwide was 1.322 in the third quarter and 6.903 in the fourth quarter, but Yeoncheon had no risk increase by quarter.
CONCLUSION: In this study, HFRS in Yeoncheon demonstrated no seasonal variation pattern compared to that in nationwide Korea, which may be considered a regional characteristic. Furthermore, in other regions where HFRS is endemic, like Yeoncheon, HFRS may arise regardless of seasonal variations.",['Park YH'],2018,50,2,Infect Chemother,Park YH.

This study aimed to explore the associations between meteorological factors and HFRS epidemic risk in Guangzhou for the period from 2006-2015.
METHODS: We obtained data of HFRS cases in Guangzhou from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS) during the period of 2006-2015. Meteorological data were obtained from the Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau. A negative binomial multivariable regression was used to explore the relationship between meteorological variables and HFRS.
RESULTS: The annual average incidence was 0.92 per 100000, with the annual incidence ranging from 0.64/100000 in 2009 to 1.05/100000 in 2012. The monthly number of HFRS cases decreased by 5.543% (95%CI -5.564% to -5.523%) each time the temperature was increased by 1°C and the number of cases decreased by 0.075% (95%CI -0.076% to -0.074%) each time the aggregate rainfall was increased by 1 mm. We found that average temperature with a one-month lag was significantly associated with HFRS transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Meteorological factors had significant association with occurrence of HFRS in Guangzhou, Southern China. This study provides preliminary information for further studies on epidemiological prediction of HFRS and for developing an early warning system.","['Wei Y', 'Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Qin P', 'Lu Y', 'Xu J', 'Chen S', 'Li M', 'Yang Z']",2018,12,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Wei Y, et al.

29936795,First molecular characterization of Dobrava-Belgrade virus found in Apodemus flavicollis in Poland.,"INTRODUCTION: Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is one of the emerging pathogens which have been reported during the last decades in Europe and have attracted the attention of researchers. The course of infection among humans may have a varied course - from the completely asymptomatic to the more severe forms, such as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). DOBV is hosted and carried by rodents like Apodemus flavicollis or A. agrarius, which occur commonly in Europe.
OBJECTIVE: To-date, orthohantaviruses have been reported in Poland, both in humans and animals, but detailed country-scale studies have not yet been carried out. The aim of the study was molecular characterization of a strain which was found in A. flavicollis in south-eastern Poland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis of the first Dobrava-Belgrade virus found in A. flavicollis in the subcarpathian region of south-eastern Poland, presented in this study, was performed after virus proliferation in cell culture and sequencing of specific PCR products.
RESULTS: Based on genetic sequences of fragments of three segments (S, M and L), the isolated virus was assigned to the Dobrava genotype, taking into consideration the most current classification of the DOBV species.
CONCLUSIONS: The Dobrava-Belgrade virus strain isolated from A. flavicollis in the subcarpathian region of south-eastern Poland, has been molecularly characterized and assigned to Dobrava genotype, thereby the occurrence of that genotype in Poland has been confirmed by molecular techniques.","['Kolodziej M', 'Melgies A', 'Joniec-Wiechetek J', 'Michalski A', 'Nowakowska A', 'Pitucha G', 'Niemcewicz M']",2018,25,2,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Kolodziej M, et al.

29934976,Prospective evaluation of integrated device diagnostics for heart failure management: results of the TRIAGE-HF study.,"AIMS: The primary aim of the TRIAGE-HF trial was to correlate cardiac implantable electronic device-generated heart failure risk status (HFRS) with signs, symptoms, and patient behaviours classically associated with worsening heart failure (HF).
METHODS AND RESULTS: TRIAGE-HF enrolled 100 subjects with systolic HF implanted with a Medtronic high-performance device and followed up at three Canadian HF centres. Study follow-up was up to 8 months. The HFRS assigned each subject's overall risk of HF hospitalization in the next 30 days and also highlighted abnormal device parameters contributing to a patient's risk status at the time of remote data transmission. Subjects with a high HFRS were contacted by telephone to assess symptoms, and compliance with prescribed therapies, nutrition, and exercise. Clinician-assessed risk and HFRS-calculated risk were correlated at both study baseline and exit. Twenty-four high HFRS occurrences were observed among 100 subjects. Device parameters associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization included OptiVol index (n = 20), followed by low patient activity (n = 18) and elevated night heart rate (n = 12). High HFRS was associated with symptoms of worsening HF in 63% of cases (n = 15) increasing to 83% of cases (n = 20) when non-compliance with pharmacological therapies and lifestyle was considered.
CONCLUSIONS: TRIAGE-HF is the first study to provide prospective data on the distribution of abnormal device parameters contributing to high HFRS. High HFRS has good predictive accuracy for patient-reported signs, symptoms, and behaviours associated with worsening HF status. As such, HFRS may be a useful tool for ambulatory HF monitoring to improve both patient-centred and health system level outcomes.","['Virani SA', 'Sharma V', 'McCann M', 'Koehler J', 'Tsang B', 'Zieroth S']",2018,5,5,ESC Heart Fail,"Virani SA, et al.

De-identified daily reports of HFRS in Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning Provinces for 2005-2014 were obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily weather data from each study location were obtained from the China meteorological Data Sharing Service System. Generalised estimating equation models (GEE) were used to quantify the city-specific HFRS-weather associations. Multivariate random-effects meta-regression models were used to pool the city-specific HFRS-weather effect estimates. HFRS showed an overall downward trend during the study period with a slight rebound after 2010. Meteorological factors were significantly associated with HFRS incidence. HFRS was relatively more sensitive to weather variability in subtropical regions (Anhui Province) than in temperate regions (Heilongjiang and Liaoning Provinces).

29885476,Molecular epidemiology of Dobrava-Belgrade virus in Greece.,"In order to gain an insight into the genetic relatedness of the Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) in Greece, a phylogenetic analysis was performed based on all currently available DOBV sequences obtained from hospitalized cases with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Most cases occurred in northwestern and north central part of the country. Two sequence datasets consisted of 41 S and 12 M partial DOBV RNA segment sequences were analyzed. All DOBV strains belong to Dobrava genotype which is associated with the rodent Apodemus flavicollis. In both phylogenetic trees (S and M segments), two main clusters of Greek strains could be distinguished. Phylogenetic analysis showed a spatial rather than temporal relation of the strains, since their genetic clustering was highly associated with the geographic distribution of the cases. Besides previous characterized endemic foci, novel ones have been identified, expanding our knowledge on the epidemiology of HFRS in Greece.","['Tsergouli K', 'Papadopoulou E', 'Tsioka K', 'Papa A']",2018,64,,Infect Genet Evol,"Tsergouli K, et al.

29874263,Spatiotemporal variation of the association between climate dynamics and HFRS outbreaks in Eastern China during 2005-2016 and its geographic determinants.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-associated zoonosis caused by hantavirus. The HFRS was initially detected in northeast China in 1931, and since 1955 it has been detected in many regions of the country. Global climate dynamics influences HFRS spread in a complex nonlinear way. The quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the ""HFRS infections-global climate dynamics"" association at a large geographical scale and during a long time period is still lacking.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This work is the first study of a recently completed dataset of monthly HFRS cases in Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. A methodological synthesis that involves a time-frequency technique, a composite space-time model, hotspot analysis, and machine learning is implemented in the study of (a) the association between HFRS incidence spread and climate dynamics and (b) the geographic factors impacting this association over Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. The results showed that by assimilating core and city-specific knowledge bases the synthesis was able to depict quantitatively the space-time variation of periodic climate-HFRS associations at a large geographic scale and to assess numerically the strength of this association in the area and period of interest. It was found that the HFRS infections in Eastern China has a strong association with global climate dynamics, in particular, the 12, 18 and 36 mos periods were detected as the three main synchronous periods of climate dynamics and HFRS distribution. For the 36 mos period (which is the period with the strongest association), the space-time correlation pattern of the association strength indicated strong temporal but rather weak spatial dependencies. The generated space-time maps of association strength and association hotspots provided a clear picture of the geographic variation of the association strength that often-exhibited cluster characteristics (e.g., the south part of the study area displays a strong climate-HFRS association with non-point effects, whereas the middle-north part displays a weak climate-HFRS association). Another finding of this work is the upward climate-HFRS coherency trend for the past few years (2013-2015) indicating that the climate impacts on HFRS were becoming increasingly sensitive with time. Lastly, another finding of this work is that geographic factors affect the climate-HFRS association in an interrelated manner through local climate or by means of HFRS infections. In particular, location (latitude, distance to coastline and longitude), grassland and woodland are the geographic factors exerting the most noticeable effects on the climate-HFRS association (e.g., low latitude has a strong effect, whereas distance to coastline has a wave-like effect).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed synthetic quantitative approach revealed important aspects of the spatiotemporal variation of the climate-HFRS association in Eastern China during a long time period, and identified the geographic factors having a major impact on this association. Both findings could improve public health policy in an HFRS-torn country like China. Furthermore, the synthetic approach developed in this work can be used to map the space-time variation of different climate-disease associations in other parts of China and the World.","['He J', 'Christakos G', 'Wu J', 'Cazelles B', 'Qian Q', 'Mu D', 'Wang Y', 'Yin W', 'Zhang W']",2018,12,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"He J, et al.

29850303,Two Atypical Cases of Hantavirus Infections from Sri Lanka.,"There are two categories of hantaviruses resulting in two distinct illnesses. The Old World (Asia and Europe) viruses give rise to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and the New World (Americas) viruses cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hantavirus infections have very similar clinical pictures and epidemiology to leptospirosis. Here, we present two cases of hantavirus infections from Sri Lanka (in South Asia) initially misdiagnosed as leptospirosis and later further investigated and diagnosed as hantavirus infections with serological confirmation of the diagnosis. They had clinical pictures of a combination of both HFRS and HPS as well as the involvement of the central nervous system. Hantavirus infections are rarely diagnosed in South Asia. Reports on such atypical clinical pictures of hantavirus infections are extremely rare. Having arrived at the correct diagnosis late/retrospectively, both these patients recovered notwithstanding being seriously ill, indicating adequate supportive therapy can save lives in such cases. The emergence of the hantavirus, an infection seriously affecting multiple organ systems with a high case fatality rate that is spread by aerosol and other routes, could become a serious public health issue in Sri Lanka.","['Ehelepola NDB', 'Basnayake BMLS', 'Sathkumara SMBY', 'Kaluphana KLR']",2018,2018,,Case Rep Infect Dis,"Ehelepola NDB, et al.

29802830,Human platelet antigens in disease.,"Platelets have various functions and participate in primary hemostasis, inflammation, and immune responses. Human platelet antigens (HPAs) are alloantigens expressed on the platelet membrane. Each HPA represent one of six platelet glycoproteins GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIa, GPIbα, GPIbβ, and CD109, and six biallelic systems are grouped. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene sequence causes a single amino acid substitution of relevant platelet glycoprotein with the exception of HPA-14bw. High-throughput next-generation sequencing-based method has been developed, which enable accurately identification of HPA polymorphisms. The roles of HPA in disease were reviewed. HPAs mediate platelet-microorganism and platelet-malignant cell interactions, and they also participate in pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and infective endocarditis. The exploration of HPA polymorphisms in association with disease susceptibility of individuals will benefit prevention or management of disease.","['Wen YH', 'Chen DP']",2018,484,,Clin Chim Acta,Wen YH and Chen DP.

29791494,Sequential assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Information on the sequential appearance, duration, and magnitude of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is limited.
METHODS: Analysis of clinical and laboratory parameters obtained serially in 81 patients with HFRS, of whom 15 were infected with Dobrava virus and 66 with Puumala virus.
RESULTS: The initial signs/symptoms, appearing on median day 1 of illness, were fever, headache, and myalgia. These were present in 86%, 65%, and 40% of patients and had a median duration of 4, 4, and 5.5 days, respectively. The signs/symptoms were followed by myopia (appearance on day 5), insomnia (day 6), oliguria/anuria (day 6), polyuria (day 9), and sinus bradycardia (day 9.5). These were present in 35%, 30%, 28%, 91%, and 35% of patients; their median duration was 2, 2, 2, 7, and 1 day, respectively. Laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, CRP, procalcitonin, creatinine, diminished glomerular filtration rate, and leukocytosis, were ascertained on admission to hospital or on the following day (day 5 or 6 of illness) and were established in 95%, 87%, 99%, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 55% of patients, and had a median duration of 4, 3, 7, 3, 9, 8, and 2 days, respectively. Comparison of patients infected with Dobrava and Puumala viruses found several differences in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of abnormalities, indicating that Dobrava virus causes the more severe HFRS.

29765118,IFN-λs inhibit Hantaan virus infection through the JAK-STAT pathway and expression of Mx2 protein.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV), member of the newly defined Hantaviridae family, within the order Bunyavirales, can cause a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome with high fatality rates in humans. However, no specific antiviral agents are currently available for HTNV infection approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Although interferon lambdas (IFN-λs) have been shown to induce an antiviral state against HTNV, the molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. In this study, we found that IFN-λs exerted its anti-HTNV effect by activating Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway-mediated antiviral immunity in A549 cells. Simultaneously, IFN-λs downregulated suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins, which are the known negative feedback regulators of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, we demonstrated the role of IFN-λs-induced myxovirus resistance 2 (Mx2, also known as MxB) protein as a potential inhibitor for HTNV infection. These findings indicate that IFN-λs play an important role in cellular defenses against HTNV infection at an early stage and that human Mx2 may represent a potential therapeutic target for HTNV infection.","['Li N', 'Luo F', 'Chen Q', 'Zhu N', 'Wang H', 'Xie L', 'Xiong H', 'Yue M', 'Zhang Y', 'Feng Y', 'Hou W']",2019,20,3,Genes Immun,"Li N, et al.

29765019,Relationship between circulating vascular endothelial growth factor and its soluble receptor in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is characterized by endothelial dysfunction with capillary leakage without obvious cytopathology in the capillary endothelium. The aim of the study was to analyze the kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its soluble receptor (sVEGFR-2) in HFRS patients infected with Dobrava (DOBV) or Puumala virus (PUUV). VEGF and sVEGFR-2 levels were measured in daily plasma and urine samples of 73 patients with HFRS (58 with PUUV, 15 with DOBV) and evaluated in relation to clinical and laboratory variables. In comparison with the healthy controls, initial samples (obtained in the first week of illness) from patients with HFRS had higher plasma and urine VEGF levels, whereas sVEGFR-2 levels were lower in plasma but higher in urine. VEGF levels did not differ in relation to hantavirus species, viral load, or the severity of HFRS. The comparison of VEGF dynamics in plasma and urine showed the pronounced secretion of VEGF in urine. Significant correlations were found between daily VEGF/sVEGFR-2 levels and platelet counts, as well as with diuresis: the correlations were positive for plasma VEGF/sVEGFR-2 levels and negative for urine levels. In addition, patients with hemorrhagic manifestations had very high plasma and urine VEGF, together with high urine sVEGFR-2. Measuring the local secretion of sVEGFR-2 in urine might be a useful biomarker for identifying HFRS patients who will progress to severe disease.","['Pal E', 'Korva M', 'Resman Rus K', 'Kejžar N', 'Bogovič P', 'Strle F', 'Avšič-Županc T']",2018,7,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Pal E, et al.

29743115,Geographical distribution and relative risk of Anjozorobe virus (Thailand orthohantavirus) infection in black rats (Rattus rattus) in Madagascar.,"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus infection is a zoonotic disease that is associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and cardiopulmonary syndrome in human. Anjozorobe virus, a representative virus of Thailand orthohantavirus (THAIV), was recently discovered from rodents in Anjozorobe-Angavo forest in Madagascar. To assess the circulation of hantavirus at the national level, we carried out a survey of small terrestrial mammals from representative regions of the island and identified environmental factors associated with hantavirus infection. As we were ultimately interested in the potential for human exposure, we focused our research in the peridomestic area.
METHODS: Sampling was achieved in twenty districts of Madagascar, with a rural and urban zone in each district. Animals were trapped from a range of habitats and examined for hantavirus RNA by nested RT-PCR. We also investigated the relationship between hantavirus infection probability in rats and possible risk factors by using Generalized Linear Mixed Models.
RESULTS: Overall, 1242 specimens from seven species were collected (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Suncus murinus, Setifer setosus, Tenrec ecaudatus, Hemicentetes semispinosus). Overall, 12.4% (111/897) of Rattus rattus and 1.6% (2/125) of Mus musculus were tested positive for THAIV. Rats captured within houses were less likely to be infected than rats captured in other habitats, whilst rats from sites characterized by high precipitation and relatively low seasonality were more likely to be infected than those from other areas. Older animals were more likely to be infected, with infection probability showing a strong increase with weight.
CONCLUSIONS: We report widespread distribution of THAIV in the peridomestic rats of Madagascar, with highest prevalence for those living in humid areas. Although the potential risk of infection to human may also be widespread, our results provide a first indication of specific zone with high transmission. Gathered data will be helpful to implement policies for control and prevention of human risk infection.","['Raharinosy V', 'Olive MM', 'Andriamiarimanana FM', 'Andriamandimby SF', 'Ravalohery JP', 'Andriamamonjy S', 'Filippone C', 'Rakoto DAD', 'Telfer S', 'Heraud JM']",2018,15,1,Virol J,"Raharinosy V, et al.

29713899,Global Diversity and Distribution of Hantaviruses and Their Hosts.,"Rodents represent 42% of the world's mammalian biodiversity encompassing 2,277 species populating every continent (except Antarctica) and are reservoir hosts for a wide diversity of disease agents. Thus, knowing the identity, diversity, host-pathogen relationships, and geographic distribution of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens, is essential for predicting and mitigating zoonotic disease outbreaks. Hantaviruses are hosted by numerous rodent reservoirs. However, the diversity of rodents harboring hantaviruses is likely unknown because research is biased toward specific reservoir hosts and viruses. An up-to-date, systematic review covering all known rodent hosts is lacking. Herein, we document gaps in our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of rodent species that host hantaviruses. Of the currently recognized 681 cricetid, 730 murid, 61 nesomyid, and 278 sciurid species, we determined that 11.3, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.1%, respectively, have known associations with hantaviruses. The diversity of hantaviruses hosted by rodents and their distribution among host species supports a reassessment of the paradigm that each virus is associated with a single-host species. We examine these host-virus associations on a global taxonomic and geographical scale with emphasis on the rodent host diversity and distribution. Previous reviews have been centered on the viruses and not the mammalian hosts. Thus, we provide a perspective not previously addressed.","['Milholland MT', 'Castro-Arellano I', 'Suzán G', 'Garcia-Peña GE', 'Lee TE', 'Rohde RE', 'Alonso Aguirre A', 'Mills JN']",2018,15,1,Ecohealth,"Milholland MT, et al.

29654824,"Escherichia coli expression, purification, and refolding of human folate receptor α (hFRα) and β (hFRβ).","Human folate receptors (hFRα and hFRβ) are membrane proteins anchored to the cell surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. They play an important role in cell growth by taking up folate for de novo synthesis of purines and methylation of DNA, lipids, and proteins. Thus, controlling folate uptake through hFRs may lead to the development of anti-cancer drugs. Development of hFRs-targeting drug requires a large amount of hFRs. However, it is difficult to prepare active forms of hFRs from prokaryotic cells because of their high content of cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds. Here, we prepared active forms of hFRα and hFRβ from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli. The crucial steps in our preparation were intensive washing of the inclusion bodies to remove impurities derived from E. coli and gradual dropping of solubilized hFRs into refolding buffers to correctly reform disulfide bonds. The binding activity of prepared hFRs to folate was confirmed by biolayer interferometry measurements. Finally, we successfully prepared the active form of 2.52 mg hFRα and 2.4 mg hFRβ from 10 g of E. coli cell bodies.","['Dharmatti R', 'Miyatake H', 'Zhang C', 'Ren X', 'Yumoto A', 'Kiga D', 'Yamamura M', 'Ito Y']",2018,149,,Protein Expr Purif,"Dharmatti R, et al.

29631140,"Level changes and human dietary exposure assessment of halogenated flame retardant levels in free-range chicken eggs: A case study of a former e-waste recycling site, South China.","To assess the impacts of e-waste regulations on environmental pollution, we built on a previous study from 2010 to investigate the levels and human dietary exposure of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in free-range chicken eggs from Baihe village in 2013 and 2016. The concentrations of PBDEs, PBBs, HBCDs, and DBDPE showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) from 2010 to 2013/2016, suggesting the efficacy of regulatory policies. The relative contribution of BDE209 were higher in 2013 and 2016 than in 2010, accounting for 67.8%, 61.4%, and 27.7%, respectively. The concentration ratios of PBB209:PBB153 were much lower in 2013 (1.51) and 2016 (1.32) than in 2010 (29.5). These observed different profiles likely due to the different environmental behaviors of HFRs (e.g. the different atmospheric migration abilities of PBDE congeners and degradation of PBB209). Our exposure estimates suggested high dietary intake of HFRs via home-produced eggs. As for PBDEs, considering the worst situation (highly polluted eggs were consumed), the margin of exposure (MOE) of BDE99 for both adults and children were 1.5 and 0.3 in 2013, and 1.1 and 0.2 in 2016, respectively, which were below 2.5. According to the CONTAM panel, an MOE larger than 2.5 indicates no health concern. Therefore, these MOE values represent a significant potential health concern due to the adverse impacts of PBDEs on human neurodevelopment and fertility.","['Huang CC', 'Zeng YH', 'Luo XJ', 'Tang B', 'Liu YE', 'Ren ZH', 'Mai BX']",2018,634,,Sci Total Environ,"Huang CC, et al.

29621716,Assessment of dermal exposure to halogenated flame retardants: Comparison using direct measurements from hand wipes with an indirect estimation from settled dust concentrations.,"There are few studies estimating dermal exposure to halogenated flame retardants in adults. To fill this gap, sixty-one hand wipe samples were collected from a Norwegian adult cohort using gauze pads immersed in isopropanol. BDE-47, BDE-209, bis(2‑ethyl‑hexyl)‑3,4,5,6‑tetrabromophthalate (BEH-TEBP) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) were the most frequently detected chemicals. The highest median mass in hand wipes was that of sumEHFR (570 ng), followed by sumHBCDD (180 ng) and sumPBDE (2.9 ng). The high EHFR level was mainly driven by tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) which accounted for 77% of the total mass. Positive and significant correlations were observed between FR levels in hand wipes and settled dust (0.26 < r < 0.56, p < 0.05), as well as between FR levels in hand wipes and the number of electronic consumer products at home (0.27 < r < 0.40, p < 0.05). Significant bivariate associations with number of laptops/tablets and phones/mobiles were further confirmed by multivariate linear regression analyses. Dermal exposure was estimated using the levels measured in handwipes. The estimated median dermal exposure was 2600, 840 and 6.2 pg/kg bw/d for sumEHFR, sumHBCDD and sumPBDE, respectively. Further, we compared these results with the dermal exposure as estimated indirectly by utilizing previously reported FR levels in settled dust collected from the residences of the same studied cohort. With the indirect approach, higher dermal exposures to sumPBDE but lower exposures to sumEHFR and sumHBCDD were observed compared to the direct dermal exposure estimated via hand wipes. Comparable exposure estimates between hand wipes and the indirect method were obtained for α‑, β‑tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (DBE-DBCH), DBDPE, BDE-28, -35, -49, -99, -153, 154, and -183. For other individual HFRs, the exposure estimates obtained from the two approaches were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05). Both methods gave similar dermal exposure estimates for many individual FRs. However, it is important to be aware of the value and limitations of each method when using them to estimate human exposure.","['Tay JH', 'Sellström U', 'Papadopoulou E', 'Padilla-Sánchez JA', 'Haug LS', 'de Wit CA']",2018,115,,Environ Int,"Tay JH, et al.

The Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV), the most prevalent orthohantavirus in Western Europe, causes a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. In France, this endemic illness affects the north-eastern part of the country. We conducted a 4-year capture-mark-recapture study in a bank vole population, combined with molecular analyses, to explore the epidemiological situation of PUUV in Alsace, a French region where human cases have occurred, but for which no studies have been conducted on this reservoir host. PUUV-infected bank voles were detected in the 2 years that showed high bank vole density with a prevalence of 4%. The individual PUUV sequences identified in this study were similar from year to year and similar to other French sequences. On a very small spatial scale, the distribution of seropositive bank voles was very heterogeneous in time and space. The short distances travelled on average by bank voles resulted in spatial clusters of seropositive rodents, which spread only very gradually throughout the year.","['Monchatre-Leroy E', 'Murri S', 'Castel G', 'Calavas D', 'Boué F', 'Hénaux V', 'Marianneau P']",2018,65,5,Zoonoses Public Health,"Monchatre-Leroy E, et al.

29564873,Topical non-occlusive polymers in hand-foot syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Many cytotoxic and biological drugs are cause of severe dermatological side effects, such as hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR). Oncologic patients with HFS or HFSR presents relevant symptoms that interferes with daily activities and with adherence to anticancer treatment. The HFRS control and treatment are important goals to enhance the quality of life of oncologic patients. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a b.i.d. (bis in die) topical administration of an anhydric ointment based on topical non-occlusive polymers (TNOP) in patients with HFS on current anticancer drug regiments.
METHODS: A prospective, open, multicenter clinical study was conducted in oncologic patients with HFS attended two hospital-based Italian dermatological unit. A global-non-instrumental evaluation, based on different standardized tools (i.e., Sum Score System Index [SRRC] Score, Dermatology Life Qualiy Index [DLQI] and global efficacy) was conducted using measurements at baseline, at 4 and 8 weeks. Non-parametric test for two correlate samples, was used to assess changes in means of the different scores. The protocol was approved by ethical committee of both dermatology service pariticipating to the study.
RESULTS: Twenty-one oncologic patients were enrolled. Thirteen (61.9%) of participants were female. The median age was 63 years (range: 37-73). Seventeen (80.9%) patients presenting a HFS associated to capecitabine, and four patients (19.1%) associated to docetaxel. At the enrollment, 33.3% (7/21) of patients showed at level of the hands a HFS of grade 2 and 9.5% (2/21) of grade 3. At level of the feet, 28.6% (6/21) showed a HFS of grade 2, and 17.4% (4/21) of grade 3. The SRRC scores were significantly decreased after 8 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, for both sites. In particular, SRRC score decreased from 4.38 to 1.67 (Z=-3.60, P=0.00) and from 4.48 to 1.43 (Z=-3.87, P=0.00) for hands and feet, respectively. A consistent significant improvement in the perceived QoL of patients was also observed. From baseline to visit 3, the total mean score of DLQI decreased from 10.62 to 4.57 (Δ=-57%, Z=-4.020, P=0.000).

29490629,Study on expression of plasma sCD138 in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Until now, there is non-specific treatment, and exploring early and novel biomarkers to determine the disease severity and prognosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) would be of importance for clinician to take systematic and timely intervention. This study observed the expression of plasma sCD138, a soluble component shedding from the glycocalyx (GCX) to the circulating blood, and evaluated its predictive value on disease severity and prognosis of HFRS.
METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with HFRS who were treated at our center between January 2011 and December 2013 were randomly enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Thirty-five blood samples from healthy subjects were obtained as the controls. The concentrations of sCD138 were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fib), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of sCD138 among the different types were compared; the correlation among sCD138 and the laboratory parameters mentioned above were analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of sCD138 was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: Except for the mild-type, the levels of sCD138 in the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients during the acute stage were significantly higher than that of the convalescent stage and the control (P<0.05). With the aggravation of the disease, the levels of sCD138 during the acute stage had an increasing tendency, while demonstrated no significant difference among the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients (P>0.05). sCD138 was negatively correlated with Fib, PLT and ALB, and was positively correlated with WBC and AST (P<0.05). sCD138 demonstrated predictive effectiveness for prognosis with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 (P<0.001).

29461545,Temporal trends of halogenated flame retardants in the atmosphere of the Canadian Great Lakes Basin (2005-2014).,"Organic pollutants have been monitored in the atmosphere of the Great Lake Basin (GLB) since the 1990s in support of the Canada-US Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and to determine the effectiveness of source reduction measures and factors influencing air concentrations. Air samples were collected between 2005 and 2014 at three sites with different geographical characteristics (Burnt Island, Egbert and Point Petre) in the Canadian GLB using high-volume air samplers and the air samples were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and several other non-PBDE halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). Spatial and temporal trends of total concentrations of HFRs were examined. BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-209 were the dominant PBDE congeners found at the three sites. For the non-PBDE HFRs, allyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-AE), hexabromobenzene (HBBz), pentabromotoluene (PBT), anti-dechlorane plus (anti-DDC-CO) and syn-dechlorane plus (syn-DDC-CO) were frequently detected. High atmospheric concentrations of PBDEs were found at the Egbert site with a larger population, while lower levels of PBDEs were detected at Point Petre, which is close to urban centers where control measures are in place. The strong temperature dependence of air concentrations indicates that volatilization from local sources influences atmospheric concentrations of BDE-28 and BDE-47 at Point Petre and Burnt Island, while long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) was important for BDE-99. However, a weaker correlation was observed between air concentrations and ambient temperature for non-PBDE HFRs such as TBP-AE and HBBz. Atmospheric PBDE concentrations are decreasing slowly, with half-lives in the range of 2-16 years. Faster declining trends of PBDEs were observed at Point Petre rather than at Burnt Island. As Point Petre is closer to urban centers, faster declining trends may reflect the phase out of technical BDE mixtures in urban centers while LRAT influences the air concentrations at Burnt Island. The levels of syn-DDC-CO and anti-DDC-CO are decreasing at Point Petre and the levels of other non-PBDE HFRs such as TBP-AE, PBT and HBBz are increasing.

The patient owned and operated an in-home rattery, or rat-breeding facility, with approximately 100 Norway rats, primarily bred as pets. A family member developed similar symptoms 4 weeks later, but was not hospitalized. Because both patients were known to have rodent contact, they were tested for hantavirus infections. In January 2017, CDC confirmed recent, acute Seoul virus infection in both patients. An investigation was conducted to identify additional human and rat infections and prevent further transmission. Ultimately, the investigation identified 31 facilities in 11 states with human and/or rat Seoul virus infections; six facilities also reported exchanging rats with Canadian ratteries. Testing of serum samples from 183 persons in the United States and Canada identified 24 (13.1%) with Seoul virus antibodies; three (12.5%) were hospitalized and no deaths occurred. This investigation, including cases described in a previously published report from Tennessee (1), identified the first known transmission of Seoul virus from pet rats to humans in the United States and Canada.

29351764,Quantification and kinetics of viral RNA transcripts produced in Orthohantavirus infected cells.,"BACKGROUND: Rodent borne viruses of the Orthohantavirus genus cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome among people in Eurasia, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. At present, there are no specific treatments or efficient vaccines against these diseases. Improved understanding of viral transcription and replication may instigate targeted treatment of Orthohantavirus infections. For this purpose, we investigated the kinetics and levels of viral RNA transcription during an ongoing infection in-vitro.
METHODS: Vero E6 cells were infected with Puumala Orthohantavirus (strain Kazan) before cells and supernatants were collected at different time points post infection for the detection of viral RNAs. A plasmid containing primer binding sites of the three Orthohantavirus segments small (S), medium (M) and large (L) was constructed and standard curves were generated to calculate the copy numbers of the individual transcripts in the collected samples.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a rapid increase in the copy number of viral RNAs after 9 h post infection. At peak days, 2-6 days after infection, the S- and M-segment transcripts became thousand and hundred-fold more abundant than the copy number of the L-segment RNA, respectively. The presence of viral RNA in the cell culture media was detected at later time-points.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method to follow RNA transcription in-vitro after synchronous infection of Vero cells. The obtained results may contribute to the understanding of the viral replication, and may have implications in the development of antiviral drugs targeting transcription or replication of negative stranded RNA viruses.","['Wigren Byström J', 'Näslund J', 'Trulsson F', 'Evander M', 'Wesula Lwande O', 'Ahlm C', 'Bucht G']",2018,15,1,Virol J,"Wigren Byström J, et al.

Defining SEOV genome sequences plays a critical role in development of preventive and therapeutic strategies against the unique worldwide hantavirus. We applied multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing to obtain SEOV genome sequences from clinical and reservoir host specimens. Epidemiologic surveillance of R. norvegicus rats in South Korea during 2000-2016 demonstrated that the serologic prevalence of enzootic SEOV infections was not significant on the basis of sex, weight (age), and season. Viral loads of SEOV in rats showed wide dissemination in tissues and dynamic circulation among populations. Phylogenetic analyses showed the global diversity of SEOV and possible genomic configuration of genetic exchanges.","['Kim WK', 'No JS', 'Lee SH', 'Song DH', 'Lee D', 'Kim JA', 'Gu SH', 'Park S', 'Jeong ST', 'Kim HC', 'Klein TA', 'Wiley MR', 'Palacios G', 'Song JW']",2018,24,2,Emerg Infect Dis,"Kim WK, et al.

Shaanxi Province in China has been among the most seriously affected areas since 1955. During 2009-2013, Shaanxi reported 11,400 human cases, the most of all provinces in China. Furthermore, the epidemiological features of HFRS have changed over time. Using long-term data of HFRS from 2005 to 2016, we carried out this retrospective epidemiological study combining ecological assessment models in Shaanxi. We found the majority of HFRS cases were male farmers who acquired infection in Guanzhong Plain, but the geographic extent of the epidemic has slowly spread northward. The highest age-specific attack rate since 2011 was among people aged 60-74 years, and the percentage of HFRS cases among the elderly increased from 12% in 2005 to 25% in 2016. We highly recommend expanding HFRS vaccination to people older than 60 years to better protect against the disease.

Landscape can influence the risk of hantavirus infection for humans, mainly through its effect on rodent community composition and distribution. It is important to understand how landscapes influence population dynamics for different rodent species and the subsequent effect on HFRS risk.
METHODS: To determine how rodent community composition influenced human hantavirus infection, we monitored rodent communities in the prefecture-level cities of Loudi and Shaoyang, China, from 2006 to 2013. Land use data were extracted from satellite images and rodent community diversity was analyzed in 45 trapping sites, in different environments. Potential contact matrices, determining how rodent community composition influence HFRS infection among different land use types, were estimated based on rodent community composition and environment type for geo-located HFRS cases.
RESULTS: Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus were the predominant species in Loudi and Shaoyang, respectively. The major risk of HFRS infection was concentrated in areas with cultivated land and was associated with A. agrarius, R. norvegicus, and Rattus flavipectus. In urban areas in Shaoyang, Mus musculus was related to risk of hantavirus infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Landscape features and rodent community dynamics may affect the risk of human hantavirus infection.

CASE: A 50-year-old male sushi chef who had never traveled outside Japan presented with a 2-day history of fever and muscle pain. On admission, the patient had thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, and jaundice. His condition continued to deteriorate, with decreasing platelet count, worsening renal function, hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. On day 5 after onset of symptoms, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse endobronchial bleeding. His respiratory status worsened rapidly with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 70, necessitating venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) and treatment with an inotrope, renal replacement therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including benzylpenicillin. Anticoagulation was maintained at the minimum level. His condition improved, and he was weaned off ECMO on day 15 and discharged on day 19 after onset of symptoms. The leptospirosis diagnosis was confirmed by leptospiral DNA detection in urine samples by polymerase chain reaction and the results of paired serum antibody titer testing.

The levels of PBDEs, HBCDs, and Dechloranes ranged from 3.2 to 71.5, 0.63-960, and 2.04-2400 pg/g dw (dry weight) in the mosses, and from 1.5 to 188, 0.1-21.1, and 1.0-83.8 pg/g dw in the lichens, respectively. HFRs were detected in all of the collected samples, even in those from the remote regions. The dominance of high brominated-BDE, anti-DP fraction, and HBCD diastereomeric ratio in the samples from remote regions suggested the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) of the HFRs. The relatively high HBCDs and Dechloranes contamination and their similar chemical profile with commercial products in the vicinity of Antarctic research stations indicated that human activities might act as local sources, while PBDEs appeared to be more influenced by LRAT and bioaccumulation rather than local emission. Lastly, the relatively high HFR levels and dominance of more brominated BDEs at the Narębski Point and in the wet lowlands suggested that penguin colonies and melting glacier water could be secondary HFR sources in Antarctica. The HFR levels differed by sample species, suggesting that further research on the factors associated with the HFR accumulation in the different species is necessary. This study firstly reports the alternative HFR levels in a wide area of the Antarctica, which could improve our understanding of the source, transport, and fate of the HFRs.","['Kim JT', 'Choi YJ', 'Barghi M', 'Yoon YJ', 'Kim JH', 'Kim JH', 'Chang YS']",2018,235,,Environ Pollut,"Kim JT, et al.

29273568,Hantavirus Gc induces long-term immune protection via LAMP-targeting DNA vaccine strategy.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) occurs widely throughout Eurasia. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment, and prophylaxis remains the best option against the major pathogenic agent, hantaan virus (HTNV), which is an Old World hantavirus. However, the absence of cellular immune responses and immunological memory hampers acceptance of the current inactivated HFRS vaccine. Previous studies revealed that a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-targeting strategy involving a DNA vaccine based on the HTNV glycoprotein Gn successfully conferred long-term immunity, and indicated that further research on Gc, another HTNV antigen, was warranted. Plasmids encoding Gc and lysosome-targeted Gc, designated pVAX-Gc and pVAX-LAMP/Gc, respectively, were constructed. Proteins of interest were identified by fluorescence microscopy following cell line transfection. Five groups of 20 female BALB/c mice were subjected to the following inoculations: inactivated HTNV vaccine, pVAX-LAMP/Gc, pVAX-Gc, and, as the negative controls, pVAX-LAMP or the blank vector pVAX1. Humoral and cellular immunity were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and 15-mer peptide enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) epitope mapping assays. Repeated immunization with pVAX-LAMP/Gc enhanced adaptive immune responses, as demonstrated by the specific and neutralizing antibody titers and increased IFN-γ production. The inactivated vaccine induced a comparable humoral reaction, but the negative controls only elicited insignificant responses. Using a mouse model of HTNV challenge, the in vivo protection conferred by the inactivated vaccine and Gc-based constructs (with/without LAMP recombination) was confirmed. Evidence of pan-epitope reactions highlighted the long-term cellular response to the LAMP-targeting strategy, and histological observations indicated the safety of the LAMP-targeting vaccines. The long-term protective immune responses induced by pVAX-LAMP/Gc may be due to the advantage afforded by lysosomal targeting after exogenous antigen processing initiation and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation trafficking. MHC II-restricted antigen recognition effectively primes HTNV-specific CD4","['Jiang DB', 'Zhang JP', 'Cheng LF', 'Zhang GW', 'Li Y', 'Li ZC', 'Lu ZH', 'Zhang ZX', 'Lu YC', 'Zheng LH', 'Zhang FL', 'Yang K']",2018,150,,Antiviral Res,"Jiang DB, et al.

31618190,Pancreatitis in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: A five-year experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatitis is a rare complication of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The causative agents of HFRS are hantaviruses, which belong to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients with HFRS at the Service of Infectious Diseases, Tirana, Albania.
METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective study, clinical and laboratory data was obtained from 36 patients with confirmed HFRS, between January 2011 and December 2016. The diagnosis had been confirmed by a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM or IgG antibodies to hantavirus.
RESULTS: The average patient age was 39.7 ± 14.1 years with a range of 15-59 years. From 36 HFRS patients, four (11.1%) were found to have AP, all were male. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom and an increase in amylase and lipase was observed in all four patients. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) indicated pancreatitis with surrounding edema, necrosis and hemorrhage. In this study, the total mortality was 11.1% (4/36), while mortality in patients with AP was 25% (1/4).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that AP is a serious complication of HFRS, with a poor prognosis.

29216545,Occurrence of selected halogenated flame retardants in Belgian foodstuff.,"This paper reports on the occurrence of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), namely PBDEs, HBCDs, TBBPA, brominated phenols (BrPhs), dechlorane plus (DP) and emerging FRs in a variety of Belgian foodstuffs. A total of 183 composite food samples were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques for the presence of HFRs. The analyses revealed that 72% of the samples was contaminated with HFRs to some extent. The highest number of contaminated samples was observed within the group 'Potatoes and derived products', 'Fish and fish products' and 'Meat and meat products', while the least contaminated group was 'Food for infants and small children'. The total HFR content ranged from <LOQ to 35.4 ng/g ww with an average content of 1.2 ng/g ww and median of 0.25 ng/g ww. The samples with the highest total HFR levels were canned king crab, fresh mackerel, Emmental cheese, fresh eel and plaice. The most frequently detected HFRs were PBDEs and BrPhs being present in almost all food groups, and among the individual HFRs, the most frequently found compounds were BDE-47 (53%), BDE-209 (46%) and 246-TBP (40%). TBBPA, DPs, TBPH and γ-HBCD occurred with a frequency of less than 5%. TBBPS, 26-DBP, HBB, TBB and BTBPE were not detected in any of the analyzed food samples.","['Poma G', 'Malysheva SV', 'Goscinny S', 'Malarvannan G', 'Voorspoels S', 'Covaci A', 'Van Loco J']",2018,194,,Chemosphere,"Poma G, et al.

29209143,Risk Factors and Preventions of Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. The development of breast cancer is a multi-step process involving multiple cell types, and its prevention remains challenging in the world. Early diagnosis of breast cancer is one of the best approaches to prevent this disease. In some developed countries, the 5-year relative survival rate of breast cancer patients is above 80% due to early prevention. In the recent decade, great progress has been made in the understanding of breast cancer as well as in the development of preventative methods. The pathogenesis and tumor drug-resistant mechanisms are revealed by discovering breast cancer stem cells, and many genes are found related to breast cancer. Currently, people have more drug options for the chemoprevention of breast cancer, while biological prevention has been recently developed to improve patients' quality of life. In this review, we will summarize key studies of pathogenesis, related genes, risk factors and preventative methods on breast cancer over the past years. These findings represent a small step in the long fight against breast cancer.","['Sun YS', 'Zhao Z', 'Yang ZN', 'Xu F', 'Lu HJ', 'Zhu ZY', 'Shi W', 'Jiang J', 'Yao PP', 'Zhu HP']",2017,13,11,Int J Biol Sci,"Sun YS, et al.

Most of the cases occurred in summer, in the North-east and Central Montenegro, a hilly/mountainous area, that provides suitable habitats for the main rodent carriers. Cases were mainly males (71) and exposures were often working outdoor or spending time visiting mountains and lakes. Incidence correlated with average annual temperature increase and average annual rainfalls decrease, but not with land cover.

29184158,Meteorological factors affect the epidemiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome via altering the breeding and hantavirus-carrying states of rodents and mites: a 9 years' longitudinal study.,"The incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Qingdao, China was three times higher than that of the average national level. Here we characterized the epidemiology, ecological determinants and pathogen evolution of HFRS in Qingdao during 2007-2015. In this longitudinal study, a total of 1846 HFRS patients and 41 HFRS-related deaths were reported. HFRS in Qingdao peaked once a year in the fourth quarter. We built a time series generalized additive model, and found that meteorological factors in the previous quarter could accurately predict HFRS occurrence. To explore how meteorological factors influenced the epidemic of HFRS, we analyzed the relationship between meteorological factors and hantavirus-carrying states of the hosts (including rodents and shrews). Comprehensive analysis showed humidity was correlated to high host densities in the third quarter and high hantavirus-carrying rates of animal hosts in the third to fourth quarters, which might contribute to HFRS peak in the fourth quarter. We further compared the L segments of hantaviruses from HFRS patients, animal hosts and ectoparasites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hantaviruses in gamasid and trombiculid mites were the same as those from the hosts. This indicated mites also contributed to the transmission of hantavirus. Furthermore, Hantaan virus from HFRS patients, hosts and mites in Qingdao formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. A new clade of Seoul virus was also identified in the hosts. Overall, meteorological factors increase HFRS incidence possibly via facilitating hosts' reproduction and consequent mite-mediated hantavirus transmission. New hantavirus subtypes evolved in Qingdao represent new challenges of fighting against HFRS.","['Jiang F', 'Wang L', 'Wang S', 'Zhu L', 'Dong L', 'Zhang Z', 'Hao B', 'Yang F', 'Liu W', 'Deng Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Pan B', 'Han Y', 'Ren H', 'Cao G']",2017,6,11,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Jiang F, et al.

29142540,Clinical Audit of Dengue Related Deaths in 2011-Mayo Hospital Lahore Pakistan.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dengue infection has evolved into an epidemic during last few years in Pakistan and has been associated with poor outcomes. Literature with respect to mortality risk factors in Dengue infection is not sufficient. This compelled us to conduct this study to find out major contributory factors to death in patients with dengue viral infection at one of Asia's ancient hospital setting with an aim to recognize complications at earliest and improve case management in future.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 95 adult dengue deaths was performed at Mayo Hospital Lahore from July 1st 2011 to 31st December 2011 during a major dengue epidemic. Patients who tested positive by dengue IgM in the presence of acute fever fulfilling the World Health Organization criteria for Dengue Fever, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever or Dengue Shock Syndrome and died within same setting, were included. Data regarding demographic profile, clinical and laboratory parameters along with treatment details were obtained and analysed. All records examined were anonymized.
RESULTS: Median age was 36 years (range13-80 years) among 95 deaths due to Dengue. Male gender comprised 60 (63.1%). Co-morbidities existed in 74 (77.9%) with hypertension in 21 (22.1%) diabetes in 11 (11.58%), liver disease in 9 (9.47%) and ischemic heart disease in 8(8.4%) cases. Patients presented at second day of fever for admission (range 1-8 days) and death occurred at a median of 4 days (range 30 minutes to 23 days). Hospital stay was for less than a week for seventy nine (83.2%) patients and 16 (16.8%) were admitted for more than 7 days. Critical care was required in 67(71%). Severe hepatitis occurred in 41 (43.1%), acute renal impairment occurred in 32 (33.7%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation in 16 (16.8%). Deaths were due to prolonged shock 49 (51.5%) fluid overload 46 (48.4%) and massive bleeding 18(19%) leading to organ failure.
CONCLUSION: Decompensated shock complicated by either massive plasma leakage, frank bleeding, multi organ failure or deranged clotting profile results in enhanced mortality in Dengue infection. Co-morbidities especially Diabetes are poor prognostic factors in predicting Dengue mortality.","['Iqtadar S', 'Akbar N', 'Mehmood M', 'Abaidullah S']",2017,33,5,Pak J Med Sci,"Iqtadar S, et al.

29107904,Environmental concentration and atmospheric deposition of halogenated flame retardants in soil from Nepal: Source apportionment and soil-air partitioning.,"While various investigations have been driven on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other flame retardants (FRs) in different framework around the world, information about contamination and fate of PBDEs and other FRs in developing countries especially in the Indian subcontinent is uncommon. Nepal being located in the Indian subcontinent, very little is known about contamination level of semi-volatile organic pollutants discharged into the environment. This motivated us to investigate the environmental fate of halogenated flame retardant (HFRs) in Nepalese condition. In this study, we investigated the concentration, fate, and sources of 9 PBDEs, 2 dechlorane plus isomers (DPs), and 6 novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs). Moreover, air-soil exchange and soil-air partitioning were also evaluated to characterize the pattern of air-soil exchange and environmental fate. In general, the concentrations of NBFRs in soil were more prevalent than PBDEs and DPs, and accounted 95% of ∑HFRs. By and large, the concentrations of NBFRs and DPs were measured high in Kathmandu, while PBDEs level exceeded in Pokhara. Principal component analysis (PCA) study suggested contributions from commercial penta-, octa-, and deca-BDEs products and de-bromination of highly brominated PBDEs as the significant source of PBDEs.

29054623,From headwaters to estuary: Distribution and fate of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in a river basin near the largest HFR manufacturing base in China.,"With the gradual phasing out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), market demands for alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) are increasing. The Laizhou Bay area is the biggest manufacturing base for brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in China, and the Xiaoqing River is the largest and most heavily contaminated river in this region. Water and sediment samples were collected from the headwaters to the estuary of the Xiaoqing River to investigate the distribution and fate of HFRs [i.e., PBDEs, alternative brominated flame retardants (aBFRs) and dechlorane plus (DPs). In the water samples, DPs was the most abundant flame retardant (median: 11.7ng/L), followed by decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) (5.92ng/L). In the sediment samples, DBDPE was the predominant flame retardant (39.5ng/g dw), followed by decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209) (2.81ng/g dw). The levels of DBDPE exceeded those of BDE 209 in most samples, indicating the overwhelming replacement of BDE 209 by DBDPE in this area. In the river section of this study, point source and atmospheric deposition followed by land runoff were the major factors influencing the distribution of HFRs, whereas in the estuary, riverine discharge, the estuarine maximum turbidity zone (MTZ), and hydrodynamic parameters played more important roles. Manufacturing is a significant source of contamination of the Xiaoqing River basin through atmospheric deposition and wastewater discharge.","['Zhen X', 'Tang J', 'Liu L', 'Wang X', 'Li Y', 'Xie Z']",2018,621,,Sci Total Environ,"Zhen X, et al.

29031969,Influence of natural organic matter on the extraction efficiency of flame retardants from surface waters.,"The influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the solid-phase extraction (SPE) efficiency was investigated for legacy and emerging flame retardants (FRs; n=26) in surface water. Three different groups of FRs were analyzed: polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), and organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs). In addition, five sorbents (Amberlite XAD-2, Amberlite IRA-743, Oasis HLB, Chromabond HR-P, and Chromabond HR-X) were evaluated for the extraction of FRs (n=33) in water, of which Oasis HLB eluted with dichloromethane and acetone:n-hexane (1:1, v/v) provided the highest overall recoveries. In subsequent NOM experiments, where FRs were extracted from water containing different NOM concentrations, both increased and decreased extraction efficiency with increasing NOM level were observed. Physicochemical and semi-empirical quantum chemistry properties were calculated for the FRs and used for analyzing relations between FRs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that the FRs separated into four different groups based on their properties. The FRs within each group responded similarly to increasing NOM, while differences in behavior were observed between the groups. This suggests that the structural properties of micropollutants highly influence NOM-FR interaction mechanisms. For instance, at high NOM levels, recoveries decreased substantially for FRs containing a moiety that can form strong hydrogen bonds (such as the double-bonded oxygen in e.g., OPFRs). Many of the compounds showed maximum extraction efficiency at higher levels of NOM. This suggests that binding of NOM to the sorbent and subsequent interaction between sorbent-bound NOM and FRs is an important mechanism for extraction of micropollutants from surface waters.","['Gustavsson J', 'Ahrens L', 'Nguyen MA', 'Josefsson S', 'Berggren Kleja D', 'Wiberg K']",2017,1524,,J Chromatogr A,"Gustavsson J, et al.

29020303,Risk of Venous Thromboembolism Following Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal Syndrome: A Self-controlled Case Series Study.,"BACKGROUND: Bleeding is associated with viral hemorrhagic fevers; however, thromboembolic complications have received less attention. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a mild viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Puumala hantavirus. We previously identified HFRS as a risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke, but the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is unknown.
METHODS: Personal identity numbers from the Swedish HFRS database were cross-linked with the National Patient register to obtain information on all causes for hospitalization during 1964 to 2013. The self-controlled case series method was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for first VTE, DVT, and PE during 1998 to 2013.
RESULTS: From 7244 HFRS patients, there were 146 with a first VTE of which 74 were DVT and 78 were PE, and 6 patients had both DVT and PE. The overall risk for a VTE was significantly higher during the first 2 weeks following HFRS onset, with an IRR of 64.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.3-114). The corresponding risk for a DVT was 45.9 (95% CI, 18-117.1) and for PE, 76.8 (95% CI, 37.1-159). Sex interacted significantly with the association between HFRS and VTE, with females having a higher risk compared with males.
CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased risk for VTE was found in the time period following HFRS onset. It is important to keep this in mind and monitor HFRS patients, and possibly other viral hemorrhagic fever patients, for early symptoms of VTE.","['Connolly-Andersen AM', 'Whitaker H', 'Klingström J', 'Ahlm C']",2018,66,2,Clin Infect Dis,"Connolly-Andersen AM, et al.

28986851,Protocols to Assess Coagulation Following In Vitro Infection with Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses.,"During the course of infection with a hemorrhagic fever virus (HFV), the checks and balances associated with normal coagulation are perturbed resulting in hemorrhage in severe cases and, in some patients, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). While many HFVs have animal models that permit the analyses of systemic coagulopathy, animal infection models do not exist for all HFVs and moreover do not always recapitulate the pathology observed in human tissues. Furthermore, molecular analyses of how coagulation is affected are not always straightforward or practical when using ex-vivo animal-derived samples, thus reinforcing the importance of cell culture studies. This chapter highlights procedures utilizing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model system to evaluate components of the intrinsic (prekallikrein (PK), factor XII (FXII), kininogen, and bradykinin (BK)) and extrinsic (Tissue Factor (TF)) systems. Specifically, protocols are included for the generation of a coculture blood vessel model, plating and infection of HUVEC monolayers and assays designed to measure activation of PK and FXII, cleavage of kininogen, and to measure the expression of TF mRNA and protein.","['Tursiella ML', 'Taylor SL', 'Schmaljohn CS']",2018,1604,,Methods Mol Biol,"Tursiella ML, et al.

28986848,Identifying Restriction Factors for Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses: Dengue and Junín.,"Host restriction factors are cellular components that interfere with viral multiplication. They are up-regulated and expressed upon viral infection and in consequence their activity is specific. So far several important restriction factors have been described against diverse viruses. The cellular antiviral mechanisms defined include proteins with the ability to interfere with early steps of viral replication and others that have been shown to block viral morphogenesis. However, other strategies by which the antiviral action is exerted still remain elusive. An additional interesting matter is how viruses also developed ways to by-pass these host-specific obstacles. Thus, unusual cell localization or re-localization represents a frequent virus choice to evade the cellular surveillance. In the present chapter, we summarize methods to identify cell restriction factors, their antiviral activity, and possible subcellular locations where their activity can take place.","['Giovannoni F', 'Cárcamo JRP', 'Morell ML', 'Cordo SM', 'García CC']",2018,1604,,Methods Mol Biol,"Giovannoni F, et al.

28986825,Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers With Emphasis on Clinical Virology.,"This article will outline surveillance approaches for viral hemorrhagic fevers. Specific methods for surveillance of clinical samples will be emphasized. Separate articles will describe methods for surveillance of rodent-borne viruses (roboviruses) and arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Since the appearance of hantaviruses and arenaviruses in the Americas, more than 30 different species in each group have been established, and therefore they have become the most frequently emerging viruses. Flaviviruses such as yellow fever and dengue viruses, although easier to recognize, are also more widely spread and therefore considered a very important public health issue, particularly for under-developed countries. On the other hand, marburgviruses and ebolaviruses, previously thought to be restricted to the African continent, have recently been shown to be more global. For many of these agents virus isolation has been a challenging task: trapping the specific vectors (mosquitoes and ticks), and reservoirs (rodents and bats), or obtaining the samples from suspected clinical human cases demands special protective gear, uncommon devices (respirators), special facilities (BSL-3 and 4), and particular skills to recognize the slow and inapparent cytopathic effects in cell culture. Alternatively, serological and molecular approaches have been very helpful in discovering and describing newly emerging viruses in many areas where the previous resources are unavailable. Unfortunately, in many cases, detailed studies have been performed only after outbreaks occur, and then active surveillance is needed to prevent viral dissemination in human populations.","['Montoya-Ruiz C', 'Rodas JD']",2018,1604,,Methods Mol Biol,Montoya-Ruiz C and Rodas JD.

Hantavirus RNA was detected in either the lungs and/or kidney of 17/21 (81%) of the Cherwell rats tested, higher than previously detected by blood testing alone (7/21, 33%), and in the kidneys of all three Cheltenham rats. The partial L gene sequences obtained from 10 of the Cherwell rats and the three Cheltenham rats were identical to each other and the previously reported UK Cherwell strain. Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) RNA was detected in the heart, kidney, lung, salivary gland and spleen (but not in the liver) of an individual rat from the Cherwell colony suspected of being the source of SEOV. Serum from 20/20 of the Cherwell rats and two associated HFRS cases had high levels of SEOV-specific antibodies (by virus neutralisation).

28943728,Short peptide epitope design from hantaviruses causing HFRS.,"Several genotypes of the hantavirus cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and is an important public health problem worldwide. There is now growing interest to develop subunit vaccines especially focused to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses which are important against viral infection. We identified candidate T-cell epitopes that bind to Class I HLA supertypes towards identifying potential subunit vaccine entity. These epitopes are conserved in all 5 hantavirus genotypes of HFRS (Hantaan, Dobrava- Belgrade, Seoul, Gou virus and Amur). The epitopes identified from S and M segment genomes were analyzed for human proteasome cleavage, transporter associated antigen processing (TAP) efficiency and antigenicity using bioinformatic approaches. The epitope MRNTIMASK which had the two characteristics of high proteasomal cleavage score and TAP score, also had high antigenicity score. Our results indicate that this epitope from the nucleocapsid protein may be considered the most favorable moiety for the development of subunit peptide vaccine.","['Sankar S', 'Ramamurthy M', 'Nandagopal B', 'Sridharan G']",2017,13,7,Bioinformation,"Sankar S, et al.

28931451,Bank vole immunoheterogeneity may limit Nephropatia Epidemica emergence in a French non-endemic region.,"Ecoevolutionary processes affecting hosts, vectors and pathogens are important drivers of zoonotic disease emergence. In this study, we focused on nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) whose natural reservoir is the bank vole, Myodes glareolus. We questioned the possibility of NE emergence in a French region that is considered to be NE-free but that is adjacent to a NE-endemic region. We first confirmed the epidemiology of these two regions and we demonstrated the absence of spatial barriers that could have limited dispersal, and consequently, the spread of PUUV into the NE-free region. We next tested whether regional immunoheterogeneity could impact PUUV chances to circulate and persist in the NE-free region. We showed that bank voles from the NE-free region were sensitive to experimental PUUV infection. We observed high levels of immunoheterogeneity between individuals and also between regions. Antiviral gene expression (Tnf and Mx2) reached higher levels in bank voles from the NE-free region. During experimental infections, anti-PUUV antibody production was higher in bank voles from the NE-endemic region. These results indicated a lower susceptibility to PUUV for bank voles from this NE-free region, which might limit PUUV persistence and therefore, the risk of NE.","['Dubois A', 'Castel G', 'Murri S', 'Pulido C', 'Pons JB', 'Benoit L', 'Loiseau A', 'Lakhdar L', 'Galan M', 'Marianneau P', 'Charbonnel N']",2018,145,3,Parasitology,"Dubois A, et al.

28843856,HTNV-induced upregulation of miR-146a in HUVECs promotes viral infection by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine release.,"Increasing research has shown a link between viruses and miRNAs, such as miRNA-146a, in regulating virus infection and replication. In the current study, the association between miR-146a and hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated, with a focus on examining the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results showed that HTNV infection promoted the production of miR-146a in HUVECs and activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, along with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5, also RANTES), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and interferon beta (IFN-β). Moreover, miR-146a exhibited a negative regulatory effect on the NF-κB pathway. Accordingly, a miR-146a inhibitor increased the expression of IL-8, CCL5, IP-10 and IFN-β, whereas a miR-146a mimic reduced the levels of these cytokines. Consequently, exogenous transduction of miR-146a significantly enhanced HTNV replication in HUVEC cells. We also discovered that viral proteins (NP/GP) contributed to miR-146a expression via enhancement the activity of miR-146a promoter. In conclusion, these results imply the negative regulation of miR-146a on the production of HTNV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to virus replication, which suggest that miR-146a may be regarded as a novel therapeutic target for HTNV infection.","['Chen QZ', 'Luo F', 'Lu MX', 'Li N', 'Teng Y', 'Huang QL', 'Zhu N', 'Wang GY', 'Yue M', 'Zhang Y', 'Feng Y', 'Xiong HR', 'Hou W']",2017,493,1,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Chen QZ, et al.

28814703,Becoming an International Scientist in South Korea: Ho Wang Lee's Research Activity about Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever.,"In the 1960-70s, South Korea was still in the position of a science latecomer. Although the scientific research environment in South Korea at that time was insufficient, there was a scientist who achieved outcomes that could be recognized internationally while acting in South Korea. He was Ho Wang Lee(1928~ ) who found Hantann Virus that causes epidemic hemorrhagic fever for the first time in the world. It became a clue to identify causative viruses of hemorrhagic diseases that were scattered here and there throughout the world. In addition, these outcomes put Ho Wang Lee on the global center of research into epidemic hemorrhagic fever. This paper examines how a Korean scientist who was in the periphery of virology could go into the central area of virology. Also this article shows the process through which the virus found by Ho Wang Lee was registered with the international academia and he proceeded with follow-up research based on this progress to reach the level at which he generalized epidemic hemorrhagic fever related studies throughout the world. While he was conducting the studies, experimental methods that he had never experienced encountered him as new difficulties. He tried to solve the new difficulties faced in his changed status through devices of cooperation and connection. Ho Wang Lee's growth as a researcher can be seen as well as a view of a researcher that grew from a regional level to an international level and could advance from the area of non-mainstream into the mainstream. This analytic tool is meaningful in that it can be another method of examining the growth process of scientists in South Korea or developing countries.",['Shin M'],2017,26,1,Uisahak,Shin M.

28806690,Occurrence and distribution of halogenated flame retardants in an urban watershed: Comparison to polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides.,"Due to restrictions on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), market demand for alternative flame retardants is projected to increase, worldwide. Information regarding the environmental behavior of these compounds is limited. The present study involved field measurements of several alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), along with PBDEs and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in surface water, bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) within a highly urbanized watershed in Singapore. Several alternative HFRs were detected in water and sediments. Dechlornane Plus stereoisomers (syn- and anti-DP) were detected in all samples, exhibiting relatively high concentrations in water, sediments and SPM. The maximum syn-DP concentrations in water, sediments and SPM were 24.30 ng/L, 2.48 ng/g dry wt. and 7774 ng/g dry wt., respectively. 1,2-Bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromotoluene (PBT), hexabromobenzene (HxBBz) and tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) were routinely detected. PBDE concentrations were relatively low and often non-detectable. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations ranged from 0.017 to 8.37 ng/L in water, 9.86-27.92 ng/g dry wt. in SPM, and 6.48-212.3 ng/g dry wt. in sediments. Congener and isomer patterns suggested no recent inputs of PBDEs or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Rainfall was found to be an important factor influencing temporal and spatial patterns of DPs, BTBPE, PBDEs and some organochlorines in surface water. Land use index was found to be important for several organochlorines, but not HFRs. The observed sediment-water partitioning behavior of the studied HFRs and legacy POPs was highly dependent on chemical hydrophobicity. The data demonstrate that the studied HFRs have a relatively high affinity for SPM and bottom sediments.

28804005,Performance assessment of the SAPS II and SOFA scoring systems in Hanta virus Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), caused by the hantavirus, is a natural infectious disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal damage. China is the most severely endemic area for HFRS in the world. In recent years, critical scoring systems based on quantitative classification have become an important clinical tool for predicting and evaluating the prognosis of critical illness, and provide guidelines for clinical practice.
METHODS: The sample comprised 384 patients with HFRS treated in the Taizhou Hospital from January 2006 to February 2017. The patients were divided into the severe group and the mild group according to their clinical characteristics. By comparing the differences in clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory data between the two groups, the clinically relevant indicators of severe HFRS were explored. According to the previous studies, we incorporated the positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) into the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) tool and formulated a new scoring system specifically for HFRS, named H-SOFA. By comparing the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), SOFA and H-SOFA scores of the two groups, their predictive values for the progression of HFRS were assessed.
RESULTS: Compared to the mild group, patients in the severe group had longer hospital stays; higher frequencies of nausea, vomiting, abdomen pain, signs of congestion and hemorrhage; and more pronounced impairment of liver and renal function. The levels of PLT, PCT, TB, and FOBT were positively correlated with the progression of HFRS (P<0.001). Patients with HFRS in the severe group got significantly higher scores on the SAPS II, SOFA, and H-SOFA scoring systems (P<0.001). The values of SAPS II, SOFA and H-SOFA, were significantly correlated with the severity of HFRS, and the AUC values were 0.90, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively.
CONCLUSION: PLT, PCT, TB, and FOBT were independent predictors of severe HFRS; SAPS II, SOFA, and H-SOFA had high predictive value for the progression of severe HFRS, with H-SOFA being the highest.","['Yu Z', 'Zhou N', 'Li A', 'Chen J', 'Chen H', 'He Z', 'Yan F', 'Zhao H', 'Zhu J']",2017,63,,Int J Infect Dis,"Yu Z, et al.

28762841,Haematuria is a marker for the severity of acute kidney injury but does not associate with thrombocytopenia in acute Puumala hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome characterized by thrombocytopenia, capillary leakage and acute kidney injury (AKI) with proteinuria and haematuria. Although the typical histologic lesion is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, the amount of glomerular proteinuria predicts the severity of upcoming AKI. Here, we studied the associations of haematuria and proteinuria with the severity of emerging AKI, thrombocytopenia and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis in PUUV infection.
METHODS: We examined 205 consecutive patients treated for serologically confirmed acute PUUV infection at Tampere University Hospital during 1997-2014. The patients were divided into three groups according to the combined positive result in urine haemoglobin and albumin dipstick tests: 0-2 + (n = 58), 3-4 + (n = 100) and 5-6 + (n = 47).
RESULTS: The medians of maximum creatinine concentrations in the three groups were: 0-2 + 100 μmol/L (range 52-1499), 3-4 + 204 μmol/L (range 65-1071) and 5-6 + 361 μmol/l (range 51-1285) (p < .001). The number of blood platelets (p = .069), and the levels of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments F1 + 2 and d-dimer (p = .602, p = .113, p = .289, respectively) were not significantly different between the groups. When the amount of haematuria in the dipstick test was examined separately, no association with thrombocytopenia was detected (p = .307 between groups 0, 1+ and 2-3+).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined positive result of haematuria and proteinuria in the dipstick test at hospital admission predicted the severity of upcoming AKI in acute PUUV infection. As haematuria was not associated with the severity of thrombocytopenia, it did not indicate increased bleeding tendency, but was rather a marker of acute kidney injury.","['Outinen TK', 'Mantula P', 'Laine OK', 'Pörsti I', 'Vaheri A', 'Mäkelä SM', 'Mustonen J']",2017,49,11-12,Infect Dis (Lond),"Outinen TK, et al.

28747170,Spatial prediction and validation of zoonotic hazard through micro-habitat properties: where does Puumala hantavirus hole - up?,"BACKGROUND: To predict the risk of infectious diseases originating in wildlife, it is important to identify habitats that allow the co-occurrence of pathogens and their hosts. Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is a directly-transmitted RNA virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans, and is carried and transmitted by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). In northern Sweden, bank voles undergo 3-4 year population cycles, during which their spatial distribution varies greatly.
METHODS: We used boosted regression trees; a technique inspired by machine learning, on a 10 - year time-series (fall 2003-2013) to develop a spatial predictive model assessing seasonal PUUV hazard using micro-habitat variables in a landscape heavily modified by forestry. We validated the models in an independent study area approx. 200 km away by predicting seasonal presence of infected bank voles in a five-year-period (2007-2010 and 2015).
RESULTS: The distribution of PUUV-infected voles varied seasonally and inter-annually. In spring, micro-habitat variables related to cover and food availability in forests predicted both bank vole and infected bank vole presence. In fall, the presence of PUUV-infected voles was generally restricted to spruce forests where cover was abundant, despite the broad landscape distribution of bank voles in general. We hypothesize that the discrepancy in distribution between infected and uninfected hosts in fall, was related to higher survival of PUUV and/or PUUV-infected voles in the environment, especially where cover is plentiful.
CONCLUSIONS: Moist and mesic old spruce forests, with abundant cover such as large holes and bilberry shrubs, also providing food, were most likely to harbor infected bank voles. The models developed using long-term and spatially extensive data can be extrapolated to other areas in northern Fennoscandia. To predict the hazard of directly transmitted zoonoses in areas with unknown risk status, models based on micro-habitat variables and developed through machine learning techniques in well-studied systems, could be used.","['Khalil H', 'Olsson G', 'Magnusson M', 'Evander M', 'Hörnfeldt B', 'Ecke F']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Khalil H, et al.

28745352,Airborne persistent toxic substances (PTSs) in China: occurrence and its implication associated with air pollution.,"In recent years, China suffered from extensive air pollution due to the rapidly expanding economic and industrial developments. Its severe impact on human health has raised great concern currently. Persistent toxic substances (PTSs), a large group of environmental pollutants, have also received much attention due to their adverse effects on both the ecosystem and public health. However, limited studies have been conducted to reveal the airborne PTSs associated with air pollution at the national scale in China. In this review, we summarized the occurrence and variation of airborne PTSs in China, especially in megacities. These PTSs included polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. The implication of their occurrence associated with air pollution was discussed, and the emission source of these chemicals was concluded. Most reviewed studies have been conducted in east and south China with more developed economy and industry. Severe contamination of airborne PTSs generally occurred in megacities with large populations, such as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. However, the summarized results suggested that industrial production and product consumption are the major sources of most PTSs in the urban environment, while unintentional emission during anthropogenic activities is an important contributor to airborne PTSs. It is important that fine particles serve as a major carrier of most airborne PTSs, which facilitates the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) of PTSs, and therefore, increases the exposure risk of the human body to these pollutants. This implied that not only the concentration and chemical composition of fine particles but also the absorbed PTSs are of particular concern when air pollution occurs.","['Wang P', 'Zhang Q', 'Li Y', 'Matsiko J', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang G']",2017,19,8,Environ Sci Process Impacts,"Wang P, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Diet-induced obese, C57BL/6J male mice were fed an HF diet without or with 20% (by weight) high-amylose maize resistant starch (HF-RS) for 6 weeks. Serum adiponectin levels were higher with RS consumption, but there were no differences in weight gain and adiposity. With HF-RS, the expression levels of ileal TLR2 and Reg3g and cecal occludin, TLR2, TLR4, NOD1 and NOD2 were induced; whereas colonic concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17A declined. The intestinal, serum, liver, and urinary metabolomes were also altered. HF-RS resulted in lower amino acid concentrations, including lower serum branched chain amino acids, and increased quantities of urinary di/trimethylamine, 3-indoxylsulfate, and phenylacetylglycine. Corresponding to these changes were enrichments in Bacteroidetes (S24-7 family) and certain Firmicutes taxa (Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichaceae) with the HF-RS diet. Parabacteroides and S24-7 positively associated with cecal maltose concentrations. These taxa and Erysipelotrichaceae, Allobaculum, and Bifidobacterium were directly correlated with uremic metabolites.
CONCLUSION: Consumption of RS modified the intestinal microbiota, stimulated intestinal immunity and endocrine-responses, and modified systemic metabolomes in obese mice consuming an otherwise obesogenic diet.","['Barouei J', 'Bendiks Z', 'Martinic A', 'Mishchuk D', 'Heeney D', 'Hsieh YH', 'Kieffer D', 'Zaragoza J', 'Martin R', 'Slupsky C', 'Marco ML']",2017,61,11,Mol Nutr Food Res,"Barouei J, et al.

However, there were limited studies focused on persistence of immune responses to HFRS vaccine in healthy adults. A phase 4, multicentre, open trial has been undertaken to assess antibody persistence after HFRS vaccination of healthy adolescents and adults aged 16-60 years.
METHODS: The vaccine was administered as a three-dose series at 0, 2 weeks and 6 months, including two primary doses and one booster dose. Anti-hantavirus IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) pre-vaccination and 1.5, 7 and 24 months after the initial vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 143 individuals aged 16-60 years were included. The median OD (range) values of IgG antibody were 0.005 (0.004-0.016), 0.116 (0.036-0.620), 0.320 (0.065-0.848) and 0.128 (0.011-0.649) pre-vaccination and at 1 month after the two primary doses, 1 month after the booster dose and 18 months after the booster dose. The positivity rate was 7.7%, 40.6%, 62.2% and 48.2%, respectively.

28685549,Analysis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and its pathogenic gene sequence based on geographic information system.,"This study analyzed the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics, epidemiological characteristics and gene sequences of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Guangxi, with the intention of providing a theoretical and technical support for the prevention of HFRS. A map of the incidence of HFRS of different cities in Guangxi was drawn up using the Geographic Information System (GIS) to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and infection source of HFRS between 2013 and 2016. Guangxi has a low incidence of HFRS, and autumn and winter are the main high-incidence seasons. Cases of HFRS were reported in all regions in Guangxi except Laibin city between 2013 and 2016. The distribution of cases in the four years suggested that Guilin, Nanning, Hechi and Wuzhou were the main infected regions, especially the local areas in the north of Guilin. The nucleotide and amino acid of S fragment and M fragment of Hantaviruses (HV) detected were highly homologous, and no obvious variation was found. Through analyzing the space-time characteristics, epidemiological characteristics and gene sequence of HFRS in Guangxi, it was found that areas rich in water, grass and moisture, such as paddy fields, are the main active areas for the host of HFRS.","['Tang Z', 'Xu XJ', 'He XJ', 'Liang ZS', 'Liang WB', 'Li Y', 'Gao K']",2017,31,2,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Tang Z, et al.

28676847,In-Cell Western Assays to Evaluate Hantaan Virus Replication as a Novel Approach to Screen Antiviral Molecules and Detect Neutralizing Antibody Titers.,"Hantaviruses encompass rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens that cause severe hemorrhagic fever disease with high mortality rates in humans. Detection of infectious virus titer lays a solid foundation for virology and immunology researches. Canonical methods to assess viral titers rely on visible cytopathic effects (CPE), but Hantaan virus (HTNV, the prototype hantavirus) maintains a relatively sluggish life cycle and does not produce CPE in cell culture. Here, an in-cell Western (ICW) assay was utilized to rapidly measure the expression of viral proteins in infected cells and to establish a novel approach to detect viral titers. Compared with classical approaches, the ICW assay is accurate and time- and cost-effective. Furthermore, the ICW assay provided a high-throughput platform to screen and identify antiviral molecules. Potential antiviral roles of several DExD/H box helicase family members were investigated using the ICW assay, and the results indicated that DDX21 and DDX60 reinforced IFN responses and exerted anti-hantaviral effects, whereas DDX50 probably promoted HTNV replication. Additionally, the ICW assay was also applied to assess NAb titers in patients and vaccine recipients. Patients with prompt production of NAbs tended to have favorable disease outcomes. Modest NAb titers were found in vaccinees, indicating that current vaccines still require improvements as they cannot prime host humoral immunity with high efficiency. Taken together, our results indicate that the use of the ICW assay to evaluate non-CPE Hantaan virus titer demonstrates a significant improvement over current infectivity approaches and a novel technique to screen antiviral molecules and detect NAb efficacies.","['Ma HW', 'Ye W', 'Chen HS', 'Nie TJ', 'Cheng LF', 'Zhang L', 'Han PJ', 'Wu XA', 'Xu ZK', 'Lei YF', 'Zhang FL']",2017,7,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Ma HW, et al.

Hubei province, located in the central south of China, has experienced some of the most severe epidemics of HFRS. To investigate the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-based phylogenetics of wild rats in Hubei, and the relationship with SEOV infection, 664 wild rats were captured from five trapping sites in Hubei from 2000-2009 and 2014-2015. Using reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR, 41 (6.17%) rats were found to be positive for SEOV infection. The SEOV-positive percentage in Yichang was significantly lower than that in other areas. The mtDNA D-loop and cytochrome b (cyt-b) genes of 103 rats were sequenced. Among these animals, 37 were SEOV-positive. The reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship (based on the complete D-loop and cyt-b sequences) allowed the rats to be categorized into two lineages, R. norvegicus and Rattus nitidus, with the former including the majority of the rats. For both the D-loop and cyt-b genes, 18 haplotypes were identified. The geographic distributions of the different haplotypes were significantly different. There were no significant differences in the SEOVpositive percentages between different haplotypes. There were three sub-lineages for the D-loop, and two for cyt-b. The SEOV-positive percentages for each of the sub-lineages did not significantly differ. This indicates that the SEOV-positive percentage is not related to the mtDNA D-loop or cyt-b haplotype or the sub-lineage of rats from Hubei.","['Liu DY', 'Liu J', 'Liu BY', 'Liu YY', 'Xiong HR', 'Hou W', 'Yang ZQ']",2017,32,3,Virol Sin,"Liu DY, et al.

28592316,The influence of climatic factors on the development of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and leptospirosis during the peak season in Korea: an ecologic study.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and leptospirosis are seasonal rodent-borne infections in the Republic of Korea (Korea). The occurrences of HFRS and leptospirosis are influenced by climatic variability. However, few studies have examined the effects of local climatic variables on the development of these infections. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of climatic factors on the occurrence of HFRS and leptospirosis in Korea.
METHODS: Daily records on human cases of HFRS and leptospirosis between January 2001 to December 2009 were analyzed. The associations of climatic factors with these cases in high incidence provinces were estimated using the time-series method and multivariate generalized linear Poisson models with a maximal lag of 12 weeks.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2009, a total of 2912 HFRS and 889 leptospirosis cases were reported, with overall incidences of 0.67 and 0.21 cases per 100,000, respectively, in the study areas. The increase in minimum temperature (1 °C) at a lag of 11 weeks was associated with 17.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.1, 20.6%] and 22.7% (95% CI: 16.5, 29.3%) increases in HFRS and leptospirosis cases, respectively. A 1-h increase in the daily sunshine was related to a 27.5% (95% CI: 18.2, 37.6%) increase in HFRS at a lag of 0 week. A 1% increase in daily minimum relative humidity and a 1 mm increase in daily rainfall were associated with 4.0% (95% CI:1.8, 6.1) and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.8%) increases in weekly leptospirosis cases at 11 and 6 weeks later, respectively.

28572804,Serum Cytokine Profiles Differentiating Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome.,"Hantavirus infection is an acute zoonosis that clinically manifests in two primary forms, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS is endemic in Europe and Russia, where the mild form of the disease is prevalent in the Tatarstan region. HPS is endemic in Argentina, as well as other countries of North and South American. HFRS and HPS are usually acquired via the upper respiratory tract by inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosol. Although the pathogenesis of HFRS and HPS remains largely unknown, postmortem tissue studies have identified endothelial cells as the primary target of infection. Importantly, cell damage due to virus replication, or subsequent tissue repair, has not been documented. Since no single factor has been identified that explains the complexity of HFRS or HPS pathogenesis, it has been suggested that a cytokine storm may play a crucial role in the manifestation of both diseases. In order to identify potential serological markers that distinguish HFRS and HPS, serum samples collected during early and late phases of the disease were analyzed for 48 analytes using multiplex magnetic bead-based assays. Overall, serum cytokine profiles associated with HPS revealed a more pro-inflammatory milieu as compared to HFRS. Furthermore, HPS was strictly characterized by the upregulation of cytokine levels, in contrast to HFRS where cases were distinguished by a dichotomy in serum cytokine levels. The severe form of hantavirus zoonosis, HPS, was characterized by the upregulation of a higher number of cytokines than HFRS (40 vs 21). In general, our analysis indicates that, although HPS and HFRS share many characteristic features, there are distinct cytokine profiles for these diseases. These profiles suggest a strong activation of an innate immune and inflammatory responses are associated with HPS, relative to HFRS, as well as a robust activation of Th1-type immune responses. Finally, the results of our analysis suggest that serum cytokines profiles of HPS and HFRS cases are consistent with the presence of extracellular matrix degradation, increased mononuclear leukocyte proliferation, and transendothelial migration.","['Khaiboullina SF', 'Levis S', 'Morzunov SP', 'Martynova EV', 'Anokhin VA', 'Gusev OA', 'St Jeor SC', 'Lombardi VC', 'Rizvanov AA']",2017,8,,Front Immunol,"Khaiboullina SF, et al.

To test actual circulation of CCHF virus (CCHFV) and hantaviruses in Bulgaria, we conducted country-wide seroepidemiological studies. Serum samples were collected prospectively from 1500 residents of all 28 districts in Bulgaria. CCHFV seroprevalence of 3.7% was revealed. Anamnesis for tick bites, contact with livestock, age over 40 years and residency in Haskovo district were found as risk factors. The highest CCHFV seroprevalence was observed in the known endemic districts in southeastern Bulgaria: Haskovo (28%) and Yambol (12%). Reactive samples were found in residents of 20 of the 28 districts in Bulgaria. In comparison with the previous studies, the data presented indicate that CCHFV increased substantially its circulation in the endemic regions and was introduced in many new areas. Hantavirus seroprevalence was based on results of the immunoblot and estimated as 3.1%. Surprisingly, contrary to all available data, Puumala virus seroprevalence rate was 2.3% versus 0.8% of Dobrava-Belgrade virus. Evidence for hantavirus IgG seropositivity was found in residents of 23 of the 28 districts in the country.

28537534,Elevated Plasma Growth Arrest-Specific 6 Protein Levels Are Associated with the Severity of Disease During Hantaan Virus Infection in Humans.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus infection in Asia. The clinical manifestation of HFRS is characterized by the rapid loss of renal function (acute kidney injury) and thrombocytopenia. The specific immune mechanisms that cause thrombocytopenia in HFRS are not well described. The growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) protein and TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) receptors have been recently shown to play prominent roles in immune regulation, and high plasma levels of Gas6 may predict the severity of diseases. The association of TAM receptors with several autoimmune diseases has been investigated, although the relationship between TAM receptors and these diseases remains unclear in HFRS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of Gas6 and TAM receptor expression in HFRS. The concentrations of Gas6 in the plasma from 144 patients and the expression of TAM receptors on monocytes from 117 patients were quantified. The relationship between Gas6 levels and disease course, severity, and clinical parameters was analyzed. We first found that the plasma Gas6 levels were significantly higher in HFRS patients, whereby they were positively correlated with white blood cell counts and negatively correlated with platelet counts. The expression of Tyro3 was increased on monocytes in HFRS patients compared with that in controls. Taken together, our data indicate that elevated plasma Gas6 levels is associated with the severity of disease during HTNV infection in humans, suggesting that Gas6 may play an important role by binding with Tyro3 on monocytes, which will be assessed in future studies.","['Zhang C', 'Tang K', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Zhuang R', 'Zheng X', 'Jin B', 'Zhang Y']",2017,30,5,Viral Immunol,"Zhang C, et al.

Small mammals were collected using Sherman live capture traps and transported to Korea University where they were euthanized, tissues removed, and assayed to determine hantavirus IgG antibody-positive and hantavirus-positive rates by RT-PCR. A total of 2,364 small mammals were captured over 11,300 trap nights (capture rate = 20.92%).

Adiponectin (APN) is an adipocytokine involved in prorevascularisation and immunomodulation. To investigate the possible effects of APN in the pathogenesis of HFRS, total and high molecular weight (HMW) APN levels in the plasma of patients with HFRS were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared with those in healthy controls, the plasma total and HMW APN levels in patients were elevated to different degrees from the fever onset and remained high at the convalescent phase. Consistent with these results, western blot analysis additionally showed that low molecular weight (LMW), middle molecular weight (MMW), and HMW APN levels were all elevated and contributed to the elevation of the total APN level. Importantly, sustained high levels of total and HMW APN at the convalescent phase were significantly higher in patients with critical disease than those in patients with mild or moderate disease. Moreover, total and HMW APN levels negatively correlated with white blood cell count and positively correlated with platelet count and serum albumin level. These results may provide insights into understanding the roles of total and HMW APN in the pathogenesis of HFRS.","['Tang K', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y']",2017,2017,,J Immunol Res,"Tang K, et al.

28419962,Temporal trends of PBDEs and emerging flame retardants in belugas from the St. Lawrence Estuary (Canada) and comparisons with minke whales and Canadian Arctic belugas.,"An exponential level increase of the ubiquitous halogenated flame retardant (HFR) class polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) has been documented during the 1990s in endangered belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) from the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE), Eastern Canada. The recent worldwide bans and regulations of PBDE mixtures led to their replacement by alternative HFRs (so-called emerging HFRs) that are increasingly being reported in various environmental compartments. There are, however, limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal trends of PBDEs and emerging HFRs in cetaceans, especially after restrictions on PBDE usage. The first objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of HFRs (35 PBDE congeners and 13 emerging compounds) in the blubber of belugas and minke whales (Balænoptera acutorostrata) found dead in the Estuary or Gulf of St. Lawrence as well as belugas from Nunavik (Canadian Arctic) collected as part of the Inuit subsistence hunt. A second objective was to investigate the trends of HFR concentrations in SLE beluga males between 1997 and 2013. PBDEs were the most abundant HFRs in all three whale populations, while hexabromobenzene (HBB), Chlordene Plus (CPlus), Dechlorane Plus (DP), and Dechlorane 604 Component B (Dec-604 CB) were quantified in the majority of blubber samples. Overall, concentrations of emerging HFRs were notably greater in SLE belugas compared to the two other whale populations, with the exception of DP and Dec-604 CB that were found in greater concentrations in Canadian Arctic belugas. No significant trend in blubber PBDE concentrations was found in SLE belugas during this 17-year period. This suggests that global PBDE regulations are too recent to observe changes in PBDE concentrations in belugas from this highly HFR-exposed environment. In contrast, concentrations of HBB and CPlus in SLE belugas decreased slightly from 1997 to 2013, while DP increased up until 2000 and decreased slightly thereafter. The occurrence and temporal variations of PBDEs and their replacement products in these cetaceans warrant continuous monitoring.","['Simond AE', 'Houde M', 'Lesage V', 'Verreault J']",2017,156,,Environ Res,"Simond AE, et al.

Focus on predictors of acute kidney injury in HFRS.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent borne zoonosis, caused by the members of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus. The main clinical features of the infection by this virus family are fever, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify, for the first time, characteristic features of HFRS in the Albanian population.
STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised 33 consecutive patients admitted with suspected HFRS from April 2011-April 2016 at one center. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by ELISA and real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to identify prognostic markers and indicators of disease severity.
RESULTS: The virus strain causing HFRS was Dobrava type in all 33 cases. The disease outbreaks occurred during the period June-July. Mean hospital stay was 15.7±6.9days. 29 (88%) of the patients were male. The mean age was 39.7±14.1. 16 (48.5%) patients were from Northeast Albania. 8 (24.2%) patients required dialysis. The strongest correlation was the inverse relationship of nadir platelet count with urea and creatinine, p<0.0001, p<0.0079 respectively. Creatinine and hyponatremia were inversely correlated p=0.0007, whereas hyponatremia and nadir platelet count had the highest sensitivity and specificity for development of severe AKI, 92.6%, 100%; 88.9%, 83.3% respectively. Mortality rate was 9.09%.
CONCLUSION: HFRS is a severe viral disease in Albania caused by Dobrava strain. It is associated with high mortality, 9.09% in our cohort. In our study, thrombocytopenia, urinary volume, hyponatremia were indicators of more severe disease.","['Rista E', 'Pilaca A', 'Akshija I', 'Rama A', 'Harja E', 'Puca E', 'Bino S', 'Cadri V', 'Kota M', 'Nestor T', 'Arjan H']",2017,91,,J Clin Virol,"Rista E, et al.

Here we analyzed dishcloths for the occurrence of polyhalogenated compounds after 14days of use in household kitchens. Analysis of 19 dishcloths revealed the presence of 29 polyhalogenated contaminants with total mean/median concentrations of 6,900/3,600ng/dishcloth, respectively. The spectrum featured classic and novel halogenated flame-retardants (HFRs) like polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), chlordene plus and dechlorane plus, as well as typical chloropesticides and background contaminants (e.g. hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lindane). The individual dishcloths showed highly variable fingerprints of polyhalogenated compounds. If present, medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) were by far the most prominent compound class with up to 55,400ng/dishcloth. Without consideration of chlorinated paraffins, the mean concentration of other polychlorinated compounds (270ng/dishcloth) was generally one order of magnitude lower than the mean concentration of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) (1,700ng/dishcloth). Our study verified that a wide range of polyhalogenated compounds is readily available in the kitchen environment. Furthermore, dishcloths are ordinarily handled without gloves or hand protection, given the observed concentrations of polyhalogenated compounds in dishcloths, such handling may serve as an additional exposure pathway for human users.

28319945,Glomerular Proteinuria Predicts the Severity of Acute Kidney Injury in Puumala Hantavirus-Induced Tubulointerstitial Nephritis.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala virus (PUUV)-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is common in many European countries. The typical renal histologic lesion is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. We examined the type and kinetics of urine protein excretion and prognostic significance of proteinuria for the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in acute PUUV infection.
METHODS: The amount of dipstick albuminuria at hospital admission was analyzed in 205 patients with acute PUUV infection. Dipstick albuminuria at admission was graded into 3 categories: 0-1+, 2+, and 3+. In 70 patients, 24-h urinary excretion of protein, overnight urinary excretion of albumin, immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and α1-microglobulin also were measured over 3 consecutive days during the hospital stay.
RESULTS: Maximum median daily proteinuria, overnight albuminuria, and IgG excretion were observed over 5 days, while that of creatinine values was observed 9 days after the onset of the disease. The medians of maximum plasma creatinine levels during hospital stay were different in the 3 categories of dipstick albuminuria: 0-1+: 98 µmol/L (58-1,499), 2+: 139 µmol/L (71-829), and 3+: 363 µmol/L (51-1,285; p < 0.001). Dipstick albuminuria ≥2+ at admission could be detected in 89% of the patients who subsequently developed severe AKI. Glomerular proteinuria, but not tubular proteinuria (α1-microglobulin), correlated with the severity of the emerging AKI.
CONCLUSION: In acute PUUV infection, maximum median proteinuria values preceded the most severe phase of AKI by a few days. A highly useful finding for clinical work was that a quick and simple albuminuria dipstick test at hospital admission predicted the severity of the upcoming AKI.","['Mantula PS', 'Outinen TK', 'Clement JPG', 'Huhtala HSA', 'Pörsti IH', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen JT', 'Mäkelä SM']",2017,136,3,Nephron,"Mantula PS, et al.

28276794,Insufficient efficacy and safety of intravenous ribavirin in treatment of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala virus.,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous ribavirin has been reported to be an effective treatment for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan virus in Asia. However, its therapeutic benefits for HFRS caused by Puumala virus (PUUV) in Europe are still unknown.
METHODS: A randomized, open-label study of efficacy and safety of intravenous ribavirin in the treatment of HFRS was conducted in the European part of Russia. Seventy-three patients with suspected HFRS within 4 d of the onset of the disease were randomized to receive either intravenous ribavirin (33 mg/kg, followed by 16 mg/kg given every 6 h for 4 d and by 8 mg/kg given every 8 h for 3 d) plus standard therapy (n = 37) or standard therapy alone (n = 36). The primary outcome was the average change from baseline in viral load over time estimated as area under the viral load curve minus baseline (AUCMB). Fifty-five patients with HFRS confirmed by nested reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were included in the assessment of the efficacy. All patients entered into the clinical trial were included in the assessment of the safety.
RESULTS: PUUV was detected in all cases of confirmed HFRS. Viral load kinetics were similar in both treatment groups. Significantly more patients receiving ribavirin than standard therapy experienced low haemoglobin level (95% vs 36%), hyperbilirubinemia (81% vs 3%), sinus bradycardia (43% vs 14%), and rash (19% vs 0%).

28249631,Expansion of spatial and host range of Puumala virus in Sweden: an increasing threat for humans?,"Hantaviruses are globally distributed and cause severe human disease. Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is the most common species in Northern Europe, and the only hantavirus confirmed to circulate in Sweden, restricted to the northern regions of the country. In this study, we aimed to further add to the natural ecology of PUUV in Sweden by investigating prevalence, and spatial and host species infection patterns. Specifically, we wanted to ascertain whether PUUV was present in the natural reservoir, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) further south than Dalälven river, in south-central Sweden, and whether PUUV can be detected in other rodent species in addition to the natural reservoir. In total, 559 animals were collected at Grimsö (59°43'N; 15°28'E), Sala (59°55'N; 16°36'E) and Bogesund (59°24'N; 18°14'E) in south-central Sweden between May 2013 and November 2014. PUUV ELISA-reactive antibodies were found both in 2013 (22/295) and in 2014 (18/264), and nine samples were confirmed as PUUV-specific by focus reduction neutralization test. Most of the PUUV-specific samples were from the natural host, the bank vole, but also from other rodent hosts, indicating viral spill-over. Finally, we showed that PUUV is present in more highly populated central Sweden.","['Borg O', 'Wille M', 'Kjellander P', 'Bergvall UA', 'Lindgren PE', 'Chirico J', 'Lundkvist Å']",2017,145,8,Epidemiol Infect,"Borg O, et al.

28245831,Puumala hantavirus infections in bank vole populations: host and virus dynamics in Central Europe.,"BACKGROUND: In Europe, bank voles (Myodes glareolus) are widely distributed and can transmit Puumala virus (PUUV) to humans, which causes a mild to moderate form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, called nephropathia epidemica. Uncovering the link between host and virus dynamics can help to prevent human PUUV infections in the future. Bank voles were live trapped three times a year in 2010-2013 in three woodland plots in each of four regions in Germany. Bank vole population density was estimated and blood samples collected to detect PUUV specific antibodies.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that fluctuation of PUUV seroprevalence is dependent not only on multi-annual but also on seasonal dynamics of rodent host abundance. Moreover, PUUV infection might affect host fitness, because seropositive individuals survived better from spring to summer than uninfected bank voles. Individual space use was independent of PUUV infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides robust estimations of relevant patterns and processes of the dynamics of PUUV and its rodent host in Central Europe, which are highly important for the future development of predictive models for human hantavirus infection risk.","['Reil D', 'Rosenfeld UM', 'Imholt C', 'Schmidt S', 'Ulrich RG', 'Eccard JA', 'Jacob J']",2017,17,1,BMC Ecol,"Reil D, et al.

28229289,Clinical aspects of hantavirus infections in Bulgaria.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses cause two distinct human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in America. In Europe, mainly Puumala, Dobrava and Seoul viruses cause HFRS. A total of 23 cases of HFRS were detected in Bulgaria over a 2‑year period 2013-2014. The aim of the study was to present epidemiology, clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of these patients.
METHODS: Patients with HFRS were diagnosed using PCR, ELISA and immunoblotting tests.
RESULTS: Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) was revealed as etiological agent in 16 (69.6%) patients and Puumala virus (PUUV) in 7 (30.4%) patients. All 23 patients were men aged 22-66 years of which 6 (26.1%) patients originated from regions in northern and western Bulgaria previously thought to be non-endemic. Patients with HFRS, despite the infecting hantavirus, manifested acute renal failure, asthenia and less pronounced hemorrhagic syndrome. Patients with DOBV infection were much more likely to present with arthromyalgia, severe headache, severe to moderately severe asthenoadynamia, abdominal pain, vomiting, hypotension, nervous system disorders as well as kidney enlargement, leucopenia and higher levels of blood creatinine, requiring hemodialysis procedures more often and for a longer period of time than patients with PUUV infection.

28215802,Occurrence of halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants in sediment and fish samples from three European river basins.,"Classic (polybromodiphenyl ethers, PBDEs) and emerging halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) such as decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and halogenated norbornenes, as well as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were analysed in 52 sediments and 27 fish samples from three European river basins, namely the Evrotas (Greece), the Adige (Italy) and the Sava (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia). This is the first time that FR levels have been reported in these three European river basins. The highest contamination was found in the Adige and Sava rivers, whereas lower values were obtained for the Evrotas. The levels in sediment samples ranged between 0.25 and 34.0ng/g dw, and between 0.31 and 549ng/g dw, for HFRs and OPFRs respectively. As regards levels in fish, concentrations ranged between 9.32 and 461ng/g lw and between 14.4 and 650ng/g lw, for HFRs and OPFRs, respectively. Thus, whereas OPFR values were higher in sediments, similar concentrations (in the Evrotas) and even lower concentrations than HFRs (Sava) were found for OPFRs in the fish samples, indicating the lower bioaccumulation potential of OPFRs. Biota to sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) were calculated and higher values were obtained for HFRs compared to those assessed for OPFRs.","['Giulivo M', 'Capri E', 'Kalogianni E', 'Milacic R', 'Majone B', 'Ferrari F', 'Eljarrat E', 'Barceló D']",2017,586,,Sci Total Environ,"Giulivo M, et al.

28161204,Chemical alternatives assessment of different flame retardants - A case study including multi-walled carbon nanotubes as synergist.,"Flame retardants (FRs) are a diverse group of chemicals used as additives in a wide range of products to inhibit, suppress, or delay ignition and to prevent the spread of fire. Halogenated FRs (HFRs) are widely used because of their low impact on other material properties and the low loading levels necessary to meet the required flame retardancy. Health and environmental hazards associated with some halogenated FRs have driven research for identifying safer alternatives. A variety of halogen-free FRs are available on the market, including organic (phosphorus and nitrogen based chemicals) and inorganic (metals) materials. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been demonstrated to act as an effective/synergistic co-additive in some FR applications and could thereby contribute to reducing the loading of FRs in products and improving their performance. As part of the FP7 project DEROCA we carried out a chemical alternatives assessment (CAA). This is a methodology for identifying, comparing and selecting safer alternatives to chemicals of concern based on criteria for categorising human and environmental toxicity as well as environmental fate. In the project we assessed the hazard data of different halogen-free FRs to be applied in 5 industrial and consumer products and here we present the results for MWCNT, aluminium diethylphosphinate, aluminium trihydroxide, N-alkoxy hindered amines and red phosphorus compared to the HFR decabromodiphenylether. We consulted the REACH guidance, the criteria of the U.S.-EPA Design for Environment (DfE) and the GreenScreen® Assessment to assess and compare intrinsic properties affecting the hazard potential. A comparison/ranking of exposure reference values such as Derived No Effect Levels (DNELs) showed that FRs of concern are not identified by a low DNEL. A comparison based on hazard designations according to the U.S.-EPA DfE and GreenScreen® for human health endpoints, aquatic toxicity and environmental fate showed that the major differences between FRs of concern and their proposed alternatives are the potential for bioaccumulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic) effects. As most alternatives are inorganic chemicals, persistence (alone) is not a suitable criterion. From our experiences in carrying out a CAA we conclude: i) REACH registration dossiers provide a comprehensive source of hazard information for an alternative assessment. It is important to consider that the presented data is subject to changes and its quality is variable. ii) Correct identification of the chemicals is crucial to retrieve the right data. This can be challenging for mixtures, reaction products or nanomaterials or when only trade names are available. iii) The quality of the data and the practice on how to fill data gaps can have a huge impact on the results and conclusions. iv) Current assessment criteria have mainly been developed for organic chemicals and create challenges when applied to inorganic solids, including nanomaterials. It is therefore crucial to analyse and report uncertainties for each decision making step.","['Aschberger K', 'Campia I', 'Pesudo LQ', 'Radovnikovic A', 'Reina V']",2017,101,,Environ Int,"Aschberger K, et al.

High-resolution, long-term field studies are critical for assessing both the baseline and future risk scenarios in a world of rapid changes. We have used a three-decade-long field study on hantavirus, a rodent-borne zoonotic pathogen distributed worldwide, coupled with epidemiological data from an endemic area of China, and show that the shift in the ecological dynamics of Hantaan virus was closely linked to environmental fluctuations at the human-wildlife interface. We reveal that environmental forcing, especially rainfall and resource availability, exert important cascading effects on intra-annual variability in the wildlife reservoir dynamics, leading to epidemics that shift between stable and chaotic regimes. Our models demonstrate that bimodal seasonal epidemics result from a powerful seasonality in transmission, generated from interlocking cycles of agricultural phenology and rodent behavior driven by the rainy seasons.","['Tian H', 'Yu P', 'Bjørnstad ON', 'Cazelles B', 'Yang J', 'Tan H', 'Huang S', 'Cui Y', 'Dong L', 'Ma C', 'Ma C', 'Zhou S', 'Laine M', 'Wu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J', 'Yang R', 'Stenseth NC', 'Xu B']",2017,13,1,PLoS Pathog,"Tian H, et al.

28141593,Clinical and virological characteristics of hantavirus infections in a 2014 Croatian outbreak.,"INTRODUCTION: Croatia is endemic for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), with both Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava virus (DOBV) documented. Several large outbreaks were recorded in 1995, 2002, and 2012. We analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and virological characteristics of HFRS cases detected in three geographically close natural foci (Ogulin, Slunj, and the Plitvice Lakes surroundings) during the 2014 outbreak.
METHODOLOGY: From January to December 2014, 122 patients with suspected HFRS were tested for hantavirus IgM/IgG antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Cross-reactive samples were further tested using a western blot (WB). For hospitalized patients from Ogulin area, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Acute infection was documented in 57 (46.7%) patients, of whom 75.4% were hospitalized. Ten (8.2%) patients were found to be IgG seropositive. Patients were 15-69 years of age and predominantly male (74.5%). The outbreak started in winter months, with most cases recorded from May to July (80.7%). The most frequently reported symptoms were fever (96.3%), chills/shivering (62.9%), and lumbar pain (48.1%). Mild clinical form was found in 66.7% patients, moderate in 18.5%, and severe in 14.8% patients (all but one infected with PUUV). One patient died. Using IFA, 48.8% patients showed monotypic antibody response, while in 51.2%, cross-reactive antibodies were found. PUUV was confirmed in 94.7% and DOBV in 5.3% HFRS cases by WB.
CONCLUSIONS: Central mountainous Croatian regions are still highly endemic areas for HFRS. A higher percentage of severe PUUV infections could be at least partly associated with a patient's immune status.","['Vilibic-Cavlek T', 'Furic A', 'Barbic L', 'Tabain I', 'Stevanovic V', 'Mlinaric-Galinovic G']",2017,11,1,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Vilibic-Cavlek T, et al.

28122569,Appearance of renal hemorrhage in adult mice after inoculation of patient-derived hantavirus.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantavirus infection is characterized by fever, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage. An animal model mimicking symptoms of HFRS remains to be established. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity of an HFRS patient-derived Hantaan virus (HTNV) in adult mice.
METHODS: Five clones of HTNV strain KHF 83-61 BL (KHFV) that was derived from blood of an HFRS patient were obtained by plaque cloning. The pathogenicity of the virus clones was evaluated by using 6-week-old female BALB/c mice. Sequence analysis of the viral genome was performed by conventional methods.
RESULTS: All of the mice intravenously inoculated with KHFV clone (cl)-1, -2, -3 and -5 showed signs of disease such as transient body weight loss, ruffled fur, reduced activity and remarkably prominent hemorrhage in the renal medulla at 6 to 9 days post-inoculation (dpi) and then recovered. In contrast, mice intravenously inoculated with KHFV cl-4 did not show any signs of disease. We selected KHFV cl-5 and cl-4 as representative of high-pathogenic and low-pathogenic clones, respectively. Quantities of viral RNA in kidneys of KHFV cl-5-infected mice were larger than those in KHFV cl-4-infected mice at any time point examined (3, 6, 9 and 12 dpi). The quantities of viral RNA of KHFV cl-5 and cl-4 peaked at 3 dpi, which was before the onset of disease. Sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid at position 417 in the glycoprotein Gn was the sole difference in viral proteins between KHFV cl-5 and cl-4. The result suggests that amino acid at position 417 in Gn is related to the difference in pathogenicity between KHFV cl-5 and cl-4. When the inoculum of KHFV cl-5 was pretreated with a neutralizing antibody against HTNV strain 76-118, which belongs to the same serotype as KHFV clones, mice did not show any signs of disease, confirming that the disease was caused by KHFV infection.
CONCLUSION: We found that an HFRS patient-derived HTNV caused renal hemorrhage in adult mice. We anticipate that this infection model will be a valuable tool for understanding the pathogenesis of HFRS.","['Shimizu K', 'Koma T', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Tsuda Y', 'Isegawa Y', 'Arikawa J']",2017,14,1,Virol J,"Shimizu K, et al.

Since the immunity of the inactivated vaccine is weak and the safety is poor, HTNV virus-like particles (VLPs) offer an attractive and safe alternative. These particles lack the viral genome but are perceived by the immune system as virus particles. We hypothesized that adding immunostimulatory signals to VLPs would enhance their efficacy.

When compared to tubulointerstitial nephritis of a wide variety of other aetiologies, a high degree of proteinuria is a distinguished trait of NE, a finding that is also helpful in the clinical suspicion of the disease. Recently, novel biomarkers for the prediction of severe AKI, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), have been identified and ultrastructural tissue changes have been more accurately described. A role for soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) in the pathogenesis of NE has been suggested, and data on gene polymorphisms, in relation to the severity of AKI have been presented. Smoking is a risk factor for NE and smoking is also associated with aggravated AKI in NE. Although no specific treatment is in sight, recent case reports concerning therapy directed against vascular permeability and vasodilation are of interest. In fact, future work trying to explain the pathophysiology of AKI might need concentrated efforts towards the mechanisms of increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation, which irrespective of organ manifestation, are two major determinants of NE.","['Mustonen J', 'Outinen T', 'Laine O', 'Pörsti I', 'Vaheri A', 'Mäkelä S']",2017,49,5,Infect Dis (Lond),"Mustonen J, et al.

28034506,Development and comparison of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques for analysis of flame retardants.,"The restrictions on the use of legacy flame retardants (FRs) have increased the need of alternative FRs to comply with fire safety legislations. In this study, the feasibility of three different gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques were investigated for the analysis of 102 legacy and alternative FRs including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, n=27), halogenated FRs (HFRs, containing bromine and/or chlorine, n=46), and organophosphorous FRs (OPFRs, n=29). The tested techniques included GC-single MS with (i) electon impact (EI) ionization and (ii) negative chemical ionization (NCI), and (iii) GC-tandem MS (MS/MS) with EI ionization. Out of the tested FRs, 90 could be detected under the used conditions on at least one of the three instrument setups. Later experiments included a selection of these FRs. For the majority of tested PBDEs (5 out of 6) and HFRs (24 out of 26), EI-MS/MS provided the highest detectability (i.e. the lowest detection limits), while for most tested OPFRs (8 out of 13), EI-MS performed better. The influence of matrix components on the analysis of FRs (n=45) was investigated by analyzing a fortified surface water sample with the technique with the lowest selectivity, EI-MS. Both peak enhancement and suppression were observed, and significant correlations between matrix effects and several physico-chemical properties (e.g., retention time and boiling point) were found for PBDEs. In a separate clean-up experiment using natural water spiked with legacy and alternative FRs (n=30), alumina provided the highest mean recovery (90%) in comparison to acidified silica (67%) and Florisil (78%).

28030550,Spatio-Temporal Pattern and Influencing Factors of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Hubei Province (China) between 2005 and 2014.,"Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is considered as a globally distributed infectious disease, which results in many deaths annually in Hubei Province, China. The outbreak of HFRS is usually characterized with spatio-temporal heterogeneity and is seasonally distributed. Further, it might also be impacted by the influencing factors such as socio-economic and geographical environment. To better understand and predict the outbreak of HFRS in the Hubei Province, the spatio-temporal pattern and influencing factors were investigated in this study. Moran's I Index value was adopted in spatial global autocorrelation analysis to identify the overall spatio-temporal pattern of HFRS outbreak. Kulldorff scan statistical analysis was performed to further identify the changing trends of the clustering patterns of HFRS outbreak. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to explore the possible influencing factors on HFRS epidemics such as climate and geographic. The results demonstrated that HFRS outbreak in Hubei Province decreased from 2005 to 2012 in general while increasing slightly from 2012 to 2014. The spatial and temporal scan statistical analysis indicated that HFRS epidemic was temporally clustered in summer and autumn from 2005 to 2014 except 2008 and 2011. The seasonal epidemic pattern of HFRS in Hubei Province was characterized by a bimodal pattern (March to May and September to November) while peaks often occurring in the spring time. SEOV-type HFRS was presumed to influence more on the total number of HFRS incidence than HTNV-type HFRS do. The average humidity and human population density were the main influencing factors during these years. HFRS outbreaks were more in plains than in other areas of Hubei Province. We did not find that whether the terrain of the wetland (water system) plays a significant role in the outbreak of HFRS incidence. With a better understanding of rodent infection rate, socio-economic status and ecological environment characteristics, this study may help to reduce the outbreak of HFRS disease.","['Ge L', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou K', 'Mu X', 'Yu H', 'Wang Y', 'Wang N', 'Fan H', 'Guo L', 'Huo X']",2016,11,12,PLoS One,"Ge L, et al.

This paper utilized the seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) method to analyze the periodicity and seasonality of the HFRS data, and used the exponential smoothing model (ETS) model to predict incidence cases from July to December 2016 by using the data from January 2006 to June 2016. Analytic results demonstrated a favorable trend of HFRS in China, and with obvious periodicity and seasonality, the peak of the annual reported cases in winter concentrated on November to January of the following year, and reported in May and June also constituted another peak in summer. Eventually, the ETS (M, N and A) model was adopted for fitting and forecasting, and the fitting results indicated high accuracy (Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 13.12%). The forecasting results also demonstrated a gradual decreasing trend from July to December 2016, suggesting that control measures for hemorrhagic fever were effective in China. The STL model could be well performed in the seasonal analysis of HFRS in China, and ETS could be effectively used in the time series analysis of HFRS in China.","['Ke G', 'Hu Y', 'Huang X', 'Peng X', 'Lei M', 'Huang C', 'Gu L', 'Xian P', 'Yang D']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Ke G, et al.

27956196,Microevolution of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) at neutral and immune-related genes during multiannual dynamic cycles: Consequences for Puumala hantavirus epidemiology.,"Understanding how host dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. Here we focus on a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in Finland between 2005 and 2009. Bank vole is the reservoir of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. M. glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, PUUV prevalence and NE occurrence. We examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immune-related genes involved in susceptibility to PUUV (Tnf-promoter, Tlr4, Tlr7 and Mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and PUUV epidemiology. We show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. Gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. The low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. Environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in PUUV in this area. Besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on PUUV circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. We find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. Footprint of positive selection is detected at Tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. We observe marginally significant associations between Mx2 genotype and PUUV genogroups. These results show that neutral processes seem to be the main factors affecting the evolution of these immune-related genes at a contemporary scale, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations. Immune related gene polymorphism may in turn partly influence PUUV epidemiology in this metapopulation.","['Dubois A', 'Galan M', 'Cosson JF', 'Gauffre B', 'Henttonen H', 'Niemimaa J', 'Razzauti M', 'Voutilainen L', 'Vitalis R', 'Guivier E', 'Charbonnel N']",2017,49,,Infect Genet Evol,"Dubois A, et al.

27918151,Reservoir-Driven Heterogeneous Distribution of Recorded Human Puumala virus Cases in South-West Germany.,"Endemic regions for Puumala virus (PUUV) are located in the most affected federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg, South-West Germany, where high numbers of notified human hantavirus disease cases have been occurring for a long time. The distribution of human cases in Baden-Wuerttemberg is, however, heterogeneous, with a high number of cases recorded during 2012 in four districts (H districts) but a low number or even no cases recorded in four other districts (L districts). Bank vole monitoring during 2012, following a beech (Fagus sylvatica) mast year, resulted in the trapping of 499 bank voles, the host of PUUV. Analyses indicated PUUV prevalences of 7-50% (serological) and 1.8-27.5% (molecular) in seven of eight districts, but an absence of PUUV in one L district. The PUUV prevalence differed significantly between bank voles in H and L districts. In the following year 2013, 161 bank voles were trapped, with reduced bank vole abundance in almost all investigated districts except one. In 2013, no PUUV infections were detected in voles from seven of eight districts. In conclusion, the linear modelling approach indicated that the heterogeneous distribution of human PUUV cases in South-West Germany was caused by different factors including the abundance of PUUV RNA-positive bank voles, as well as by the interaction of beech mast and the proportional coverage of beech and oak (Quercus spec.) forest per district. These results can aid developing local public health risk management measures and early warning models.","['Drewes S', 'Turni H', 'Rosenfeld UM', 'Obiegala A', 'Straková P', 'Imholt C', 'Glatthaar E', 'Dressel K', 'Pfeffer M', 'Jacob J', 'Wagner-Wiening C', 'Ulrich RG']",2017,64,5,Zoonoses Public Health,"Drewes S, et al.

27857837,Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and hypophysitis after Puumala hantavirus infection.,"UNLABELLED: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection causes nephropathia epidemica (NE), a relatively mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Hypophyseal haemorrhage and hypopituitarism have been described in case reports on patients with acute NE. Chronic hypopituitarism diagnosed months or years after the acute illness has also been reported, without any signs of a haemorrhagic aetiology. The mechanisms leading to the late-onset hormonal defects remain unknown. Here, we present a case of NE-associated autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and hypopituitarism presumably due to autoimmune hypophysitis. Thyroid peroxidase antibody seroconversion occurred between 6 and 12 months, and ovarian as well as glutamate decarboxylase antibodies were found 18 months after acute NE. Brain MRI revealed an atrophic adenohypophysis with a heterogeneous, low signal intensity compatible with a sequela of hypophysitis. The patient developed central (or mixed central and peripheral) hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and diabetes insipidus, all requiring hormonal replacement therapy. This case report suggests that late-onset hormonal defects after PUUV infection may develop by an autoimmune mechanism. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by prospective studies with sufficient numbers of patients.
LEARNING POINTS: Pituitary haemorrhage resulting in hypopituitarism has been reported during acute HFRS caused by PUUV and other hantaviruses.Central and peripheral hormone deficiencies developing months or years after HFRS have also been found, with an incidence higher than that in the general population. The pathogenesis of these late-onset hormonal defects remains unknown.This case report suggests that the late-onset hypopituitarism and peripheral endocrine defects after HFRS could evolve via autoimmune mechanisms.The sensitivity of current anti-pituitary antibody (APA) tests is low. A characteristic clinical course, together with typical brain MRI and endocrine findings may be sufficient for a non-invasive diagnosis of autoimmune hypophysitis, despite negative APAs.","['Tarvainen M', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Jaatinen P']",2016,2016,,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,"Tarvainen M, et al.

27824286,The assessment of Hantaan virus-specific antibody responses after the immunization program for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in northwest China.,"Xianyang city is one of the main hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) epidemic areas in northwest China. Although the HFRS immunity program has been provided in this city, HFRS is still occurred every year. In order to implement the vaccination program effectively and to control HFRS, the analysis of antibody responses specific to Hantaan virus (HTNV) in individuals after vaccination is essential. In this study, a total of 100 subjects were divided into 5 groups: unvaccinated, 1, 3, 29 and 33 months after boost vaccination. The levels and the positive rates of HTNV-NP-specific IgM and IgG antibodies as well as HTNV neutralizing antibodies were significantly increased in the serum of the vaccinated individuals. The positive rates and levels of HTNV-NP-specific IgG and HTNV neutralizing antibody reached their highest values at 3 months respectively and could be sustained up to 33 months after vaccination. Moreover, the titres of HTNV-NP-specific IgM or IgG antibody and the titres of HTNV neutralizing antibody at 1 month after vaccination have a positive correlation. The level of HTNV-NP-specific IgG antibody was much higher than that of HTNV-NP-specific IgM antibody or HTNV neutralizing antibody. In addition, the strongest responses of antibody-secreting cells were observed at 3 months after vaccination, which was consistent with the serum results. Therefore, the HFRS immunization program is effective to induce humoral immunity in the population of northwest China.","['Li Z', 'Zeng H', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng L', 'Zhang F', 'Lei Y', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y', 'Chen L']",2017,13,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Li Z, et al.

Despite the known nutritional regulation of ruminant milk composition, the overall mammary mechanisms underlying this regulation are far from being understood. The aim of our study was to determine nutritional regulation of mammary transcriptomes in relation to the cow milk composition.
METHODS: Twelve cows received diets differing in the forage-to-concentrate ratio [high forage (HF) and low forage (LF)] supplemented or not with lipids [HF with whole intact rapeseeds (RS) and LF sunflower oil (SO)] in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Milk production and FA composition were determined. The gene expression profile was studied using RT-qPCR and a bovine microarray.
RESULTS: Our results showed a higher amplitude of milk composition and mammary transcriptome responses to lipid supplementation with the LF-SO compared with the LF diet than with the HF-RS compared with the HF diet. Forty-nine differentially expressed genes, including genes involved in lipid metabolism, were identified with LF-SO versus LF, whereas RS supplementation to the HF diet did not affect the mammary transcriptome.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights different responses to lipid supplementation of milk production and composition and mammary transcriptomes depending on the nature of lipid supplementation and the percentage of dietary concentrate.","['Leroux C', 'Bernard L', 'Faulconnier Y', 'Rouel J', 'de la Foye A', 'Domagalski J', 'Chilliard Y']",2016,9,2-4,J Nutrigenet Nutrigenomics,"Leroux C, et al.

The bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the only reservoir of PUUV in Central Europe. A commercial PUUV rapid field test for rodents was validated for bank-vole blood samples collected in two PUUV-endemic regions in Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg). A comparison of the results of the rapid field test and standard ELISAs indicated a test efficacy of 93-95%, largely independent of the origin of the antigens used in the ELISA. In ELISAs, reactivity for the German PUUV strain was higher compared to the Swedish strain but not compared to the Finnish strain, which was used for the rapid field test. In conclusion, the use of the rapid field test can facilitate short-term estimation of PUUV seroprevalence in bank-vole populations in Germany and can aid in assessing human PUUV infection risk.","['Reil D', 'Imholt C', 'Rosenfeld UM', 'Drewes S', 'Fischer S', 'Heuser E', 'Petraityte-Burneikiene R', 'Ulrich RG', 'Jacob J']",2017,145,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Reil D, et al.

27783711,Mechanistic Insight into Bunyavirus-Induced Membrane Fusion from Structure-Function Analyses of the Hantavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Gc.,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic viruses transmitted to humans by persistently infected rodents, giving rise to serious outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), depending on the virus, which are associated with high case fatality rates. There is only limited knowledge about the organization of the viral particles and in particular, about the hantavirus membrane fusion glycoprotein Gc, the function of which is essential for virus entry. We describe here the X-ray structures of Gc from Hantaan virus, the type species hantavirus and responsible for HFRS, both in its neutral pH, monomeric pre-fusion conformation, and in its acidic pH, trimeric post-fusion form. The structures confirm the prediction that Gc is a class II fusion protein, containing the characteristic β-sheet rich domains termed I, II and III as initially identified in the fusion proteins of arboviruses such as alpha- and flaviviruses. The structures also show a number of features of Gc that are distinct from arbovirus class II proteins. In particular, hantavirus Gc inserts residues from three different loops into the target membrane to drive fusion, as confirmed functionally by structure-guided mutagenesis on the HPS-inducing Andes virus, instead of having a single ""fusion loop"". We further show that the membrane interacting region of Gc becomes structured only at acidic pH via a set of polar and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the structure reveals that hantavirus Gc has an additional N-terminal ""tail"" that is crucial in stabilizing the post-fusion trimer, accompanying the swapping of domain III in the quaternary arrangement of the trimer as compared to the standard class II fusion proteins. The mechanistic understandings derived from these data are likely to provide a unique handle for devising treatments against these human pathogens.","['Guardado-Calvo P', 'Bignon EA', 'Stettner E', 'Jeffers SA', 'Pérez-Vargas J', 'Pehau-Arnaudet G', 'Tortorici MA', 'Jestin JL', 'England P', 'Tischler ND', 'Rey FA']",2016,12,10,PLoS Pathog,"Guardado-Calvo P, et al.

27748540,Prediction of B Cell Epitopes Among Hantavirus Strains Causing Hemorragic Fever With Renal Syndrome.,"Hantavirus infections are now recognized to be a global problem. The hantaviruses include several genotypic variants of the virus with different distributions in varying geographical regions. The virus genotypes seem to segregate in association with certain manifestations specific for each syndrome. They primarily include HFRS, HCPS, febrile illness with or without mild involvement of renal diseases. In the course of our study on hantavirus etiology of febrile illnesses, we recovered a hantavirus strain identified by nPCR. This has been sequenced to be Hantaan-like virus (partial S segment). The current manuscript is focused on understanding the N protein coded by S segment in terms of variation of amino acid sequences of the virus genotypes associated with HFRS. The diagnosis of this infection is achieved by PCR testing of serum/plasma or demonstration of IgM/IgG in serum. The limitations of PCR are temporal often not positive after 7 days of onset of infection. IgM detection is possible around this period and up to 21 days. IgG detection is less definitive in acute infections. Here, we report characterization of the sequence diversity of HFRS strains, 3D structure of Hantaan N protein, and B-cell epitopes on this molecule. We predicted a 20 amino acid sequence length peptide by using BepiPred online server in IEDB analysis resource program. We suggest this peptide may be used for development of geographic region-specific immunoassays like EIAs for antibody detection, monoclonal antibody development, and immunoblots (line immunoassay).

27737653,Human Puumala hantavirus infection in northern Sweden; increased seroprevalence and association to risk and health factors.,"BACKGROUND: The rodent borne Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in central and northern Europe. The number of cases has increased and northern Sweden has experienced large outbreaks in 1998 and 2006-2007 which raised questions regarding the level of immunity in the human population.
METHODS: A randomly selected population aged between 25 and 74 years from northern Sweden were invited during 2009 to participate in a WHO project for monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease. Health and risk factors were evaluated and sera from 1,600 participants were available for analysis for specific PUUV IgG antibodies using a recombinant PUUV nucleocapsid protein ELISA.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence in the investigated population was 13.4 %, which is a 50 % increase compared to a similar study only two decades previously. The prevalence of PUUV IgG increased with age, and among 65-75 years it was 22 %. More men (15.3 %) than women (11.4 %) were seropositive (p < 0.05). The identified risk factors were smoking (OR = 1.67), living in rural areas (OR = 1.92), and owning farmland or forest (OR = 2.44). No associations were found between previous PUUV exposure and chronic lung disease, diabetes, hypertension, renal dysfunction, stroke or myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: PUUV is a common infection in northern Sweden and there is a high life time risk to acquire PUUV infection in endemic areas. Certain risk factors as living in rural areas and smoking were identified. Groups with increased risk should be targeted for future vaccination when available, and should also be informed about appropriate protection from rodent secreta.","['Bergstedt Oscarsson K', 'Brorstad A', 'Baudin M', 'Lindberg A', 'Forssén A', 'Evander M', 'Eriksson M', 'Ahlm C']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bergstedt Oscarsson K, et al.

27721108,Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome due to Puumala virus in Germany.,"In Germany Puumala virus (PUUV), known to cause mild forms of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), is the predominating endemic hantavirus. We herein describe an unusually severe case of a PUUV infection that occurred in summer 2015 in South Eastern Germany in a region known to be endemic for PUUV since over ten years. A 54-year-old female gardener was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and dyspnea. Within 48hours the patient developed a rapid progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with circulatory failure and required ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) treatment. Serological and molecular biological examinations of serum samples confirmed an infection with PUUV. Partial sequences of the S- and M-segment clustered to a strain previously described in South Eastern Germany. Our reported case highlights, that in rare incidents PUUV can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, a syndrome that is usually found after infections with New World hantaviruses, and neurological symptoms.","['Vollmar P', 'Lubnow M', 'Simon M', 'Müller T', 'Bergler T', 'Alois P', 'Thoma BR', 'Essbauer S']",2016,84,,J Clin Virol,"Vollmar P, et al.

A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was applied to establish a highly predictive model of HFRS. Meteorological factors were considered external variables through a cross correlation analysis. Then, these factors were included in the SARIMA model to determine if they could improve the predictive ability of HFRS epidemics in the region. The optimal univariate SARIMA model was identified as (0,0,2)(1,1,1)12. The R2 of the prediction of HFRS cases from January 2014 to December 2014 was 0.857, and the Root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.708. However, the inclusion of meteorological variables as external regressors did not significantly improve the SARIMA model. This result is likely because seasonal variations in meteorological variables were included in the seasonal characteristics of the HFRS itself.","['Li S', 'Cao W', 'Ren H', 'Lu L', 'Zhuang D', 'Liu Q']",2016,11,10,PLoS One,"Li S, et al.

Detection of 18 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 9 alternative HFRs including Dechlorane Plus (DP), brominated alkylbenzenes, and polybrominated biphenyls, and 2 related degradation products was conducted. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) were the dominant HFRs, with concentrations ranging from 200 to 2150 ng/g and 680-27,400 ng/g, respectively. The DBDPE detected was the highest level reported so far, exceeding those previously reported by 10-100 times. PBDEs were surpassed as the dominant HFRs in sewage sludge, with mean DBDPE/BDE 209 ratio exceeding 2 in all samples. The review of earlier surveys reveals that DBDPE level was surging while BDE 209 was declining. Annual emissions of BDE 209, DP, and DBDPE were estimated to be 227.9, 10.5, and 979.3 kg/yr, respectively. Although ecological risks assessment suggested low risks for the examined sludge, the key environmental properties and transformation pathways of alternative HFRs remain largely unknown. These findings prompt for further investigations on alternative HFR and sustainable management practices for HFR-laden biosolids. The HFR emission pattern revealed in this study is likely representative of other similarly industrialized regions in the post-PBDE era.","['Wu Q', 'Li H', 'Kuo DTF', 'Chen S', 'Mai B', 'Li H', 'Liu Z', 'Deng M', 'Zhang H', 'Hu X', 'Geng X', 'Chen Y']",2017,220,Pt A,Environ Pollut,"Wu Q, et al.

27619797,Immune response in Dobrava-Belgrade virus infections.,"Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is a hantavirus that causes a disease in humans known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hallmarks of hantaviral infections are increased vascular permeability due to dysregulation of the endothelial cell barrier and acute thrombocytopenia. In order to gain insight into the immune response in DOBV infections, the serum levels of 27 cytokines in 24 hospitalized Greek HFRS patients were evaluated. Compared to the control group, significantly higher IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1b, TNF-α and VEGF levels were found in severe cases, while in non-severe cases, IL-13 and TNF-α levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05). In all groups, IP-10 was increased and RANTES was decreased. Significant and time- (after onset of illness) dependent differences among fatal, severe and non-severe cases were seen. VEGF was positively associated with disease severity. A strong immune response was seen during the first week of illness, especially in severe cases, while the response in non-severe cases was weaker and delayed. The Th1 response was strong in non-severe cases and weak in the fatal case, while a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response was seen in the survivors of severe disease.","['Tsergouli K', 'Papa A']",2016,161,12,Arch Virol,Tsergouli K and Papa A.

27566671,"Vitamins (A, C and E) and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients treated with HFR and HFR-Supra.","BACKGROUND: Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is an extracorporeal dialytic method that combines diffusion, convection and adsorption. HFR-Supra (HFR-S) is a second-generation system with increased convective permeability and adsorption capability. Previous studies suggested that HFR reduces oxidative stress compared to standard haemodialysis. The principal aim of the present study was to compare antioxidant vitamins behavior and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients treated with HFR and HFR-S.
METHODS: The study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, crossover trial. Forty-one patients were recruited from 19 dialysis centers and after a 4-month washout stabilization period in on-line hemodiafiltration (ol-HDF), each patient was randomized to a sequence of treatments (HFR-S followed by HFR or viceversa) with each treatment applied over 6 months. Plasma levels of Advanced Oxidation Protein Products, Total Antioxidant Status, vitamins C, A and E and their ligands (Retinol Binding Protein and total lipids) were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.
RESULTS: Results show that the higher convective permeability of HFR-S with respect to HFR did not produce additional beneficial effects on the patients' oxidative status, a slight decrease of both Vitamin A and Retinol Binding Protein being the only difference registered in the long-term. However, as compared to ol-HDF, both the re-infusive techniques allowed to reduce the intradialytic loss of Vitamin C and, in the long-term, improve the patients' oxidative status and increase Retinol Binding Protein plasma values. No significant differences were found between the Vitamin C concentration of pre- and post cartridge UF neither in HFR-S nor in HFR showing that the sorbent resin does not adsorb Vitamin C.
CONCLUSION: HFR-S and HFR are almost equivalent in term of impact on antioxidant vitamins and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients. Nonetheless, as compared to ol-HDF, both treatments produced a sensible sparing of Vitamin C and may represent a new approach for reducing oxidative stress and related complications in dialysis patients. Long-term effects of re-infusive treatments on patients' cardiovascular morbidity and mortality need to be evaluated.

27542281,Construction and immunological characterization of CD40L or GM-CSF incorporated Hantaan virus like particle.,"Infection of Hantaan virus (HTNV) usually causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). China has the worst epidemic incidence of HFRS as well as high fatality. Inactivated whole virus has been used for HFRS vaccination, however there are still problems such as safety concerns. CD40 ligand (CD40L) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are well-known immune stimulating molecules that can enhance antigen presenting, lymphocytes activation and maturation, incorporation of CD40L and GM-CSF to the surface of virus like particles (VLPs) can greatly improve the vaccination effect. We constructed eukaryotic vectors expressing HTNV M segment and S segment, as well as vectors expressing HTNV M segment with CD40L or GM-CSF, our results showed successful production of CD40L or GM-CSF incorporated HTNV VLPs. In vitro stimulation with CD40L or GM-CSF anchored HTNV VLP showed enhanced activation of macrophages and DCs. CD40L/GM-CSF incorporated VLP can induce higher level of HTNV specific antibody and neutralizing antibody in mice. Immunized mice splenocytes showed higher ability of secreting IFN-γ and IL-2, as well as enhancing CTL activity. These results suggest CD40L/GM-CSF incorporated VLP can serve as prospective vaccine candidate.","['Ying Q', 'Ma T', 'Cheng L', 'Zhang X', 'Truax AD', 'Ma R', 'Liu Z', 'Lei Y', 'Zhang L', 'Ye W', 'Zhang F', 'Xu Z', 'Shang L', 'Liu R', 'Wang F', 'Wu X']",2016,7,39,Oncotarget,"Ying Q, et al.

27539248,Occurrence and Concentrations of Halogenated Flame Retardants in the Atmospheric Fine Particles in Chinese Cities.,"The concentrations of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in PM2.5 were monitored for one year at 10 urban sites in China during 2013-2014. This study investigated four classes of HFRs: nine polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), six nonbromodiphenyl ether (BDE) brominated flame retardants, two dechlorane plus (DP) flame retardants, and three chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Extremely high concentrations of BDE-209 and DBDPE were observed in only one city (Guangzhou), which was a consequence of the intensive e-waste recycling and disposal operations in the Pearl River Delta. This result differed from the tris(monochloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) distributions, which showed high concentrations in most cities, suggesting wide usage and large emissions in China in recent years. The highest TCPP and TCEP concentrations were observed in the summer, indicating that emission from local sources was an important factor controlling the levels in the air. This was not the case for BDE-209 and DBDPE, for which higher concentrations were found in winter. When bound to particulate matter due to low vapor pressure, these compounds may be more persistent in air, and temperature-dependent gas-particle partitioning was a key factor. Moreover, regional pollution and long-range transport had a significant influence on the seasonal distributions of BDE-209 and DBDPE, especially in cities (Guangzhou and Shanghai) close to electrical/electronic waste recycling sites. Residents in urban areas were exposed to higher levels of chlorinated OPFRs. This raises considerable concern, and an appropriate risk assessment is required.","['Liu D', 'Lin T', 'Shen K', 'Li J', 'Yu Z', 'Zhang G']",2016,50,18,Environ Sci Technol,"Liu D, et al.

27529272,What Do We Know about How Hantaviruses Interact with Their Different Hosts?,"Hantaviruses, like other members of the Bunyaviridae family, are emerging viruses that are able to cause hemorrhagic fevers. Occasional transmission to humans is due to inhalation of contaminated aerosolized excreta from infected rodents. Hantaviruses are asymptomatic in their rodent or insectivore natural hosts with which they have co-evolved for millions of years. In contrast, hantaviruses cause different pathologies in humans with varying mortality rates, depending on the hantavirus species and its geographic origin. Cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been reported in Europe and Asia, while hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndromes (HCPS) are observed in the Americas. In some cases, diseases caused by Old World hantaviruses exhibit HCPS-like symptoms. Although the etiologic agents of HFRS were identified in the early 1980s, the way hantaviruses interact with their different hosts still remains elusive. What are the entry receptors? How do hantaviruses propagate in the organism and how do they cope with the immune system? This review summarizes recent data documenting interactions established by pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses with their natural or human hosts that could highlight their different outcomes.","['Ermonval M', 'Baychelier F', 'Tordo N']",2016,8,8,Viruses,"Ermonval M, et al.

Accuracy and rapidity of a diagnostic test to Orientia tsutsugamushi is an important step to diagnose this disease. To discriminate scrub typhus from other diseases, the improved ImmuneMed Scrub Typhus Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) was evaluated in Korea and Sri Lanka. The sensitivity at the base of each IgM and IgG indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) in Korean patients was 98.6% and 97.1%, and the specificity was 98.2% and 97.7% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for retrospective diagnosis at the base of IFA in Sri Lanka was 92.1% and 96.1%. ImmuneMed RDT was not reactive to any serum from seventeen diseases including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (n = 48), leptospirosis (n = 23), and murine typhus (n = 48). ImmuneMed RDT shows superior sensitivity (98.6% and 97.1%) compared with SD Bioline RDT (84.4% at IgM and 83.3% at IgG) in Korea. The retrospective diagnosis of ImmuneMed RDT exhibits 94.0% identity with enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using South India patient serum samples. These results suggest that this RDT can replace other diagnostic tests and is applicable for global diagnosis of scrub typhus. This rapid and accurate diagnosis will be beneficial for diagnosing and managing scrub typhus.","['Kim YJ', 'Park S', 'Premaratna R', 'Selvaraj S', 'Park SJ', 'Kim S', 'Kim D', 'Kim MS', 'Shin DH', 'Choi KC', 'Kwon SH', 'Seo W', 'Lee NT', 'Kim SH', 'Kang HK', 'Kim YW']",2016,31,8,J Korean Med Sci,"Kim YJ, et al.

27430149,Development of a SYBR-Green Ⅰ quantitative PCR assay for the detection and genotyping of different hantaviruses.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a severe, viral zoonotic disease which occurs worldwide, particularly in Asia and Europe. In China, the Hantaan virus (HTNV) and the Seoul virus (SEOV) are known to be the most prevalent causative agents of HFRS. Since no protective vaccines or effective treatments are available for human use, accurate and reliable diagnostic methods are essential for disease surveillance. In the present study, the viral loads in cell culture supernatant, infected mice blood and clinical serum samples were quantified using the SYBR‑Green I-based reverse transcription-quantitiative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, which targeted the S gene sequence of the HTNV and SEOV genomes. The cRNA of these two viruses were synthesized as a positive control and 10-fold serially diluted from 1x105 to 1x100 copies/µl. Standard curves were generated by plotting the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values versus copy numbers. The standard curve of HTNV had a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.994, efficiency of amplification (E) of 101.9%, and the slope of -3.278, whereas that of SEOV had an R2 of 0.993, E of 104.8%, and the slope of -3.212. The minimum detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay for HTNV and SEOV was 101 copies/µl. Two qPCR assays were successfully established for the detection of HTNV and SEOV, respectively. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that using the SYBR‑Green I-based RT-qPCR assay, the HTNV and SEOV may be genotyped precisely without cross-reactivity. Furthermore, viral RNA may be detected and quantified in cells, mice and infected individuals, which may be useful in epidemiological studies as well as for early monitoring and further preventative treatment against SEOV and HTNV-induced diseases.","['Liu Z', 'Wang F', 'Yuan L', 'Zhang X', 'Ying Q', 'Yu L', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng L', 'Zhang F', 'Lu J', 'Wu X']",2016,38,3,Int J Mol Med,"Liu Z, et al.

27414047,Inhibition of the Hantavirus Fusion Process by Predicted Domain III and Stem Peptides from Glycoprotein Gc.,"Hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. To enter cells, hantaviruses fuse their envelope membrane with host cell membranes. Previously, we have shown that the Gc envelope glycoprotein is the viral fusion protein sharing characteristics with class II fusion proteins. The ectodomain of class II fusion proteins is composed of three domains connected by a stem region to a transmembrane anchor in the viral envelope. These fusion proteins can be inhibited through exogenous fusion protein fragments spanning domain III (DIII) and the stem region. Such fragments are thought to interact with the core of the fusion protein trimer during the transition from its pre-fusion to its post-fusion conformation. Based on our previous homology model structure for Gc from Andes hantavirus (ANDV), here we predicted and generated recombinant DIII and stem peptides to test whether these fragments inhibit hantavirus membrane fusion and cell entry. Recombinant ANDV DIII was soluble, presented disulfide bridges and beta-sheet secondary structure, supporting the in silico model. Using DIII and the C-terminal part of the stem region, the infection of cells by ANDV was blocked up to 60% when fusion of ANDV occurred within the endosomal route, and up to 95% when fusion occurred with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the fragments impaired ANDV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion, and cross-inhibited the fusion mediated by the glycoproteins from Puumala virus (PUUV). The Gc fragments interfered in ANDV cell entry by preventing membrane hemifusion and pore formation, retaining Gc in a non-resistant homotrimer stage, as described for DIII and stem peptide inhibitors of class II fusion proteins. Collectively, our results demonstrate that hantavirus Gc shares not only structural, but also mechanistic similarity with class II viral fusion proteins, and will hopefully help in developing novel therapeutic strategies against hantaviruses.","['Barriga GP', 'Villalón-Letelier F', 'Márquez CL', 'Bignon EA', 'Acuña R', 'Ross BH', 'Monasterio O', 'Mardones GA', 'Vidal SE', 'Tischler ND']",2016,10,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Barriga GP, et al.

The mean levels of SCCPs, MCCPs, PCBs, PBDEs and OHFRs in surface particulates ranged from 30,000-61,000, 170,000-890,000, 2700-27,000, 52,000-240,000, and 62,000-140,000ng/g dry weight (dw), respectively. OHFRs, including decabromodiphenyl ethane, dechlorane plus, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane, tetrabromobisphenol A, hexabromocyclododecanes, polybrominated biphenyls, hexabromobenzene, pentabromotoluene, and pentabromoethylbenzene, were frequently (>50% detection frequency) detected in surface particulates with mean concentration ranges of 39,000-63,000, 310-2700, 98-16,000, 21,000-56,000, 55-5700, 1700-27,000, 42-1600, 3.2-220, and 5.8-12ng/g dw, respectively. The composition of OHPs varied depend on the e-waste items processing in different regions. Guiyu and Dali were typical sites contaminated by halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and CPs, respectively, while Qingyuan, and Taizhou were representative PCB-polluted regions.

27348219,HMGB1 Is a Potential Biomarker for Severe Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) are common representatives of viral hemorrhagic fevers still often neglected in some parts of the world. Infection with Dobrava or Puumala virus (HFRS) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) can result in a mild, nonspecific febrile illness or as a severe disease with hemorrhaging and high fatality rate. An important factor in optimizing survival rate in patients with VHF is instant recognition of the severe form of the disease for which significant biomarkers need to be elucidated. To determine the prognostic value of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) as a biomarker for disease severity, we tested acute serum samples of patients with HFRS or CCHF. Our results showed that HMGB1 levels are increased in patients with CCHFV, DOBV or PUUV infection. Above that, concentration of HMGB1 is higher in patients with severe disease progression when compared to the mild clinical course of the disease. Our results indicate that HMGB1 could be a useful prognostic biomarker for disease severity in PUUV and CCHFV infection, where the difference between the mild and severe patients group was highly significant. Even in patients with severe DOBV infection concentrations of HMGB1 were 2.8-times higher than in the mild group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicated HMGB1 as a potential biomarker for severe hemorrhagic fevers.","['Resman Rus K', 'Fajs L', 'Korva M', 'Avšič-Županc T']",2016,10,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Resman Rus K, et al.

27315053,"Genetic Diversity and Reassortment of Hantaan Virus Tripartite RNA Genomes in Nature, the Republic of Korea.","BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV), a negative sense tripartite RNA virus of the Family Bunyaviridae, is the most prevalent hantavirus in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It is the causative agent of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in humans and maintained in the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, the primary zoonotic host. Clinical HFRS cases have been reported commonly in HFRS-endemic areas of Gyeonggi province. Recently, the death of a member of the ROK military from Gangwon province due to HFRS prompted an investigation of the epidemiology and distribution of hantaviruses in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces that border the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate the geographic distribution and molecular diversity of HTNV, whole genome sequences of HTNV Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S) segments were acquired from lung tissues of A. agrarius captured from 2003-2014. Consistent with the clinical incidence of HFRS established by the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC), the prevalence of HTNV in naturally infected mice in Gangwon province was lower than for Gyeonggi province. Whole genomic sequences of 34 HTNV strains were identified and a phylogenetic analysis showed geographic diversity of the virus in the limited areas. Reassortment analysis first suggested an occurrence of genetic exchange of HTNV genomes in nature, ROK.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first report to demonstrate the molecular prevalence of HTNV in Gangwon province. Whole genome sequencing of HTNV showed well-supported geographic lineages and the molecular diversity in the northern region of ROK due to a natural reassortment of HTNV genomes. These observations contribute to a better understanding of the genetic diversity and molecular evolution of hantaviruses. Also, the full-length of HTNV tripartite genomes will provide a database for phylogeographic analysis of spatial and temporal outbreaks of hantavirus infection.","['Kim JA', 'Kim WK', 'No JS', 'Lee SH', 'Lee SY', 'Kim JH', 'Kho JH', 'Lee D', 'Song DH', 'Gu SH', 'Jeong ST', 'Park MS', 'Kim HC', 'Klein TA', 'Song JW']",2016,10,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Kim JA, et al.

Hantavirus infections are characterized by thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to assess the association of thrombocytopenia with disease severity in HFRS induced by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV).
METHODS: Altogether 546 patients treated for acute serologically confirmed PUUV infection during 1982-2013 at Tampere University Hospital, Finland, were examined. Blood platelet count was determined daily and analysed in relation to different variables reflecting disease severity. The patients were divided into two groups according to the minimum platelet count: severe thrombocytopenia (<69 × 10(9)/L, i.e. below median) and no severe thrombocytopenia (≥69 × 10(9)/L).
RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 × 10(9)/L) was detected in 90% of patients, and in 28% of patients platelet count was <50 × 10(9)/L. Patients with severe thrombocytopenia had longer stay (8 versus 7 days, p = 0.002) and greater weight gain (2.8 versus 2.0 kg, p < 0.001) at the hospital, higher blood leukocyte count (11.2 × 10(9)/L versus 9.6 × 10(9)/L, p < 0.001), plasma C-reactive protein (81 versus 59 mg/L, p < 0.001), maximum hematocrit (0.44 versus 0.42, p < 0.001), urinary protein excretion (1.7 versus 1.1 g/24 h, p = 0.002), and lower plasma albumin concentration (27 versus 32 g/L, p < 0.001) than patients without severe thrombocytopenia (comparisons between medians). Maximum creatinine concentration did not differ between patients with or without severe thrombocytopenia (median 235 versus 214 μmol/L, p = 0.217).

27235087,Epidemiological and virological differences in human clustered and sporadic infections with avian influenza A H7N9.,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has suggested that avian influenza A H7N9 has a greater potential pandemic risk than influenza A H5N1. This research investigated the difference in human clustered and sporadic cases of H7N9 virus and estimated the relative risk of clustered infections.
METHODS: Comparative epidemiology and virology studies were performed among 72 sporadic confirmed cases, 17 family clusters (FCs) caused by human-to-human transmission, and eight live bird market clusters (LCs) caused by co-exposure to the poultry environment.
RESULTS: The case fatality of FCs, LCs and sporadic cases (36%, 26%, and 29%, respectively) did not differ among the three groups (p>0.05). The average age (36 years, 60 years, and 58 years), co-morbidities (31%, 60%, and 54%), exposure to birds (72%, 100%, and 83%), and H7N9-positive rate (20%, 64%, and 35%) in FCs, LCs, and sporadic cases, respectively, differed significantly (p<0.05). These higher risks were associated with increased mortality. There was no difference between primary and secondary cases in LCs (p>0.05). However, exposure to a person with confirmed avian influenza A H7N9 (primary 12% vs. secondary 95%), history of visiting a live bird market (100% vs. 59%), multiple exposures (live bird exposure and human-to-human transmission history) (12% vs. 55%), and median days from onset to antiviral treatment (6 days vs. 3 days) differed significantly between primary and secondary cases in FCs (p<0.05). Mild cases were found in 6% of primary cases vs. 32% of secondary cases in FCs (p<0.05). Twenty-five isolates from the three groups showed 99.1-99.9% homology and increased human adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistical difference in the case fatality rate and limited transmission between FCs and LCs. However, the severity of the primary cases in FCs was much higher than that of the secondary cases due to the older age and greater underlying disease of the latter patients.","['Wu Z', 'Sha J', 'Yu Z', 'Zhao N', 'Cheng W', 'Chan TC', 'Amer S', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu S']",2016,49,,Int J Infect Dis,"Wu Z, et al.

27175497,[Optimization of ELISA and immunoblot methods for the detection of IgG antibodies against old world hantaviruses in wild rodents].,"Hantaviruses infect humans via inhalation of viral particles in infected rodents' secretions such as saliva, urine and faeces or via direct contact with infected rodents. The rodent species that are known as the carriers of Dobrava (DOBV), Puumala (PUUV), Saaremaa (SAAV), Tula (TULV) and Seoul (SEOV) viruses are found in our country. The presence of specific antibodies against hantaviruses have been demonstrated in rodents collected from Black Sea and Aegean Regions of Turkey in 2004 for the first time. The first hantavirus-related hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases were reported in Black Sea region in 2009. The determination of the hantavirus prevalence in wild life and rodent populations in the field is crucial for the information about hantavirus-related cases and to clarify the state of risk. There is no commercial product optimized for the screening of rodent serum samples in terms of HFRS agents like DOBV and PUUV that are widely seen in Eurasia as well as Turkey. In this study, the antigens belonging to the commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and immunoblot tests that are produced for the screening of human sera were used for the development of antibody screening tests against hantavirus in rodent sera and were optimized. The most appropriate serum and conjugate dilutions were determined for the optimization of ELISA (Anti-Hantavirus Pool ELISA; Euroimmun, Germany) and immunoblot (Euroline Anti-Hanta Profile 1 strips; Euroimmun, Germany) methods. Optimized ELISA method was used for the screening and optimized immunoblot method was used for the confirmation. A total of 84 wild rodent sera that belonged to Apodemus and Microtus species were evaluated with this procedure and the cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity of optimized ELISA method were determined. For the optimization of ELISA 1/50, 1/100 and 1/200 serum dilutions and 1/10.000, 1/20.000 and 1/40.000 conjugate dilutions were tested. For the optimization of immunoblot, 1/50 and 1/100 serum dilutions and 1/5.000 and 1/10.000 conjugate dilutions were tested. The horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for ELISA and the alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for immunoblot were used. We followed the manufacturer's recommendations for the incubation parameters, substrate and the number of washes. 1/50 serum dilution and 1/10.000 conjugate dilution for ELISA and 1/100 serum dilution and 1/5.000 conjugate dilution for immunoblot were determined as optimal concentrations. By using the optimized ELISA, 26.2% (22/84) of rodents were found positive for hantavirus antibodies according the determined cut-off value (OD(450/620): 0.325). By using immunoblot as a confirmatory test, 20 out of 22 ELISA positive samples could be studied because of the insufficient amount of sera and 17 of them was found positive in terms of DOBV antibodies. Of these rodents 11 were Apodemus flavicollis, three were Apodemus agrarius, two were Microtus guentheri and one was Apodemus sylvaticus. When the results of ELISA were compared to immunoblot results, the optimized ELISA's sensitivity and specificity were found as 100% and 95%, respectively. In this study, a method that can be used in the screening of rodent sera was constituted which uses commercial antigens that can be provided easily, gives fast and reliable results. Similar serological methods optimized for different types of rodents are of great importance for the realization of active follow-up and monitoring of the studies in the field.","['Polat C', 'Karataş A', 'Sözen M', 'Matur F', 'Abacıoğlu H', 'Öktem MA']",2016,50,2,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Polat C, et al.

Multi species soil systems (MS·3) were used to assess the fate and the effects associated with the application of four biosolids in agricultural soil on terrestrial soil organisms. Biosolid amendment increased concentrations 1.5-14-fold for PFASs, 1.1-2.4-fold for polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs, and 1.1-3.6-fold for chlorinated flame retardants, CFRs. Perfluorooctanesulfonate, PFOS, (25%) and BDE-209 (60%) were the predominant PFAS and HFR compounds, respectively, in biosolids-amended soils. Total concentrations (ng/g dry weight) in earthworms from biosolid-amended soils ranged from 9.9 to 101 for PFASs, from 45 to 76 for PBDEs and 0.3-32 for CFRs. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated to evaluate the degree of exposure of pollutants in earthworms. The mean BAF ranged from 2.2 to 198 for PFASs, 0.6-17 for PBDEs and 0.5-20 for CFRs. The relationship of PFAS and PBDE BAFs in earthworms and their log Kow were compared: PFAS BAFs increased while PBDE BAFs declined with increasing log Kow values. The effect of the aging (21 days) on the bioavailability of the pollutants in amended soils was also assessed: the residence time affected differently to the compounds studied.","['Navarro I', 'de la Torre A', 'Sanz P', 'Pro J', 'Carbonell G', 'Martínez MLÁ']",2016,149,,Environ Res,"Navarro I, et al.

27149147,Plant selective uptake of halogenated flame retardants at an e-waste recycling site in southern China.,"The concentrations and homolog patterns of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in vegetables grown at an e-waste contaminated site were investigated. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were the dominant HFRs in vegetable tissues, with concentrations ranging from 10.3 to 164 ng g(-1) and 1.16-107 ng g(-1) in shoots and roots, respectively, followed by novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and dechlorane plus (DPs). This is an indication that PBDE contamination in vegetables grown around e-waste recycling sites may pose a risk to the local terrestrial ecosystem and residents. In addition, this is the first report on the concentrations and compositions of NBFRs in vegetables around e-waste recycling sites. The HFRs concentrations in vegetables varied greatly with the vegetable species, with the highest concentrations observed in Brassica oleracea var. capitata. Root concentration factors (RCF) decreased with increasing log Kow of HFRs, which indicated that the uptake of HFRs was controlled mainly by log Kow. Dissimilar HFRs profiles in shoots and roots suggested that the uptake and translocation of HFRs by plants were selective, with lower halogenated congeners prone to accumulation in vegetable tissues. Positive relationships between PBDEs and their substitutes were observed in vegetable tissues, suggesting that the replacement of PBDEs by NBFRs has not resulted in an obvious transition in plants within the study area.","['Wang S', 'Wang Y', 'Luo C', 'Li J', 'Yin H', 'Zhang G']",2016,214,,Environ Pollut,"Wang S, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Materials of epizootologic and epidemiologic monitoring of natural foci of HFRS of the Republic of Bashkortostan for 1980 - 2014 were used. Evaluation of area of territory with high, medium and low potential epidemic hazard by HFRS was carried out taking into account multi-year param- eters of morbidity by administrative districts of the Republic of Bashkortostan. 3 gradations of morbidity level by HFRS - more than 201, 101 - 200, less than 100 per 100 thousand of the population - were used for epidemiologic differentiation ofthe territory.
RESULTS: 3 main landscape- epidemiologic types of HFRS foci were isolated - forest, forest-barrens, barrens, as well as their landscape variants. The area with a high degree of potential epidemic hazard by HFRS was estab= lished to be around 3.8%; medium - 15.9%, low - 80.3%.of the whole territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan.

27117403,A Molecular-Level Account of the Antigenic Hantaviral Surface.,"Hantaviruses, a geographically diverse group of zoonotic pathogens, initiate cell infection through the concerted action of Gn and Gc viral surface glycoproteins. Here, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure of the antigenic ectodomain of Gn from Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Fitting of PUUV Gn into an electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of intact Gn-Gc spike complexes from the closely related but non-pathogenic Tula hantavirus localized Gn tetramers to the membrane-distal surface of the virion. The accuracy of the fitting was corroborated by epitope mapping and genetic analysis of available PUUV sequences. Interestingly, Gn exhibits greater non-synonymous sequence diversity than the less accessible Gc, supporting a role of the host humoral immune response in exerting selective pressure on the virus surface. The fold of PUUV Gn is likely to be widely conserved across hantaviruses.","['Li S', 'Rissanen I', 'Zeltina A', 'Hepojoki J', 'Raghwani J', 'Harlos K', 'Pybus OG', 'Huiskonen JT', 'Bowden TA']",2016,15,5,Cell Rep,"Li S, et al.

We analysed serologically confirmed acute PUUV infections reported to the National Infectious Disease Register from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 2014. A total of 30 942 cases of PUUV infections were identified during the study period. The average annual incidence was 31 cases/100 000 person-years with the highest in Eastern Finland and the lowest in Southwestern Finland. Throughout Finland there was not an increasing trend in incidence but changes in incidence, seasonality and long-term cycles differed regionally. Long-term cycles supported by high Bayesian posterior probabilities (73-100%) differed between the south and the north, shifting from 3 to 4 years, respectively. Temporal changes in seasonality were most prominent in Southwestern Finland. The pattern of human PUUV infection epidemiology probably primarily reflects the spatio-temporal interaction between bank-vole population dynamics and climate.","['Sane J', 'Ollgren J', 'Makary P', 'Vapalahti O', 'Kuusi M', 'Lyytikäinen O']",2016,144,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Sane J, et al.

This study presents the molecular characterization of PUUV circulating in bank voles in two regions of the Netherlands. Most human cases of hantavirus infection are from these two regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the (partial) S, M and L-segments indicated that the Dutch strains belong to the CE lineage, which includes PUUV strains from France, Germany and Belgium.

27038799,"Genetic characterization of hantaviruses isolated from rodents in the port cities of Heilongjiang, China, in 2014.","BACKGROUND: Hantavirus is a tripartite negative-sense RNA virus. It can infect humans through contaminated rodent excreta and causes two types of fatal human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). China exhibits the highest HFRS occurrence rate in the world, and the Heilongjiang area is one of the most severely infected regions.
RESULTS: To obtain additional insights into the genetic characteristics of hantaviruses in the port cities of the Heilongjiang area in China, a molecular epidemiological investigation of hantaviruses isolated from rodents was performed in 2014. A total of 649 rodents (11 murine species and 1 shrew species) were caught in 12 port cities in Heilongjiang. Among these rodents, the most common species was A. agrarius, and the second-most common was R. norvegicus. A viral gene PCR assay revealed the presence of two specific genotypes of hantavirus, referred to as Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), and the positive SEOV infection rate was higher than that for HTNV. A genetic analysis based on partial M segment sequences indicated that all of the isolates belonging to SEOV could be assigned to two genetic lineages, whereas the isolate belonging to HTNV could be assigned to only one genetic lineage.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that HTNV and SEOV are circulating in A. agrarius and R. norvegicus in the port cities in the area of Heilongjiang, but SEOV may be the dominant common hantavirus.","['Cao S', 'Ma J', 'Cheng C', 'Ju W', 'Wang Y']",2016,12,,BMC Vet Res,"Cao S, et al.

NE infections have been shown to occur in specific geographical areas characterized by environmental factors that influence the distribution and dynamics of host populations and virus persistence in the soil. Here, we review the influence of environmental conditions (including climate factors, food availability and habitat conditions) with respect to incidence in humans and seroprevalence in rodents, considering both direct and indirect transmission pathways. For each type of environmental factor, results and discrepancies between studies are presented and examined in the light of biological hypotheses. Overall, food availability and temperature appear to be the main drivers of host seroprevalence and NE incidence, but data quality and statistical approaches varied greatly among studies. We highlight the issues that now need to be addressed and suggest improvements for study design in regard to the current knowledge on hantavirus epidemiology.","['Monchatre-Leroy E', 'Crespin L', 'Boué F', 'Marianneau P', 'Calavas D', 'Hénaux V']",2017,64,4,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Monchatre-Leroy E, et al.

26972493,Specific interference shRNA-expressing plasmids inhibit Hantaan virus infection in vitro and in vivo.,"AIM: To investigate the antiviral effects of vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice.
RESULTS: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 μg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys.
CONCLUSION: Plasmid-based shRNAs potently inhibit HTNV replication in vitro and in vivo.

Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most common causative agent of HFRS in Europe. Current routine diagnostic methods are based on serological analyses and can yield inconclusive results. Hantavirus-infected patients are viremic during the early phase of disease; therefore, detection of viral RNA genomes can be a valuable complement to existing serological methods. However, the high genomic sequence diversity of PUUV has hampered the development of molecular diagnostics, and currently no real-time reverse transcription-quantitative (RT)-PCR assay is available for routine diagnosis of HFRS. Here, we present a novel PUUV RT-PCR assay. The assay was validated for routine diagnosis of HFRS on samples collected in Sweden during the winter season from 2013 to 2014. The assay allowed detection of PUUV RNA in 98.7% of confirmed clinical HFRS samples collected within 8 days after symptomatic onset. In summary, this study shows that real-time RT-PCR can be a reliable alternative to serological tests during the early phase of HFRS.","['Lagerqvist N', 'Hagström Å', 'Lundahl M', 'Nilsson E', 'Juremalm M', 'Larsson I', 'Alm E', 'Bucht G', 'Ahlm C', 'Klingström J']",2016,54,5,J Clin Microbiol,"Lagerqvist N, et al.

26887639,Temporal dynamics of Puumala hantavirus infection in cyclic populations of bank voles.,"Understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir host populations is a prerequisite for predicting and preventing human disease epidemics. The human infection risk of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is highest in northern Europe, where populations of the rodent host (bank vole, Myodes glareolus) undergo cyclic fluctuations. We conducted a 7-year capture-mark-recapture study to monitor seasonal and multiannual patterns of the PUUV infection rate in bank vole populations exhibiting a 3-year density cycle. Infected bank voles were most abundant in mid-winter months during years of increasing or peak host density. Prevalence of PUUV infection in bank voles exhibited a regular, seasonal pattern reflecting the annual population turnover and accumulation of infections within each year cohort. In autumn, the PUUV transmission rate tracked increasing host abundance, suggesting a density-dependent transmission. However, prevalence of PUUV infection was similar during the increase and peak years of the density cycle despite a twofold difference in host density. This may result from the high proportion of individuals carrying maternal antibodies constraining transmission during the cycle peak years. Our exceptionally intensive and long-term dataset provides a solid basis on which to develop models to predict the dynamic public health threat posed by PUUV in northern Europe.","['Voutilainen L', 'Kallio ER', 'Niemimaa J', 'Vapalahti O', 'Henttonen H']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Voutilainen L, et al.

26873607,Selective predation on hantavirus-infected voles by owls and confounding effects from landscape properties.,"It has been suggested that predators may protect human health through reducing disease-host densities or selectively preying on infected individuals from the population. However, this has not been tested empirically. We hypothesized that Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) selectively preys on hantavirus-infected individuals of its staple prey, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Bank voles are hosts of Puumala hantavirus, which causes a form of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Selective predation by owls on infected voles may reduce human disease risk. We compared the prevalence of anti-Puumala hantavirus antibodies (seroprevalence), in bank voles cached by owls in nest boxes to seroprevalence in voles trapped in closed-canopy forest around each nest box. We found no general difference in seroprevalence. Forest landscape structure could partly account for the observed patterns in seroprevalence. Only in more connected forest patches was seroprevalence in bank voles cached in nest boxes higher than seroprevalence in trapped voles. This effect disappeared with increasing forest patch isolation, as seroprevalence in trapped voles increased with forest patch isolation, but did not in cached voles. Our results suggest a complex relationship between zoonotic disease prevalence in hosts, their predators, and landscape structure. Some mechanisms that may have caused the seroprevalence patterns in our results include higher bank vole density in isolated forest patches. This study offers future research potential to shed further light on the contribution of predators and landscape properties to human health.","['Khalil H', 'Ecke F', 'Evander M', 'Hörnfeldt B']",2016,181,2,Oecologia,"Khalil H, et al.

The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group, and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Ninety-three plasma samples from the patients in the acute stage and 78 samples from the patients in the convalescent stage were obtained, and 28 samples from healthy subjects were obtained as controls. The concentrations of APN were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of white blood cells, platelets, hematocrit, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and uric acid in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of APN among the different types were compared; the correlation between APN and the laboratory parameters was analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of APN and the laboratory parameters as mentioned above were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.The levels of APN in the mild- and moderate-type patients in the acute stage were significantly higher than the severe-type and control (P < 0.05) and decreased with the severity of the disease, while there were no obvious difference among severe-, critical-type and control groups. The levels of APN in patients in the convalescent stage were higher than the control group (P < 0.05), and the APN levels of the critical-type group were higher compared with the mild-type groups (P < 0.05). Adiponectin was negatively correlated with white blood cells and hematocrit and positively correlated with platelets, albumin, and uric acid (P < 0.001). Adiponectin showed no statistical significance for predicting prognosis, with the area under the curve equal to 0.609 (95% CI: 0.237-0.745, P = 0.215).Adiponectin can be considered as a novel biomarker for disease severity in patients with HFRS, while it seems to have no predictive capacity for prognosis of HFRS.","['Du H', 'Bai X', 'Lian J', 'Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang P', 'Jiang H']",2016,95,6,Medicine (Baltimore),"Du H, et al.

26850398,[Application of nonlinear autoregressive neural network in predicting incidence tendency of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the prospect of nonlinear autoregressive neural network in fitting and predicting the incidence tendency of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) , in the mainland of China.
METHODS: Monthly reported case series of HFRS in China from 2004 to 2013 were used to build both ARIMA and NAR neural network models, in order to predict the monthly incidence of HFRS in China in 2014. Fitness and prediction on the effects of these two models were compared.
RESULTS: For the Fitting dataset, MAE, RMSE and MAPE of the ARIMA model were 148.058, 272.077 and 12.678% respectively, while the MAE, RMSE and MAPE of NAR neural network appeared as 119.436, 186.671 and 11.778% respectively. For the Predicting dataset, MAE, RMSE and MAPE of the ARIMA model appeared as 189.088, 221.133 and 21.296%, while the MAE, RMSE and MAPE of the NAR neural network as 119.733, 151.329 and 11.431% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The NAR neural network showed better effects in fitting and predicting the incidence tendency of HFRS than using the traditional ARIMA model, in China. NAR neural network seemed to have strong application value in the prevention and control of HFRS.","['Wu W', 'An S', 'Guo J', 'Guan P', 'Ren Y', 'Xia L', 'Zhou B']",2015,36,12,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Wu W, et al.

26826547,Long-term immunogenicity and safety of inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine (Hantavax™) in healthy adults.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is a serious health problem in Eurasian countries, including Korea and China. This study evaluated the long-term immunogenicity and safety of formalin-inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine (Hantavax™).
METHODS: A phase III, multi-center clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Hantavax™ (three-dose schedule at 0, 1, and 13 months) among healthy adults. Immune response was assessed using the plaque reduction neutralizing antibody test (PRNT) and immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). Antibody levels were measured pre-vaccination and at 2, 13, 14, 25, 37, and 49 months after the initial vaccination. Systemic and local adverse events were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 226 healthy subjects aged 19-75 years were enrolled. Following two primary doses of Hantavax™, the seroconversion rate was 90.14% by IFA, but it was only 23.24% by PRNT50. With booster administration, seropositive rates were 87.32% and 45.07% at one month post-vaccination according to IFA and PRNT50, respectively. In young adults (19-39 years), the seropositive rate according to PRNT50 reached about 60% after booster vaccination. The mean duration of seropositive response was 735 days for PRNT50 and 845 days for IFA. Solicited local and systemic adverse events occurred in 47.79% and 25.22% of study subjects, respectively, and most were grade 1.
CONCLUSION: Hantavax™ showed a booster effect and immunogenicity lasting two years with a three-dose schedule. The neutralizing antibody response was quite poor with two primary doses, so an early booster vaccination at 2-6 months might be warranted to provide timely protection to high-risk subjects.","['Song JY', 'Woo HJ', 'Cheong HJ', 'Noh JY', 'Baek LJ', 'Kim WJ']",2016,34,10,Vaccine,"Song JY, et al.

However, the annual reported incidences of HFRS in Yichun City Increased significantly from 2009 to 2013.
MATERIAL/METHODS: The information on HFRS reported cases were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP), and demographic data was collected from the Basic Information System. Hantavirus-specific antigen and antibody of rodent specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immune fluorescent assay.
RESULTS: The annual HFRS incidences among all age subgroups presented growth tendencies in non-EPI targeted regions and EPI targeted regions, except for the EPI target population. The annual incidences of EPI target population were stable at around 10 per 100,000 population from 2008 to 2013. HFRS annual incidence was significantly related to rat virus index among all age subgroups in non-EPI targeted regions and >60 age subgroup in EPI targeted regions.

HFRS is endemic in the Balkan Peninsula, where sporadic cases or outbreaks have been reported. Puumala virus (PUUV) is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of HFRS. PUUV is carried by the bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In this study, we investigated viral RNA from 76 tissues samples (lung n=30, heart n=6, liver n=18 and kidney n=22) of infected naturally rodent hosts in the area of Central Dinarides caught in live traps. Puumala virus was extracted from 34,7% (16/46) rodents by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. Overall, 18 (21,4%) specimens of internal organs (kidney n=8, liver n=6, heart n=2 and lung n=2) were positive for PUUV. It was shown a high rodent infestation rate in a relatively low number of rodent and their organs, although mice were not caught during the time of high density population of host rodents.","['Dervović E', 'Hukić M']",2016,230,,J Virol Methods,Dervović E and Hukić M.

26775886,Successful treatment of neonatal atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome with C5 monoclonal antibody.,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is rare in neonates. We report the case of atypical HUS (aHUS) revealed by neonatal seizures. This 18-day-old baby presented with repeated clonus of the left arm and eye deviation. Four days earlier, she had suffered from gastroenteritis (non-bloody diarrhea and vomiting without fever). Her work-up revealed hemolytic anemia (120 g/L), thrombocytopenia (78 g/L), and impaired renal function (serum creatinine=102 μmol/L) compatible with the diagnosis of HUS. Levels of C3 and C4 in the serum were normal. Shiga-toxin in the stools as well as the IgM and IgG against Escherichia coli O157 were negative. ADAMTS 13 deficiency, inborn error of the cobalamin pathway, deficiency in the H and I protein, and factor H antibodies were excluded and we concluded in aHUS. Genetic screening of the alternative complement pathway was normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging performed after 24 h and 1 week showed restricted diffusion areas with periventricular white matter ischemic-hemorrhagic lesions. Extensive infectious work-up was negative. Upon admission the baby received antiepileptic drugs and 2 days later C5 monoclonal antibody (eculizumab) and two transfusions of packed erythrocytes because the hemoglobin value had dropped to 55 g/L. The platelet value was minimal at 30 g/L. Renal function normalized in 48 h without dialysis and neurological examination was normal in 1 week.

26747994,Product screening for sources of halogenated flame retardants in Canadian house and office dust.,"Human exposure to halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their replacements, can be related to exposure to indoor dust and direct contact with HFR-containing products. This study aimed to identify electronic products that contributed to HFRs measured in indoor dust and to develop a screening method for identifying HFRs in hard polymer products. Concentrations of 10 PBDEs and 12 halogenated replacements in dust and surface wipe samples of hard polymer casings of electronic products plus Br in the surfaces of those casing measured using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were analyzed from 35 homes and 10 offices in Toronto (ON, Canada). HFR concentrations in dust and product wipes were positively correlated. Thus, we hypothesize that electronic products with the highest HFR concentrations contribute the most to concentrations in dust, regardless of the volatility of the HFR. Abundant HFRs in dust and product wipes were PBDEs (BDE-47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 209), TDCPP, DBDPE, EH-TBB and BEHTBP. Older CRT TVs had the highest concentration of BDE-209 of all products tested. This was followed by higher concentrations of HFRs in PCs, Audio/Video (A/V) devices, small household appliances (HHAs) and flat screen TVs. The removal of HFRs from polymer surfaces using wipes supports concerns that HFRs could be transferred from these surfaces to hands as a result of direct contact with HFR-containing products. Surface wipe testing shows promise for screening additive HFRs. In comparison, the Br-content obtained using a handheld XRF analyzer did not correspond to concentrations obtained from surface wipe testing.","['Abbasi G', 'Saini A', 'Goosey E', 'Diamond ML']",2016,545-546,,Sci Total Environ,"Abbasi G, et al.

26724461,Short-term fasts increase levels of halogenated flame retardants in tissues of a wild incubating bird.,"Many species are adapted for fasting during parts of their life cycle. For species undergoing extreme fasts, lipid stores are mobilized and accumulated contaminants can be released to exert toxicological effects. However, it is unknown if short-term fasting events may have a similar effect. The objective of this study was to determine if short successive fasts are related to contaminant levels in liver and plasma of birds. In ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis), both members of the pair alternate between incubating the nest for several hours (during which they fast) and foraging, making them a useful model for examining this question. Birds were equipped with miniature data loggers recording time and GPS position for two days to determine the proportion and duration of time birds spent in these two activities. Liver and plasma samples were collected, and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) (PBDEs and dechlorane plus) and organochlorines (OCs) (PCBs, DDTs, and chlordane-related compounds) were determined. Most birds (79%) exhibited plasma lipid content below 1%, indicating a likely fasted state, and plasma lipid percent declined with the number of hours spent at the nest site. The more time birds spent at their nest site, the higher were their plasma and liver concentrations of HFRs. However, body condition indices were unrelated to either the amount of time birds fasted at the nest site or contaminant levels, suggesting that lipid mobilization might not have been severe enough to affect overall body condition of birds and to explain the relationship between fasting and HFR concentrations. A similar relationship between fasting and OC levels was not observed, suggesting that different factors are affecting short-term temporal variations in concentrations of these two classes of contaminants. This study demonstrates that short fasts can be related to increased internal contaminant exposure in birds and that this may be a confounding factor in research and monitoring involving tissue concentrations of HFRs in wild birds.","['Marteinson SC', 'Drouillard KG', 'Verreault J']",2016,146,,Environ Res,"Marteinson SC, et al.

Results indicate that the distribution and infection rates of rodents are closely associated with environmental conditions. Hantavirus infections in rodents were positively correlated with temperature vegetation dryness index and negatively correlated with elevation. The predictive risk maps based on multivariate regression model revealed that the annual variation of infection risks is small, whereas monthly variation is large and corresponded well to the seasonal variation of human HFRS incidence.

In this study, we analyzed the regulation of 2 fibrinolytic parameters, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its physiological inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), in Puumala hantavirus (PUUV)-infected patients and in human microvascular endothelial cells. We detected strong upregulation of tPA in the acute phase of illness and in PUUV-infected macaques and found the tPA level to positively correlate with disease severity. The median levels of PAI-1 during the acute stage did not differ from those during the recovery phase. In concordance, hantaviruses induced tPA but not PAI-1 in microvascular endothelial cells, and the induction was demonstrated to be dependent on type I interferon. Importantly, type I and II interferons directly upregulated tPA through signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which regulated tPA gene expression via a STAT1-responsive enhancer element. These results suggest that tPA may be a general factor in the immunological response to viruses.","['Strandin T', 'Hepojoki J', 'Laine O', 'Mäkelä S', 'Klingström J', 'Lundkvist Å', 'Julkunen I', 'Mustonen J', 'Vaheri A']",2016,213,10,J Infect Dis,"Strandin T, et al.

26699788,Dengue hemorrhagic fever and the kidney.,"Dengue virus infection (DVI)/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a common febrile illness with a variety of severities. The mortality rate is high in dengue shock syndrome (DSS), caused by circulatory failure due to plasma leakage resulting in multi-organ failure. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is rarely reported. In areas of endemic DVI, the prevalence of AKI due to DVI has been reported to be as high as 6.0 % in children with AKI, and 0.9 % in children with DVI who were admitted to a hospital. The mechanism of AKI in DVI is not clear. It may result from (a) direct injury as in other infectious diseases, (b) an indirect mechanism such as via the immune system, since DHF is an immunological disease, or (c) hypotensive DSS, leading in turn to reduced renal blood supply and renal failure. The mortality rates of DF/DHF, DSS and DHF/DSS-related AKI are <1 %, 12-44 %, and >60 %, respectively. Kidney involvement is not actually that rare, but is under-recognized and often only reported when microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, electrolyte imbalance, or even AKI is found. The prevalence of proteinuria and hematuria has been reported as high as 70-80 % in DVI. A correct diagnosis depends on basic investigations of kidney function such as urinalysis, serum creatinine and electrolytes. Although DVI-related renal involvement is treated supportively, it is still important to make an early diagnosis to prevent AKI and its complications, and if AKI does occur, dialysis may be required. Fortunately, in patients who recover, kidney function usually completely recovers as well.","['Vachvanichsanong P', 'Thisyakorn U', 'Thisyakorn C']",2016,161,4,Arch Virol,"Vachvanichsanong P, et al.

26654580,Long-term persistence of anti-hantavirus antibodies in sera of patients undergoing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and subjects vaccinated against the disease.,"Background China has the highest prevalence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and accounts for 90% of the total cases worldwide. However, the long-term persistence of anti-hantavirus antibodies in sera of patients with HFRS and subjects vaccinated against the disease remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of anti-hantavirus IgG antibodies in sera of patients with prior HFRS, versus subjects vaccinated against the disease and controls in Shaanxi, China. Methods Six hundred individuals were included in this study. We quantified anti-hantavirus IgG antibodies in HFRS patients (n = 100), vaccinees (n = 200), controls from endemic regions (n = 200), and controls from non-endemic regions (n = 100) in China. Results The median optical density (OD) values (range) were 0.803 (0.008-1.813), 0.075 (0.004-1.565), 0.026 (0-1.179), and 0.015 (0.009-0.118) for HFRS patients, vaccinated subjects, endemic controls, and non-endemic controls, respectively. There was a strikingly significant difference between the HFRS group and each non-HFRS group (p < 0.001). The vaccinated subjects were also significantly different from the endemic controls. The time since the acute phase was correlated with the OD values of the HFRS patients. Conclusions Our study suggests that HFRS patients gain long-lasting protection and that vaccination may be an effective way to stimulate antibody production.","['Zheng Y', 'Wei J', 'Zhou BY', 'Xu Y', 'Dong JH', 'Guan LY', 'Ma P', 'Yu PB', 'Wang JJ']",2016,48,4,Infect Dis (Lond),"Zheng Y, et al.

26650941,Puumala Hantavirus-Induced Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome Must Be Considered across the Borders of Nephrology to Avoid Unnecessary Diagnostic Procedures.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, is caused by Puumala virus and is characterized by acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective survey of 456 adult patients with serologically confirmed NE was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 456 investigated patients, 335 had received inpatient treatment. At time of admission to hospital, 72% of the patients had still an AKI and thrombocytopenia was present in 64% of the patients. The 335 patients were treated in 29 different hospitals and 6 of which had nephrology departments. 10 out of 335 patients received treatment in university hospitals and 63% of patients admitted themselves to hospital. Initially, the patients were admitted to 12 different clinical departments (29% of the patients were referred to a nephrology department) and during the course of the disease, 8% of the patients were transferred to another department in the same hospital and 3% were transferred to a nephrology department at another hospital. Regarding diagnostic procedures, in 28% of the inpatients computed tomography to exclude pulmonary embolism or due to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis, magnetic resonance tomography of the brain owing to suspected stroke because of visual disorders, gastroscopy, or colonoscopy due to gastrointestinal symptoms was performed at time of admission to hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: NE must be considered by physicians across the borders of nephrology to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures especially in areas where NE is endemic.","['Kitterer D', 'Segerer S', 'Alscher MD', 'Braun N', 'Latus J']",2015,10,12,PLoS One,"Kitterer D, et al.

METHODS: Data of 140 cases of hospitalized patients with HFRS were collected. The patients were divided into incomplete vaccinated group (n = 10) and unvaccinated group (n = 130) according to vaccination status. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the two groups' patients were compared through t test, Pearson χ(2) test, and Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: In comparison with the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate of vomiting and hypotensive-shock, the white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count, the level of blood urea nitrogen and albumin, total number of dialysis and hospitalization cost of patients in the incomplete vaccinated group have statistically significant differences.
CONCLUSION: HFRS disease may still occur in individuals with a history of HFRS incomplete vaccination although the symptoms may be mild.

Kidney injury is not usual but can be severe, and it is most often associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock. Guadeloupe, which is located in an endemic area, experienced an epidemic from 2013 to 2014. During this outbreak, a case of renal failure during dengue was observed in a 10-year-old child. No evidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome was found. The clinical and biological course improved with symptomatic treatment. The association of acute renal failure with hemolytic anemia suggested a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, this could not be confirmed in the absence of thrombocytopenia and cytopathologic evidence. This case illustrates the diversity of clinical presentations of dengue, and the possibility of severe renal impairment unrelated to the usual factors encountered in dengue.","['Nicolon C', 'Broustal E']",2016,23,1,Arch Pediatr,Nicolon C and Broustal E.

26559827,Crystal Structure of the Core Region of Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Reveals the Mechanism for Ribonucleoprotein Complex Formation.,"UNLABELLED: Hantaviruses, which belong to the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae, infect mammals, including humans, causing either hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans with high mortality. Hantavirus encodes a nucleocapsid protein (NP) to encapsidate the genome and form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) together with viral polymerase. Here, we report the crystal structure of the core domains of NP (NPcore) encoded by Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV), which are two representative members that cause HCPS in the New World. The constructs of SNV and ANDV NPcore exclude the N- and C-terminal portions of full polypeptide to obtain stable proteins for crystallographic study. The structure features an N lobe and a C lobe to clamp RNA-binding crevice and exhibits two protruding extensions in both lobes. The positively charged residues located in the RNA-binding crevice play a key role in RNA binding and virus replication. We further demonstrated that the C-terminal helix and the linker region connecting the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and NPcore are essential for hantavirus NP oligomerization through contacts made with two adjacent protomers. Moreover, electron microscopy (EM) visualization of native RNPs extracted from the virions revealed that a monomer-sized NP-RNA complex is the building block of viral RNP. This work provides insight into the formation of hantavirus RNP and provides an understanding of the evolutionary connections that exist among bunyaviruses.
IMPORTANCE: Hantaviruses are distributed across a wide and increasing range of host reservoirs throughout the world. In particular, hantaviruses can be transmitted via aerosols of rodent excreta to humans or from human to human and cause HFRS and HCPS, with mortalities of 15% and 50%, respectively. Hantavirus is therefore listed as a category C pathogen. Hantavirus encodes an NP that plays essential roles both in RNP formation and in multiple biological functions. NP is also the exclusive target for the serological diagnoses. This work reveals the structure of hantavirus NP, furthering the knowledge of hantavirus RNP formation, revealing the relationship between hantavirus NP and serological specificity and raising the potential for the development of new diagnosis and therapeutics targeting hantavirus infection.","['Guo Y', 'Wang W', 'Sun Y', 'Ma C', 'Wang X', 'Wang X', 'Liu P', 'Shen S', 'Li B', 'Lin J', 'Deng F', 'Wang H', 'Lou Z']",2016,90,2,J Virol,"Guo Y, et al.

The concentrations of PBDEs, NBFRs, and DPs ranged from 13.9 to 351, 11.6 to 70.8, and 0.64 to 8.74 ng g(-1) in RS and 7.56 to 127, 8.98 to 144, and 0.38 to 8.45 ng g(-1) in NRS, respectively. BDE-209 and DBDPE were the dominant congeners of PBDEs and NBFRs, respectively. PBDEs, NBFRs, and DPs were more enriched in RS than NRS in most vegetables species. Further analysis suggested that the differentiation of the rhizosphere effect on halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) was not solely controlled by the octanol-water coefficients. This difference was also reflected by the correlations between total organic carbon (TOC) and PBDEs, NBFRs, or DPs, which indicated that organic carbon was a more pivotal controlling factor for PBDEs and DPs than for NBFRs in soil. We also found significant positive correlations between PBDEs and their replacement products, which indicated a similar emission pattern and environmental behaviour.","['Wang S', 'Wang Y', 'Song M', 'Luo C', 'Li J', 'Zhang G']",2016,208,Pt B,Environ Pollut,"Wang S, et al.

26544886,Distribution of brominated flame retardants and dechloranes between sediments and benthic fish--A comparison of a freshwater and marine habitat.,"A total of 53 halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were analysed in sediments, European eels and dabs from both freshwater and marine sampling stations in the German Bight and the river Elbe. Classic HFRs, such as polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), were the highest concentrated HFRs in eels as well as in most dabs (apart from 1,2,5,6-tetrabromocyclooctane (TBCO)). In sediments, on the other hand, alternate BFRs and especially dechloranes dominated the contamination pattern. Dabs were still found to be statistically representative for the contamination patterns and relative magnitude in sediments from their respective habitats. Contamination patterns in eels seemed to be more driven by the contamination situation in the food chain or historical contamination of their habitat. Unsuspectedly the alternate flame retardant TBCO was found in comparably high concentrations (up to 12 ng g(-1) ww) in dabs from two sampling stations as well as in sediments from these stations (up to 1.2 ng g(-1) dw). It could not be detected in any other analysed fish or sediment samples, indicating a localised contamination source in the area. This study provides information on HFR contamination patterns and behaviour in both marine and freshwater sediments and their potential role as contamination source for benthic fish.","['Sühring R', 'Busch F', 'Fricke N', 'Kötke D', 'Wolschke H', 'Ebinghaus R']",2016,542,Pt A,Sci Total Environ,"Sühring R, et al.

26506370,Complete Genome and Phylogeny of Puumala Hantavirus Isolates Circulating in France.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. NE incidence presents a high spatial variation throughout France, while the geographical distribution of the wild reservoir of PUUV, the bank vole, is rather continuous. A missing piece of the puzzle is the current distribution and the genetic variation of PUUV in France, which has been overlooked until now and remains poorly understood. During a population survey, from 2008 to 2011, bank voles were trapped in eight different forests of France located in areas known to be endemic for NE or in area from where no NE case has been reported until now. Bank voles were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)G ELISA serology and two seropositive animals for each of three different areas (Ardennes, Jura and Orleans) were then subjected to laboratory analyses in order to sequence the whole S, M and L segments of PUUV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that French PUUV isolates globally belong to the central European (CE) lineage although isolates from Ardennes are clearly distinct from those in Jura and Orleans, suggesting a different evolutionary history and origin of PUUV introduction in France. Sequence analyses revealed specific amino acid signatures along the N protein, including in PUUV from the Orleans region from where NE in humans has never been reported. The relevance of these mutations in term of pathophysiology is discussed.","['Castel G', 'Couteaudier M', 'Sauvage F', 'Pons JB', 'Murri S', 'Plyusnina A', 'Pontier D', 'Cosson JF', 'Plyusnin A', 'Marianneau P', 'Tordo N']",2015,7,10,Viruses,"Castel G, et al.

26503619,Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) and proteinuria predict severity of acute kidney injury in Puumala virus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) that is caused by the Puumala virus. Periodic outbreaks have been described in endemic areas, with a substantial number of previously healthy individuals developing acute kidney injury (AKI). There is a considerable diversity in the clinical course of the disease, and few patients require renal replacement therapy.
METHODS: We tested whether urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (uNGAL), urine albumin/creatinine ratio (uACR), urine protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR), urine dipstick protein, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, leukocyte and platelet count, determined on admission to the hospital, can predict the severity of AKI. Sixty-one patients were analyzed during admission in the emergency department.
RESULTS: The variables most strongly associated with peak plasma creatinine concentration were uNGAL (β = 0.70, p <0.0001), uPCR (β = 0.64, p = 0.001), uACR (β = 0.61, p = 0.002), and dipstick proteinuria (β = 0.34, p = 0.008). The highest AUC-ROC to predict stage 3 AKI according to the acute kidney injury network's (AKIN) classification was seen for uNGAL (0.81, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: uNGAL accurately predicts the severity of AKI in NE. This could help emergency room physicians predict disease severity and allow for initial risk stratification.","['Bunz H', 'Weyrich P', 'Peter A', 'Baumann D', 'Tschritter O', 'Guthoff M', 'Beck R', 'Jahn G', 'Artunc F', 'Häring HU', 'Heyne N', 'Wagner R']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Bunz H, et al.

The virus has been found in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and several other rodent species, and suggested to have zoonotic potential. Thus far, seroepidemiological data on LV infections in humans are scarce. In this study, we aimed to characterize the demographic and geographical distribution of LV-reactive antibodies in Finland, and to investigate its occurrence in patients suspected of having a rodent-borne disease, nephropathia epidemica (NE) caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). Using an immunofluorescence assay (LV strain 145SLG), we screened human sera (n = 1378) and found LV-reactive antibodies in 36% of samples. The probability of possessing LV-reactive antibodies peaked at age of 14 years, suggesting that most infections occur in childhood. The prevalence of LV-reactive antibodies was significantly higher in the urbanized area surrounding Helsinki than in more rural Central Finland. These findings are uncharacteristic of a rodent-borne pathogen, and therefore we consider human-to-human transmission of one or several Ljungan-like viruses as a likely cause for most of the observed antibody responses.","['Jääskeläinen AJ', 'Voutilainen L', 'Lehmusto R', 'Henttonen H', 'Lappalainen M', 'Kallio-Kokko H', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O']",2016,144,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Jääskeläinen AJ, et al.

A unique feature of the Hox loci is the collinearity between the gene position within the cluster and its spatial expression pattern along the body axis. However, the mechanisms that regulate collinear patterns of Hox gene expression remain unclear, especially in higher vertebrates. We recently identified novel histone-free regions (HFRs) that can act as chromatin boundary elements demarcating successive murine Hox genes and help regulate their precise expression domains (Srivastava et al., 2013). In this report, we describe in detail the ChIP-chip analysis strategy associated with the identification of these HFRs.

26468149,"Ectoparasitic chigger mites on large oriental vole (Eothenomys miletus) across southwest, China.","An investigation of chigger mites on the large oriental vole, Eothenomys miletus (Rodentia: Cricetidae), was conducted between 2001 and 2013 at 39 localities across southwest China, and 2463 individuals of the vole hosts were captured and examined, which is a big host sample size. From the body surface of E. miletus, 49,850 individuals of chigger mites were collected, and they were identified as comprising 175 species, 13 genera, and 3 subfamilies in 2 families (Trombiculidae and Leeuwenhoekiidae). The 175 species of chigger mites from such a single rodent species (E. miletus) within a certain region (southwest China) extremely exceeded all the species of chigger mites previously recorded from multiple species of hosts in a wide region or a whole country in some other countries, and this suggests that E. miletus has a great potential to harbor abundant species of chigger mites on its body surface. Of 175 mite species, Leptotrombidium scutellare was the most dominant species, which has been proved as one of the main vectors of scrub typhus and the potential vector of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in China. The patchiness index (m*/m) was used to measure the spatial patterns of the dominant chigger mite species, and all the three dominant mite species (L. scutellare, Leptotrombidium sinicum, and Helenicula simena) showed aggregated distributions among the different host individuals. The coefficient of association (V) was adopted to measure the interspecies interaction between the dominant mite species and a slightly positive association existed between L. scutellare and L. sinicum (V = 0.28, P < 0.01), which implies that these two mite species can co-exist on the same species of the host, E. miletus. The tendency curve of species abundance showed that the number of chigger mite species gradually decreased with the increase of mite individuals, and this revealed that most chigger mite species were rare with very few individuals, but few dominant species had abundant individuals. The species-sample relationship indicated that the number of chigger mite species increased with the increase of the host samples. The results suggest that a big host sample size over a wide realm of geographical regions is needed in the field investigation in order to obtain a true picture of species diversity and species composition.","['Peng PY', 'Guo XG', 'Song WY', 'Hou P', 'Zou YJ', 'Fan R']",2016,115,2,Parasitol Res,"Peng PY, et al.

26378166,CD8low CD100- T Cells Identify a Novel CD8 T Cell Subset Associated with Viral Control during Human Hantaan Virus Infection.,"UNLABELLED: Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause a severe lethal hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in combating HTNV infections. However, the contributions of different CD8(+) T cell subsets to the immune response against viral infection are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel subset of CD8(+) T cells characterized by the CD8(low) CD100(-) phenotype in HFRS patients. The CD8(low) CD100(-) subset accounted for a median of 14.3% of the total CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS, and this percentage subsequently declined in the late phase of infection, whereas this subset was absent in healthy controls. Furthermore, the CD8(low) CD100(-) cells were associated with high activation and expressed high levels of cytolytic effector molecules and exhibited a distinct expression profile of effector CD8(+) T cells (CCR7(+/-) CD45RA(-) CD127(high) CD27(int) CD28(low) CD62L(-)). When stimulated with specific HTNV nucleocapsid protein-derived peptide pools, most responding CD8(+) cells (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] positive and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] positive) were CD8(low) CD100(-) cells. The frequency of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was higher in milder cases than in more severe cases. Importantly, the proportion of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset among CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS was negatively correlated with the HTNV viral load, suggesting that CD8(low) CD100(-) cells may be associated with viral clearance. The contraction of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset in late phase of infection may be related to the consistently high expression levels of PD-1. These results may provide new insights into our understanding of CD8(+) T cell-mediated protective immunity as well as immune homeostasis after HTNV infection in humans.
IMPORTANCE: CD8(+) T cells play important roles in the antiviral immune response. We found that the proportion of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among CD8(+) T cells from HFRS patients was negatively correlated with the HTNV viral load, and the frequency of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among virus-specific CD8(+) T cells was higher in milder HFRS cases than in more severe cases. These results imply a beneficial role for the CD8(low) CD100(-) cell subset in viral control during human HTNV infection.","['Liu B', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Yi J', 'Zhuang R', 'Yu H', 'Yang A', 'Zhang Y', 'Jin B']",2015,89,23,J Virol,"Liu B, et al.

Zibo City is one of the most seriously affected areas in Shandong Province, China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence in Zibo to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we constructed an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for monthly HFRS incidence in Zibo from 2004 to 2013. The ARIMA (3,1,1) × (2,1,1)12 model is reliable with a high validity, which can be used to predict the next year's HFRS incidence in Zibo.

The territory of the Republic of Tatarstan is included into the body of Volga Federal District of the Russian Federation and is located within the boundaries in coniferous taiga and temperate forests, forest-steppe and steppe geographical areas. The endowment of large forests as well as weather and climatic conditions play an important role in the activity and rhythmicity of this natural focal viral infection, the virus carriers of which are mouse-like rodents. The virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae and is a representative of the genus Hantavirus. On the base of the epidemiological and clinical data of State Autonomous Healthcare Institution ""Naberezhno-Chelninskaya Infectious Diseases Hospital"" there was performed the analysis of seasonal and the long-term HFRS morbidity rate from 2008 to 2012 with consideration of age and gender cohorts during the period from 2008 to 2012. There were shown both the seasonal character of the development of infectious disease and its unstable rhythmicity in the long-term dynamics. The most number of cases was observed in the summer-autumn period. 84,32% out of all disease cases were occurred in the male population, adults' morbidity rate was averagely 28 times more than the children's morbidity rate, which was due to the more frequent stay in the foci of the virus circulation. In the long-term dynamics the fever development is indirectly related with the weather and climate conditions of the whole region that influence on biology and the dynamics of rodents' population. So 2010 was differed by anomalously hot summer that led to a significant reduction in the number of the disease cases among the human population of the area.","[""Leont'ev VV""]",2015,94,3,Gig Sanit,Leont'ev VV.

With the rapid growth of web page recommendation, results retrieved based on data mining techniques did not offer higher performance filtering rate because relationships between user profile and queries were not analyzed in an extensive manner. At the same time, existing user profile based prediction in web data mining is not exhaustive in producing personalized result rate. To improve the query result rate on dynamics of user behavior over time, Hamilton Filtered Regime Switching User Query Probability (HFRS-UQP) framework is proposed. HFRS-UQP framework is split into two processes, where filtering and switching are carried out. The data mining based filtering in our research work uses the Hamilton Filtering framework to filter user result based on personalized information on automatic updated profiles through search engine. Maximized result is fetched, that is, filtered out with respect to user behavior profiles. The switching performs accurate filtering updated profiles using regime switching. The updating in profile change (i.e., switches) regime in HFRS-UQP framework identifies the second- and higher-order association of query result on the updated profiles.

26220480,Detection of different South American hantaviruses.,"Hantaviruses are the etiologic agents of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Old World, and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)/Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), in the New World. Serological methods are the most common approach used for laboratory diagnosis of HCPS, however theses methods do not allow the characterization of viral genotypes. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for diagnosis of viral infections, including those caused by hantaviruses, enabling detection of few target sequence copies in the sample. However, most studies proposed methods of PCR with species-specific primers. This study developed a simple and reliable diagnostic system by RT-PCR for different hantavirus detection. Using new primers set, we evaluated human and rodent hantavirus positive samples of various regions from Brazil. Besides, we performed computational analyzes to evaluate the detection of other South American hantaviruses. The diagnostic system by PCR proved to be a sensible and simple assay, allowing amplification of Juquitiba virus, Araraquara virus, Laguna Negra virus, Rio Mamore virus and Jabora virus, beyond of the possibility of the detecting Andes, Anajatuba, Bermejo, Choclo, Cano Delgadito, Lechiguanas, Maciel, Oran, Pergamino and Rio Mearim viruses. The primers sets designed in this study can detect hantaviruses from almost all known genetics lineages in Brazil and from others South America countries and also increases the possibility to detect new hantaviruses. These primers could easily be used both in diagnosis of suspected hantavirus infections in humans and also in studies with animals reservoirs.","['Guterres A', 'de Oliveira RC', 'Fernandes J', 'Schrago CG', 'de Lemos ER']",2015,210,,Virus Res,"Guterres A, et al.

Presently the risk factors predicting severe kidney damage after Puumala virus infection are not well known. The objective of the study was to investigate environmental and individual factors predicting severe kidney damage caused by serologically established Puumala infections. In a nationwide cohort study we investigated all serologically established Puumala infections in Southern Denmark from 1996 to 2012. A total of 184 patients had serologically verified Puumala virus infection. In patients with Puumala virus infections the decrease of platelet counts preceded acute kidney failure. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that recent activities in the forest, platelet counts, and flu-like symptoms predicted estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(²), but not age, gender, fever, nor abdominal pain.

26204892,Evaluation of lipase levels in patients with nephropathia epidemica--no evidence for acute pancreatitis.,"BACKGROUND: The most common causative agent for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Germany is Puumala virus (PUUV) and a high percentage of patients with PUUV infection have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of increased lipase levels and acute pancreatitis during nephropathia epidemica (NE) in 166 patients from Germany.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data during the acute phase of the disease were obtained from medical reports and files from 456 patients during acute hantavirus infection. Patients in whom serum lipase levels were determined during acute course of the disease were included in the study.
RESULTS: Lipase levels at the time of diagnosis were determined in 166 of the 456 NE patients (36%). Of the 166 patients, 25 (15%) had elevated lipase levels at the time of admission to hospital or first contact with general practitioner/nephrologist. In total 7 patients had a threefold increased serum lipase above the normal range. Abdominal pain was not more often present in the group of patients with elevated serum lipase compared to the lipase-negative group (9/25 vs 58/141). Abdominal ultrasound and CT scans revealed no signs of pancreatitis in any of the patients. Patients with elevated serum lipase had higher serum creatinine peak levels (p = 0.03) during the course of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated lipase levels were common in our patient cohort and might reflect a more severe form of NE. NE does not lead to acute pancreatitis.","['Kitterer D', 'Artunc F', 'Segerer S', 'Alscher MD', 'Braun N', 'Latus J']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Kitterer D, et al.

DESIGN: Forty-seven of our recent cohort of 58 NE patients volunteered to be re-examined in order to estimate the burden of hormonal deficiency 4 to 8 years after the acute illness. Two patients had suffered from pituitary haemorrhage, but many others exhibited pituitary oedema during their acute infection. In this study, we searched for symptoms of hormonal deficiency, performed hormonal laboratory screening, and most patients underwent pituitary MRI examination.
RESULTS: The pituitary size had diminished in all patients in whom MRI was performed (P < 0·001). One patient with acute phase haemorrhage had made a complete recovery while the other continued to require hormonal substitution. In addition, hormonal laboratory abnormalities were observed in nine other patients; these being attributable to several reasons, for example independent peripheral hormonal diseases, side effects of medication or other secondary causes such as obesity. None of them had signs of late-onset pituitary insufficiency caused by their previous NE. Health-related quality of life (mean and median 15D score) of patients was comparable to that of age-standardized general population.
CONCLUSIONS: None of our patients had developed obvious late-onset hypopituitarism despite of the fact that pituitary gland can be affected during acute NE. We recommend requesting a history of hantavirus infection whenever the possibility of pituitary dysfunction is suspected at least in patients originating from regions with high NE infection rate.","['Partanen T', 'Koivikko M', 'Leisti P', 'Salmela P', 'Pääkkö E', 'Karttunen A', 'Sintonen H', 'Risteli L', 'Hautala N', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Kauma H', 'Hautala T']",2016,84,1,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),"Partanen T, et al.

CD14, a pattern recognition receptor recognizing lipopolysaccharide, is highly expressed on monocytes and can be shed as soluble CD14 (sCD14) upon monocyte activation. To understand the role of sCD14 in HFRS, the sCD14 plasma concentrations from 45 HFRS patients were quantified, and the relationships between the plasma sCD14 level and the monocyte response status and clinical parameters were analyzed. The plasma sCD14 levels were significantly higher in the HFRS patients and they correlated with monocyte expansion and activation, which were characterized by increased blood monocyte counts, the proportion of CD14(++)CD16(+) intermediate monocytes, as well as elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and soluble CD163 (sCD163) levels. Additionally, the high plasma sCD14 levels positively correlated with white blood cell counts and blood urea nitrogen levels and negatively correlated with platelet counts in the HFRS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that elevated plasma sCD14 levels are associated with the monocyte response status during HTNV infection in humans.","['Tang K', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B', 'Ma Y']",2015,28,8,Viral Immunol,"Tang K, et al.

26196448,Effects of Different Doses of Nucleocapsid Protein from Hantaan Virus A9 Strain on Regulation of Interferon Signaling.,"Hantaan virus A9 strain (HTNV A9) is an etiologic agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China. The virulence of the pathogenic hantaviruses is determined by their ability to alter key signaling pathways of early interferon (IFN) induction within cells. The potential role of HTNV A9 structural proteins, such as nucleocapsid (N) and envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), in regulating human's innate antiviral immune response has not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of HTNV A9 N protein on the regulation of the IFN pathway. We found that A9 N protein can influence the host innate immune response by regulating the activation of IFNβ. The A9 N protein stimulates IFN response in low doses, whereas significantly inhibits IFNβ production at high doses. Furthermore, A9 N protein constitutively inhibits nuclear factor kappa B activation. A high dose of A9 N protein could inhibit either Poly IC-induced IFNβ or vesicular stomatitis virus-induced IFNβ and interferon-stimulated gene production. Our results indicate that HTNV A9 N protein helps virus establish successful infection by downregulating the IFN response and shed new light to the understanding of the interaction between the host innate immunity and virus during Hantaan virus infection.","['Pan W', 'Bian G', 'Wang K', 'Feng T', 'Dai J']",2015,28,8,Viral Immunol,"Pan W, et al.

Chongqing, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, has been experiencing differences in the occurrence of HFRS from 1997 to 2008. The current study was designed to explore the effects of climate and rodent factors on the transmission of HFRS in Chongqing. Data on monthly HFRS cases, rodent strains, and climatic factors were collected from 1997 to 2008. Spatio-temporal analysis indicated that most HFRS cases were clustered in central Chongqing and that the incidence of HFRS decreased from 1997 to 2008. Poisson regression models showed that temperature (with lagged months of 0 and 5) and rainfall (with 2 lagged months) were key climatic factors contributing to the transmission of HFRS. A zero-inflated negative binomial model revealed that rodent density was also significantly associated with the occurrence of HFRS in the Changshou district. The monthly trend in HFRS incidence was positively associated with rodent density and rainfall and negatively associated with temperature.

The numbers of NE cases rose gradually from July to November, with the highest morbidity in adult males. The highest annual disease incidence rate, 64·4 cases/100 000 population, was observed in 1997, with a total of 2431 NE cases registered. NE cases were mostly associated with visiting forests and agricultural activities.

26150428,Smoking is associated with aggravated kidney injury in Puumala hantavirus-induced haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that smoking affects the outcome of some infections and is a risk factor for Puumala virus (PUUV) infection. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of smoking on the clinical severity of PUUV infection and the prevalence of smoking in patients with PUUV infection.
METHODS: A questionnaire on smoking habits was sent to 494 patients in 2012, who had been treated in Tampere University Hospital, Finland, for serologically confirmed PUUV infection during years 1982-2012.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 357 (72%) participated. Maximum plasma creatinine level measured during acute illness was significantly higher in current smokers than in non-smokers (median: 273 versus 184 µmol/L, P < 0.001). Current smokers had a higher maximum blood leucocyte count than non-smokers (median: 10.8 versus 8.9 × 10(9)/L, P < 0.001) and they were younger than non-smokers (38 versus 45 years, P < 0.001). There were no differences between current smokers and non-smokers in the other variables reflecting the severity of PUUV infection. Altogether 51% were current smokers at the time of onset of the illness, 57% of males and 36% of females. During these years in Finland, smoking among males in the same aged population has decreased from 33 to 22% and among females, smoking has varied between 14 and 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is common in patients with PUUV infection. Current smokers suffer from more severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and they have higher leucocyte count than non-smokers in PUUV infection. Smoking cessation decreases the risk of severe AKI to the same level as observed in never-smokers.","['Tervo L', 'Mäkelä S', 'Syrjänen J', 'Huttunen R', 'Rimpelä A', 'Huhtala H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen J']",2015,30,10,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Tervo L, et al.

Both HNPs and HFRs were detected in brain, implying that they are able to surpass the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain, which represents a new finding for some compounds, such as Q1 and PMBPs, MHC-1, TriBHD, TetraBHD, or Dec 603. Moreover, some compounds (TetraBHD, BDE-153, or HBB) presented higher levels in brain than in blubber. This study evidence the high concentrations of HNPs in the marine environment, especially in top predators. It shows the importance of further monitoring these natural compounds and evaluating their potential toxicity, when most studies focus on anthropogenic compounds only. While no bioaccumulation was found for ∑HNPs, ∑HFRs increased significantly with body size for both common and striped dolphins.

Our aim was to evaluate the prognosis of severe AKI associated with PUUV infection.
METHODS: We examined 556 patients who were treated at Tampere University Hospital during 1982-2013 for acute, serologically confirmed PUUV infection. Plasma creatinine was measured during hospitalization, convalescence, and 1, 2, and 5 years after the acute infection.
RESULTS: Plasma creatinine concentration was elevated (>100 μmol/l) in 459 (83%) patients, while altogether 189 patients (34%) had severe AKI defined as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 3, that is, plasma creatinine ≥353.6 μmol/l (4.0 mg/dl) or need of dialysis. There were no fatal cases during the hospitalization or the following 3 months. Fatality rate during the years following PUUV infection did not differ between patients who had suffered from severe AKI versus those without severe AKI. Post-hospitalization plasma creatinine values were available for 188 (34%) patients. One month after the acute infection, patients with prior severe AKI had higher median plasma creatinine concentration (82 µmol/l, range 54-184) than patients without severe AKI (74 µmol/l, range 55-109, p = 0.005). After 1 year, no significant difference existed in median plasma creatinine concentrations between patients with (71 µmol/l, range 36-123) and without prior severe AKI (72 µmol/l, range 34-116, p = 0.711). After 5 years all but 1 patient had normal creatinine levels.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the worldwide well-accepted KDIGO criteria, severe AKI associated with PUUV infection is not associated with excess fatality but has a very good prognosis, both in the short and long terms.","['Outinen TK', 'Mäkelä S', 'Clement J', 'Paakkala A', 'Pörsti I', 'Mustonen J']",2015,130,3,Nephron,"Outinen TK, et al.

Understanding the population dynamics of these viruses and their hosts can provide important insights for epidemiology and virus evolution. Puumala virus (PUUV) is a European hantavirus that may cause regional outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of PUUV circulating in local populations of its rodent reservoir host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) during eight years. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of all three genome segments of PUUV showed strong geographical structuring at a very local scale. There was a high temporal turnover of virus strains in the local bank vole populations, but several virus strains persisted through multiple years. Phylodynamic analyses showed no significant changes in the local effective population sizes of PUUV, although vole numbers and virus prevalence fluctuated widely. Microsatellite data demonstrated also a temporally persisting subdivision between local vole populations, but these groups did not correspond to the subdivision in the virus strains. We conclude that restricted transmission between vole populations and genetic drift play important roles in shaping the genetic structure and temporal dynamics of PUUV in its natural host which has several implications for zoonotic risks of the human population.","['Weber de Melo V', 'Sheikh Ali H', 'Freise J', 'Kühnert D', 'Essbauer S', 'Mertens M', 'Wanka KM', 'Drewes S', 'Ulrich RG', 'Heckel G']",2015,8,6,Evol Appl,"Weber de Melo V, et al.

We aim to study the risk factors associated with NE in this region.
METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study between June 2011 and July 2012. We compared confirmed NE cases with randomly selected controls, matched by age, sex, and place of infection or residence. We analyzed the association between NE and several occupational, environmental, and behavioral exposures using conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: We included in the final analysis 114 cases and 300 controls, forming 246 case-control pairs. Living in a house with an open space beneath, making house repairs, living less than 50 m from the forest, seeing rodents, and smoking were significantly associated with NE.
CONCLUSION: Our results could orient public health policies targeting these risk factors and subsequently reduce the NE burden in the region.","['Gherasim A', 'Hjertqvist M', 'Lundkvist Å', 'Kühlmann-Berenzon S', 'Carlson JV', 'Stenmark S', 'Widerström M', 'Österlund A', 'Boman H', 'Ahlm C', 'Wallensten A']",2015,5,,Infect Ecol Epidemiol,"Gherasim A, et al.

26126854,Haploid Genetic Screen Reveals a Profound and Direct Dependence on Cholesterol for Hantavirus Membrane Fusion.,"UNLABELLED: Hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Old World and a highly fatal hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the New World. No vaccines or antiviral therapies are currently available to prevent or treat hantavirus disease, and gaps in our understanding of how hantaviruses enter cells challenge the search for therapeutics. We performed a haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for entry by Andes virus, a highly virulent New World hantavirus. We found that multiple genes involved in cholesterol sensing, regulation, and biosynthesis, including key components of the sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, are critical for Andes virus entry. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of the membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase/site-1 protease (MBTPS1/S1P), an SREBP control element, dramatically reduced infection by virulent hantaviruses of both the Old World and New World clades but not by rhabdoviruses or alphaviruses, indicating that this pathway is broadly, but selectively, required by hantaviruses. These results could be fully explained as arising from the modest depletion of cellular membrane cholesterol that accompanied S1P disruption. Mechanistic studies of cells and with protein-free liposomes suggested that high levels of cholesterol are specifically needed for hantavirus membrane fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that the profound dependence on target membrane cholesterol is a fundamental, and unusual, biophysical property of hantavirus glycoprotein-membrane interactions during entry.
IMPORTANCE: Although hantaviruses cause important human diseases worldwide, no specific antiviral treatments are available. One of the major obstacles to the development of new therapies is a lack of understanding of how hantaviruses hijack our own host factors to enter cells. Here, we identified multiple cellular genes that control the levels of cholesterol in cellular membranes to be important for hantavirus entry. Our findings suggest that high concentrations of cholesterol in cellular membranes are required at a specific step in the entry process-fusion between viral and cellular membranes-that allows escape of the hantavirus genome into the host cell cytoplasm to initiate infection. Our findings uncover a fundamental feature of the hantavirus infection mechanism and point to cholesterol-lowering drugs as a potential new treatment of hantaviral infections.","['Kleinfelter LM', 'Jangra RK', 'Jae LT', 'Herbert AS', 'Mittler E', 'Stiles KM', 'Wirchnianski AS', 'Kielian M', 'Brummelkamp TR', 'Dye JM', 'Chandran K']",2015,6,4,mBio,"Kleinfelter LM, et al.

26027907,Construction and evaluation of DNA vaccine encoding Hantavirus glycoprotein N-terminal fused with lysosome-associated membrane protein.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviral diseases can have a high case fatality rate within the absence of broadly effective antiviral treatments or vaccines. We developed a DNA vaccine targeting the Hantavirus glycoprotein N-terminal (Gn) to major histocompatibility complex class II compartment by fusing the antigen with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), which altered antigen presenting pathway and activated the CD4+ T cells.
METHODS: The segments of Gn and LAMP1 were cloned into vector pVAX1, and recombinant plasmid was constructed by inserting Gn sequence into LAMP1, between luminal and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains. Subsequently, the protein expression was identified through immunoprecipitation, western blot and Immunofluorescent assay. Adaptive immune responses were assessed by the presence of specific and neutralizing antibodies, interferon (ELISpot results, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity. Epitope mapping was performed to study the T-cell epitopes. Protective immunity in vivo was evaluated using a novel HTNV-challenging model, and safety evaluation was based on histological and behavioral observations.
RESULTS: Native or LAMP1 targeting HTNV Gn was successfully identified. Humoral immune responses were enhanced, featuring with satisfying titers of specific and neutralizing antibody production. The boosted activities of IFN-γ and CTL cytotoxicity witnessed enhanced cellular immune responses. Effective protection against HTNV in vivo was conferred in all three vaccine groups by the challenge model. Safety was confirmed and one dominant T-cell epitope screened from immunized mice overlapped the specific T-cell hot spot in HFRS patients.
CONCLUSION: LAMP1 targeting strategy successfully enhanced the efficacy of HTNV Gn-based vaccine, which is highly immunogenic and safe, showing promise for immunoprophylaxis against HFRS. Further investigations are warranted in the future.","['Jiang DB', 'Sun YJ', 'Cheng LF', 'Zhang GF', 'Dong C', 'Jin BQ', 'Song CJ', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang FL', 'Yang K']",2015,33,29,Vaccine,"Jiang DB, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epizootological and epidemiologic data from 1998 to 2012 were analyzed. During this period in all the types of foci of Atkarsk area (Northern barrens) 13,004 trap-nights were worked off, 2577 small mammals were procured.

To ascertain the hantavirus harbored by the northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus), we initially screened sera from 233 M. rutilus, as well as from 90 M. rufocanus and 110 M. glareolus, captured in western and eastern Siberia during June 2007 to October 2009, for anti-hantaviral antibodies. Thereafter, lung tissues from 44 seropositive voles were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Partial L-, M- and S-segment sequences, detected in M. rutilus and M. rufocanus, were closely related to HOKV, differing from previously published L-, M- and S-segment sequences of HOKV by 17.8-20.2%, 15.9-23.4% and 15.0-17.0% at the nucleotide level and 2.6-7.9%, 1.3-6.3% and 1.2-4.0% at the amino acid level, respectively. Alignment and comparison of hantavirus sequences from M. glareolus trapped in Tyumen Oblast showed very high sequence similarity to the Omsk lineage of PUUV. Phylogenetic analysis, using neighbor-joining, maximal likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that HOKV strains shared a common ancestry with PUUV and exhibited geographic-specific clustering.

SEOV is amongst the Old World hantaviruses which cause haemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. HFRS is characterised by a classical triad of fever, acute kidney injury and haemorrhage, but can show different signs and symptoms in specific cases. SEOV is transmitted from infected rats to humans by inhalation of aerosolised excreta. When compared with the known circulating hantaviruses in the Netherlands, Puumala (PUUV) and Tula (TULV), SEOV causes a more severe form of HFRS. Data from cohort studies undertaken in China and Northern Europe show differences in signs and symptoms at onset of disease, (haemorrhagic) complications and mortality. Furthermore, routine diagnostics currently available for hantavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands are not optimised for SEOV detection. The clinical outcome of an SEOV and PUUV infection will greatly benefit from an early diagnosis which will reduce the costs of unnecessary tests and treatments as well. The discovery of SEOV circulation in the Netherlands follows recent findings of SEOV infections in both rodents and humans in England, Wales, France, Belgium and Sweden, indicating the emerging character of SEOV and a high importance of this hantavirus for Public Health in large areas of Europe.

The method we developed was specific for both HTNV and SEOV without any cross-reaction with other pathogens. We conclude that RT-LAMP assays could be useful for the rapid and direct detection of HTNV and SEOV clinically, and for the epidemiological investigation of HFRS.","['Hu D', 'Hao L', 'Zhang J', 'Yao P', 'Zhang Q', 'Lv H', 'Gong X', 'Pan X', 'Cao M', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Feng Y', 'Wang C']",2015,221,,J Virol Methods,"Hu D, et al.

25888018,Association of low serum TGF-β level in hantavirus infected patients with severe disease.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, an immune-mediated pathogenesis is discussed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-β expression in acute hantavirus infection.
RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30-39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-β1 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-β2 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-β1/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease. Our results support the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in hantavirus infection.","['Sadeghi M', 'Lahdou I', 'Ettinger J', 'Navid MH', 'Daniel V', 'Zeier M', 'Hofmann J', 'Opelz G', 'Schnitzler P']",2015,16,,BMC Immunol,"Sadeghi M, et al.

25875211,"Modeling and predicting hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome trends based on meteorological factors in Hu County, China.","BACKGROUND: Hu County is a serious hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) epidemic area, with notable fluctuation of the HFRS epidemic in recent years. This study aimed to explore the optimal model for HFRS epidemic prediction in Hu.
METHODS: Three models were constructed and compared, including a generalized linear model (GLM), a generalized additive model (GAM), and a principal components regression model (PCRM). The fitting and predictive adjusted R2 of each model were calculated. Ljung-Box Q tests for fitted and predicted residuals of each model were conducted. The study period was stratified into before (1971-1993) and after (1994-2012) vaccine implementation epochs to avoid the confounding factor of vaccination.
RESULTS: The autocorrelation of fitted and predicted residuals of the GAM in the two epochs were not significant (Ljung-Box Q test, P>.05). The adjusted R2 for the predictive abilities of the GLM, GAM, and PCRM were 0.752, 0.799, and 0.665 in the early epoch, and 0.669, 0.756, and 0.574 in the recent epoch. The adjusted R2 values of the three models were lower in the early epoch than in the recent epoch.
CONCLUSIONS: GAM is superior to GLM and PCRM for monthly HFRS case number prediction in Hu County. A shift in model reliability coincident with vaccination implementation demonstrates the importance of vaccination in HFRS control and prevention.","['Xiao D', 'Wu K', 'Tan X', 'Le J', 'Li H', 'Yan Y', 'Xu Z']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Xiao D, et al.

Monthly surveys were conducted from January 2008-December 2009. A total of 1,720 small mammals were captured belonging to the Orders Rodentia [Families, Sciuridae (1 species) and Muridae (7 species)] and Soricomorpha [Family, Soricidae (1species)]. Apodemus agrarius, the primary reservoir for Hantaan virus (HTNV), accounted for 89.9% (1,546) of all small mammals captured, followed by Myodes regulus (4.0%), Crocidura lasiura (3.9%), Micromys minutus (1.4%), Mus musculus (0.3%), Microtus fortis (0.2%), Apodemus peninsulae (0.2%), Tamias sibiricus (0.1%), and Rattus norvegicus (<0.1%). Three species were antibody-positive (Ab+) for hantaviruses: A. agrarius (8.2%), M. minutus (4.2%), and C. lasiura (1.5%). HTNV specific RNA was detected in 93/127 Ab+ A. agrarius, while Imjin virus specific RNA was detected in 1/1 Ab+ C. lasiura. Overall, hantavirus Ab+ rates for A. agrarius increased with weight (age) and were significantly higher among males (10.9%) than females (5.1%) (P<0.0001). High A. agrarius gravid rates during the fall (August-September) were associated with peak numbers of HFRS cases in Korea that followed high gravid rates. From 79 RT-PCR positive A. agrarius, 12 HTNV RNA samples were sequenced and compared phylogenetically based on a 320 nt sequence from the GC glycoprotein-encoding M segment. These results demonstrate that the HTNV isolates from NM-R are distinctly separated from HTNV isolated from the People's Republic of China. These studies provide for improved disease risk assessments that identify military activities, rodent HTNV rates, and other factors associated with the transmission of hantaviruses during field training exercises.","['Klein TA', 'Kim HC', 'Chong ST', 'Kim JA', 'Lee SY', 'Kim WK', 'Nunn PV', 'Song JW']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Klein TA, et al.

The VLPs were purified and used to immunize Kunming mice. Then, polyclonal antibodies were purified from the samples of ascites with a protein G HiTrap SP column and labeled with horseradish peroxidase. A MacELISA method for the detection of IgM antibodies against CHIKV was assembled with goat anti-human IgM antibody, VLP antigens and an enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody. The results were evaluated with a serum panel containing serum samples from laboratory-confirmed CHIK, HFRS patients, healthy donors, and commercially available CHIKV IgM as a quality control. It was shown that the MacELISA had a specificity of 99% (99/100), the coefficients of variation (CoV) within a plate were <10%, and the CoV of different ELISA plates in terms of the plate variation coefficient was <15%. A comparative analysis was performed to compare the current method against a commercial CHIKV IgM antibody detection kit for IIFA-IgM. The detection limit of MacELISA was significantly lower than that of the IIFA-IgM commercial kit (P< 0.0001).

25852676,"Effect of Puumala hantavirus infection on human umbilical vein endothelial cell hemostatic function: platelet interactions, increased tissue factor expression and fibrinolysis regulator release.","Puumala virus (PUUV) infection causes over 5000 cases of hemorrhagic fever in Europe annually and can influence the hemostatic balance extensively. Infection might lead to hemorrhage, while a recent study showed an increased risk of myocardial infarction during or shortly after PUUV infection. The mechanism by which this hantavirus influences the coagulation system remains unknown. Therefore we aimed to elucidate mechanisms explaining alterations seen in primary and secondary hemostasis during PUUV infection. By using low passage PUUV isolates to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) we were able to show alterations in the regulation of primary- and secondary hemostasis and in the release of fibrinolysis regulators. Our main finding was an activation of secondary hemostasis due to increased tissue factor (TF) expression leading to increased thrombin generation in a functional assay. Furthermore, we showed that during infection platelets adhered to HUVEC and subsequently specifically to PUUV virus particles. Infection of HUVEC with PUUV did not result in increased von Willebrand factor while they produced more plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) compared to controls. The PAI-1 produced in this model formed complexes with vitronectin. This is the first report that reveals a potential mechanism behind the pro-coagulant changes in PUUV patients, which could be the result of increased thrombin generation due to an increased TF expression on endothelial cells during infection. Furthermore, we provide insight into the contribution of endothelial cell responses regarding hemostasis in PUUV pathogenesis.","['Goeijenbier M', 'Meijers JC', 'Anfasa F', 'Roose JM', 'van de Weg CA', 'Bakhtiari K', 'Henttonen H', 'Vaheri A', 'Osterhaus AD', 'van Gorp EC', 'Martina BE']",2015,6,,Front Microbiol,"Goeijenbier M, et al.

25836633,Hantaan virus infection induces both Th1 and ThGranzyme B+ cell immune responses that associated with viral control and clinical outcome in humans.,"Hantaviruses infection causing severe emerging diseases with high mortality rates in humans has become public health concern globally. The potential roles of CD4(+)T cells in viral control have been extensively studied. However, the contribution of CD4(+)T cells to the host response against Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection remains unclear. Here, based on the T-cell epitopes mapped on HTNV glycoprotein, we studied the effects and characteristics of CD4(+)T-cell responses in determining the outcome of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. A total of 79 novel 15-mer T-cell epitopes on the HTNV glycoprotein were identified, among which 20 peptides were dominant target epitopes. Importantly, we showed the presence of both effective Th1 responses with polyfunctional cytokine secretion and ThGranzyme B(+) cell responses with cytotoxic mediators production against HTNV infection. The HTNV glycoprotein-specific CD4(+)T-cell responses inversely correlated with the plasma HTNV RNA load in patients. Individuals with milder disease outcomes showed broader epitopes targeted and stronger CD4(+)T-cell responses against HTNV glycoproteins compared with more severe patients. The CD4(+)T cells characterized by broader antigenic repertoire, stronger polyfunctional responses, better expansion capacity and highly differentiated effector memory phenotype(CD27-CD28-CCR7-CD45RA-CD127(hi)) would elicit greater defense against HTNV infection and lead to much milder outcome of the disease. The host defense mediated by CD4(+)T cells may through the inducing antiviral condition of the host cells and cytotoxic effect of ThGranzyme B+ cells. Thus, these findings highlight the efforts of CD4(+)T-cell immunity to HTNV control and provide crucial information to better understand the immune defense against HTNV infection.","['Ma Y', 'Yuan B', 'Zhuang R', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu B', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu H', 'Yi J', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2015,11,4,PLoS Pathog,"Ma Y, et al.

This scavenger receptor is reported to dampen the inflammatory response, and high plasma levels of sCD163, which are thought to reflect the total level of CD163 expression, may predict the severity of disease. To understand the role of sCD163 in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) better, the concentrations of sCD163 in plasma from 66 patients were quantified, and the relationships between sCD163 level and disease course, severity, and clinical parameters were analyzed. The level of plasma sCD163 in HFRS patients was elevated from fever onset and during the course of the disease, and it peaked in the oliguria stage at 874.5 (549.9-1138.0) ng/mL compared with controls at 192.8 (54.9-282.1) ng/mL. The correlations between plasma sCD163 and renal dysfunction suggest that sCD163 may play an important role in the development of acute renal failure in patients infected with Hantaan virus.","['Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhuang R', 'Liu B', 'Yi J', 'Jin B']",2015,28,4,Viral Immunol,"Zhang Y, et al.

25734100,Endothelial activation and repair during hantavirus infection: association with disease outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial activation and dysfunction play a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Hantaviral disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever and is characterized by capillary dysfunction, although the underlying mechanisms for hantaviral disease are not fully elucidated.
METHODS: The temporal course of endothelial activation and repair were analyzed during Puumala hantavirus infection and associated with disease outcome and a marker for hypoxia, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1). The following endothelial activation markers were studied: endothelial glycocalyx degradation (syndecan-1) and leukocyte adhesion molecules (soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and endothelial selectin). Cytokines associated with vascular repair were also analyzed (vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, angiopoietin, and stromal cell-derived factor 1).
RESULTS: Most of the markers we studied were highest during the earliest phase of hantaviral disease and associated with clinical and laboratory surrogate markers for disease outcome. In particular, the marker for glycocalyx degradation, syndecan-1, was significantly associated with levels of thrombocytes, albumin, IGFBP-1, decreased blood pressure, and disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Hantaviral disease outcome was associated with endothelial dysfunction. Consequently, the endothelium warrants further investigation when designing future medical interventions.","['Connolly-Andersen AM', 'Thunberg T', 'Ahlm C']",2014,1,1,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Connolly-Andersen AM, et al.

HFRS is caused by hantaviruses, mainly Seoul virus in urban areas and Hantaan virus in agricultural areas. Although preventive measures including vaccination programs and rodent control measures have resulted in a decline in cases in recent years, there has been an increase in incidence in some areas and new endemic areas have emerged. This review summarises the recent literature relating to the effects of climatic factors on the incidence of HFRS in China and discusses future research directions. Temperature, precipitation and humidity affect crop yields, rodent breeding patterns and disease transmission, and these can be influenced by a changing climate. Detailed surveillance of infections caused by Hantaan and Seoul viruses and further research on the viral agents will aid in interpretation of spatiotemporal patterns and a better understanding of the environmental and ecological drivers of HFRS amid China's rapidly urbanising landscape and changing climate.","['Hansen A', 'Cameron S', 'Liu Q', 'Sun Y', 'Weinstein P', 'Williams C', 'Han GS', 'Bi P']",2015,33,,Int J Infect Dis,"Hansen A, et al.

25701819,Life-long shedding of Puumala hantavirus in wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus).,"The knowledge of viral shedding patterns and viraemia in the reservoir host species is a key factor in assessing the human risk of zoonotic viruses. The shedding of hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) by their host rodents has widely been studied experimentally, but rarely in natural settings. Here we present the dynamics of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) shedding and viraemia in naturally infected wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In a monthly capture-mark-recapture study, we analysed 18 bank voles for the presence and relative quantity of PUUV RNA in the excreta and blood from 2 months before up to 8 months after seroconversion. The proportion of animals shedding PUUV RNA in saliva, urine and faeces peaked during the first month after seroconversion, but continued throughout the study period with only a slight decline. The quantity of shed PUUV in reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) positive excreta was constant over time. In blood, PUUV RNA was present for up to 7 months but both the probability of viraemia and the virus load declined with time. Our findings contradict the current view of a decline in virus shedding after the acute phase and a short viraemic period in hantavirus infection - an assumption widely adopted in current epidemiological models. We suggest the life-long shedding as a means of hantaviruses to survive over host population bottlenecks, and to disperse in fragmented habitats where local host and/or virus populations face temporary extinctions. Our results indicate that the kinetics of pathogens in wild hosts may differ considerably from those observed in laboratory settings.","['Voutilainen L', 'Sironen T', 'Tonteri E', 'Bäck AT', 'Razzauti M', 'Karlsson M', 'Wahlström M', 'Niemimaa J', 'Henttonen H', 'Lundkvist Å']",2015,96,Pt 6,J Gen Virol,"Voutilainen L, et al.

The current outbreak has centered in West Africa and affected over 15,000 individuals. EVD is transmitted by direct contact with blood or other infectious bodily fluid, and as such, numerous heath care workers caring for patients with EVD have become infected. During the current outbreak, a number of patients have received advanced supportive care for EVD in Europe and North America and therefore survived. Now, many hospitals in Europe and North America are planning to accept care for patients with EVD. In this review, we discussed the key issues related to the planning and delivery of advanced supportive care in patients with EVD with a focus on the factors necessary to provide renal replacement therapy (RRT). Since success in the treatment of patients with EVD rests on both patient outcome and prevention of transmission of disease to health care workers, we extensively discussed the modes of Ebola virus transmission and recommended protocols to protect health care workers. Experience now indicates that with appropriate planning and protocols, it is possible to successfully treat EVD patients with advanced supportive care (mechanical ventilation and RRT) while avoiding transmission to health care providers.

We found that in groups with HPS who were treated with ribavirin, there was no significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.60-1.61, I(2) = 0 %). On the other hand, for animal group with HPS-like disease, there was significant increase in survival (RR 0.05, 95 % CI 0.01-0.34, I(2) = 0 %).

Similarly, for humans with HFRS treated, there was increase in survival (RR 0.28, 95 % CI 0.08-1), although only a study exist.

METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective survey of 456 adults with serologically confirmed NE was performed.
RESULTS: PCT levels at the time of diagnosis were available for 43 out of 456 patients, and in 24 of these patients (56%) PCT levels were elevated (""PCT positive""). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at admission to hospital and peak CRP levels during the acute course of the disease were higher in the PCT-positive compared with the PCT-negative group (p<0.05). Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) (RIFLE I and F) was present in similar numbers of PCT-positive and -negative patients (p=0.7), but antibiotics were more frequently used in the PCT-positive than the PCT-negative group (p<0.05). Within the PCT-positive group, PCT levels were similar among those receiving and not receiving antibiotics (p=0.13), and neither the duration of hospital stay nor CRP peak levels were lower in those treated with antibiotics (p=0.12 and p=0.13, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated PCT levels are common in patients with acute NE. There was no association between PCT levels and severity of disease, including AKI or thrombocytopenia. It is important to distinguish Puumala virus infection from other causes of AKI with thrombocytopenia. However, PCT might not be useful in differentiating hantavirus infection from bacterial infection.","['Latus J', 'Kitterer D', 'Segerer S', 'Artunc F', 'Alscher MD', 'Braun N']",2015,40,1,Kidney Blood Press Res,"Latus J, et al.

25658420,IL-33/ST2 correlates with severity of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and regulates the inflammatory response in Hantaan virus-infected endothelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) causes a severe lethal haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Despite a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of HFRS, the importance of the abundant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been widely recognized. Interleukin 33 (IL-33) has been demonstrated to play an important role in physiological and pathological immune responses. After binding to its receptor ST2L, IL-33 stimulates the Th2-type immune response and promotes cytokine production. Depending on the disease model, IL-33 either protects against infection or exacerbates inflammatory disease, but it is unknown how the IL-33/ST2 axis regulates the immune response during HTNV infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood samples were collected from 23 hospitalized patients and 28 healthy controls. The levels of IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) in plasma were quantified by ELISA, and the relationship between IL-33, sST2 and the disease severity was analyzed. The role of IL-33/sST2 axis in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was studied on HTNV-infected endothelial cells. The results showed that the plasma IL-33 and sST2 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. Spearman analysis showed that elevated IL-33 and sST2 levels were positively correlated with white blood cell count and viral load, while negatively correlated with platelet count. Furthermore, we found that IL-33 enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HTNV-infected endothelial cells through NF-κB pathway and that this process was inhibited by the recombinant sST2.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the IL-33 acts as an initiator of the ""cytokine storm"" during HTNV infection, while sST2 can inhibit this process. Our findings could provide a promising immunotherapeutic target for the disease control.","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhuang R', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yi J', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2015,9,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang Y, et al.

25647584,Elevated serum levels of decoy receptor 3 are associated with disease severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral infectious disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal failure. HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.","['Dong Y', 'Shi D', 'Li M', 'Dai P', 'Wang X', 'Xie M']",2015,10,5,Intern Emerg Med,"Dong Y, et al.

Many of these pathogens, including Rickettsia typhi, Bartonella spp., and Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), are thought to be endemic in rat populations worldwide; however, past field research has found these organisms to be absent in certain rat populations. Rats (Rattus spp.) from an inner city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, were tested for exposure to and/or infection with SEOV and R. typhi (using serology and PCR), as well as Bartonella spp. (using culture and sequencing). Approximately 25% of 404 rats tested were infected with Bartonella tribocorum, which demonstrated significant geographic clustering within the study area. Infection was associated with both season and sexual maturity. Seroreactivity against R. typhi and SEOV was observed in 0.36% and 1.45% of 553 rats tested, respectively, although PCR screening results for these pathogens were negative, suggesting that they are not endemic in the study population. Overall, these results suggest that the geographic distribution of rat-associated zoonoses, including R. typhi, SEOV, and Bartonella spp., is less ubiquitous than previously appreciated, and is likely dependent on patterns of dispersion and establishment of the rat reservoir host. Further study on global and local Rattus spp. population structures may help to elucidate the ecology of zoonotic organisms in these species.","['Himsworth CG', 'Bai Y', 'Kosoy MY', 'Wood H', 'DiBernardo A', 'Lindsay R', 'Bidulka J', 'Tang P', 'Jardine C', 'Patrick D']",2015,15,1,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Himsworth CG, et al.

25609306,The association between hantavirus infection and selenium deficiency in mainland China.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantaviruses and transmitted by rodents is a significant public health problem in China, and occurs more frequently in selenium-deficient regions. To study the role of selenium concentration in HFRS incidence we used a multidisciplinary approach combining ecological analysis with preliminary experimental data. The incidence of HFRS in humans was about six times higher in severe selenium-deficient and double in moderate deficient areas compared to non-deficient areas. This association became statistically stronger after correction for other significant environment-related factors (low elevation, few grasslands, or an abundance of forests) and was independent of geographical scale by separate analyses for different climate regions. A case-control study of HFRS patients admitted to the hospital revealed increased activity and plasma levels of selenium binding proteins while selenium supplementation in vitro decreased viral replication in an endothelial cell model after infection with a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). Viral replication with a higher MOI was not affected by selenium supplementation. Our findings indicate that selenium deficiency may contribute to an increased prevalence of hantavirus infections in both humans and rodents. Future studies are needed to further examine the exact mechanism behind this observation before selenium supplementation in deficient areas could be implemented for HFRS prevention.","['Fang LQ', 'Goeijenbier M', 'Zuo SQ', 'Wang LP', 'Liang S', 'Klein SL', 'Li XL', 'Liu K', 'Liang L', 'Gong P', 'Glass GE', 'van Gorp E', 'Richardus JH', 'Ma JQ', 'Cao WC', 'de Vlas SJ']",2015,7,1,Viruses,"Fang LQ, et al.

25557350,Climate Variability and the Occurrence of Human Puumala Hantavirus Infections in Europe: A Systematic Review.,"Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are transmitted by rodents. In Europe, the infection usually manifests as a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) known as nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is triggered by the virus species Puumala. Its host is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). In the context of climate change, interest in the role of climatic factors for the disease has increased. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between climate variability and the occurrence of human Puumala hantavirus infections in Europe. We performed a literature search in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. Studies that investigated Puumala virus infection and climatic factors in any European country with a minimum collection period of 2 years were included. The selection of abstracts and the evaluation of included studies were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 434 titles were identified in the databases, of which nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in central Europe (Belgium, France and Germany), while only two came from the north (Sweden) and one from the south (Bosnia). Strong evidence was found for a positive association between temperature and NE incidence in central Europe, while the evidence for northern Europe so far appears insufficient. Results regarding precipitation were contradictory. Overall, the complex relationships between climate and hantavirus infections need further exploration to identify specific health risks and initiate appropriate intervention measures in the context of climate change.","['Roda Gracia J', 'Schumann B', 'Seidler A']",2015,62,6,Zoonoses Public Health,"Roda Gracia J, et al.

25543297,Complete genome of a Puumala virus strain from Central Europe.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is one of the predominant hantavirus species in Europe causing mild to moderate cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Parts of Lower Saxony in north-western Germany are endemic for PUUV infections. In this study, the complete PUUV genome sequence of a bank vole-derived tissue sample from the 2007 outbreak was determined by a combined primer-walking and RNA ligation strategy. The S, M and L genome segments were 1,828, 3,680 and 6,550 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sliding-window analyses of the nucleotide sequences of all available complete PUUV genomes indicated a non-homogenous distribution of variability with hypervariable regions located at the 3'-ends of the S and M segments. The overall similarity of the coding genome regions to the other PUUV strains ranged between 80.1 and 84.7 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence and between 89.5 and 98.1 % for the deduced amino acid sequences. In comparison to the phylogenetic trees of the complete coding sequences, trees based on partial segments revealed a general drop in phylogenetic support and a lower resolution. The Astrup strain S and M segment sequences showed the highest similarity to sequences of strains from geographically close sites in the Osnabrück Hills region. In conclusion, a primer-walking-mediated strategy resulted in the determination of the first complete nucleotide sequence of a PUUV strain from Central Europe. Different levels of variability along the genome provide the opportunity to choose regions for analyses according to the particular research question, e.g., large-scale phylogenetics or within-host evolution.","['Ali HS', 'Drewes S', 'Weber de Melo V', 'Schlegel M', 'Freise J', 'Groschup MH', 'Heckel G', 'Ulrich RG']",2015,50,2,Virus Genes,"Ali HS, et al.

25534190,Severe Ebola virus disease with vascular leakage and multiorgan failure: treatment of a patient in intensive care.,"BACKGROUND: In the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease in western Africa, many aid workers have become infected. Some of these aid workers have been transferred to specialised hospitals in Europe and the USA for intensified treatment, providing the potential for unique insight into the clinical course of Ebola virus disease under optimised supportive measures in isolation units.
METHODS: A 38-year-old male doctor who had contracted an Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone was airlifted to University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, on day 5 after disease onset. Within 72 h of admission to the hospital's high-level isolation unit, the patient developed signs of severe multiorgan failure, including lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In addition to clinical parameters, the diagnostic work-up included radiography, ultrasound, pulse contour cardiac output technology, and microbiological and clinical chemistry analyses. Respiratory failure with pulmonary oedema and biophysical evidence of vascular leak syndrome needed mechanical ventilation. The patient received a 3 day treatment course with FX06 (MChE-F4Pharma, Vienna, Austria), a fibrin-derived peptide under clinical development for vascular leak syndrome. After FX06 administration and concurrent detection of Ebola-virus-specific antibodies and a fall in viral load, vascular leak syndrome and respiratory parameters substantially improved. We gave broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy and the patient needed intermittent renal replacement therapy. The patient fully recovered.
FINDINGS: This case report shows the feasibility of delivery of successful intensive care therapy to patients with Ebola virus disease under biosafety level 4 conditions.
INTERPRETATION: The effective treatment of vascular leakage and multiorgan failure by combination of ventilatory support, antibiotic treatment, and renal replacement therapy can sustain a patient with severe Ebola virus disease until virological remission. FX06 could potentially be a valuable agent in contribution to supportive therapy.

Although HFRS is endemic in Bulgaria, genome sequences of hantaviruses have never been detected in wild rodents. To identify rodent reservoirs, a total of 691 rodents from three endemic regions were trapped in 2011-2012 and screened by TaqMan RT-PCR for detection of hantaviral genomic RNA. Partial small (S) and/or large (L)-segment sequences were recovered from six Apodemus mice: five of the species A. flavicollis and one A. agrarius. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all recovered sequences belonged to DOBV. On the phylogenetic trees, the novel Bulgarian hantavirus sequences clustered together with sequences of established previously DOBV variants recovered from Bulgarian HFRS patients and also with variants found in wild rodents trapped in Slovenia, Greece, and Slovakia. One of the novel Bulgarian DOBV S-sequences from A. agrarius was related closely to DOBV sequences recovered from A. flavicollis, suggesting a spillover of DOBV from its natural host to A. agrarius mice. The results of this study confirmed the circulation of DOBV in wild rodents in Bulgaria. The complexity of the epidemiological situation in the Balkans requires further studies of hantaviruses in rodent hosts and human HFRS cases.","['Christova I', 'Plyusnina A', 'Gladnishka T', 'Kalvatchev N', 'Trifonova I', 'Dimitrov H', 'Mitkovska V', 'Mohareb E', 'Plyusnin A']",2015,87,2,J Med Virol,"Christova I, et al.

25461845,Hantaan virus can infect human keratinocytes and activate an interferon response through the nuclear translocation of IRF-3.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a rodent-borne virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and can be transmitted to humans through bites or the inhalation of aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Keratinocytes predominate in the epidermis and reportedly serve as a replication site for multiple vector-borne viruses, little is known about the susceptibility of human skin cells to HTNV infection. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether human keratinocytes support HTNV replication and elicit an immune response against HTNV infection. We found that a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, supports HTNV replication. In addition, retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA5) play key roles in the detection of HTNV infection in HaCaT cells and in the up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-β expression, which subsequently leads to the production of a large amount of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other chemokines used for immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, we suggest that interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, as opposed to NF-κB/p65 or IRF-7, is translocated to the nucleus to induce IFN-β. However, the early induction of chemokine CXCL10 was a direct result of HaCaT cells counteracting HTNV infection and was not due to the induction of IFN. Overall, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the permissiveness of human keratinocytes to HTNV infection.","['Ye W', 'Xu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Dong Y', 'Xi Q', 'Cao M', 'Yu L', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng L', 'Wu X', 'Xu Z', 'Lei Y', 'Zhang F']",2015,29,,Infect Genet Evol,"Ye W, et al.

On the other hand, consumption of specific food items (mainly lamb/mutton and margarine) correlated significantly with more than two HFR serum concentrations, while this was not the case for household factors (electronic appliances). Only the significant bivariate associations with diet were confirmed by multivariate linear regression analyses, which might indicate a higher contribution from food compared to the indoor environment to the variation of the body burden of these HFRs.","['Cequier E', 'Marcé RM', 'Becher G', 'Thomsen C']",2015,74,,Environ Int,"Cequier E, et al.

Rodent hosts of Hantavirus are present in restricted areas in France; consequently, there are ecological niches and microepidemics of human Hantavirus infections. A HFRS case was diagnosed in the Paris region. The 11-year-old child had an acute debut fever-persistent despite antipyretic medication-asthenia, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, as well as renal failure with proteinuria. The diagnosis was made with a relevant clinical history and the specific serology of Puumala hantavirus. Therefore, a kidney biopsy was not necessary. What was interesting was the diagnostic approach because of the difference between the place and time of contamination and where the child became ill and developed the symptoms. The child was infected by Puumala hantavirus in Les Ardennes, a high-risk area, but became ill in the Paris region, an area with no prevalence. We review Hantavirus infections in France and its differential diagnosis.","['Dandolo A', 'Prajs N', 'Lizop M']",2014,21,12,Arch Pediatr,"Dandolo A, et al. [Nephropathy due to Puumala hantavirus].

25412359,NK cell activation in human hantavirus infection explained by virus-induced IL-15/IL15Rα expression.,"Clinical infection with hantaviruses cause two severe acute diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). These diseases are characterized by strong immune activation, increased vascular permeability, and up to 50% case-fatality rates. One prominent feature observed in clinical hantavirus infection is rapid expansion of natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood of affected individuals. We here describe an unusually high state of activation of such expanding NK cells in the acute phase of clinical Puumala hantavirus infection. Expanding NK cells expressed markedly increased levels of activating NK cell receptors and cytotoxic effector molecules. In search for possible mechanisms behind this NK cell activation, we observed virus-induced IL-15 and IL-15Rα on infected endothelial and epithelial cells. Hantavirus-infected cells were shown to strongly activate NK cells in a cell-cell contact-dependent way, and this response was blocked with anti-IL-15 antibodies. Surprisingly, the strength of the IL-15-dependent NK cell response was such that it led to killing of uninfected endothelial cells despite expression of normal levels of HLA class I. In contrast, hantavirus-infected cells were resistant to NK cell lysis, due to a combination of virus-induced increase in HLA class I expression levels and hantavirus-mediated inhibition of apoptosis induction. In summary, we here describe a possible mechanism explaining the massive NK cell activation and proliferation observed in HFRS patients caused by Puumala hantavirus infection. The results add further insights into mechanisms behind the immunopathogenesis of hantavirus infections in humans and identify new possible targets for intervention.","['Braun M', 'Björkström NK', 'Gupta S', 'Sundström K', 'Ahlm C', 'Klingström J', 'Ljunggren HG']",2014,10,11,PLoS Pathog,"Braun M, et al.

In China, HFRS has been recognized as a severe public health problem with 90% of the total reported cases in the world. This study describes the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS cases in China and identifies the regions, time, and populations at highest risk, which could help the planning and implementation of key preventative measures.
METHODS: Data on all reported HFRS cases at the county level from January 2005 to December 2012 were collected from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Geographic Information System-based spatiotemporal analyses including Local Indicators of Spatial Association and Kulldorff's space-time scan statistic were performed to detect local high-risk space-time clusters of HFRS in China. In addition, cases from high-risk and low-risk counties were compared to identify significant demographic differences.
RESULTS: A total of 100,868 cases were reported during 2005-2012 in mainland China. There were significant variations in the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS. HFRS cases occurred most frequently in June, November, and December. There was a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of HFRS incidence during the study periods, with Moran's I values ranging from 0.46 to 0.56 (P<0.05). Several distinct HFRS cluster areas were identified, mainly concentrated in northeastern, central, and eastern of China. Compared with cases from low-risk areas, a higher proportion of cases were younger, non-farmer, and floating residents in high-risk counties.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified significant space-time clusters of HFRS in China during 2005-2012 indicating that preventative strategies for HFRS should be particularly focused on the northeastern, central, and eastern of China to achieve the most cost-effective outcomes.","['Zhang WY', 'Wang LY', 'Liu YX', 'Yin WW', 'Hu WB', 'Magalhaes RJ', 'Ding F', 'Sun HL', 'Zhou H', 'Li SL', 'Haque U', 'Tong SL', 'Glass GE', 'Bi P', 'Clements AC', 'Liu QY', 'Li CY']",2014,8,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang WY, et al.

25406549,[Clinical characteristics of pediatric hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of pediatric hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and to improve its understanding so as to reduce the misdiagnosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 26 children with HFRS between January 2009 and December 2012.
RESULTS: The age of disease onset was mainly distributed between 7 and 14 years (23 cases, 88%), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.89:l. The clinical manifestations of pediatric HFRS varied. The early symptoms resembled those of a cold, and in the course of HFRS, most patients developed digestive symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain. The laboratory examinations usually implicated platelet changes, and the imaging examinations revealed polyserous effusions. The prominent complication was myocardial injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HFRS mainly occurs in school-age children, more commonly in males. HFRS does not have typical clinical manifestations or symptoms, so it should be distinguished from cold or appendicitis at the early stage.

25392926,Elevated soluble CD163 plasma levels are associated with disease severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus is a major zoonotic pathogen that causesing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Although HFRS pathogenesis has not been entirely elucidated, the importance of host-related immune responses in HFRS pathogenesis has been widely recognized. CD163, a monocyte and macrophage-specific scavenger receptor that plays a vital function in the hosts can reduce inflammation, is shed during activation as soluble CD163 (sCD163). The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological significance of sCD163 in patients with HFRS.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 81 hospitalized patients in Tangdu Hospital from October 2011 to January 2014 and from 15 healthy controls. The sCD163 plasma levels were measured using a sandwich ELISA, and the relationship between sCD163 and disease severity was analyzed. Furthermore, CD163 expression in 3 monocytes subset was analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that sCD163 plasma levels during the HFRS acute phase were significantly higher in patients than during the convalescent stage and the levels in the healthy controls (P<0.0001). The sCD163 plasma levels in the severe/critical group were higher than those in the mild/moderate group during the acute (P<0.0001). A Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the sCD163 levels were positively correlated with white blood cell, serum creatine, blood urea nitrogen levels, while they were negatively correlated with blood platelet levels in the HFRS patients. The monocyte subsets were significantly altered during the acute stage. Though the CD163 expression levels within the monocyte subsets were increased during the acute stage, the highest CD163 expression level was observed in the CD14++CD16+ monocytes when compared with the other monocyte subsets.
CONCLUSION: sCD163 may be correlated with disease severity and the disease progression in HFRS patients; however, the underlying mechanisms should be explored further.","['Wang J', 'Guo W', 'Du H', 'Yu H', 'Jiang W', 'Zhu T', 'Bai X', 'Wang P']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Wang J, et al.

25391132,The importance of bank vole density and rainy winters in predicting nephropathia epidemica incidence in Northern Sweden.,"Pathogenic hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are rodent-borne viruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In Europe, there are more than 10,000 yearly cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus (PUUV). The common and widely distributed bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the host of PUUV. In this study, we aim to explain and predict NE incidence in boreal Sweden using bank vole densities. We tested whether the number of rainy days in winter contributed to variation in NE incidence. We forecast NE incidence in July 2013-June 2014 using projected autumn vole density, and then considering two climatic scenarios: 1) rain-free winter and 2) winter with many rainy days. Autumn vole density was a strong explanatory variable of NE incidence in boreal Sweden in 1990-2012 (R2 = 79%, p<0.001). Adding the number of rainy winter days improved the model (R2 = 84%, p<0.05). We report for the first time that risk of NE is higher in winters with many rainy days. Rain on snow and ground icing may block vole access to subnivean space. Seeking refuge from adverse conditions and shelter from predators, voles may infest buildings, increasing infection risk. In a rainy winter scenario, we predicted 812 NE cases in boreal Sweden, triple the number of cases predicted in a rain-free winter in 2013/2014. Our model enables identification of high risk years when preparedness in the public health sector is crucial, as a rainy winter would accentuate risk.","['Khalil H', 'Olsson G', 'Ecke F', 'Evander M', 'Hjertqvist M', 'Magnusson M', 'Löfvenius MO', 'Hörnfeldt B']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Khalil H, et al.

25388133,Leptospirosis in humans.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread and potentially fatal zoonosis that is endemic in many tropical regions and causes large epidemics after heavy rainfall and flooding. Infection results from direct or indirect exposure to infected reservoir host animals that carry the pathogen in their renal tubules and shed pathogenic leptospires in their urine. Although many wild and domestic animals can serve as reservoir hosts, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is the most important source of human infections. Individuals living in urban slum environments characterized by inadequate sanitation and poor housing are at high risk of rat exposure and leptospirosis. The global burden of leptospirosis is expected to rise with demographic shifts that favor increases in the number of urban poor in tropical regions subject to worsening storms and urban flooding due to climate change. Data emerging from prospective surveillance studies suggest that most human leptospiral infections in endemic areas are mild or asymptomatic. Development of more severe outcomes likely depends on three factors: epidemiological conditions, host susceptibility, and pathogen virulence (Fig. 1). Mortality increases with age, particularly in patients older than 60 years of age. High levels of bacteremia are associated with poor clinical outcomes and, based on animal model and in vitro studies, are related in part to poor recognition of leptospiral LPS by human TLR4. Patients with severe leptospirosis experience a cytokine storm characterized by high levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Patients with the HLA DQ6 allele are at higher risk of disease, suggesting a role for lymphocyte stimulation by a leptospiral superantigen. Leptospirosis typically presents as a nonspecific, acute febrile illness characterized by fever, myalgia, and headache and may be confused with other entities such as influenza and dengue fever. Newer diagnostic methods facilitate early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. Patients progressing to multisystem organ failure have widespread hematogenous dissemination of pathogens. Nonoliguric (high output) renal dysfunction should be supported with fluids and electrolytes. When oliguric renal failure occurs, prompt initiation of dialysis can be life saving. Elevated bilirubin levels are due to hepatocellular damage and disruption of intercellular junctions between hepatocytes, resulting in leaking of bilirubin out of bile caniliculi. Hemorrhagic complications are common and are associated with coagulation abnormalities. Severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome due to extensive alveolar hemorrhage has a fatality rate of >50 %.

25313168,Acute kidney injury and tools for risk-stratification in 456 patients with hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most common species of hantavirus in Central Europe. Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by PUUV, is characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombocytopenia. The major goals of this study were to provide a clear clinical phenotyping of AKI in patients with NE and to develop an easy prediction rule to identify patients, who are at lower risk to develop severe AKI.
METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective survey of 456 adult patients with serologically confirmed NE was performed. Data were collected from medical records and prospectively at follow-up visit. Severe AKI was defined by standard criteria according to the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease) classification. Fuller statistical models were developed and validated to estimate the probability for severe AKI.
RESULTS: During acute NE, 88% of the patients had AKI according to the RILFE criteria during acute NE. A risk index score for severe AKI was derived by using three independent risk factors in patients with normal kidney function at time of diagnosis: thrombocytopenia [two points; odds ratios (OR): 3.77; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.82, 8.03], elevated C-reactive protein levels (one point; OR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.42, 6.58) and proteinuria (one point; OR: 3.92; 95% CI: 1.33, 13.35). On the basis of a point score of one or two, the probability of severe AKI was 0.18 and 0.28 with an area under the curve of 0.71.

This was a rare event, but it is important to learn about this class of viruses and to be aware of the hazards while working in the field in close contact with wild animals. The virus termed Puumala belongs to the genus Hanta from the Bunyaviridae family. The natural reservoir is rodents, mice, rats and Bank Votes for the Puuamala strain. The disease is termed HFRS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome), is prevalent in Asia and Europe, affecting 200,000 people a year, with 5-15% percent mortality (although in Finland mortality rate is 0.1%). The New World strains cause HPS (hemorrhagic pulmonary syndrome) affecting 200 people a year with 40% mortality. Virus is present in all rodents excretions, and route of infection is by aerosols, hand to mucus membranes contamination, by rodents bites and by contaminated food or water.

Exactly the same conclusion, using the same IFA screening technique, resulted from a 1994 serosurvey in the same country, and in 627 clinical cases plus 100 healthy controls. SEOV-positive study subjects were also mainly farmers with heavy rat-exposure, but residing in Northern-Ireland, a region where all other known rodent reservoirs for pathogenic hantaviruses are known to be absent, except the wild rat. A rodent capture action in and around the farms of eight seropositives confirmed SEOV seropositivity in 21.6% of 51 rats. All SEOV seropositives were patients, hospitalized with an acute feverish condition, a majority of which having the clinical picture of hantavirus-induced nephropathy, known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Leptospirosis, often mimicking perfectly HFRS, was serologically excluded. Thus, SEOV was established as a human hantaviral pathogen in the UK and in Europe 20 years ago.","['Clement J', 'McKenna P', 'Vergote V', 'Van Ranst M']",2014,6,9,Viruses,"Clement J, et al.

25243411,Novel camelid antibody fragments targeting recombinant nucleoprotein of Araucaria hantavirus: a prototype for an early diagnosis of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome.,"In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids produce immunoglobulins G composed exclusively of heavy chains in which the antigen binding site is formed only by single domains called VHH. Their particular characteristics make VHHs interesting tools for drug-delivery, passive immunotherapy and high-throughput diagnosis. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Two clinical forms of the infection are known. Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is present in the Old World, while Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is found on the American continent. There is no specific treatment for HPS and its diagnosis is carried out by molecular or serological techniques, using mainly monoclonal antibodies or hantavirus nucleoprotein (N) to detect IgM and IgG in patient serum. This study proposes the use of camelid VHHs to develop alternative methods for diagnosing and confirming HPS. Phage display technology was employed to obtain VHHs. After immunizing one Lama glama against the recombinant N protein (prNΔ₈₅) of a Brazilian hantavirus strain, VHH regions were isolated to construct an immune library. VHHs were displayed fused to the M13KO7 phage coat protein III and the selection steps were performed on immobilized prNΔ₈₅. After selection, eighty clones recognized specifically the N protein. These were sequenced, grouped based mainly on the CDRs, and five clones were analyzed by western blot (WB), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) device, and ELISA. Besides the ability to recognize prNΔ85 by WB, all selected clones showed affinity constants in the nanomolar range. Additionaly, the clone KC329705 is able to detect prNΔ₈₅ in solution, as well as the native viral antigen. Findings support the hypothesis that selected VHHs could be a powerful tool in the development of rapid and accurate HPS diagnostic assays, which are essential to provide supportive care to patients and reduce the high mortality rate associated with hantavirus infections.","['Pereira SS', 'Moreira-Dill LS', 'Morais MS', 'Prado ND', 'Barros ML', 'Koishi AC', 'Mazarrotto GA', 'Gonçalves GM', 'Zuliani JP', 'Calderon LA', 'Soares AM', 'Pereira da Silva LH', 'Duarte dos Santos CN', 'Fernandes CF', 'Stabeli RG']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Pereira SS, et al.

25207806,"The spatial analysis on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Jiangsu province, China based on geographic information system.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in mainland China, accounting for 90% of total reported cases worldwide, and Jiangsu is one of the most severely affected provinces. In this study, the authors conducted GIS-based spatial analyses in order to determine the spatial distribution of the HFRS cases, identify key areas and explore risk factors for public health planning and resource allocation.
METHODS: Interpolation maps by inverse distance weighting were produced to detect the spatial distribution of HFRS cases in Jiangsu from 2001 to 2011. Spatio-temporal clustering was applied to identify clusters at the county level. Spatial correlation analysis was conducted to detect influencing factors of HFRS in Jiangsu.
RESULTS: HFRS cases in Jiangsu from 2001 to 2011 were mapped and the results suggested that cases in Jiangsu were not distributed randomly. Cases were mainly distributed in northeastern and southwestern Jiangsu, especially in Dafeng and Sihong counties. It was notable that prior to this study, Sihong county had rarely been reported as a high-risk area of HFRS. With the maximum spatial size of 50% of the total population and the maximum temporal size of 50% of the total population, spatio-temporal clustering showed that there was one most likely cluster (LLR = 624.52, P<0.0001, RR = 8.19) and one second-most likely cluster (LLR = 553.97, P<0.0001, RR = 8.25), and both of these clusters appeared from 2001 to 2004. Spatial correlation analysis showed that the incidence of HFRS in Jiangsu was influenced by distances to highways, railways, rivers and lakes.
CONCLUSION: The application of GIS together with spatial interpolation, spatio-temporal clustering and spatial correlation analysis can effectively identify high-risk areas and factors influencing HFRS incidence to lay a foundation for researching its pathogenesis.","['Bao C', 'Liu W', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu W', 'Hu J', 'Liang Q', 'Cheng Y', 'Wu Y', 'Yu R', 'Zhou M', 'Shen H', 'Chen F', 'Tang F', 'Peng Z']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Bao C, et al.

25184252,"Time-specific ecologic niche models forecast the risk of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Dongting Lake district, China, 2005-2010.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne infectious disease, is one of the most serious public health threats in China. Increasing our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of HFRS infections could guide local prevention and control strategies.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed statistical models to analyze HFRS case data together with environmental data from the Dongting Lake district during 2005-2010. Specifically, time-specific ecologic niche models (ENMs) were used to quantify and identify risk factors associated with HFRS transmission as well as forecast seasonal variation in risk across geographic areas. Results showed that the Maximum Entropy model provided the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.755). Time-specific Maximum Entropy models showed that the potential risk areas of HFRS significantly varied across seasons. High-risk areas were mainly found in the southeastern and southwestern areas of the Dongting Lake district. Our findings based on models focused on the spring and winter seasons showed particularly good performance. The potential risk areas were smaller in March, May and August compared with those identified for June, July and October to December. Both normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use types were found to be the dominant risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that time-specific ENMs provide a useful tool to forecast the spatial and temporal risk of HFRS.","['Liu HN', 'Gao LD', 'Chowell G', 'Hu SX', 'Lin XL', 'Li XJ', 'Ma GH', 'Huang R', 'Yang HS', 'Tian H', 'Xiao H']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Liu HN, et al.

25179578,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy and physical exercise for alleviating treatment-induced menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: Many breast cancer patients experience (severe) menopausal symptoms after an early onset of menopause caused by cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and physical exercise (PE), compared to a waiting list control group (WLC).
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare system perspective, using a Markov model. Effectiveness data came from a recent randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of CBT and PE. Cost data were obtained from relevant Dutch sources. Outcome measures were incremental treatment costs (ITCs) per patient with a clinically relevant improvement on a measure of endocrine symptoms, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaire (FACT-ES), and on a measure of hot flushes, the Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS), and costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained over a 5-year time period.
RESULTS: ITCs for achieving a clinically relevant decline on the FACT-ES for one patient were €1,051 for CBT and €1,315 for PE, compared to the WLC. The corresponding value for the HFRS was €1,067 for CBT, while PE was not more effective than the WLC. Incremental cost-utility ratios were €22,502/QALY for CBT and €28,078/QALY for PE.
CONCLUSION: CBT is likely the most cost-effective strategy for alleviating treatment-induced menopausal symptoms in this population, followed by PE. The outcomes are sensitive to a reduction of the assumed duration of the treatment effect from 5 to 3 and 1.5 years.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patients can be prescribed CBT or, based on individual preferences, PE.","['Mewes JC', 'Steuten LM', 'Duijts SF', 'Oldenburg HS', 'van Beurden M', 'Stuiver MM', 'Hunter MS', 'Kieffer JM', 'van Harten WH', 'Aaronson NK']",2015,9,1,J Cancer Surviv,"Mewes JC, et al.

25139076,"The hanta hunting study: underdiagnosis of Puumala hantavirus infections in symptomatic non-travelling leptospirosis-suspected patients in the Netherlands, in 2010 and April to November 2011.","Leptospirosis and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are hard to distinguish clinically since these two important rodent-borne zoonoses share hallmark symptoms such as renal failure and haemorrhage. Leptospirosis is caused by infection with a spirochete while HFRS is the result of an infection with certain hantaviruses. Both diseases are relatively rare in the Netherlands. Increased incidence of HFRS has been observed since 2007 in countries that border the Netherlands. Since a similar rise in incidence has not been registered in the Netherlands, we hypothesise that due to overlapping clinical manifestations, hantavirus infections may be confused with leptospirosis, leading to underdiagnosis. Therefore, we tested a cohort of non-travelling Dutch patients with symptoms compatible with leptospirosis, but with a negative diagnosis, during 2010 and from April to November 2011. Sera were screened with pan-hantavirus IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Sera with IgM reactivity were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). ELISA (IgM positive) and IFA results were confirmed using focus reduction neutralisation tests (FRNTs). We found hantavirus-specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies in 4.3% (11/255) of samples taken in 2010 and in 4.1% (6/146) of the samples during the 2011 period. After FRNT confirmation, seven patients were classed as having acute Puumala virus infections.

Twenty-four species that represent sero- and genotypes have been registered within the genus Hantavirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Among the viral proteins, nucleocapsid (N) protein possesses an immunodominant antigen. The antigenicitiy of N protein is conserved compared with that of envelope glycoproteins. Therefore, N protein has been used for serological diagnoses and seroepidemiological studies. An understanding of the antigenic properties of N protein is important for the interpretation of results from serological tests using N antigen. N protein consists of about 430 amino acids and possesses various epitopes. The N-terminal quarter of N protein bears linear and immunodominant epitopes. However, a serotype-specific and multimerization-dependent antigenic site was found in the C-terminal half of N protein. In this paper, the structure, function, and antigenicity of N protein are reviewed.","['Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J']",2014,6,8,Viruses,Yoshimatsu K and Arikawa J.

25087879,"Co-circulation of Hantaan, Kenkeme, and Khabarovsk Hantaviruses in Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island, China.","Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) was first recognized in far eastern Asia in the 1930s, and has been highly prevalent in this region ever since. To reveal the molecular epidemiology of hantaviruses in this region, a total of 374 small mammals (eight species of rodents and one species of shrew) were captured in the Chinese part of the Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island (Heilongjiang Province). Hantavirus sequences were recovered from three striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), 11 Maximowicz's voles (Microtus maximowiczii), and one flat-skulled shrew (Sorex roboratus). Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three viruses: Hantaan virus (HTNV), Khabarovsk virus (KHAV), and Kenkeme virus (KKMV). HTNV sequences recovered from A. agrarius were closely related to those identified in Apodemus mice from the surrounding areas, while a new lineage of KHAV was present in M. maximowiczii. Additionally, while the viral sequences recovered from one flat-skulled shrew were most closely related to KKMV, their divergence to the prototype strain suggests that they represent a new viral subtype. Overall, these results suggest that Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island harbors considerable hantavirus diversity.","['Wang CQ', 'Gao JH', 'Li M', 'Guo WP', 'Lu MQ', 'Wang W', 'Hu MX', 'Li MH', 'Yang J', 'Liang HJ', 'Tian XF', 'Holmes EC', 'Zhang YZ']",2014,191,,Virus Res,"Wang CQ, et al.

25029493,Increased plasma cell-free DNA level during HTNV infection: correlation with disease severity and virus load.,"Cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) in blood represents a promising DNA damage response triggered by virus infection or trauma, tumor, etc. Hantavirus primarily causes two diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), depending on different Hantavirus species. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma cf-DNA levels in acute phase of HFRS, and to correlate plasma cf-DNA with disease severity and plasma Hanttan virus (HTNV) load. We observed the appearance of cf-DNA in 166 plasma samples from 76 HFRS patients: the plasma cf-DNA levels peaked at the hypotensive stage of HFRS, and then decreased gradually. Until the diuretic stage, there was no significant difference in plasma cf-DNA level between patients and the healthy control. Exclusively in the febrile/hypotensive stage, the plasma cf-DNA levels of severe/critical patients were higher than those of the mild/moderate group. Moreover, the plasma cf-DNA value in the early stage of HFRS was correlated with HTNV load and disease severity. In most of the patients, plasma cf-DNA displayed a low-molecular weight appearance, corresponding to the size of apoptotic DNA. In conclusion, the plasma cf-DNA levels were dynamically elevated during HFRS, and correlated with disease severity, which suggests that plasma cf-DNA may be a potential biomarker for the pathogenesis and prognosis of HFRS.","['Yi J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang C', 'Li Q', 'Liu B', 'Liu Z', 'Liu J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B']",2014,6,7,Viruses,"Yi J, et al.

25013204,Acute hantavirus infection induces galectin-3-binding protein.,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic viruses that cause life-threatening diseases when transmitted to humans. Severe hantavirus infection is manifested by impairment of renal function, pulmonary oedema and capillary leakage. Both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we showed that galectin-3-binding protein (Gal-3BP) was upregulated as a result of hantavirus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Gal-3BP is a secreted glycoprotein found in human serum, and increased Gal-3BP levels have been reported in chronic viral infections and in several types of cancer. Our in vitro experiments showed that, whilst Vero E6 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) constitutively expressed and secreted Gal-3BP, this protein was detected in primary human cells only as a result of hantavirus infection. Analysis of Gal-3BP levels in serum samples of cynomolgus macaques infected experimentally with hantavirus indicated that hantavirus infection induced Gal-3BP also in vivo. Finally, analysis of plasma samples collected from patients hospitalized because of acute hantavirus infection showed higher Gal-3BP levels during the acute than the convalescent phase. Furthermore, the Gal-3BP levels in patients with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome correlated with increased complement activation and with clinical variables reflecting the severity of acute hantavirus infection.","['Hepojoki J', 'Strandin T', 'Hetzel U', 'Sironen T', 'Klingström J', 'Sane J', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Meri S', 'Lundkvist Å', 'Vapalahti O', 'Lankinen H', 'Vaheri A']",2014,95,Pt 11,J Gen Virol,"Hepojoki J, et al.

25012160,"Epidemic characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China, 2006-2012.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantaviruses is a serious public health problem in China. The National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) was established online by China CDC in 2004 and rodent surveillance sites were adjusted to 40 sites in 22 provinces in 2005. Here we analyzed the surveillance data of both human cases and rodents host during 2006-2012 to examine the epidemic trends of HFRS in recent years in China.
METHODS: Records on HFRS human cases and surveillance data of rodents host from 2006 to 2012 were analyzed. Phylogenetic tree based on complete sequence of M segment of 58 virus isolates was constructed and analyzed to make a better understanding of the molecular diversity of hantaviruses in China.
RESULTS: During 2006-2012, a total of 77558 HFRS human cases and 866 deaths were reported with the average annual incidence rate of 0.83 cases/100,000 population and case fatality rate of 1.13%. 84.16% of the total cases were clustered in 9 provinces and mainly reported in spring and autumn-winter seasons. HFRS incidence in males was over 3 times higher than in females and farmers still accounted for the largest proportion. The average density of rodents was relatively stable from 2006 to 2012. Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus were predominant in wild field and residential area, respectively. Both hantaviruses carrying and infection rates in rodents had a rapid increase in 2012. Phylogenetic analysis showed that at least six clades of Hantaan virus and five of Seoul virus were prevalent in China.
CONCLUSION: HFRS in China was still a natural focal disease with relatively high morbidity and fatality and its distribution and epidemic trends had also changed.

The incidence of HFRS was related to NDVI value, rat density and rat's virus carriage rate by multiple linear regression (F = 25.936, P<0.01). The pseudo- R2value for the model was 0.644.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of HFRS was related to NDVI value, rat density and rat's virus carriage rate. Control of these factors should be used to prevent HFRS in Hebei province.","['Li Q', 'Zhao W', 'Wei Y', 'Han X', 'Han Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Qi S', 'Xu Y']",2014,9,7,PLoS One,"Li Q, et al.

24992563,Health risk characterization for resident inhalation exposure to particle-bound halogenated flame retardants in a typical e-waste recycling zone.,"Inhalation of pollutants is an important exposure route for causing human health hazards, and inhalation exposure assessment must take into account particle size distribution because particle-bound pollutants are size-dependent. Such information is scarce, particularly for residents dwelling within e-waste recycling zones where abundant atmospheric halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) commonly used in electronic/electrical devices have been widely reported. Atmospheric size-fractioned particle samples were collected using a 10-stage Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor from an e-waste recycling zone in South China. The deposition efficiencies and fluxes of size-fractioned HFRs including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alternative brominated flame retardants, and Dechlorane Plus in the human respiratory tract were estimated using the International Commission on Radiological Protection deposition model. The majority of HFRs was found to deposit in the head airways, with coarse particles (aerodynamic diameter (Dp) > 1.8 μm) contributing the most (69-91%). Conversely, fine particles (Dp < 1.8 μm) were dominant in the alveolar region (62-80%). The inhalation intake of PBDEs within the e-waste recycling zone was 44 ng/d (95% confidence interval (CI): 30-65 ng/d), close to those through food consumption in non-e-waste recycling regions. The estimated total hazard quotient of particle-bound HFRs was 5.6 × 10(-4) (95% CI: 3.8 × 10(-4)-8.8 × 10(-4)). In addition, incremental lifetime cancer risk induced by BDE-209 was 1.36 × 10(-10) (95% CI: 7.3 × 10(-11)-2.3 × 10(-10)), much lower than the Safe Acceptable Range (1.0 × 10(-6)-1.0 × 10(-4)) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These results indicate that the potential health risk from inhalation exposure to particle-bound HFRs for residents dwelling in the e-waste recycling zone was low.","['Luo P', 'Bao LJ', 'Wu FC', 'Li SM', 'Zeng EY']",2014,48,15,Environ Sci Technol,"Luo P, et al.

24988362,Occurrence of halogenated flame retardants in sediment off an urbanized coastal zone: association with urbanization and industrialization.,"To examine the impacts of urbanization and industrialization on the coastal environment, sediment samples were collected from an urbanized coastal zone (i.e., Daya Bay and Hong Kong waters of South China) and analyzed for 20 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 10 alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs). The sum concentration of PBDEs was in the range of 1.7-55 (mean: 17) ng g(-1), suggesting a moderate pollution level compared to the global range. The higher fractions of AHFRs (i.e., TBB+TBPH, BTBPE and DBDPE) than those of legacy PBDEs (i.e., penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE) corresponded with the phasing out of PBDEs and increasing demand for AHFRs. Heavy contamination occurred at the estuary of Dan'ao River flowing through the Daya Bay Economic Zone, home to a variety of petrochemicals and electronics manufacturing facilities. The concentrations of HFRs in surface sediments of Hong Kong were the highest in Victoria Harbor, which receives around 1.4 million tons of primarily treated sewage daily, and a good relationship (r(2) = 0.80; p < 0.0001) between the HFR concentration and population density in each council district was observed, highlighting the effect of urbanization. Moreover, the AHFR concentrations were significantly correlated (r(2) > 0.73; p < 0.05) with the production volume of electronic devices, production value of electronic industries and population size, demonstrating the importance of industrializing and urbanizing processes in dictating the historical input patterns of AHFRs.","['Liu HH', 'Hu YJ', 'Luo P', 'Bao LJ', 'Qiu JW', 'Leung KM', 'Zeng EY']",2014,48,15,Environ Sci Technol,"Liu HH, et al.

The available data, much of it from recent studies in China, indicate that both trombiculid and gamasid mites are naturally infected with Hantaan virus and that infected mites can transmit the virus by bite to laboratory mice and transovarially (vertically) through eggs to their offspring. Collectively, these findings challenge the current paradigm of hantavirus transmission, namely, that rodents serve as the reservoir of human pathogenic hantaviruses in nature and that humans are infected with these viruses by inhalation of aerosols of infectious rodent excreta. Further research is needed to confirm the mite-hantavirus association and to determine if parasitic mites are in fact the major source and principal vectors of human pathogenic hantaviruses, such as Hantaan. If the mite hypothesis is correct, then it will significantly alter current concepts about the epidemiology, prevention, and control of human hantavirus infection.","['Yu XJ', 'Tesh RB']",2014,210,11,J Infect Dis,Yu XJ and Tesh RB.

24942310,Upregulation of IFN-γ and IL-12 is associated with a milder form of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic disease characterized by acute onset, fever, malaise, and back pain. As the disease progresses, hemorrhagic disturbances and kidney dysfunctions predominate. The examination of tissue collected postmortem supports the premise that virus replication is not responsible for this pathology; therefore, it is widely believed that virus-induced immune responses lead to the clinical manifestations associated with HFRS. The overproduction of inflammatory cytokines is commonly reported in subjects with HFRS and has given rise to the hypothesis that a so-called ""cytokine storm"" may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Currently, supportive care remains the only effective treatment for HFRS. Our data show that serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-10, CCL2, and IL-12 are upregulated in HFRS cases when compared to healthy controls and the level of upregulation is dependent on the phase and severity of the disease. Furthermore, we observed an association between the mild form of the disease and elevated serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-12. Collectively, these observations suggest that the administration of exogenous IFN-γ and IL-12 may provide antiviral benefits for the treatment of HFRS and, thus, warrants further investigations.","['Khaiboullina SF', 'Martynova EV', 'Khamidullina ZL', 'Lapteva EV', 'Nikolaeva IV', 'Anokhin VV', 'Lombardi VC', 'Rizvanov AA']",2014,33,12,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Khaiboullina SF, et al.

24902039,Surveillance of hantaviruses in Poland: a study of animal reservoirs and human hantavirus disease in Subcarpathia.,"The first cluster of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Poland was identified in 2007 in the Subcarpathian region. The natural environment of this area is a key habitat for hantavirus vectors. The animal reservoir of existing human HFRS clusters was studied to assess the occurrence of viruses (including Tula virus, Puumala virus, and Dobrava-Belgrade virus) among rodents. We examined 70 suspected human cases with symptoms corresponding to the clinical picture of HFRS. Serological analysis (indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunoblot) confirmed the presence of anti-hantavirus antibodies in 18 patients, which were surveyed with regard to developed symptoms and presumed rodent contact. Seroepidemiological analysis of newly confirmed human cases was performed, putative areas of human exposure were studied, and 194 rodents were subsequently captured from identified areas. Internal organs (lungs, heart, spleen, bladder, and kidneys) were collected from 64 Apodemus flavicollis, 55 Apodemus agrarius, 40 Myodes glareolus, 21 Mus musculus, and 14 Microtus arvalis and tested for the presence of hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription and subsequent real-time PCR. Positive samples were also tested by indirect immunofluorescence. Animal reservoir surveillance enabled the first detection of Puumala virus and Dobrava-Belgrade virus among animals in Poland. Furthermore, some places where rodents were captured correlated with areas of residence of laboratory-confirmed human cases and likely detected virus species. Moreover, three species of hantaviruses coexisting in a relatively small area were identified.","['Michalski A', 'Niemcewicz M', 'Bielawska-Drózd A', 'Nowakowska A', 'Gaweł J', 'Pitucha G', 'Joniec J', 'Zielonka K', 'Marciniak-Niemcewicz A', 'Kocik J']",2014,14,7,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Michalski A, et al.

24897398,Early indicators of severity and construction of a risk model for prognosis based upon laboratory parameters in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to explore the role of laboratory parameters as early indicators of severity and as effective predictors of prognosis in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: A total of 356 patients were enrolled in this study and were divided into mild, moderate, severe and critical types according to the clinical classification of HFRS. The levels of 12 routinely tested laboratory parameters during the acute stage among the four types were compared. The predictive values of the laboratory parameters for prognosis were analyzed, and a risk model for prognosis based upon the parameters was constructed.
RESULTS: The levels of white blood counts (WBC), platelets (PLT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) demonstrated significant differences among the four types (p<0.001); WBC, AST, PT and fibrinogen (Fib) were major independent risk factors for death; WBC, AST, PT and Fib used in combination were better for predicting prognosis than single parameters used alone (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Some routinely tested laboratory parameters can be beneficial as early indicators of severity of HFRS. Using a combination of WBC, AST, PT and Fib to predict the outcome in patients with HFRS exhibited acceptable diagnostic capability.","['Du H', 'Li J', 'Yu HT', 'Jiang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang JN', 'Wang PZ', 'Bai XF']",2014,52,11,Clin Chem Lab Med,"Du H, et al.

From 2008 to 2011, 537 patients with fever ≥ 38°C for ≥ 48 hours without a diagnosis were enrolled into a sentinel surveillance study to investigate the incidence of nine pathogens, including CCHF virus and hantavirus. Of 14 patients with a hemorrhagic fever syndrome, 3 patients tested positive for CCHF virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Two of the patients enrolled in the study had acute renal failure. These 2 of 537 enrolled patients were the only patients in the study positive for hantavirus IgM antibodies.

24888473,"Halogenated flame retardants during egg formation and chicken embryo development: maternal transfer, possible biotransformation, and tissue distribution.","Hen muscle, eggs, and newborn chick tissues (muscle and liver) were collected from an electronic waste recycling site in southern China. The authors examined the maternal transfer, potential metabolism, and tissue distribution of several halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) during egg formation and chicken embryo development. The pollutant composition changes significantly from hen muscle to eggs and from eggs to tissues of newborn chicks. Higher-halogenated chemicals, such as octa- to deca-polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, deca-polybrominated biphenyl (PBB209), and dechlorane plus (DP), are less readily transferred to eggs compared with lower-halogenated chemicals. During embryo development, PBDEs are the most likely to be metabolized, whereas decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) is the least. The authors also observed selective maternal transfer of anti-DP and stereoselective metabolism of syn-DP during chicken embryo development. During tissue development, liver has greater affinity than the muscle for chemcials with a high log octanol-water partition coefficient, with the exception of DBDPE. The differences in metabolism potential of different chemicals in chicken embryos cause pollutant composition alterations. Halogenated flame retardant from maternal transfer and tissue distribution also exhibited chemical specificity, especially for DBDPE. Levels of DBDPE were elevated along with the full process from hen muscle to eggs and from eggs to chick tissues. More attention should be paid to the selective accumulation and biotransformation of HFRs in the early development stage of birds.","['Zheng XB', 'Luo XJ', 'Zeng YH', 'Wu JP', 'Chen SJ', 'Mai BX']",2014,33,8,Environ Toxicol Chem,"Zheng XB, et al.

24867363,Genetic analysis of Dobrava-Belgrade virus from western Serbia--a newly detected focus in the Balkan Peninsula.,"Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is a hantavirus species that causes the most severe form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. DOBV has been detected in three Apodemus rodents: A. flavicollis, A. agrarius and A. ponticus. These emerging viruses appear throughout the Balkan Peninsula including Serbia as its central part. In this study, we examined the seroprevalence, molecular epidemiology and phylogenetics of DOBV from A. flavicollis captured at six Serbian localities. Furthermore, we applied microsatellite typing of host animal genome to analyse the role of host kinship in DOBV animal transmission. The overall IgG seropositivity rate over 3 years (2008-2010) was 11.9% (22/185). All seropositive samples were subjected to RT-PCR and DNA sequencing for S and L genome segments (pos. 291-1079 nt and 2999-3316 nt, respectively). DOBV was genetically detected in three samples from mountain Tara in western Serbia, a newly detected DOBV focus in the Balkans. No sequence data from human cases from Serbia are available for the studied period. However, collected DOBV isolates in this work phylogenetically clustered together with isolates from Serbian human cases dating from 2002, with 1.9% nucleotide divergence. We determined the level of kinship between seropositive and seronegative animal groups and found no significant difference, suggesting that horizontal virus transmission in the studied population was the same within and among the hatches. Our findings are the first genetic detection of DOBV in rodents in Serbia. We confirm wide and continuous hantavirus presence in the examined parts of the Balkans, underlying the necessity of continual monitoring of hantavirus circulation in A. flavicollis.","['Stamenković G', 'Nikolić V', 'Blagojević J', 'Bugarski-Stanojević V', 'Adnađević T', 'Stanojević M', 'Vujošević M']",2015,62,2,Zoonoses Public Health,"Stamenković G, et al.

24857988,Detection of Puumala hantavirus antigen in human intestine during acute hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most important hantavirus species in Central Europe. Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by PUUV, is characterized by acute renal injury (AKI) with thrombocytopenia and frequently gastrointestinal symptoms.
METHODS: 456 patients with serologically and clinically confirmed NE were investigated at time of follow-up in a single clinic. The course of the NE was investigated using medical reports. We identified patients who had endoscopy with intestinal biopsy during acute phase of NE. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of the biopsies were performed.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent colonoscopy or gastroscopy for abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting during acute phase of NE. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in 11 biopsies from 8 patients; 14 biopsies from 5 patients were negative for PUUV nucleocapsid antigen. IHC localized PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in endothelial cells of capillaries or larger vessels in the lamina propria. Rate of AKI was not higher and severity of AKI was not different in the PUUV-positive compared to the PUUV-negative group. All IHC positive biopsies were positive for PUUV RNA using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed clustering of all PUUV strains from this study with viruses previously detected from the South-West of Germany. Long-term outcome was favorable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NE, PUUV nucleocapsid antigen and PUUV RNA was detected frequently in the intestine. This finding could explain frequent GI-symptoms in NE patients, thus demonstration of a more generalized PUUV infection. The RT-PCR was an effective and sensitive method to detect PUUV RNA in FFPE tissues. Therefore, it can be used as a diagnostic and phylogenetic approach also for archival materials. AKI was not more often present in patients with PUUV-positive IHC. This last finding should be investigated in larger numbers of patients with PUUV infection.","['Latus J', 'Tenner-Racz K', 'Racz P', 'Kitterer D', 'Cadar D', 'Ott G', 'Alscher MD', 'Schmidt-Chanasit J', 'Braun N']",2014,9,5,PLoS One,"Latus J, et al.

Using nested RT-PCR, Puumala virus (PUUV) RNA was detected in 41/53 (77·4%) bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and Dobrava virus (DOBV) RNA was found in 6/61 (9·8%) yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis). Sequence analysis of a 341-nucleotide region of the PUUV S segment, obtained from all infected bank voles and five HFRS patients, showed 98·8-100% sequence similarity, indicating that the patients were probably exposed to PUUV on Medvednica mountain.

24772398,Dengue-associated kidney disease.,"CONTEXT: A mosquito-borne viral illness highly prevalent in the tropics and subtropics, dengue is considered a major global health threat by the World Health Organization.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITIONS: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Google Scholar, PubMed (NLM), LISTA (EBSCO) and Web of Science have been searched.
RESULTS: An RNA virus from the genus Flavivirus, dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes aegypti,the yellow fever mosquito. Dengue is asymptomatic in as many as one half of infected individuals. Dengue fever is an acute febrile illness accompanied by constitutional symptoms. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are the severe forms of dengue infection.Dengue infection has been associated with a variety of renal disorders. Acute renal failure is a potential complication of severe dengue infection and is typically associated with hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, or hemolysis. Acute renal failure complicates severe dengue infection in 2-5% of the cases and carries a high mortality rate. Proteinuria has been detected in as high as 74% of patients with severe dengue infection. Hematuria has been reported in up to 12.5% of patients. Various types of glomerulonephritis have been reported during or shortly after dengue infection in humans and mouse models of dengue infection. Mesangial proliferation and immune complex deposition are the dominant histologic features of dengue-associated glomerulonephritis. On a rare occasion, dengue infection is associated with systemic autoimmune disorders involving the kidneys.
CONCLUSIONS: In the vast majority of cases, dengue infection and associated renal disorders are self-limited.","['Lizarraga KJ', 'Nayer A']",2014,3,2,J Nephropathol,Lizarraga KJ and Nayer A.

24752452,Comprehensive multiplex one-step real-time TaqMan qRT-PCR assays for detection and quantification of hemorrhagic fever viruses.,"BACKGROUND: Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of animal and human illnesses that are mostly caused by several distinct families of viruses including bunyaviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses and arenaviruses. Although specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, initial signs and symptoms are very similar. Therefore rapid immunologic and molecular tools for differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) are important for effective case management and control of the spread of VHFs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay is one of the reliable and desirable methods for specific detection and quantification of virus load. Multiplex PCR assay has the potential to produce considerable savings in time and resources in the laboratory detection.
RESULTS: Primers/probe sets were designed based on appropriate specific genes for each of 28 HFVs which nearly covered all the HFVs, and identified with good specificity and sensitivity using monoplex assays. Seven groups of multiplex one-step real-time qRT-PCR assays in a universal experimental system were then developed by combining all primers/probe sets into 4-plex reactions and evaluated with serial dilutions of synthesized viral RNAs. For all the multiplex assays, no cross-reactivity with other HFVs was observed, and the limits of detection were mainly between 45 and 150 copies/PCR. The reproducibility was satisfactory, since the coefficient of variation of Ct values were all less than 5% in each dilution of synthesized viral RNAs for both intra-assays and inter-assays. Evaluation of the method with available clinical serum samples collected from HFRS patients, SFTS patients and Dengue fever patients showed high sensitivity and specificity of the related multiplex assays on the clinical specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the comprehensive multiplex one-step real-time qRT-PCR assays were established in this study, and proved to be specific, sensitive, stable and easy to serve as a useful tool for rapid detection of HFVs.","['Pang Z', 'Li A', 'Li J', 'Qu J', 'He C', 'Zhang S', 'Li C', 'Zhang Q', 'Liang M', 'Li D']",2014,9,4,PLoS One,"Pang Z, et al.

24751477,Plasma pentraxin-3 and coagulation and fibrinolysis variables during acute Puumala hantavirus infection and associated thrombocytopenia.,"Thrombocytopenia and altered coagulation characterize all hantavirus infections. To further assess the newly discovered predictive biomarkers of disease severity during acute Puumala virus (PUUV) infection, we studied the associations between them and the variables reflecting coagulation, fibrinolysis and endothelial activation. Nineteen hospital-treated patients with serologically confirmed acute PUUV infection were included. Acutely, plasma levels of pentraxin-3 (PTX3), cell-free DNA (cf-DNA), complement components SC5b-9 and C3 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were recorded as well as platelet ligands and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. High values of plasma PTX3 associated with thrombin formation (prothrombin fragments F1+2; r = 0.46, P = 0.05), consumption of platelet ligand fibrinogen (r = -0.70, P < 0.001) and natural anticoagulants antithrombin (AT) (r = -0.74, P < 0.001), protein C (r = -0.77, P < 0.001) and protein S free antigen (r = -0.81, P < 0.001) and a decreased endothelial marker ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 domain 13) (r = -0.48, P = 0.04). Plasma level of AT associated with C3 (r = 0.76, P < 0.001), IL-6 (r = -0.56, P = 0.01) and cf-DNA (r = -0.47, P = 0.04). High cf-DNA coincided with increased prothrombin fragments F1+2 (r = 0.47, P = 0.04). Low C3 levels reflecting the activation of complement system through the alternative route predicted loss of all natural anticoagulants (for protein C r = 0.53, P = 0.03 and for protein S free antigen r = 0.64, P = 0.004). Variables depicting altered coagulation follow the new predictive biomarkers of disease severity, especially PTX3, in acute PUUV infection. The findings are consistent with the previous observations of these biomarkers also being predictive for low platelet count and underline the cross-talk of inflammation and coagulation systems in acute PUUV infection.","['Laine OK', 'Koskela SM', 'Outinen TK', 'Joutsi-Korhonen L', 'Huhtala H', 'Vaheri A', 'Hurme MA', 'Jylhävä J', 'Mäkelä SM', 'Mustonen JT']",2014,25,6,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,"Laine OK, et al.

24750436,Hantavirus infections.,"Over the past few decades understanding and recognition of hantavirus infection has greatly improved worldwide, but both the amplitude and the magnitude of hantavirus outbreaks have been increasing. Several novel hantaviruses with unknown pathogenic potential have been identified in a variety of insectivore hosts. With the new hosts, new geographical distributions of hantaviruses have also been discovered and several new species were found in Africa. Hantavirus infection in humans can result in two clinical syndromes: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) caused by Old World and New World hantaviruses, respectively. The clinical presentation of HFRS varies from subclinical, mild, and moderate to severe, depending in part on the causative agent of the disease. In general, HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, Amur virus and Dobrava virus are more severe with mortality rates from 5 to 15%, whereas Seoul virus causes moderate and Puumala virus and Saaremaa virus cause mild forms of disease with mortality rates <1%. The central phenomena behind the pathogenesis of both HFRS and HCPS are increased vascular permeability and acute thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis is likely to be a complex multifactorial process that includes contributions from immune responses, platelet dysfunction and the deregulation of endothelial cell barrier functions. Also a genetic predisposition, related to HLA type, seems to be important for the severity of the disease. As there is no effective treatment or vaccine approved for use in the USA and Europe, public awareness and precautionary measures are the only ways to minimize the risk of hantavirus disease.","['Avšič-Županc T', 'Saksida A', 'Korva M']",2019,21S,,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Avšič-Županc T, et al.

In the present study, focus-reduction neutralization tests (FRNT) confirmed Dobrava hantavirus (DOBV) as the causative agent in some HFRS cases, but could not distinguish between DOBV and Saaremaa virus (SAAV) infections in other cases. DOBV was detected by a DOBV-specific TaqMan assay in sera of nine patients out of 22 tested. Partial sequences of the M genomic segment of DOBV were obtained from sera of three patients and revealed the circulation of two DOBV lineages in Romania. Investigation of rodents trapped in Romania found three DOBV-positive Apodemus flavicollis out of 83 rodents tested. Two different DOBV lineages were also detected in A. flavicollis as determined from partial sequences of the M and S genomic segments. Sequences of DOBV in A. flavicollis were either identical or closely related to the sequences obtained from the HFRS patients. The DOBV strains circulating in Romania clustered in two monophyletic groups, together with strains from Slovenia and the north of Greece. This is the first evidence for the circulation of DOBV in wild rodents and for a DOBV etiology of HFRS in Romania.","['Panculescu-Gatej RI', 'Sirbu A', 'Dinu S', 'Waldstrom M', 'Heyman P', 'Murariu D', 'Petrescu A', 'Szmal C', 'Oprisan G', 'Lundkvist A', 'Ceianu CS']",2014,14,5,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Panculescu-Gatej RI, et al.

24717117,Urine soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor levels correlate with proteinuria in Puumala hantavirus infection.,"OBJECTIVES: Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is upregulated during inflammation and known to bind to β3 -integrins, receptors used by pathogenic hantaviruses to enter endothelial cells. It has been proposed that soluble uPAR (suPAR) is a circulating factor that causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria by activating β3 -integrin in kidney podocytes. Proteinuria is also a characteristic feature of hantavirus infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between urine suPAR levels and disease severity in acute Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection.
DESIGN: A single-centre, prospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urinary suPAR levels were measured twice during the acute phase and once during convalescence in 36 patients with serologically confirmed PUUV infection. Fractional excretion of suPAR (FE suPAR) and of albumin (FE alb) was calculated.
RESULTS: The FE suPAR was significantly elevated during the acute phase of PUUV infection compared to the convalescent phase (median 3.2%, range 0.8-52.0%, vs. median 1.9%, range 1.0-5.8%, P = 0.005). Maximum FE suPAR was correlated markedly with maximum FE alb (r = 0.812, P < 0.001) and with several other variables that reflect disease severity. There was a positive correlation with the length of hospitalization (r = 0.455, P = 0.009) and maximum plasma creatinine level (r = 0.780, P < 0.001) and an inverse correlation with minimum urinary output (r = -0.411, P = 0.030). There was no correlation between FE suPAR and plasma suPAR (r = 0.180, P = 0.324).
CONCLUSION: Urinary suPAR is markedly increased during acute PUUV infection and is correlated with proteinuria. High urine suPAR level may reflect local production of suPAR in the kidney during the acute infection.","['Outinen TK', 'Mäkelä S', 'Huttunen R', 'Mäenpää N', 'Libraty D', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen J', 'Aittoniemi J']",2014,276,4,J Intern Med,"Outinen TK, et al.

24714064,"Involvement of the Akt/NF-κB pathways in the HTNV-mediated increase of IL-6, CCL5, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in HUVECs.","BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection causes a severe form of HFRS(hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome)in Asia. Although HTNV has been isolated for nearly forty years, the pathogenesis of HFRS is still unknown, and little is known regarding the signaling pathway that is activated by the virus.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cardamonin was selected as a NF-κB inhibitor, and indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the effect of cardamonin on HTNV-infected HUVECs. The effect of cardamonin on the HTNV-induced phosphorylation of Akt and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB were determined using Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), respectively. Then, flow cytometric and quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed to quantify the expression levels of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL5 in HUVEC supernatants were examined using ELISA. The results showed that cardamonin did not effect the proliferation of HUVECs or the replication of HTNV in HUVECs. Instead, cardamonin inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and nuclear transduction of NF-κB and further reduced the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HTNV-infected HUVECs. Cardamonin also inhibited the secretion of IL-6 and CCL5, but not IL-8.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: HTNV replication may not be dependent upon the ability of the virus to activate NF-κB in HUVECs. The Akt/NF-κB pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of HFRS; therefore, cardamonin may serve as a potential beneficial agent for HFRS therapy.","['Yu H', 'Jiang W', 'Du H', 'Xing Y', 'Bai G', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J', 'Wang P', 'Bai X']",2014,9,4,PLoS One,"Yu H, et al.

24713176,Comparison of two automated immunoassays for the determination of Puumalavirus IgM and IgG.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala virus (PUUV), a member of the genus hantavirus, can cause nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The method of choice for the serodiagnosis of hantavirus infections are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).
OBJECTIVES: Two commercially available PUUV ELISA kits were compared: Hantavirus (Puumala) IgM/IgG ELISA (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) and PUUMALA IgM and IgG EIA AutoM (Reagena, Toivala, Finland).
STUDY DESIGN: The sensitivity of the ELISA kits was evaluated with a panel of 55 serum samples from patients with an acute (n=27) or past (n=28) infection based on Progen or Reagena. A panel of 56 serum samples was composed to evaluate the specificity: samples with potentially false positive Progen Puumala IgM results (n=12), seronegative samples for Puumala IgG/IgM with Progen (n=20), and potentially cross reacting samples (n=24). Discrepancies between the two assays were resolved with strip immunoblot. As measure of agreement between Progen and Reagena results, Cohen kappa coefficient was calculated.
RESULTS: Reagena showed a higher specificity (IgM 100%, IgG 100%) than Progen Puumala (IgM 73.21%, IgG 100%). However, Reagena showed a slightly lower sensitivity (IgM 96.15%, IgG 97.78%) compared with Progen (IgM 100%, IgG 100%). Substantial agreement with a Cohen kappa of 0.67 and 0.76 was found between the two assays for Puumala IgM and IgG respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a higher specificity of Reagena in comparison to Progen with a lower sensitivity, probably caused by selection bias. In spite of Reagena's lower sensitivity, no acute infection was missed with this assay.","['Muyldermans A', 'Lagrou K', 'Patteet S', 'Van Esbroeck M', 'Van Ranst M', 'Saegeman V']",2014,60,2,J Clin Virol,"Muyldermans A, et al.

24712579,Clinical characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has become an important public health concern because of the high incidence and mortality rates, and limited treatment and vaccination. Until now, clinical studies on characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with HFRS have been limited. The aim of this study was to observe the clinical characteristics and cumulative proportions surviving and explore the predictive effects and risk factors for prognosis.
METHODS: A detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records for critical HFRS patients was conducted. The patients enrolled were treated in the centre for infectious diseases, Tangdu Hospital, between January 2008 and August 2012. The clinical characteristics between the survivors and non-survivors were compared by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The risk clinical factors for prognosis were explored by logistic regression analysis. The predictive effects of prognosis in clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The cumulative proportions surviving at certain intervals in the critical patients were observed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 75 patients enrolled, the cumulative proportion surviving was 70.7% at the second week interval, with a 28-day mortality rate of 36.3%. The non-survivors tended to have higher frequencies of agitation, dyspnea, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and encephalopathy (P < .05). ARDS, conjunctival hemorrhage and coma were risk factors for death in the critical patients with HFRS. The non-survivors were found to have lower serum creatinine (Scr) levels (P < .001) and higher incidences of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (P = .006), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = .003) and elevated white blood cells (WBC) levels (P = .005), and the laboratory parameters mentioned above reached statistical significance for predicting prognosis (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The high fatality in critical patients with HFRS underscores the importance of clinicians' alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications and changes in biochemical status to ensure that timely and systematically supportive treatment can be initiated when necessary.","['Du H', 'Wang PZ', 'Li J', 'Bai L', 'Li H', 'Yu HT', 'Jiang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang JN', 'Bai XF']",2014,14,,BMC Infect Dis,"Du H, et al.

24701034,"Hantaan virus infection induces CXCL10 expression through TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 pathways correlated with the disease severity.","Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a major agent causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Although the pathogenesis of HFRS is unclear, some reports have suggested that the abundant production of proinflammatory cytokines and uncontrolled inflammatory responses may contribute to the development of HFRS. CXCL10 is one of these cytokines and is found to be involved in the pathogenesis of many virus infectious diseases. However, the role of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of HFRS and the molecular regulation mechanism of CXCL10 in HTNV infection remain unknown. In this study, we report that CXCL10 expresses highly in the HFRS patients' sera and the elevated CXCL10 is positively correlated with the severity of HFRS. We find that HTNV, a single-strand RNA virus, can act as a double-strand RNA to activate the TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 signaling pathways. Through the downstream transcription factors of these pathways, NF-κB and IRF7, which bind directly to the CXCL10's promoter, the expression of CXCL10 is increased. Our results may help to better understand the role of CXCL10 in the development of HFRS and may provide some novel insights into the immune response of HTNV infection.","['Zhang Y', 'Liu B', 'Ma Y', 'Yi J', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Wang J', 'Yang K', 'Yang A', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B']",2014,2014,,Mediators Inflamm,"Zhang Y, et al.

24684420,Response of primary vectors and related diseases to impoundment by the Three Gorges Dam.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the local ecological environment. We conducted a 3-year cross-sectional survey of natural focus infectious diseases in the area before and after the water level rose to 156 m to evaluate the dam's health impacts.
METHODS: Direct and indirect immunofluorescence methods were applied to detect rat antigen and antibody of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Fresh rat kidneys were inoculated in Korth's culture medium to detect Leptospira. A group of captured crabs were ground to observe the metacercariae of Paragonimus. Serum samples were collected from healthy local individuals. ELISA kits were used to detect human antibody against HFRS and paragonimiasis. Human Leptospira infections were detected by a microscopic agglutination test.
RESULTS: Upstream rodent density increased significantly with Rattus flavipectus and Apodemus agrarius as the major pathophoric genera. The infection rate of human HFRS and Leptospira in the upstream human population samples was significantly higher than in the downstream samples and correlated with the increase in rodent density. Paragonimus infection rates remained at a low level during the study. Culex pipiens fatigan and Armigeres obturbans were the dominant species of mosquito.
CONCLUSIONS: The creation of the Three Gorges Dam changed the proliferation of intermediary agents of diseases, but not notably. However, the ecological effects on the environment may require a prolonged period of time to manifest themselves; thus, long-term and effective surveillance of vectors and related diseases needs to be established.","['Zhang X', 'Peng L', 'Liu W', 'Fan L', 'Zhang Q', 'Chen G', 'He P', 'Wu R', 'Liu A', 'Yang Y', 'Yu X', 'Yun L']",2014,19,4,Trop Med Int Health,"Zhang X, et al.

24658382,"The epidemic characteristics and changing trend of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Hubei Province, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by different hantaviruses within the Bunyaviridae family. HFRS is a fulminant, infectious disease that occurs worldwide and is endemic in all 31 provinces of China. Since the first HFRS case in Hubei Province was reported in 1957, the disease has spread across the province and Hubei has become one of the seriously affected areas in China with the greatest number of reported HFRS cases in the 1980's. However, the epidemic characteristics of HFRS in Hubei are still not entirely clear and long-term, systematic investigations of this epidemic area have been very limited.
METHODS: The spatiotemporal distribution of HFRS was investigated using data spanning the years 1980 to 2009. The annual HFRS incidence, fatality rate and seasonal incidence between 1980 and 2009 were calculated and plotted. GIS-based spatial analyses were conducted to detect the spatial distribution and seasonal pattern of HFRS. A spatial statistical analysis, using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic, was performed to identify clustering of HFRS.
RESULTS: A total of 104,467 HFRS cases were reported in Hubei Province between 1980 and 2009. Incidence of and mortality due to HFRS declined after the outbreak in 1980s and HFRS cases have been sporadic in recent years. The locations and scale of disease clusters have changed during the three decades. The seasonal epidemic pattern of HFRS was characterized by the shift from the unimodal type (autumn/winter peak) to the bimodal type.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic development has great influence on the transmission of hantaviruses to humans and new epidemic characteristics have emerged in Hubei Province. It is necessary to reinforce preventative measures against HFRS according to the newly-presented seasonal variation and to intensify these efforts especially in the urban areas of Hubei Province.","['Zhang YH', 'Ge L', 'Liu L', 'Huo XX', 'Xiong HR', 'Liu YY', 'Liu DY', 'Luo F', 'Li JL', 'Ling JX', 'Chen W', 'Liu J', 'Hou W', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan H', 'Yang ZQ']",2014,9,3,PLoS One,"Zhang YH, et al.

Several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases. However, in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined, little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses. Because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms, it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur. Despite these limitations, recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus/reservoir relationships.","['Schountz T', 'Prescott J']",2014,6,3,Viruses,Schountz T and Prescott J.

24631566,Simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies associated with viral hemorrhagic fever by a multiplexed Luminex-based immunoassay.,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are worldwide diseases caused by several kinds of viruses. With the emergence of new viruses, advanced diagnostic methods are urgently needed for identification of VHFs. Based on Luminex xMAP technology, a rapid, sensitive, multi-pathogen and high-throughput method which could simultaneously detect hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) specific IgG antibodies was developed. Recombinant antigens of nine HFVs including Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Puumala virus (PUUV), Andes virus (ANDV), Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus (SFTSV) and dengue virus (DENV) were produced and purified from a prokaryotic expression system and the influence of the coupling amount was investigated. Cross-reactions among antigens and their rabbit immune sera were evaluated. Serum samples collected from 51 laboratory confirmed hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients, 43 confirmed SFTS patients and 88 healthy donors were analyzed. Results showed that recombinant nucleocapsid protein of the five viruses belonging to the genus Hantavirus, had serological cross-reactivity with their corresponding rabbit immune sera, but not apparent with immune sera of other four viruses. Evaluation of this new method with clinical serum samples showed 98.04% diagnostic sensitivity for HFRS, 90.70% for SFTS detection and the specificity was ranging from 66.67% to 100.00%.

24630625,[YEL-AND meningoencephalitis in a 4-year-old boy consecutive to a yellow-fever vaccine].,"Yellow fever is a vector-borne disease transmitted by an endemic mosquito in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. It causes fever and possibly liver and renal failure with hemorrhagic signs, which may be fatal. The yellow-fever vaccine is an attenuated vaccine that is recommended for all travelers over the age of 9 months in high-risk areas. Adverse effects have been reported: minor symptoms (such as viral syndrome), hypersensitivity reactions, and major symptoms such as viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) and neurotropic disease (YEL-AND). The yellow-fever vaccine-associated autoimmune disease with central nervous system involvement (such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) associates fever and headaches, neurologic dysfunction, seizures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and elevated protein, with neuroimaging consistent with multifocal areas of demyelization. The presence of antibodies or virus in CSF, within 1-30 days following vaccination, and the exclusion of other causes is necessary for diagnosis. We describe herein the case of a 4-year-old child who presented with severe encephalitis consecutive to a yellow-fever vaccine, with favorable progression. Diagnosis is based on the chronology of clinical and paraclinical signs and the presence of yellow-fever-specific antibodies in CSF.

24603736,Risk factors associated with hantavirosis fatality: a regional analysis from a case-control study in Brazil.,"INTRODUCTION: In Brazil, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) has a high lethality rate that varies by region. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with fatal hantavirosis.
METHODS: This study was a case-control study that included all laboratory confirmed cases of hantavirosis. The cases were stratified by the different Brazilian regions using data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System. ""Cases"" were patients who progressed to death, whereas ""controls"" were patients who were cured. The odds ratio (OR) and the adjusted OR were calculated.
RESULTS: Overall, 158 cases and 281 controls were included in this study. In the Midwest region, the cases were 60% less likely to present with flank pain, and the time between the beginning of symptoms and death was shorter than the time between the beginning of symptoms and a cure. In the Southeast region, the cases were 60% less likely to present with thrombocytopenia or reside in rural areas compared to those who progressed to a cure. Additionally, the cases sought medical assistance, notification and investigation more quickly than the controls. In the Southern region, the cases that died were 70% less likely to be male compared to the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: HCPS manifests with nonspecific symptoms, and there are few published studies related to the condition, so determining a patient's therapeutic strategy is difficult. This study presents findings from different Brazilian regions and highlights the need for further investigations to improve comprehension about regional risk factors associated with hantavirosis and to reduce morbimortality.","['Willemann MC', 'Oliveira SV']",2014,47,1,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,Willemann MC and Oliveira SV.

24587107,"Co-circulation of multiple hemorrhagic fever diseases with distinct clinical characteristics in Dandong, China.","Hemorrhagic fevers (HF) caused by viruses and bacteria are a major public health problem in China and characterized by variable clinical manifestations, such that it is often difficult to achieve accurate diagnosis and treatment. The causes of HF in 85 patients admitted to Dandong hospital, China, between 2011-2012 were determined by serological and PCR tests. Of these, 34 patients were diagnosed with Huaiyangshan hemorrhagic fever (HYSHF), 34 with Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), one with murine typhus, and one with scrub typhus. Etiologic agents could not be determined in the 15 remaining patients. Phylogenetic analyses of recovered bacterial and viral sequences revealed that the causative infectious agents were closely related to those described in other geographical regions. As these diseases have no distinctive clinical features in their early stage, only 13 patients were initially accurately diagnosed. The distinctive clinical features of HFRS and HYSHF developed during disease progression. Enlarged lymph nodes, cough, sputum, and diarrhea were more common in HYSHF patients, while more HFRS cases presented with headache, sore throat, oliguria, percussion pain kidney area, and petechiae. Additionally, HYSHF patients displayed significantly lower levels of white blood cells (WBC), higher levels of creations kinase (CK) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), while HFRS patients presented with an elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA). These clinical features will assist in the accurate diagnosis of both HYSHF and HFRS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To observe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and to explore the predictive effects for prognosis in laboratory findings, we conducted a detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records for critical patients with HFRS complicated by ARDS, treated at the center for infectious diseases, Tangdu Hospital, between January 2008 and December 2012.
RESULTS: A total of 48 critical patients with laboratory confirmed HFRS accompanied by ARDS were enrolled in the study, including 27 survivors and 21 non-survivors, with a fatality rate of 43.75%. Thirty-one individuals (64.6%) contracted HFRS between the months of September and December. The non-survivors tended to have lower incidence of overlapping phase (P = 0.025). There were no obvious differences in the needs for mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement therapy (RRT), except for the need for vasoactive drugs between the survivors and non-survivors (P = 0.001). The non-survivors were found to have higher frequencies of encephalopathy, refractory shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), lower incidences of acute renal failure (ARF) and secondary hypertension (P<0.05). The non-survivors tended to have lower levels of serum creatinine (Scr) (P<0.001) and fibrinogen (Fib) (P = 0.003), higher incidences of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (P = 0.006) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = 0.020) and higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.015), and the laboratory parameters mentioned above reached statistical significance for predicting prognosis (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate of critical patients with HFRS complicated by ARDS emphasizes the importance of clinicians' alertness and timely initiation of systemic supportive therapy.","['Du H', 'Li J', 'Jiang W', 'Yu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J', 'Wang P', 'Bai X']",2014,9,2,PLoS One,"Du H, et al.

24555484,Detection and genetic characterization of Seoul virus from commensal brown rats in France.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, which are transmitted to humans primarily via inhalation of aerosolised virus in contaminated rodent urine and faeces. Whilst infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic, human infections can lead to two clinical manifestations, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with varying degrees of clinical severity. The incidence of rodent and human cases of Seoul virus (SEOV) in Europe has been considered to be low, and speculated to be driven by the sporadic introduction of infected brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) via ports.
METHODS: Between October 2010 and March 2012, 128 brown rats were caught at sites across the Lyon region in France.
RESULTS: SEOV RNA was detected in the lungs of 14% (95% CI 8.01-20.11) of brown rats tested using a nested pan-hantavirus RT-PCR (polymerase gene). Phylogenetic analysis supports the inclusion of the Lyon SEOV within Lineage 7 with SEOV strains originating from SE Asia and the previously reported French & Belgian SEOV strains. Sequence data obtained from the recent human SEOV case (Replonges) was most similar to that obtained from one brown rat trapped in a public park in Lyon city centre. We obtained significantly improved recovery of virus genome sequence directly from SEOV infected lung material using a simple viral enrichment approach and NGS technology.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of SEOV in two wild caught brown rats in the UK and the multiple detection of SEOV infected brown rats in the Lyon region of France, suggests that SEOV is circulating in European brown rats. Under-reporting and difficulties in identifying the hantaviruses associated with HFRS may mask the public health impact of SEOV in Europe.","['Dupinay T', 'Pounder KC', 'Ayral F', 'Laaberki MH', 'Marston DA', 'Lacôte S', 'Rey C', 'Barbet F', 'Voller K', 'Nazaret N', 'Artois M', 'Marianneau P', 'Lachuer J', 'Fooks AR', 'Pépin M', 'Legras-Lachuer C', 'McElhinney LM']",2014,11,,Virol J,"Dupinay T, et al.

24530800,Changes of accumulation profiles from PBDEs to brominated and chlorinated alternatives in marine mammals from the South China Sea.,"The present study investigated the composition profiles and levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and five PBDE alternatives in the blubber of two species of marine mammals, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) from the South China Sea. Despite the fact that PBDEs were the most predominant brominated flame retardants in the samples analyzed, decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), 1,2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), bis- (2-ethylhexyl) -tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) were all detected in both cetacean species. In addition, significantly increasing temporal shifting trends of Deca-BDE to DBDPE, Octa-BDE to BTBPE, and Deca-BDE to DP were observed in porpoise samples between 2003 and 2012 and dolphin samples between 2003 and 2011. These patterns may be attributed to the replacement of PBDEs by alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and the increasing usage of these alternatives following the restriction/voluntary withdrawal of the production and use of PBDE commercial mixtures. Our findings suggest that the study region may be a source of contamination by PBDE alternative flame retardants due to the high detection frequencies and levels of these compounds in marine mammals.","['Zhu B', 'Lai NL', 'Wai TC', 'Chan LL', 'Lam JC', 'Lam PK']",2014,66,,Environ Int,"Zhu B, et al.

24510007,Elevated serum IL-21 levels in hantavirus-infected patients correlate with the severity of the disease.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral infection caused by Hantavirus (HTV). Capillary leakage is one of the hallmarks of HTV infection. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HFRS are not completely understood. However, it has been suggested that immune mechanisms, including cytokines, might have an important role in HFRS pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the potential role of interleukin-21 (IL-21) which is a newly discovered cytokine that stimulates T-cell and B-cell responses in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Serum samples were collected from 58 patients hospitalized with laboratory-verified HTV infection and 20 healthy controls. Serum IL-21 concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IL-21 levels began to increase in the fever phase when renal damage appeared. The highest serum IL-21 level was detected in oliguric phase along with the peak degree of urinary renal impairment. When entering the polyuric phase, with gradual increase in urine and recovered renal function, the serum IL-21 level was observed to fall, returning to normal level after the renal function recovered in the convalescent phase. The serum IL-21 level was positively correlated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), suggesting that the serum IL-21 level is associated with the disease severity of HFRS. This study indicated that IL-21 may act as an important inflammatory mediator in the immunopathogenesis of HFRS. The strategy to control IL-21 may hamper the immune response in patients with HFRS.","['Chen H', 'Liu H', 'Wang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao Y']",2014,37,4,Inflammation,"Chen H, et al.

24509342,Discovery of hantaviruses in bats and insectivores and the evolution of the genus Hantavirus.,"Hantaviruses are among the most important zoonotic pathogens of humans, causing either hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). From the period 1964-2006 almost all hantaviruses had been identified in rodents, with the exception of Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) isolated from shrews sampled in India. As a consequence, rodents were considered as the natural reservoir hosts. However, over the past seven years, most of the newly found hantavirus genotypes have been from either shrews or moles. Remarkably, in recent years divergent hantaviruses have also been identified in bats sampled from both Africa and Asia. All these data indicate that hantaviruses have a broad range of natural reservoir hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of the available sequences of hantaviruses suggest that hantaviruses might have first appeared in Chiroptera (bats) or Soricomorpha (moles and shrews), before emerging in rodent species. Although rodent hantaviruses cluster according to whether their hosts are members of the Murinae and Cricetidae, the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts, indicating that cross-species transmission events have occurred at all taxonomic levels. In sum, both cross-species transmission and co-divergence have produced the high genetic diversity of hantaviruses described to date.",['Zhang YZ'],2014,187,,Virus Res,Zhang YZ.

To evaluate enhanced potency of Hantaan virus (HTNV) glycoprotein (GP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) immunogenicity by heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a recombinant adenovirus rAd-GnS0.7-pCAG-HSP70C expression vector was developed by genetically linking the HSP70 C-terminal gene (HSP70 359-610 aa, HSP70C) to the Gn and 0.7 kb fragment of the NP (aa1-274-S0.7). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with these recombinant adenoviral vectors. A series of immunological assays determined the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenoviral vectors.

The outbreak affected six students and included two deaths. The epidemiological survey revealed that both of the deceased cases were misdiagnosed initially, and treatment was delayed. Furthermore, a higher rodent population density and lower HFRS vaccine coverage were observed in the affected area, which indicates a possible role in the outbreak. Rattus norvegicus (Rn) and Mus musculus (Mm) were the predominant host populations in the area. Genotyping revealed that all HVs from patients and rodents were Hantaan virus (HTNV). Sequence analysis of the S segments revealed that the HTNVs reported in this study had high similarity with strains reported in 2011 and 1985, but these viruses diverged from a strain isolated in 1984 and the HTNV prototype strain 76-118.

24472777,HFRS and hantaviruses in the Balkans/South-East Europe.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is endemic in the Balkans with epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases that have been recorded yearly since the disease was first recognized. The incidence of Balkan HFRS is modest, with approximately one hundred cases reported in most years. Seroepidemiological investigations conducted in several Balkan countries revealed an overall seroprevalence of 6% in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1.6% in Croatia, 4% in Greece and 1.7% in Slovenia, respectively. The complex ecology of the Balkan Peninsula supports the existence of diverse rodent and insectivore species which harbor several pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses. Among them only Dobrava (DOBV) and Puumala (PUUV) viruses are associated with disease in humans. Comprehensive clinical studies compared clinical signs and symptoms between patients infected with either virus. A spectrum of clinical picture of the disease ranges from mild illness typical of PUUV infections to a severe form with fulminant hemorrhagic fever and an overall mortality rate of 9.8% among DOBV infected patients. While severe DOBV cases are recognized from Slovenia in the North to Greece in the South, PUUV infections are more frequent in northern part of the area. Balkans represent an area with a potential need for hantavirus vaccines, but due to co-existence of DOBV and PUUV causing HFRS in the same region, a universal vaccine is required.","['Avšič Županc T', 'Korva M', 'Markotić A']",2014,187,,Virus Res,"Avšič Županc T, et al.

24452006,First molecular evidence for Puumala hantavirus in Poland.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) causes mild to moderate cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and is responsible for the majority of hantavirus infections of humans in Fennoscandia, Central and Western Europe. Although there are relatively many PUUV sequences available from different European countries, little is known about the presence of this virus in Poland. During population studies in 2009 a total of 45 bank voles were trapped at three sites in north-eastern Poland, namely islands on Dejguny and Dobskie Lakes and in a forest near Mikołajki. S and M segment-specific RT-PCR assays detected PUUV RNA in three animals from the Mikołajki site. The obtained partial S and M segment sequences demonstrated the highest similarity to the corresponding segments of a PUUV strain from Latvia. Analysis of chest cavity fluid samples by IgG ELISA using a yeast-expressed PUUV nucleocapsid protein resulted in the detection of two seropositive samples, both being also RT-PCR positive.

24440318,"Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome in the New, and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the Old World: paradi(se)gm lost or regained?","Since the first clinical description in 1994 of the so-called ""Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome"" (HPS) as a ""newly recognized disease"", hantavirus infections have always been characterized as presenting in two distinct syndromes, the so-called ""Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome"" (HFRS) in the Old World, with the kidney as main target organ, in contrast to HPS in the New World, with the lung as main target organ. However, European literature mentions already since 1934 a mostly milder local HFRS form, aptly named ""nephropathia epidemica"" (NE), and caused by the prototype European hantavirus species Puumala virus (PUUV). Several NE reports dating from the 1980s and early 1990s described already non-cardiogenic HPS-like lung involvement, prior to any kidney involvement, and increasing evidence is now mounting that a considerable clinical overlap exists between HPS and HFRS. Moreover, growing immunologic insights point to common pathologic mechanisms, leading to capillary hyperpermeability, the cardinal feature of all hantavirus infections, both of the New and Old World. It is now perhaps time to reconsider the paradigm of two ""different"" syndromes caused by viruses of the same Hantavirus genus in the same Bunyaviridae family, and to agree on a common, more logical disease denomination, such as simply and briefly ""Hantavirus fever"".","['Clement J', 'Maes P', 'Van Ranst M']",2014,187,,Virus Res,"Clement J, et al.

24438436,Hantavirus disease in Germany due to infection with Dobrava-Belgrade virus genotype Kurkino.,"Members of the Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) species are hantaviruses carried by different Apodemus mice as reservoir hosts and causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. In Central Europe, the Kurkino genotype of DOBV, associated with the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, is prevalent. This paper presents the first extensive study of the serological and molecular diagnostics, epidemiology and clinics of DOBV-Kurkino infections in Central Europe. Serum samples from 570 German patients living in the habitat of A. agrarius (north and northeast Germany) and exhibiting febrile disease, were analysed. All samples were tested by ELISA, subsets of samples were also analysed by immunoblot, neutralization assay, and RT-PCR. A group of 86 individuals was confirmed as DOBV-infected. The virus neutralization assay allowed a reliable identification of DOBV antibodies during both acute and convalescent phases of infection. However, differentiation of relevant DOBV genotypes was not possible by neutralization test but required molecular analysis. Whereas DOBV IgM antibodies tend to persist in the infected organism, RNAaemia seems to be short. Nucleotide sequences were amplified from four patients, and their analysis demonstrated infection by DOBV-Kurkino. With respect to the initial results, the high degree of identity of local patient-derived and A. agrarius-derived virus sequences may allow a closer allocation of the geographical place where the human infection occurred. In contrast to moderate/severe HFRS caused by the DOBV genotypes Dobrava or Sochi, all available data showed a mild clinical course of HFRS caused by DOBV-Kurkino infection without lethal outcomes.","['Hofmann J', 'Meier M', 'Enders M', 'Führer A', 'Ettinger J', 'Klempa B', 'Schmidt S', 'Ulrich RG', 'Kruger DH']",2014,20,10,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Hofmann J, et al.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled the adult patients treated at the Republican Hospital for Infectious Diseases (Izhevsk) in 2010-2012 with diagnoses of BM-ITBB (n = 71), Lyme disease (n = 38), tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (n = 25), and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (n = 27). The Decision Tree procedure in IBM SPSS Statistics was used to analyze more than 65 variables characterizing a disease case.
RESULTS: The final decision tree had 7 dichotomous fissions in accordance with the values of several indices (presence of erythema migrans, tick bite, goat's milk consumption, sweating, vertigo, nausea, abdominal pain, as well as blood concentrations of platelets, alanine aminotransferase, and count, and urea) and formed 8 terminal nodes. The proposed algorithm provides correct classification in 95% of disease cases.

The geographic distribution of hantavirus includes the Americas, Asia, and Europe. An outbreak of Puumala hantavirus infections among U.S. military health care beneficiaries was identified by the U.S. Army Public Health Command Region-Europe at U.S. Army installations in Stuttgart, Germany, during 2012. Overall, five cases (one probable and four confirmed) were identified in three service members, one U.S. civilian employee, and one dependent family member. Four cases were hospitalized, one of whom required dialysis. The outbreak investigation revealed that all cases exercised in forested areas and most were active smokers (4 out of 5).

24421910,"Animal reservoir, natural and socioeconomic variations and the transmission of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Chenzhou, China, 2006-2010.","BACKGROUND: China has the highest incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) worldwide. Reported cases account for 90% of the total number of global cases. By 2010, approximately 1.4 million HFRS cases had been reported in China. This study aimed to explore the effect of the rodent reservoir, and natural and socioeconomic variables, on the transmission pattern of HFRS.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data on monthly HFRS cases were collected from 2006 to 2010. Dynamic rodent monitoring data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, climate data, and socioeconomic data were also obtained. Principal component analysis was performed, and the time-lag relationships between the extracted principal components and HFRS cases were analyzed. Polynomial distributed lag (PDL) models were used to fit and forecast HFRS transmission. Four principal components were extracted. Component 1 (F1) represented rodent density, the NDVI, and monthly average temperature. Component 2 (F2) represented monthly average rainfall and monthly average relative humidity. Component 3 (F3) represented rodent density and monthly average relative humidity. The last component (F4) represented gross domestic product and the urbanization rate. F2, F3, and F4 were significantly correlated, with the monthly HFRS incidence with lags of 4 months (r = -0.289, P<0.05), 5 months (r = -0.523, P<0.001), and 0 months (r = -0.376, P<0.01), respectively. F1 was correlated with the monthly HFRS incidence, with a lag of 4 months (r = 0.179, P = 0.192). Multivariate PDL modeling revealed that the four principal components were significantly associated with the transmission of HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The monthly trend in HFRS cases was significantly associated with the local rodent reservoir, climatic factors, the NDVI, and socioeconomic conditions present during the previous months. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of early warning systems for the control and prevention of HFRS and similar diseases.","['Xiao H', 'Tian HY', 'Gao LD', 'Liu HN', 'Duan LS', 'Basta N', 'Cazelles B', 'Li XJ', 'Lin XL', 'Wu HW', 'Chen BY', 'Yang HS', 'Xu B', 'Grenfell B']",2014,8,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Xiao H, et al.

These conferences have provided a forum for a synergistic group of clinicians, basic researchers, mammalogists, epidemiologists and ecologists to share their expertise and interests in all aspects of hantavirus research. Much of what is now hantavirus dogma was only conjecture when HWL organized the first conference in Seoul, Korea in 1989. Herein, we provide our reflections on key events in hantavirus research. As we come from distinct areas of the world and have had individual historical experiences, we certainly have our own geocentric opinions about the key events.

24398017,Increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke during hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: a self-controlled case series study.,"BACKGROUND: We recently observed that cardiovascular causes of death are common in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is caused by hantaviruses. However, it is not known whether HFRS is a risk factor for the acute cardiovascular events of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Personal identification numbers from the Swedish HFRS patient database (1997-2012; n=6643) were cross-linked with the National Patient Register from 1987 to 2011. Using the self-controlled case series method, we calculated the incidence rate ratio of AMI/stroke in the 21 days after HFRS against 2 different control periods either excluding (analysis 1) or including (analysis 2) fatal AMI/stroke events. The incidence rate ratios for analyses 1 and 2 for all AMI events were 5.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-11.8) and 6.02 (95% CI, 2.95-12.3) and for first AMI events were 3.53 (95% CI, 1.25-9.96) and 4.64 (95% CI, 1.83-11.77). The incidence rate ratios for analyses 1 and 2 for all stroke events were 12.93 (95% CI, 5.62-29.74) and 15.16 (95% CI, 7.21-31.87) and for first stroke events were 14.54 (95% CI, 5.87-36.04) and 17.09 (95% CI, 7.49-38.96). The majority of stroke events occurred in the first week after HFRS. Seasonal effects were not observed, and apart from 1 study, neither sex nor age interacted with the associations observed in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significantly increased risk for AMI and stroke in the immediate time period after HFRS. Therefore, HFRS patients should be carefully monitored during the acute phase of disease to ensure early recognition of symptoms of impending AMI or stroke.","['Connolly-Andersen AM', 'Hammargren E', 'Whitaker H', 'Eliasson M', 'Holmgren L', 'Klingström J', 'Ahlm C']",2014,129,12,Circulation,"Connolly-Andersen AM, et al.

Acute infection causes transient kidney injury, permeability disorder, and fluid retention, for example.
METHODS: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal peptide (NT-proBNP) during NE were investigated; disease severity and development of clinical symptoms were considered.
RESULTS: Mean concentrations were 80.2 pg/mL and 55.2 pg/mL for BNP, and 2362.5 pg/mL and 1057.0 pg/mL for NT-proBNP in males and females, respectively. Hospitalization was 6.3 versus 5.2 days (P = 0.01) and 5.9 versus 4.4 days (P = 0.01) for patients with elevated BNP (> 100 pg/mL) or NT-proBNP (> 300 pg/mL), respectively, compared to those with normal peptide concentrations. Weight change during hospitalization was -2.8 or -0.3 kg (P <0.05) in patients with elevated or normal BNP, respectively. Heart rate (r = -0.46, P = 0.001 and r = -0.37, P = 0.01), creatinine clearance (r = -0.46, P = 0.001 and r = -0.56, P = 0.000), blood haemoglobin concentration (r = -0.55, P = 0.000 and r = -0.52, P = 0.000), and C-reactive protein (r = -0.47, P = 0.001 and r = -0.36, P = 0.01) measured when the peptide samples were collected correlated with BNP and NT-proBNP, respectively.

Plasmid DNA vaccines have well established manufacturing procedures and are safe in that they are replication defective, cannot revert to virulence and cannot be transmitted from person-to-person or into the environment. In addition, DNA vaccines can be combined to form multivalent formulations and can be delivered by a variety of methods. Because of these numerous advantages, we have developed DNA vaccines expressing the envelope glycoprotein genes of hantaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). We have demonstrated that these DNA vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies in multiple laboratory animal species when delivered to skin or muscle tissues. Moreover, these vaccines delivered as active vaccines or passive vaccines (e.g., transfer of sera from vaccinated rabbits or nonhuman primates), protected hamsters from infection with HFRS-causing hantaviruses. Early clinical studies of HFRS vaccines expressing Hantaan virus or Puumala virus genes have been completed and show promise for further development.

Studies evaluating the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in tropical Norway rat populations are rare, and data on co-infection with multiple pathogens are nonexistent. Herein, we describe the prevalence of leptospiral carriage, Seoul virus (SEOV), and Bartonella spp. infection independently, in addition to the rates of co-infection among urban, slum-dwelling Norway rats in Salvador, Brazil, trapped during the rainy season from June to August of 2010. These data were complemented with previously unpublished Leptospira and SEOV prevalence information collected in 1998. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney impressions was used to identify Leptospira interrogans in 2010, whereas isolation was used in 1998, and western blotting was used to detect SEOV antibodies in 2010, whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used in 1998: in 2010, Bartonella spp. were isolated from a subsample of rats. The most common pathogen in both years was Leptospira spp. (83%, n=142 in 1998, 63%, n=84 in 2010). SEOV was detected in 18% of individuals in both 1998 and 2010 (n=78 in 1998; n=73 in 2010), and two species of Bartonella were isolated from 5 of 26 rats (19%) tested in 2010. The prevalence of all agents increased significantly with rat mass/age. Acquisition of Leptospira spp. occurred at a younger mass/age than SEOV and Bartonella spp. infection, suggesting differences in the transmission dynamics of these pathogens. These data indicate that Norway rats in Salvador serve as reservoir hosts for all three of these zoonotic pathogens and that the high prevalence of leptospiral carriage in Salvador rats poses a high degree of risk to human health.","['Costa F', 'Porter FH', 'Rodrigues G', 'Farias H', 'de Faria MT', 'Wunder EA', 'Osikowicz LM', 'Kosoy MY', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Childs JE']",2014,14,1,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Costa F, et al.

Hantavirus infection is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis, which is easy to ignore. There is a need to analyze clinical features of acute pancreatitis caused by Hantavirus.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted from May 1, 2006 to May 31, 2012 on patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome at our hospital. We reviewed these patients medical records, laboratory results and radiologic examinations to determine the prevalence and summarize clinical features of acute pancreatitis in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.
RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome during the 6-year study period. Only 2.8% (6/218) of the total hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The first symptom for all six of the patients with acute pancreatitis was fever. All six patients experienced hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia during the disease course, which was different from general acute pancreatitis. In addition, we presented two misdiagnosed clinical cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis is not a frequent complication in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.

24287104,Phylogeography and evolutionary history of rodent-borne hantaviruses.,"Hantavirus (Family Bunyaviridae) are mostly associated to rodents and transmitted to man by inhalation of aerosolized infected excreta of these animals. The human infection by hantaviruses can lead to severe diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe, and pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas. To determine the origin, spreading and evolutionary dynamics of rodent-borne hantaviruses, 190 sequences of nucleoprotein (N) of hantaviruses identified in 30 countries, from 1985 to 2010, were retrieved from the GenBank and analyzed using the BEAST program. Our evolutionary analysis indicates that current genetic diversity of N gene of rodent-borne hantaviruses probably was originated around 2000 years ago. Hantavirus harbored by Murinae and Arvicolinae subfamilies, probably, were originated in Asia 500-700 years ago and later spread toward Siberia, Europe, Africa and North America. Hantavirus carried by Neotominae subfamily, probably, emerged 500-600 years ago in Central America and spread toward North America. Finally, hantaviruses associated to Sigmodontinae occurred in Brazil 400 years ago and were, probably, originated from Neotominae-associated virus from northern South America.

24269676,Regulatory T cell response correlates with the severity of human hantavirus infection.,"OBJECTIVES: Hantaviruses are an important group of emerging zoonotic pathogens, with significant mortality rates. Immunopathology is thought to be important in hantaviral disease, but the balance between protective and harmful responses is unknown. We studied Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection, which causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with a generally mild but highly variable clinical course.
METHODS: Clinical data and blood samples were collected from 24 patients with acute PUUV infection, and analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: The patients had a significantly increased frequency of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells expressing the cell cycle marker Ki-67, but the magnitude of the effector T cell response did not correlate with disease severity. The frequency of FOXP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing Ki-67 was also increased, and likewise did not correlate with disease outcome. In contrast, the level of FOXP3 expression, a surrogate of the suppressive phenotype, had a strong positive correlation with disease severity. This correlation was also found in samples taken 6-12 months after the HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The best predictor of a severe disease course in HFRS was the FOXP3(+) Treg cell response, suggesting that the role of Treg cells in acute human hantaviral infections may be deleterious.","['Koivula TT', 'Tuulasvaara A', 'Hetemäki I', 'Mäkelä SM', 'Mustonen J', 'Sironen T', 'Vaheri A', 'Arstila TP']",2014,68,4,J Infect,"Koivula TT, et al.

24269331,Development of a SYBR Green I based one-step real-time PCR assay for the detection of Hantaan virus.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV), which belongs to the genus Hantavirus, causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) mainly in China. The diagnosis of HFRS depends on clinical manifestations and serological tests. A SYBR Green I based one-step real-time PCR assay was established in this study to detect HTNV. The HTNV standard curves were generated by plotting mean cycle threshold (Ct) values versus 10-fold serial dilutions of a previous titrated HTNV stock over a wide range of concentrations (1×10(7) to 1PFU/ml). The minimum detection limit of the assay was 1PFU/ml, and it was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. Melting curve analysis indicated that there were no primer-dimers and non-specific products in the assay. No cross-reaction was observed with Seoul virus (SEOV). The specificity of the asssay was also verified by nuleotide sequencing of the PCR products. Intra- and inter-assay variability data were analyzed to examine the reproducibility of the assay. HTNV viral loads in HFRS patients were also investigated with the assay. These results indicated that the one-step real-time PCR assay is useful for detecting HTNV and for monitoring the viral loads.","['Jiang W', 'Wang PZ', 'Yu HT', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao K', 'Du H', 'Bai XF']",2014,196,,J Virol Methods,"Jiang W, et al.

24252696,"The impact of the vaccination program for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Hu County, China.","The incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Hu County ranked third of all counties in China in 2010. Although this county has provided a HFRS vaccination program freely since 1994, the impact of HFRS remains quite substantial. In order to continue the vaccination program effectively and control HFRS, a detailed understanding of the effect of the vaccination program should be undertaken. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was employed to examine the temporal trends of HFRS incidences, mortality rate and vaccination compliance. Temporal cluster analysis was performed to detect time periods of high HFRS risk. Cross correlation analysis was conducted to detect the correlation between HFRS incidence and vaccination compliance. Wavelet analysis was employed to detect the shift of the periodicity of HFRS. Between 1971 and 2011, the HFRS incidence and mortality rate ranged from 9.53/100,000 to 300.57/100,000 and 0 to 24.91/100,000, respectively, with a fluctuating but distinctly declining trend (incidence: Z=-34.38, P<0.01; mortality rate: Z=-23.44, P<0.01). The vaccination compliance ranged from 4.55% to 83.67%, with a distinctly increasing trend (Z=1621.70, P<0.01). The most likely temporal cluster of the HFRS epidemic was between 1983 and 1988 (RR=3.44, P<0.01) or 1979-1988 (RR=3.18, P<0.01) with different maximum temporal cluster size. There was a negative correlation between HFRS incidence and vaccination compliance when the lagged year was 1 and 2 (cross correlation coefficient=-0.51 and -0.55). The periodicity of HFRS epidemic was prolonged from about 5 years during 1976-1988 to 15 years after 1988, especially after the start of HFRS vaccination in 1994. In conclusion, the increase in vaccination compliance may play an important role in HFRS control and prevention in Hu County, China.","['Xiao D', 'Wu K', 'Tan X', 'Yan T', 'Li H', 'Yan Y']",2014,32,6,Vaccine,"Xiao D, et al.

Light-vented bulbul exhibited significantly lower levels of PBDEs, DBDPE, DP, and HBB than other three bird species due to its phytophagy and the other three bird species' insectivores. PBDEs were the predominant HFRs in bird eggs, followed by DBDPE and DP. Significant negative relationship between the fraction of anti-DP and DP concentrations was observed in bird eggs, suggesting that DP levels play an important role in determining the isomeric composition.

24160911,Cardiopulmonary involvement in Puumala hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus infections cause potentially life-threatening disease in humans world-wide. Infections with American hantaviruses may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome characterised by severe cardiopulmonary distress with high mortality. Pulmonary involvement in European Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection has been reported, whereas knowledge of potential cardiac manifestations is limited. We aimed to comprehensively investigate cardiopulmonary involvement in patients with PUUV-infection.
METHODS: Twenty-seven hospitalised patients with PUUV-infection were examined with lung function tests, chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), echocardiography including speckle tracking strain rate analysis, ECG and measurements of cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) and troponin T. Patients were re-evaluated after 3 months. Twenty-five age and sex-matched volunteers acted as controls for echocardiography data.
RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients experienced respiratory symptoms as dry cough or dyspnoea. Gas diffusing capacity was impaired in most patients, significantly improving at follow-up but still subnormal in 38%. HRCT showed thoracic effusions or pulmonary oedema in 46% of the patients. Compared to controls, the main echocardiographic findings in patients during the acute phase were significantly higher pulmonary vascular resistance, higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction and impaired left atrial myocardial motion. Pathological ECG, atrial fibrillation or T-wave changes, was demonstrated in 26% of patients. NT-ProBNP concentrations were markedly increased and were inversely associated with gas diffusing capacity but positively correlated to pulmonary vascular resistance. Furthermore, patients experiencing impaired general condition at follow-up had significantly lower gas diffusing capacity and higher pulmonary vascular resistance, compared to those feeling fully recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: In a majority of patients with PUUV-infection, both cardiac and pulmonary involvement was demonstrated with implications on patients' recovery. The results demonstrate vascular leakage in the lungs that most likely is responsible for impaired gas diffusing capacity and increased pulmonary vascular resistance with secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart distress. Interestingly, NT-ProBNP was markedly elevated even in the absence of overt ventricular heart failure. The method of simultaneous investigations of important cardiac and respiratory measurements improves the interpretation of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.","['Rasmuson J', 'Lindqvist P', 'Sörensen K', 'Hedström M', 'Blomberg A', 'Ahlm C']",2013,13,,BMC Infect Dis,"Rasmuson J, et al.

24149655,"Landscape features and helminth co-infection shape bank vole immunoheterogeneity, with consequences for Puumala virus epidemiology.","Heterogeneity in environmental conditions helps to maintain genetic and phenotypic diversity in ecosystems. As such, it may explain why the capacity of animals to mount immune responses is highly variable. The quality of habitat patches, in terms of resources, parasitism, predation and habitat fragmentation may, for example, trigger trade-offs ultimately affecting the investment of individuals in various immunological pathways. We described spatial immunoheterogeneity in bank vole populations with respect to landscape features and co-infection. We focused on the consequences of this heterogeneity for the risk of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection. We assessed the expression of the Tnf-α and Mx2 genes and demonstrated a negative correlation between PUUV load and the expression of these immune genes in bank voles. Habitat heterogeneity was partly associated with differences in the expression of these genes. Levels of Mx2 were lower in large forests than in fragmented forests, possibly due to differences in parasite communities. We previously highlighted the positive association between infection with Heligmosomum mixtum and infection with PUUV. We found that Tnf-α was more strongly expressed in voles infected with PUUV than in uninfected voles or in voles co-infected with the nematode H. mixtum and PUUV. H. mixtum may limit the capacity of the vole to develop proinflammatory responses. This effect may increase the risk of PUUV infection and replication in host cells. Overall, our results suggest that close interactions between landscape features, co-infection and immune gene expression may shape PUUV epidemiology.","['Guivier E', 'Galan M', 'Henttonen H', 'Cosson JF', 'Charbonnel N']",2014,112,3,Heredity (Edinb),"Guivier E, et al.

We investigated differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatment parameters, and outcome between patients in 2012 and previous years (2007-2011). All patients diagnosed with Puumala virus infections between 2007 and 2012 using a point of care Puumala IgM test at the microbiology laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, were included. In 2012, 42 and in 2007-2011 a total of 40 patients were diagnosed with NE. In 2007-2011, patients presented more frequently with arthromyalgias (25% vs 7%, p = 0.027), while lower back pain was reported more often in 2012 (21% vs 5%, p = 0.029). Other symptoms occurred at the same rate. In 2012, patients were diagnosed significantly faster (time from first contact with a physician to diagnosis 1.3 ± 0.2 vs 2.7 ± 0.4 days, p = 0.01).

Currently, several types of inactivated HFRS vaccines are widely used, however the limited ability of these immunogen to elicit neutralizing antibodies restricts vaccine efficacy. Development of an effective vaccine to overcome this weakness is must.
METHODS: In the present study, a recombinant pseudotyped lentivirus bearing the hantaan virus (HTNV) envelope glycoproteins (GP), rLV-M, was constructed. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the rLV-M and a series of immunological assays were conducted to determine the immunogenicity of the recombinant pseudotyped lentivirus. The humoral and cell-mediated immune responses induced by rLV-M were compared with those of the inactivated HFRS vaccine.
RESULTS: Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed the rLV-M expressed target proteins in HEK-293 cells. In mice, the rLV-M efficiently induced GP-specific humoral responses and protection against HTNV infection. Furthermore, the rLV-M induced higher neutralizing antibody titers than the inactivated HFRS vaccine control.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the potential of using a pseudotyped lentivirus as a delivery vector for a hantavirus vaccine immunogen.","['Yu L', 'Bai W', 'Wu X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang L', 'Li P', 'Wang F', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang F', 'Xu Z']",2013,10,,Virol J,"Yu L, et al.

24090247,"No gender-related differences in the severity of nephropathia epidemica, Germany.","BACKGROUND: The number of cases of hantavirus disease caused by Puumala virus is increasing enormously in Germany within the last years. Men are overrepresented in hantavirus disease and differences in course and symptoms in relation to gender were reported from several countries. This study was conducted to define possible gender-specific risk factors and aspects of severity in hantavirus infections occurring in Germany.
METHODS: Characteristics, clinical parameters and symptoms were recorded in a retrospective analysis of 108 patients with serologically confirmed hantavirus infection treated in our department. This cohort corresponds in regard to age, time of infection and gender ratio to the characteristics of the overall cases reported in Germany.
RESULTS: The frequency of characteristic symptoms of hantavirus disease did not differ between males and females. The median of nadir and peak levels of clinical parameters did not exhibit relevant differences that would point to a more severe course in males or females. The clinical course and duration of hospitalization were similar for both sexes. No relevant differences in renal and pulmonary findings were observed. Males with hantavirus disease exhibited more cardiac findings than females.To compare the unequal gender distribution of the rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus disease with the gender ratio of other infectious diseases, we analyzed the gender ratio for notifiable infections according to their mode of transmission. Our data revealed a general overrepresentation of men in infections carried by arthropods and rodents.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to reports from other countries, no crucial differences in the symptoms, course or severity of hantavirus disease between infected men and female were observed in our cohort. However behavioural differences may account for the fact that men are more often affected by certain infectious diseases than females.","['Krautkrämer E', 'Grouls S', 'Urban E', 'Schnitzler P', 'Zeier M']",2013,13,,BMC Infect Dis,"Krautkrämer E, et al.

24070985,Role of nucleocapsid protein of hantaviruses in intracellular traffic of viral glycoproteins.,"To understand the role of nucleocapsid protein (NP) of hantaviruses in viral assembly, the effect of NP on intracellular traffic of viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc was investigated. Double staining of viral and host proteins in Hantaan virus (HTNV)-infected Vero E6 cells showed that Gn and Gc were localized to cis-Golgi, in which virus particles are thought to be formed. When HTNV Gn and Gc were expressed by a plasmid encoding glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which is posttranslationally cleaved into Gn and Gc, Gn was localized to cis-Golgi, whereas Gc showed diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm in 32.9% of Gc-positive cells. The ratio of the diffused Gc-positive cells was significantly decreased to 15.0% by co-expression of HTNV NP. Co-expression of HTNV GPC with NPs of other hantaviruses, such as Seoul virus, Puumala virus and Sin Nombre virus, also reduced the ratios of diffused Gc-positive cells to 13.5%, 25.2%, and 11.6%, respectively. Among amino- and carboxyl-terminally truncated HTNV NPs, NP75-429, NP116-429, NP1-333, NP1-233, and NP1-155 possessed activity to reduce the ratio of diffused Gc-positive cells, while NP155-429 and NP1-116 did not. NP30-429 has partial activity. These results indicate that amino acid region 116-155 of NP is important for the activity, although amino acid region 1-30 is partially related. Truncation of the HTNV Gc cytoplasmic tail caused an increase in diffused Gc-positive cells. In addition, the effect of coexpression of HTNV NP was weakened. These results suggest that HTNV NP has a role to promote Golgi localization of Gc through a mechanism possibly mediated by the Gc cytoplasmic tail.","['Shimizu K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Koma T', 'Yasuda SP', 'Arikawa J']",2013,178,2,Virus Res,"Shimizu K, et al.

24069862,New cases of suspected HFRS (Hantavirus infection) in south-eastern Poland.,"INTRODUCTION: HFRS--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, found in Europe, is an acute viral zoonosis due to the hantavirus infection. The disease is characterized by the triad of symptoms: sudden, febrile onset, acute renal failure and haemorrhagic diathesis. The range of hantavirus infections in humans has not been yet established on the territory of Poland. The medical literature described 18 cases of seropositive HFRS in Poland--mainly in the district of Sanok, and single cases in the districts of: Brzozów, Dębica, Krosno, Lesko, Przemyśl and Stalowa Wola.
AIM: The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis, assuming that patients hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology, located in the Regional Hospital in Przemyśl were infected with hantavirus and had HFRS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Due to the fact that patients selected for the study were not tested serologically, verification was based on statistical comparison of the retrospectively selected group of patients suspected of HFRS with the seropositive group described in the study of Nowakowska, Heyman, Knap et al. in 2009, in terms of individual symptoms prevalence in conjunction with the structure of selected clinical and epidemiological parameters.
RESULTS: 26 individuals with renal failure and influenza-like episode of several-day fever of unknown origin were indentified on the base of the retrospectively analyzed records of the patients hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology in Przemyśl between 2001-2011. The significant differences in age, frequency of selected laboratory parameters (platelet count, serum electrolytes) and oliguria were not found in both compared groups. However, the study group included the higher percentage of men. Additionally, the differences in prevalence of symptoms (cough, diarrhea), which are not considered specific for HFRS were detected. Analogously to the reference group, seasonal morbidity was observed also in the study group, but the peak intensity was delayed for 4 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis cannot be rejected that, the group analyzed in the prestent study, hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology in the Regional Hospital in Przemyśl--is the sample of patients with HFRS (similarly to the group described by Nowakowska et al.). The cases described in this study can be considered as suspected of HFRS. It is justifiable to perform serological testing in these individuals.","['Gut AK', 'Gut R', 'Pencuła M', 'Jarosz MJ']",2013,20,3,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Gut AK, et al.

24040126,Elevated plasma soluble Sema4D/CD100 levels are associated with disease severity in patients of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) could cause a severe lethal hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Despite a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of HFRS, the importance of host-related immune responses in the pathogenesis of HFRS has been widely recognized. CD100/Sema4D has been demonstrated to play an important role in physiological and pathological immune responses, but the functional role of CD100 in infectious diseases has only been inadequately reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological significance of CD100 in patients after HTNV infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood samples were collected from 99 hospitalized patients in Tangdu Hospital and 27 health controls. The level of soluble CD100 (sCD100) in plasma were quantified by ELISA and the relationship between sCD100 and the disease course or severity were analyzed. The expressions of membrane CD100 on various subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that sCD100 level in acute phase of HFRS was significantly higher in patients than that in healthy controls (P<0.0001) and the sCD100 level declined in convalescent phase. Multivariate model analysis showed that platelet count, white blood cell count, serum creatinine level and blood urea nitrogen level were associated with sCD100 levels and contributed independently to the elevated sCD100 levels. The expression of membrane CD100 on PBMCs decreased in the acute phase of HFRS patients compared with that of the normal controls and recovered in the convalescent phase.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the elevated level of plasma sCD100 in HFRS patients and the elevated level might be a result from the shedding of membrane CD100 on PBMC. The elevated level of sCD100 was associated with disease severity, suggesting that sCD100 might be a cause or a consequence of progression of HFRS. The underlying mechanisms should be explored further.","['Liu B', 'Ma Y', 'Yi J', 'Xu Z', 'Zhang YS', 'Zhang C', 'Zhuang R', 'Yu H', 'Wang J', 'Yang A', 'Zhang Y', 'Jin B']",2013,8,9,PLoS One,"Liu B, et al.

Monthly notified HFRS cases and climatic data for 2001-2009 in Heilongjiang Province were collected. Using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we found that relative humidity with a one-month lag (β = -0.010, P = 0.003) and a three-month lag (β = 0.008, P = 0.003), maximum temperature with a two-month lag (β = 0.082, P = 0.028), and southern oscillation index with a two-month lag (β = -0.048, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with HFRS transmission. Our study also showed that predicted values expected under the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model were highly consistent with observed values (Adjusted R(2) = 83%, root mean squared error = 108). Thus, findings may help add to the knowledge gap of the role of climate factors in HFRS transmission in China and also assist national local health authorities in the development/refinement of a better strategy to prevent HFRS transmission.","['Li CP', 'Cui Z', 'Li SL', 'Magalhaes RJ', 'Wang BL', 'Zhang C', 'Sun HL', 'Li CY', 'Huang LY', 'Ma J', 'Zhang WY']",2013,89,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Li CP, et al.

We report a severe nonresolving chronic renal failure after protracted Dobrava hantavirus infection successfully treated with corticosteroids. Ten days after working in a basement a 33-year-old man fell seriously ill, with high fever, chills, diffuse myalgia, headache and abdominal pain. After hospital admission a diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Dobrava hantavirus was made. Acute oliguric kidney injury developed in the first 3 days after admission, in a few days diuresis restored and he became polyuric. Nevertheless renal failure persisted and he needed hemodialysis. Because of nonresolving kidney failure, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renoparenchymal arterial hypertension persisting 2 months after onset of symptoms, a kidney biopsy was performed, showing severe necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis. High dose methylprednisolone therapy was started and his renal function significantly improved. Two months later a second renal biopsy showed persisting elements of active necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis. We decided to stop corticosteroid treatment and introduced aldosterone antagonist eplerenon as anti-fibrotic agent, and his renal function further improved and remained stable.

23928646,[Comparison of direct immune-fluorescent assay and real-time quantitative PCR in detecting the Hantavirus].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences between the direct immuno-fluorescent assay (DFA) and real-time quantitative PCR in detecting the Hantavirus (HV) in rat lungs.
METHODS: From April to October in 2012, a total of 479 rats were caught by mouse-trap in residential or wild areas in Huxian, Jingyang, and Meixian of Shaanxi province, where haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) was highly prevalent. The rats were dissected to take the two lungs, one was frozen and applied immuno-fluorescent assay to detect HV antigen while the other one was extracted its RNA and detected HV nucleic acid by real-time quantitative PCR. Then we compared the positive rate of the two methods.
RESULTS: Out of the 479 rats, 105 were caught from residential areas and the other 374 were caught from wild areas. Among the 105 rats caught from residential areas, no HV were detected out neither by DFA nor by real-time quantitative PCR. Among the 374 wild rats, 13.1% (49/374) were detected HV positive by DFA and 14.7% (55/374) were detected HV positive by real-time quantitative PCR. The difference showed no statistical significance (χ(2) = 0.402, P = 0.526). When detecting each lung sample, the HV positive rate was 10.2% (49/479) under the detection by DFA while the HV positive rate was 11.5% (55/479) under the detection by real-time quantitative PCR. The difference had no statistical significance (χ(2) = 1.286, P = 0.257) and the consistency coefficient was 68.2% under the paired chi-square test analysis, which showed high consistency (u = 11.759, P < 0.05). The sensitivity of real-time quantitative PCR to detect HV was 77.6% (38/49) comparing with DFA as standard, and the specificity was 96.1% (413/430). Out of the 9 suspected HV positive sample detected by DFA, 6 were confirmed positive by real-time quantitative PCR and 3 were denied.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the DFA, real-time quantitative PCR could also be used to detect the infection of HV in rats, and the result might be more stable.","['Yu PB', 'Li S', 'Wei J', 'Ma CA', 'Lu XL', 'DU SQ', 'Guan LY', 'Zheng Y', 'Dong JH', 'Ma CF', 'Wang JJ']",2013,47,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Yu PB, et al.

23911296,Establishment of a novel one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid identification of RNA from the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.,"As an emerging infectious disease, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection has been found in many areas of China. Suitable laboratory diagnostic method is urgently needed in clinical detections and epidemiological investigations. In this study, a modified, low-cost and rapid visualized one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of RNA from the SFTSV has been established. In order to avoid the risk of aerosol contamination and facilitate the naked eye to observe, a microcrystalline wax-dye capsule wrapping the highly sensitive DNA fluorescence dye SYBR Green I was added to the RT-LAMP reaction tube before the initiation of the assay. The detection limit of the established RT-LAMP assay was 10 fg template RNA per reaction mixture. The RT-LAMP assay was confirmed to be high specific to SFTSV, and no cross-reaction was found with the detection of the Chikungunya fever virus, Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome virus (HFRSV), and Dengue fever virus. The assay was then applied for the detection of SFTSV RNA in 32 clinical serum samples and showed 94.4% consistence with the detection results of the real-time RT-PCR. The whole process, from sample preparation to result reporting, can be completed within 2h. This adapted, cost efficient and quick visualized RT-LAMP method is feasible for SFTSV field diagnosis in resource-limited field settings.","['Xu H', 'Zhang L', 'Shen G', 'Feng C', 'Wang X', 'Yan J', 'Zhang Y']",2013,194,1-2,J Virol Methods,"Xu H, et al.

23892100,A novel Sin Nombre virus DNA vaccine and its inclusion in a candidate pan-hantavirus vaccine against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).,"Sin Nombre virus (SNV; family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) causes a hemorrhagic fever known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America. There have been approximately 200 fatal cases of HPS in the United States since 1993, predominantly in healthy working-age males (case fatality rate 35%). There are no FDA-approved vaccines or drugs to prevent or treat HPS. Previously, we reported that hantavirus vaccines based on the full-length M gene segment of Andes virus (ANDV) for HPS in South America, and Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia, all elicited high-titer neutralizing antibodies in animal models. HFRS is more prevalent than HPS (>20,000 cases per year) but less pathogenic (case fatality rate 1-15%). Here, we report the construction and testing of a SNV full-length M gene-based DNA vaccine to prevent HPS. Rabbits vaccinated with the SNV DNA vaccine by muscle electroporation (mEP) developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, hamsters vaccinated three times with the SNV DNA vaccine using a gene gun were completely protected against SNV infection. This is the first vaccine of any kind that specifically elicits high-titer neutralizing antibodies against SNV. To test the possibility of producing a pan-hantavirus vaccine, rabbits were vaccinated by mEP with an HPS mix (ANDV and SNV plasmids), or HFRS mix (HTNV and PUUV plasmids), or HPS/HFRS mix (all four plasmids). The HPS mix and HFRS mix elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly against ANDV/SNV and HTNV/PUUV, respectively. Furthermore, the HPS/HFRS mix elicited neutralizing antibodies against all four viruses. These findings demonstrate a pan-hantavirus vaccine using a mixed-plasmid DNA vaccine approach is feasible and warrants further development.","['Hooper JW', 'Josleyn M', 'Ballantyne J', 'Brocato R']",2013,31,40,Vaccine,"Hooper JW, et al.

Renal transplantation is also expanding. We aimed to study dengue in renal transplant recipients (RTR).
METHODS: We conducted a study of RTR reported to be anti-dengue immunoglobulin-M antibody positive from January 2009 to December 2010 at our institution in Karachi and follow their clinical course and outcome.
RESULTS: Median age was 28 years; 75 (73.7%) were males. Clinical presentation included fever in 82 (80.4%), gastrointestinal symptoms in 35 (34.3%), hemorrhagic complications in 9 (8.8%), and thrombocytopenia in 97 (95%), which was of >15 days duration in 24%. Fever was seen less frequently in patients on high-dose (>7.5 mg) steroids as compared with low-dose (≤7.5 mg) steroids. Forty-four patients (43%) had primary and 58 (56.8%) had secondary dengue infection. Dengue fever (DF) occurred in 90 (88%), and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) occurred in 12 (11.7%). DHF/DSS was seen in 3 (6.8%) of those with primary and in 9 (15.5%) of those with secondary infection (P < 0.22). In secondary infection, patients on cyclosporine-containing regimen had less severe disease, with DHF/DSS in 22% as opposed to DF in 59% (P < 0.04). Of 102 RTR, 68 (66.7%) had graft dysfunction, 5 of whom died. Of the remaining 63, in 54 patients (85.7%) creatinine returned to baseline by an average of 12.6 days. Of 102 patients, 95 (93%) recovered and 7 (6.9%) died, 6 of whom had bacteremia with sepsis and 1 had respiratory failure. None died due to dengue infection alone.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in RTR without life-threatening co-morbidities, the clinical course of dengue infection is mild, with good recovery and preserved renal function.","['Nasim A', 'Anis S', 'Baqi S', 'Akhtar SF', 'Baig-Ansari N']",2013,15,5,Transpl Infect Dis,"Nasim A, et al.

23874198,Endothelial cell permeability during hantavirus infection involves factor XII-dependent increased activation of the kallikrein-kinin system.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) are diseases caused by hantavirus infections and are characterized by vascular leakage due to alterations of the endothelial barrier. Hantavirus-infected endothelial cells (EC) display no overt cytopathology; consequently, pathogenesis models have focused either on the influx of immune cells and release of cytokines or on increased degradation of the adherens junction protein, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, due to hantavirus-mediated hypersensitization of EC to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To examine endothelial leakage in a relevant in vitro system, we co-cultured endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) to generate capillary blood vessel-like structures. In contrast to results obtained in monolayers of cultured EC, we found that despite viral replication in both cell types as well as the presence of VEGF, infected in vitro vessels neither lost integrity nor displayed evidence of VE-cadherin degradation. Here, we present evidence for a novel mechanism of hantavirus-induced vascular leakage involving activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). We show that incubation of factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein (PK), and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) plasma proteins with hantavirus-infected EC results in increased cleavage of HK, higher enzymatic activities of FXIIa/kallikrein (KAL) and increased liberation of bradykinin (BK). Measuring cell permeability in real-time using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), we identified dramatic increases in endothelial cell permeability after KKS activation and liberation of BK. Furthermore, the alterations in permeability could be prevented using inhibitors that directly block BK binding, the activity of FXIIa, or the activity of KAL. Lastly, FXII binding and autoactivation is increased on the surface of hantavirus-infected EC. These data are the first to demonstrate KKS activation during hantavirus infection and could have profound implications for treatment of hantavirus infections.","['Taylor SL', 'Wahl-Jensen V', 'Copeland AM', 'Jahrling PB', 'Schmaljohn CS']",2013,9,7,PLoS Pathog,"Taylor SL, et al.

Significant correlation between PBDEs and DBDPE indicated that they may have the similar emission sources. The production and use of DBDPE is growing rapidly and comparable concentrations between PBDEs and DBDPE in YRD sediment may suggest that DBDPE will likely become one of the major HFRs emerging in the environment in China.

Zibo City is one of the most serious affected areas in Shandong Province China with the HFRS incidence increasing sharply from 2009 to 2012. However, the hotspots of HFRS in Zibo remained unclear. Thus, a spatial analysis was conducted with the aim to explore the spatial, spatial-temporal and seasonal patterns of HFRS in Zibo from 2009 to 2012, and to provide guidance for formulating regional prevention and control strategies.
METHODS: The study was based on the reported cases of HFRS from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Annualized incidence maps and seasonal incidence maps were produced to analyze the spatial and seasonal distribution of HFRS in Zibo City. Then spatial scan statistics and space-time scan statistics were conducted to identify clusters of HFRS.
RESULTS: There were 200 cases reported in Zibo City during the 4-year study period. One most likely cluster and one secondary cluster for high incidence of HFRS were identified by the space-time analysis. And the most likely cluster was found to exist at Yiyuan County in October to December 2012. The human infections in the fall and winter reflected a seasonal characteristic pattern of Hantaan virus (HTNV) transmission. The secondary cluster was detected at the center of Zibo in May to June 2009, presenting a seasonal characteristic of Seoul virus (SEOV) transmission.
CONCLUSION: To control and prevent HFRS in Zibo city, the comprehensive preventive strategy should be implemented in the southern areas of Zibo in autumn and in the northern areas of Zibo in spring.","['Cui F', 'Wang T', 'Wang L', 'Yang S', 'Zhang L', 'Cao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu H', 'Zhai S']",2013,8,6,PLoS One,"Cui F, et al.

23819824,"Ecology and geography of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Changsha, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an important public health problem in mainland China. HFRS is particularly endemic in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan Province, with one of the highest incidences in China. The occurrence of HFRS is influenced by environmental factors. However, few studies have examined the relationship between environmental variation (such as land use changes and climate variations), rodents and HFRS occurrence. The purpose of this study is to predict the distribution of HFRS and identify the risk factors and relationship between HFRS occurrence and rodent hosts, combining ecological modeling with the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach.
METHODS: Ecological niche models (ENMs) were used to evaluate potential geographic distributions of rodent species by reconstructing details of their ecological niches in ecological dimensions, and projecting the results onto geography. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production was used to produce ENMs. Data were collected on HFRS cases in Changsha from 2005 to 2009, as well as national land survey data, surveillance data of rodents, meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).
RESULTS: The highest occurrence of HFRS was in districts with strong temperature seasonality, where elevation is below 200 m, mean annual temperature is around 17.5°C, and annual precipitation is below 1600 mm. Cultivated and urban lands in particular are associated with HFRS occurrence. Monthly NDVI values of areas predicted present is lower than areas predicted absent, with high seasonal variation. The number of HFRS cases was correlated with rodent density, and the incidence of HFRS cases in urban and forest areas was mainly associated with the density of Rattus norvegicus and Apodemus agrarius, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity between different areas shows that HFRS occurrence is affected by the intensity of human activity, climate conditions, and landscape elements. Rodent density and species composition have significant impacts on the number of HFRS cases and their distribution.","['Xiao H', 'Lin X', 'Gao L', 'Huang C', 'Tian H', 'Li N', 'Qin J', 'Zhu P', 'Chen B', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao J']",2013,13,,BMC Infect Dis,"Xiao H, et al.

The proposed method is the first one developed for such a broad range of HFRs in aquatic biota, featuring several advantages, including low solvent and sample intake, simplicity of operation, reduced cost and integration of extraction and clean-up into a single step. Under optimal conditions, 0.5g of freeze-dried sample, 0.5g of a primary-secondary amine (PSA) as solid support, a sorbent combination of 1.75g of florisil (deactivated with 5% Milli-Q water), 1.75g of acidified silica (10% (w/w) H2SO4) and 0.5g of silica, and 10mL dichloromethane as elution solvent were used. Standard addition over the extract was required however for the correct quantification due to matrix effects in the GC system, particularly for novel HFRs, that could not be compensated with the internal standards. The method afforded LODs in the range of 0.003-0.07ngg(-1) dry weight (0.0006-0.014ngg(-1) on a wet weight basis, assuming an 80% sample water content), except for decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) (0.6ngg(-1) dry weight, 0.12ngg(-1) wet weight). The accuracy of the method was evaluated with three different types of spiked mollusk species using surrogate standards and standard addition over the extract for quantification and the recoveries were in the 70-120% range, except for bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-phthalate (DEHTBP) in clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) samples (46% recovery). Moreover, the method was successfully validated with standard reference materials (SRMs) of salmon and mussel tissues for BDEs. Finally, the method was applied to the determination of HFRs in different kind of freeze-dried mollusks: mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and clam (R. philippinarum).

In the Far East regions whose fraction of all the HFRS disease cases in Russia is around 2%, the causative agents of the infection are Hantaan, Amur, Seoul hantaviruses, the natural reservoir for those are striped field mouse, Korean field mouse and brown rat. In the European part of Russia the causative agent of the infection are Puumala hantavirus as well as 2 genetic subtypes of Dobrava virus, the main reservoirs of those in the nature are bank vole, striped field mouse and Black Sea field mouse, respectively. 9 strain of Puumala and 10 strains of Dobrava virus were isolated. Based on sequencing of Dobrava virus strains significant differences were detected between Dobrava virus strains isolated from Black Sea field mouse from Sochi and striped field mouse from Lipetsk Region. Cultural inactivated vaccine against HFRS was developed and completed preclinical trials.","['Tkachenko EA', 'bernshtein AD', 'Dzagurova TK', 'Morozov VG', 'Slonova RA', 'Ivanov LI', 'Trankvilevskiĭ DV', 'Kruger D']",2013,,1,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Tkachenko EA, et al.

In this study, a chimeric gene, GcS0.7, which encodes a fusion protein containing Gc and truncated NP, was constructed as a candidate for Hantaan virus (HTNV) vaccine development. The chimeric gene was cloned into an adenoviral vector in conjunction with the powerful hybrid cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter or the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), or both. Both elements increased the expression level of the fusion protein. The rAd-GcS0.7-pCAG group demonstrated the highest fusion protein expression level, with a 2.3-fold increase compared with the unmodified adenoviral vector. To further evaluate the humoral and cellular immunity induced by the recombinant adenovirus, the antibody titers, interferon (IFN)-γ secretion level and cytotoxic T cell ratio were detected in immunized mice. The strongest HTNV‑specific humoral and cellular immune responses were detected in the rAd-GcS0.7‑pCAG group. The immunogenicity of these recombinant adenoviruses was compared with that of the inactivated vaccine through a series of immunological assays. In terms of the cellular immune responses, the rAd-GcS0.7-pCAG group even exceeded those induced by the vaccine control. The CAG hybrid promoter improved not only the expression level, but also the immunogenicity of the fusion protein, and may thus provide a promising strategy for HTNV vaccine research.","['Li K', 'Li PY', 'Wu XA', 'Zhang L', 'Liu ZY', 'Yu L', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng LF', 'Bai WT', 'Zhang FL', 'Xu ZK']",2013,32,3,Int J Mol Med,"Li K, et al.

This study aimed to explore the association between atmospheric moisture variability and the transmission of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) for the period of 1991-2010 in Changsha, China.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Wavelet analyses were performed by using monthly reported time series data of HFRS cases to detect and quantify the periodicity of HFRS. A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and a log link model were used to quantify the relationship between climate and HFRS cases, highlighting the importance of moisture conditions. There was a continuous annual oscillation mode and multi-annual cycle around 3-4 years from 1994 to 1999. There was a significant association of HFRS incidence with moisture conditions and the Multivariate El Niño-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI). Particularly, atmospheric moisture has a significant effect on the propagation of HFRS; annual incidence of HFRS was positively correlated with annual precipitation and annual mean absolute humidity.
CONCLUSIONS: The final model had good accuracy in forecasting the occurrence of HFRS and moisture condition can be used in disease surveillance and risk management to provide early warning of potential epidemics of this disease.","['Xiao H', 'Tian HY', 'Cazelles B', 'Li XJ', 'Tong SL', 'Gao LD', 'Qin JX', 'Lin XL', 'Liu HN', 'Zhang XX']",2013,7,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Xiao H, et al.

23742660,Viral load and humoral immune response in association with disease severity in Puumala hantavirus-infected patients--implications for treatment.,"Hantaviruses are the causative agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. The case fatality rate varies between different hantaviruses and can be up to 40%. At present, there is no specific treatment available. The hantavirus pathogenesis is not well understood, but most likely, both virus-mediated and host-mediated mechanisms are involved. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association among Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) viral RNA load, humoral immune response and disease severity in patients with HFRS. We performed a study of 105 PUUV-infected patients that were followed during the acute phase of disease and for up to 1-3 months later. Fifteen of the 105 patients (14%) were classified as having moderate/severe disease. A low PUUV-specific IgG response (p <0.05) and also a higher white blood cell count (p <0.001) were significantly associated with more severe disease. The PUUV RNA was detected in a majority of patient plasma samples up to 9 days after disease onset; however, PUUV RNA load or longevity of viraemia were not significantly associated with disease severity. We conclude that a low specific IgG response was associated with disease severity in patients with HFRS, whereas PUUV RNA load did not seem to affect the severity of HFRS. Our results raise the possibility of passive immunotherapy as a useful treatment for hantavirus-infected patients.","['Pettersson L', 'Thunberg T', 'Rocklöv J', 'Klingström J', 'Evander M', 'Ahlm C']",2014,20,3,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Pettersson L, et al.

A prospective study of patients with suspected HFRS patients was carried out. Sera were collected for serological evaluation by ELISA and RT-nested PCR testing. Primers were selected from the published sequence of the S segment of HTNV strain 76-118 and SEOV strain SR-11, which made it possible to obtain an amplicon of 403 bp by RT-nested PCR. The genotypic differentiations of the RT-nested PCR amplicons were carried out by RFLP. Sequence analyses of the amplicons were used to confirm the accuracy of the results obtained by RFLP. Of the 48 acute-stage sera from suspected HFRS patients, 35 were ELISA-positive while 41 were positive by RT-nested PCR. With Hind III and Hinf I, RFLP profiles of the RT-nested PCR amplicons of the 41 positive sera exhibited two patterns. 33 had RFLP profiles similar to the reference strain R22, and thus belonged to the SEOV type. The other 8 samples which were collected during October-December had RFLP profiles similar to the reference strain 76-118, and thus belonged to the HTNV type. Sequence phylogenetic analysis of RT-nested PCR amplicons revealed sdp1, sdp2 YXL-2008, and sdp3 as close relatives of HTNV strain 76-118, while sdp22 and sdp37 as close relatives of SEOV strain Z37 and strain R22 located in two separate clusters in the phylogenetic tree. These results were identical to those acquired by RFLP. RT-nested PCR integrated with RFLP was a rapid, simple, accurate method for detecting and differentiating the genotypes of Hantavirus in the acute-stage sera of suspected HFRS patients.

Being in a febrile, impaired general condition, pressure pains in the upper abdomen and flank pains were particularly noteworthy.
INVESTIGATIONS: The results of the examinations, indicating acute renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were typical of a hantavirus infection, and positive serology for the puumala virus confirmed this suspicion. Ultrasonography indicated nephritic changes in all cases. Striking and unusual, however, was the finding of an acalculous cholecystitis.
TREATMENT AND COURSE: In one of the three cases, antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone was performed, in the other two cases symptomatic therapy. The cholecystitis was closely monitored sonographically and healed without complications in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Hantavirus infections are common in an endemic area such as the Swabian Alb in Southern Germany, but an acalculous cholecystitis was rarely described in such a context. This accumulation is very remarkable, and the knowledge about it can both help to detect complications at an early stage and prevent unnecessary cases of cholecystectomy.","['Fröhlich R', 'Römmele U']",2013,138,23,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Fröhlich R and Römmele U.

23702092,Slit2-Robo4 receptor responses inhibit ANDV directed permeability of human lung microvascular endothelial cells.,"Hantaviruses nonlytically infect human endothelial cells (ECs) and cause edematous and hemorrhagic diseases. Andes virus (ANDV) causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and Hantaan virus (HTNV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Hantaviruses enhance vascular endothelial growth factor directed EC permeability resulting in the disassembly of inter-endothelial cell adherens junctions (AJs). Recent studies demonstrate that Slit2 binding to Robo1/Robo4 receptors on ECs has opposing effects on AJ disassembly and vascular fluid barrier functions. Here we demonstrate that Slit2 inhibits ANDV and HTNV induced permeability and AJ disassembly of pulmonary microvascular ECs (PMECs) by interactions with Robo4. In contrast, Slit2 had no effect on the permeability of ANDV infected human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Analysis of Robo1/Robo4 expression determined that PMECs express Robo4, but not Robo1, while HUVECs expressed both Robo4 and Robo1 receptors. SiRNA knockdown of Robo4 in PMECs prevented Slit2 inhibition of ANDV induced permeability demonstrating that Robo4 receptors determine PMEC responsiveness to Slit2. Collectively, this data demonstrates a selective role for Slit2/Robo4 responses within PMECs that inhibits ANDV induced permeability and AJ disassembly. These findings suggest Slit2s utility as a potential HPS therapeutic that stabilizes the pulmonary endothelium and antagonizes ANDV induced pulmonary edema.","['Gorbunova EE', 'Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Mackow ER']",2013,99,2,Antiviral Res,"Gorbunova EE, et al.

HFRS is considered to be distinct from hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary syndrome (HPS or HCPS), described in the New World. Here, we report a severe case, which fulfilled most, if not all, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HPS, needing non-invasive ventilation and subsequent acute hemodialysis. However, the etiological agent was PUUV, as proved by serological testing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing. Viral antigen was detected by specific anti-PUUV immunostaining, showing, for the first time, greenish intracytoplasmic inclusions in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages. This case definitely confirms that HPS can be encountered during PUUV infections. Interestingly, special findings could render the diagnosis easier, such as greenish homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions, surrounded by a fine clear halo in BAL macrophages.

23658849,Review of Dengue hemorrhagic fever fatal cases seen among adults: a retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic in many countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. The disease affects mainly children, but in recent years it is becoming more of an adult disease. Malaysia experienced a large dengue outbreak in 2006 to 2007, involving mostly adults, with a high number of deaths.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a retrospective study to examine dengue death cases in our hospital from June 2006 to October 2007 with a view to determine if there have been changes in the presentation of severe to fatal dengue. Nine of ten fatal cases involved adult females with a median age of 32 years. All had secondary dengue infection. The mean duration of illness prior to hospitalization was 4.7 days and deaths occurred at an average of 2.4 days post-admission. Gastrointestinal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, intravascular leakages and bleeding occurred in the majority of cases. DSS complicated with severe bleeding, multi-organ failure and coagulopathy were the primary causes of deaths. Seven patients presented with thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia, five of which had hemoconcentration and increased ALT and AST indicative of liver damage. Co-morbidities particularly diabetes mellitus was common in our cohort. Prominent unusual presentations included acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocarditis with pericarditis, and hemorrhages over the brain and heart.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, dengue fatalities are seen primarily in adult females with secondary dengue infection. The majority of the patients presented with common clinical and laboratory warning signs of severe dengue. Underlying co-morbidities may contribute to the rapid clinical deterioration in severe dengue. The uncommon presentations of dengue are likely a reflection of the changing demographics where adults are now more likely to contract dengue in dengue endemic regions.","['Sam SS', 'Omar SF', 'Teoh BT', 'Abd-Jamil J', 'AbuBakar S']",2013,7,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sam SS, et al.

23607444,"Epidemiology of Hantavirus infections in humans: a comprehensive, global overview.","Hantaviruses comprise an emerging global threat for public health, affecting about 30,000 humans annually. Infection may lead to Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Europe and Asia. Humans are spillover hosts, acquiring infection primarily through the inhalation of aerosolized excreta from infected rodents and insectivores. Risk factors for infection include involvement in outdoor activities, such as rural- and forest-related activities, peridomestic rodent presence, exposure to potentially infected dust and outdoor military training; prolonged, intimate contact with infected individuals promotes transmission of Andes virus, the only Hantavirus known to be transmitted from human-to-human. The total number of Hantavirus case reports is generally on the rise, as is the number of affected countries. Knowledge of the geographical distribution, regional incidence and associated risk factors of the disease are crucial for clinicians to suspect and diagnose infected individuals early on. Climatic, ecological and environmental changes are related to fluctuations in rodent populations, and subsequently to human epidemics. Thus, prevention may be enhanced by host-reservoir control and human exposure prophylaxis interventions, which likely have led to a dramatic reduction of human cases in China over the past decades; vaccination may also play a role in the future.","['Watson DC', 'Sargianou M', 'Papa A', 'Chra P', 'Starakis I', 'Panos G']",2014,40,3,Crit Rev Microbiol,"Watson DC, et al.

Reflecting the presence of all relevant small mammals serving as reservoir hosts, close to all recognized European hantaviruses occur also in Central Europe. Important human pathogens, Puumala and Dobrava-Belgrade viruses, are present and cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome of various severities.

23587219,Air pollution and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in South Korea: an ecological correlation study.,"BACKGROUND: The effects of air pollution on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and the resulting impacts on public health, have been widely studied. However, little is known about the effect of air pollution on the occurrence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne infectious disease. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between air pollution and HFRS incidence from 2001 to 2010, and estimated the significance of the correlation under the effect of climate variables.
METHODS: We obtained data regarding HFRS, particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM₁₀) as an index of air pollution, and climate variables including temperature, humidity, and precipitation from the national database of South Korea. Poisson regression models were established to predict the number of HFRS cases using air pollution and climate variables with different time lags. We then compared the ability of the climate model and the combined climate and air pollution model to predict the occurrence of HFRS.
RESULTS: The correlations between PM₁₀ and HFRS were significant in univariate analyses, although the direction of the correlations changed according to the time lags. In multivariate analyses of adjusted climate variables, the effects of PM₁₀ with time lags were different. However, PM₁₀ without time lags was selected in the final model for predicting HFRS cases. The model that combined climate and PM₁₀ data was a better predictor of HFRS cases than the model that used only climate data, for both the study period and the year 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to document an association between HFRS and PM₁₀ level.","['Han SS', 'Kim S', 'Choi Y', 'Kim S', 'Kim YS']",2013,13,,BMC Public Health,"Han SS, et al.

23555267,Hantavirus-infection confers resistance to cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis.,"Hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome (HCPS; also called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)), both human diseases with high case-fatality rates. Endothelial cells are the main targets for hantaviruses. An intriguing observation in patients with HFRS and HCPS is that on one hand the virus infection leads to strong activation of CD8 T cells and NK cells, on the other hand no obvious destruction of infected endothelial cells is observed. Here, we provide an explanation for this dichotomy by showing that hantavirus-infected endothelial cells are protected from cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated induction of apoptosis. When dissecting potential mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we discovered that the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein inhibits the enzymatic activity of both granzyme B and caspase 3. This provides a tentative explanation for the hantavirus-mediated block of cytotoxic granule-mediated apoptosis-induction, and hence the protection of infected cells from cytotoxic lymphocytes. These findings may explain why infected endothelial cells in hantavirus-infected patients are not destroyed by the strong cytotoxic lymphocyte response.","['Gupta S', 'Braun M', 'Tischler ND', 'Stoltz M', 'Sundström KB', 'Björkström NK', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Klingström J']",2013,9,3,PLoS Pathog,"Gupta S, et al.

As one of the vascular permeability cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) might mediate the hyperpermeability caused by HFRS. In the present study, the levels of serum VEGF were measured by competitive inhibition ELISA. We found variable but persistently elevated levels of VEGF throughout the various stages and types of HFRS disease, which suggested that the levels of VEGF were closely correlated to the progression of HFRS. Moreover, elevated levels of VEGF have correlation with the severity and degree of kidney damage. Therefore, to study the relationship between levels of VEGF and disease severity of patients with HFRS is helpful to clarify the pathogenesis of HFRS.","['Li M', 'Ji Y', 'Dong Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Ren H', 'Xie M']",2013,36,4,Inflammation,"Li M, et al.

23469304,HLA-A2 and B35 restricted hantaan virus nucleoprotein CD8+ T-cell epitope-specific immune response correlates with milder disease in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in humans is a serious public health concern in Asia. A potent T cell activation peptide vaccine from HTNV structure protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. However, the T cell epitopes of the HTNV restricted by the HLA alleles and the role of epitope-specific T cell response after HTNV infection remain largely unexplored.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Five well-conserved novel CD8(+) T-cell epitopes of the HTNV nucleoprotein restricted by the most popular HLA alleles in Chinese Han population were defined with interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay in 37 patients infected with HTNV during hospitalization. Two epitopes aa129-aa137 and aa131-aa139 restricted by HLA-A2 and B35, respectively, were selected to evaluate the epitope-specific CD8(+) T-cell response. HLA-peptide pentamer complex staining showed that the frequency of single epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell could be detected in patients (95% confidence interval for aa129-aa137: 0.080%-0.208%; for aa131-aa139: 0.030%-0.094%). The frequency of epitope-specific pentamer(+) CD8(+) T-cell response was much higher in mild/moderate patients than in severe/critical ones at the acute stage of the disease. Moreover, the frequency of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells at acute stage was inversely associated with the peak level of serum creatinine and was positively associated with the nadir platelet counts during the hospitalization. The intracellular cytokine staining and the proliferation assay showed that the effective epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were characterized with the production of interferon-γ, expression of CD69 and the strong capacity of proliferation.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The novel HLA class I restricted HTNV nucleoprotein epitopes-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses would be closely related with the progression and the severity of the disease, which could provide the first step toward effective peptide vaccine development against HTNV infection in humans.","['Ma Y', 'Wang J', 'Yuan B', 'Wang M', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu B', 'Yi J', 'Yang K', 'Yang A', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B']",2013,7,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ma Y, et al.

23421884,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever as causes of acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Bulgaria.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) are the 2 widespread viral hemorrhagic fevers occurring in Europe. HFRS is distributed throughout Europe, and CCHF has been reported mainly on the Balkan Peninsula and Russia. Both hemorrhagic fevers are endemic in Bulgaria. We investigated to what extent acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Bulgaria could be due to hantaviruses or to CCHF virus. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we tested serum samples from 527 patients with acute febrile illness for antibodies against hantaviruses and CCHF virus. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against hantaviruses were detected in 15 (2.8%) of the patients. Of the 15 hantavirus-positive patients, 8 (1.5%) were positive for Dobrava virus (DOBV), 5 (0.9%) were positive for Puumala virus (PUUV), and the remaining 2 were positive for both hantaviruses. A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) confirmed 4 of the 10 DOBV-positive samples. PRNT was negative for all PUUV-positive samples. Serologic evidence of recent CCHF virus infection was found in 13 (2.5%) of the patients. Interestingly, HFRS and CCHF were not only detected in well-known endemic areas of Bulgaria but also in nonendemic regions. Our results suggested that in endemic countries, CCHF and/or HFRS might appear as a nonspecific febrile illness in a certain proportion of patients.

23384818,Factors driving hantavirus emergence in Europe.,"Hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In Europe both the amplitude and the magnitude of outbreaks of HFRS have increased. The mechanisms that drive the incidences are complex and multi-factorial and only partially due to increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools. Risk determinants include reservoir ecology, virus ecology and anthropogenic factors. The dogma of one specific rodent species as primordial reservoir for a specific hantavirus is increasingly challenged. New hantaviruses have been discovered in shrews, moles and bats and increasing evidence points at host-switching events and co-circulation in multiple, sympatric reservoir species, challenging the strict rodent-virus co-evolution theory. Changing landscape attributes and climatic parameters determine fluctuations in hantavirus epidemiology, for instance through increased food availability, prolonged virus survival and decreased biodiversity.","['Reusken C', 'Heyman P']",2013,3,1,Curr Opin Virol,Reusken C and Heyman P.

METHODS: The night trapping method was used to monitor the population proportion, density and the rate of hantavirus (HV) carriers in mice in Xikou township Longyou county in August and September from 1994 to 2010. The healthy residents in Xikou township aged 16 to 60 years were recruited. The subjects were randomly selected as vaccination group and control group according to age, sex, occupational distribution (10 178 in intervention group and 16 159 in control group). Intervention group was given purified and inactivated vaccine from suckling mouse brain, while the control group received no intervention. The prevention effect was evaluated by protective rate of vaccine.
RESULTS: The mouse population was stable in the sixteen years and the apodemus agrarius was the main type (76.5% (564/737)). The average density of mouse was 4.73% (1170/24 727). The average rate of virus carrier of mouse was 3.87% (41/1033). In 1994 - 1995, the density of mouse was 22.82% (186/815) and the rate of virus carrier was 7.0% (10/143). In 2009 - 2010, the density of mouse decreased to 2.75% (119/4330) and the rate of virus carrier was 5.5% (13/237). The average antibody positive rate of mouse from 2005 to 2010 was 4.8% (35/728) and the rate was 4.4% (6/138), 0.0% (0/113), 11.8% (16/136), 1.0% (1/104), 3.7% (4/109) and 6.3% (8/128) in each year (P < 0.01).

23358234,Ecological niche modelling of bank voles in Western Europe.,"The bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the natural host of Puumala virus (PUUV) in vast areas of Europe. PUUV is one of the hantaviruses which are transmitted to humans by infected rodents. PUUV causes a general mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) called nephropathia epidemica (NE). Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases generally display clear spatial patterns due to different space-dependent factors. Land cover influences disease transmission by controlling both the spatial distribution of vectors or hosts, as well as by facilitating the human contact with them. In this study the use of ecological niche modelling (ENM) for predicting the geographical distribution of bank vole population on the basis of spatial climate information is tested. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) is used to model the ecological niche of bank voles in Western Europe. The meteorological data, land cover types and geo-referenced points representing the locations of the bank voles (latitude/longitude) in the study area are used as the primary model input value. The predictive accuracy of the bank vole ecologic niche model was significant (training accuracy of 86%). The output of the GARP models based on the 50% subsets of points used for testing the model showed an accuracy of 75%. Compared with random models, the probability of such high predictivity was low (χ(2) tests, p < 10(-6)). As such, the GARP models were predictive and the used ecologic niche model indeed indicates the ecologic requirements of bank voles. This approach successfully identified the areas of infection risk across the study area. The result suggests that the niche modelling approach can be implemented in a next step towards the development of new tools for monitoring the bank vole's population.","['Amirpour Haredasht S', 'Barrios M', 'Farifteh J', 'Maes P', 'Clement J', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Tersago K', 'Van Ranst M', 'Coppin P', 'Berckmans D', 'Aerts JM']",2013,10,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Amirpour Haredasht S, et al.

However, it is very difficult to isolate the virus from its original host, which hampers the viral characterization. This study describes an efficient method for isolating HTNV in suckling mice.
METHODS: Hantavirus-infected Apodemus agrarius were screened by quantitative real-time PCR. The homogenates of one positive rodent lung tissue were inoculated into suckling mice for virus propagation through serial passages.
RESULTS: During the three passages in suckling mice, the number of viral RNA copies/nanogram of GAPDH mRNA increased significantly ranging from 477 to 7,278 and 46 to 4,898 in the tissues of brain and lung, respectively. Hantaviral antigens could be detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay and around 100-nm virion-like structures were also observed in brain tissue by transmission electron microscopy. No nucleotide exchange was found except for one in the 3'-non-coding domain of S segment when comparing the complete genome sequences from hantavirus in the first and the third passages.

The nadir platelet count correlated moderately with the levels of peak blood urea nitrogen (r = -0.616) and serum creatinine (r = -0.589), the length of hospital stay (r = -0.599), and the number of dialysis sessions that each patient received during hospital stay (r = -0.625). By multivariate analysis, decreased nadir platelet count remained independently associated with the development of severe AKI (odds ratio, 27.57; 95% CI, 6.96-109.16; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia, rather than leukocytosis, is independently associated with subsequent severe AKI among patients with acute HTNV infection.","['Wang M', 'Wang J', 'Wang T', 'Li J', 'Hui L', 'Ha X']",2013,8,1,PLoS One,"Wang M, et al.

23290388,Development and evaluation of a broad reacting SYBR-green based quantitative real-time PCR for the detection of different hantaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses are endemic in most parts of the world and cause hundreds of thousand human cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) annually throughout Eurasia and the Americas. They are zoonotic viruses, most commonly transmitted to humans by aerosolized rodent excreta. New hantaviruses are frequently discovered in previously unknown reservoir species and geographic areas. Consequently, there is a need to improve hantavirus diagnostics.
OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the design and evaluation of a rapid and robust quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) assay able to detect a wide range of hantaviruses.
STUDY DESIGN: Primers with the potential to detect different hantaviruses were designed from conserved regions of different hantavirus L segments, as identified from multiple sequence alignments.
RESULTS: By using SYBR-green-based QRT-PCR 100-1000 target molecules of in vitro produced RNA and less than 100 copies of hantavirus RNA from different hantavirus clades and regions of the world were detected. When using the assay on clinical samples from patients with acute HFRS, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) RNA was confirmed in all previously positive samples. Notably, the broad reacting L-segment QRT-PCR also detected viral RNA in HFRS patient samples, previously negative by a QRT-PCR targeting the S segment of PUUV.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel assay provides a powerful tool for diagnosis of hantaviruses from different clades and regions and may also be useful in surveys with the purpose of finding new hantaviruses in rodent or insectivore species.","['Mohamed N', 'Nilsson E', 'Johansson P', 'Klingström J', 'Evander M', 'Ahlm C', 'Bucht G']",2013,56,4,J Clin Virol,"Mohamed N, et al.

23289396,Human puumala and dobrava hantavirus infections in the Black Sea region of Turkey: a cross-sectional study.,"This study was carried out to better understand the epidemiology of hantaviruses in a province of Turkey (Giresun) where human hantavirus disease has recently been detected. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 626 blood samples from healthy people aged 15 and 84 years old were collected both in urban and rural areas in 2009. The sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting assay, and the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). We screened the samples by an ELISA and found that 65/626 samples reacted positively for the presence of hantavirus-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Twenty of the 65 ELISA-positive samples could be confirmed by an immunobloting assay, and the overall seroprevalence was thereby calculated to 3.2% (20/626). The seroprevalence of the people living in wood areas or adobe houses 9/17 (52.9%) was significantly higher than among people living in concrete houses 10/47 (21.3%) (p=0.014). Finally, 3 of the 20 immunoblot-positive sera were confirmed as specific for the Puumala hantavirus serotype by FRNT, 1 serum was confirmed as Dobrava virus-specific, whereas 1 serum was found to be equally reactive to Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses. We will now focus on further investigations of the ecology and epidemiology of hantaviruses in humans and their carrier animals in Turkey, studies that have already been started and will be further intensified.","['Gozalan A', 'Kalaycioglu H', 'Uyar Y', 'Sevindi DF', 'Turkyilmaz B', 'Çakir V', 'Cindemir C', 'Unal B', 'Yağçi-Çağlayik D', 'Korukluoglu G', 'Ertek M', 'Heyman P', 'Lundkvist Å']",2013,13,2,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Gozalan A, et al.

Commonly used rodent models including mouse or rat models are not suitable for vaccine evaluation because the rodents are resistant to EV71 infection after they reach the age of 6 days. In this study, 21-day-old gerbils inoculated intraperitoneally (IP) with a non mouse-adapted EV71 strain developed neurological lesion-related signs including hind limb paralysis, slowness, ataxia and lethargy similar to those of central nervous system (CNS) infection of EV71 in humans. The infected gerbils eventually died of the neurological lesions and EV71 could be isolated from lung, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, spinal cord, brain cortex, brainstem and skeletal muscle. Significantly high virus replication was detected in spinal cord, brainstem and skeletal muscle by cellular analysis, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. Histopathologic changes such as neuronal degeneration, neuronal loss and neuronophagia were observed in spinal cord, brain cortex, brainstem, and skeletal muscle along with necrotizing myositis and splenic atrophy. Gerbils that received two doses of inactive whole-virus vaccine showed no EV71-specific symptoms after challenged with EV71. In contrast, gerbils that received mock vaccination died of EV71-induced neuropathology after challenged with EV71. The result indicates that gerbils can serve as a reliable disease model for evaluating safety and efficacy of EV71 vaccine.","['Yao PP', 'Qian L', 'Xia Y', 'Xu F', 'Yang ZN', 'Xie RH', 'Li X', 'Liang WF', 'Huang XX', 'Zhu ZY', 'Zhu HP']",2012,7,12,PLoS One,"Yao PP, et al.

23277320,"Current levels and composition profiles of PBDEs and alternative flame retardants in surface sediments from the Pearl River Delta, southern China: comparison with historical data.","Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and alternative flame retardants were measured in surface sediments collected during 2009-2010 from the Pearl River Delta, southern China (a large manufacturing base for electronics/electrical products), to evaluate the influence of China's RoHS directive (adopted in 2006) on their environmental occurrence. The concentrations in sediments from different water systems ranged from 3.67 to 2,520 ng/g (average of 17.1-588 ng/g) for PBDEs and from 0.22 to 5,270 ng/g (average of 11.3-454 ng/g) for the alternative retardants. Although the PBDE levels have decreased significantly compared with those in sediments collected in 2002 in this region, the levels of alternative decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) have exceeded those of BDE209 (two predominant halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in China) in the majority of sediments. This finding suggests a different contaminant pattern of HFRs in current sediments due to the replacement of the deca-BDE mixture with DBDPE in this region. In addition, sediment concentrations of discontinued PBDEs in the rural area are clearly elevated due to e-waste dismantling. The congener profiles of PBDEs in the current sediments (with more abundant lower-brominated congeners) differed substantially from those in 2002 and from the technical products, suggesting that biological or photolytic debromination of PBDEs may have occurred in the environment.","['Chen SJ', 'Feng AH', 'He MJ', 'Chen MY', 'Luo XJ', 'Mai BX']",2013,444,,Sci Total Environ,"Chen SJ, et al.

The results showed that the complete nucleotide sequence of the S gene of NA33 strain was composed of 1 693 nucleotides with TA-rich. The S gene contained one ORF, starting at position 37 and ending at position 1 326, encoding the N protein of 429 amino acid residues, and in line with HTN-based coding. Sequence comparison of the S genes between NA33 and reference hantavirus strains showed that NA33 was more homologous to Amur-like viruses than to the Hantaan (HTN) viruses or the other hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of N proteins showed that NA33 was clustered into the group of Amur-like viruses and was more similar to Far East Russia and Jilin strains isolated from Apodemus peninsulae. The phylogenetic tree indicated a certain degree of host-dependent characteristics and geographical aggregation characteristics of hantanviruses. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of N protein of NA33 had the conserved amino acid sites of Amur-like viruses.

23206462,Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor levels induce hyperpermeability of endothelial cells in hantavirus infection.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR)-2, angiopoietin (Ang)-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ levels were measured in serum samples from 68 patients with HFRS. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUEVCs) were infected by Hantaan virus (HTNV) and/or stimulated with recombinant VEGF; dextran permeability of the cells was determined. Claudin-1 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin levels were determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses.
RESULTS: Serum VEGF, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were significantly elevated, whereas sVEGFR2 and Ang-1 levels were reduced, during the acute phase of HFRS. In vitro cell permeability was unaffected by HTNV infection or VEGF stimulation alone, but the combination of HTNV infection and VEGF treatment significantly increased the permeability of endothelial cell monolayers in a time-dependent manner. Claudin-1 and VE-cadherin were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein level by combined HTNV infection and VEGF stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated VEGF induced by HTNV infection may play an important role in the vascular hyperpermeability that is characteristic of HFRS.","['Li Y', 'Wang W', 'Wang JP', 'Pan L', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu HT', 'Jiang W', 'Wang PZ', 'Bai XF']",2012,40,5,J Int Med Res,"Li Y, et al.

23202882,Using the gravity model to estimate the spatial spread of vector-borne diseases.,"The gravity models are commonly used spatial interaction models. They have been widely applied in a large set of domains dealing with interactions amongst spatial entities. The spread of vector-borne diseases is also related to the intensity of interaction between spatial entities, namely, the physical habitat of pathogens’ vectors and/or hosts, and urban areas, thus humans. This study implements the concept behind gravity models in the spatial spread of two vector-borne diseases, nephropathia epidemica and Lyme borreliosis, based on current knowledge on the transmission mechanism of these diseases. Two sources of information on vegetated systems were tested: the CORINE land cover map and MODIS NDVI. The size of vegetated areas near urban centers and a local indicator of occupation-related exposure were found significant predictors of disease risk. Both the land cover map and the space-borne dataset were suited yet not equivalent input sources to locate and measure vegetated areas of importance for disease spread. The overall results point at the compatibility of the gravity model concept and the spatial spread of vector-borne diseases.","['Barrios JM', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Maes P', 'Aerts JM', 'Farifteh J', 'Coppin P']",2012,9,12,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Barrios JM, et al.

23181849,Spatiotemporal dynamics of Puumala hantavirus in suburban reservoir rodent populations.,"The transmission of pathogens to susceptible hosts is dependent on the vector population dynamics. In Europe, bank voles (Myodes glareolus) carry Puumala hantavirus, which causes nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans. Fluctuations in bank vole populations and epidemics in humans are correlated but the main factors influencing this relationship remain unclear. In Belgium, more NE cases are reported in spring than in autumn. There is also a higher incidence of human infections during years of large vole populations. This study aimed to better understand the link between virus prevalence in the vector, vole demography, habitat quality, and human infections. Three rodent populations in different habitats bordering Brussels city, Belgium, were studied for two years. The seroprevalence in voles was influenced first by season (higher in spring), then by vole density, vole weight (a proxy for age), and capture site but not by year or sex. Moreover, voles with large maximal distance between two captures had a high probability for Puumala seropositivity. Additionally, the local vole density showed similar temporal variations as the number of NE cases in Belgium. These results showed that, while season was the main factor influencing vole seroprevalence, it was not sufficient to explain human risks. Indeed, vole density and weight, as well as the local habitat, were essential to understanding the interactions in these host-pathogen dynamics. This can, in turn, be of importance for assessing the human risks.","['Dobly A', 'Yzoard C', 'Cochez C', 'Ducoffre G', 'Aerts M', 'Roels S', 'Heyman P']",2012,37,2,J Vector Ecol,"Dobly A, et al.

23176630,Model-based prediction of nephropathia epidemica outbreaks based on climatological and vegetation data and bank vole population dynamics.,"Wildlife-originated zoonotic diseases in general are a major contributor to emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses more specifically cause thousands of human disease cases annually worldwide, while understanding and predicting human hantavirus epidemics pose numerous unsolved challenges. Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a human infection caused by Puumala virus, which is naturally carried and shed by bank voles (Myodes glareolus). The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows model-based predicting 3 months ahead of the occurrence of NE epidemics. Two data sets were utilized to develop and test the models. These data sets were concerned with NE cases in Finland and Belgium. In this study, we selected the most relevant inputs from all the available data for use in a dynamic linear regression (DLR) model. The number of NE cases in Finland were modelled using data from 1996 to 2008. The NE cases were predicted based on the time series data of average monthly air temperature (°C) and bank voles' trapping index using a DLR model. The bank voles' trapping index data were interpolated using a related dynamic harmonic regression model (DHR). Here, the DLR and DHR models used time-varying parameters. Both the DHR and DLR models were based on a unified state-space estimation framework. For the Belgium case, no time series of the bank voles' population dynamics were available. Several studies, however, have suggested that the population of bank voles is related to the variation in seed production of beech and oak trees in Northern Europe. Therefore, the NE occurrence pattern in Belgium was predicted based on a DLR model by using remotely sensed phenology parameters of broad-leaved forests, together with the oak and beech seed categories and average monthly air temperature (°C) using data from 2001 to 2009. Our results suggest that even without any knowledge about hantavirus dynamics in the host population, the time variation in NE outbreaks in Finland could be predicted 3 months ahead with a 34% mean relative prediction error (MRPE). This took into account solely the population dynamics of the carrier species (bank voles). The time series analysis also revealed that climate change, as represented by the vegetation index, changes in forest phenology derived from satellite images and directly measured air temperature, may affect the mechanics of NE transmission. NE outbreaks in Belgium were predicted 3 months ahead with a 40% MRPE, based only on the climatological and vegetation data, in this case, without any knowledge of the bank vole's population dynamics. In this research, we demonstrated that NE outbreaks can be predicted using climate and vegetation data or the bank vole's population dynamics, by using dynamic data-based models with time-varying parameters. Such a predictive modelling approach might be used as a step towards the development of new tools for the prevention of future NE outbreaks.","['Haredasht SA', 'Taylor CJ', 'Maes P', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Clement J', 'Barrios M', 'Lagrou K', 'Van Ranst M', 'Coppin P', 'Berckmans D', 'Aerts JM']",2013,60,7,Zoonoses Public Health,"Haredasht SA, et al.

Viral infections of the kidney have a negative impact not only on patients undergoing renal transplantation and immunosuppression. Besides the increasing number of patients suffering from HIV-associated nephropathy, another group of viruses infects immunocompetent patients and induces renal failure. Hantaviruses belong nowadays to the emerging zoonoses that increase in number and geographic distribution. The viruses are distributed worldwide in endemic areas and distribution seems to expand. Together with the increase in the number of cases in the last few years, the understanding of epidemiology and pathology has deepened and some concepts had to be changed. Symptoms and mortality vary between species. The classification refers to geographical distribution: New World hantaviruses causing hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and Old World hantaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Indeed, in most HFRS cases, the kidney is mainly affected and HCPS is characterized by cardiopulmonary involvement. But the picture of strict organ tropism is changing and reports of pulmonary findings and nonrenal manifestations in infections with Old World hantaviruses are increasing. However, the overall symptoms-vascular alterations and leakage-that are responsible for organ failure are characteristic for all diseases caused by hantaviruses.","['Krautkrämer E', 'Zeier M', 'Plyusnin A']",2013,83,1,Kidney Int,"Krautkrämer E, et al.

23141988,"Determination of urine tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, IL-8, and serum IL-6 in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: Double-antibody sandwich ELISA was used to determine serum interleukin (IL)-6, urine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL-8 levels in 56 patients with HFRS.
RESULTS: Serum IL-6, urine TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations in HFRS patients were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.001). The concentrations increased at fever stage, then continued to increase during the hypotension stage and peaked at the oliguria stage. The concentrations of serum IL-6, urine TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 increased according to the severity of the disease, and differed greatly among different types of the disease. Serum IL-6 had remarkable relationships with serum specific antibodies. It was positively related to serum β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr). Significant positive relationships were also found both between urine IL-6 and TNF, and between IL-6 and IL-8 (r=0.5768, p<0.05; r=0.3760, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 were activated during the course of the disease. IL-6 was associated with the immunopathological lesions caused by the hyperfunction of the humoral immune response. IL-6, IL-8 and TNF were involved in renal immune impairment. Determining them might, to a certain extent, be useful in predicting the prognosis and outcome of patients with HFRS.","['Fan W', 'Liu X', 'Yue J']",2012,16,6,Braz J Infect Dis,"Fan W, et al.

Generally, the level of serum VEGF in patients was elevated to 607.0 (542.2-671.9) pg/mL, which was dramatically higher compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). There was a rapid increase of the serum VEGF level in all patients from the fever onset to oliguric stage, at which the serum creatinine reached the peak level of the disease, indicating that VEGF may be involved in the pathogenesis of renal hyper-permeability. Moreover, the serum VEGF level at convalescent stage was positively correlated with the degree of the disease severity. The sustained high level of serum VEGF at convalescence was observed in critical HFRS patients, suggesting that VEGF would probably contribute to the renal recovery after the virus clearance. Taken together, our results suggested that the VEGF would be involved in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction at the oliguric stage after HTNV infection, but may function as a recovery factor during the convalescence to help the body self-repair of the renal injury.","['Ma Y', 'Liu B', 'Yuan B', 'Wang J', 'Yu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Yi J', 'Zhang C', 'Zhou X', 'Yang A', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin B']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Ma Y, et al.

23091554,The genetic polymorphisms of HLA are strongly correlated with the disease severity after Hantaan virus infection in the Chinese Han population.,"The polymorphism of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which is a genetic factor that influences the progression of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) after Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection, was incompletely understood. In this case-control study, 76 HFRS patients and 370 healthy controls of the Chinese Han population were typed for the HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 loci. The general variation at the HLA-DRB1 locus was associated with the onset of HFRS (P < 0.05). The increasing frequencies of HLA-DRB1∗09 and HLA-B*46-DRB1*09 in HFRS patients were observed as reproducing a previous study. Moreover, the HLA-B*51-DRB1*09 was susceptible to HFRS (P = 0.037; OR = 3.62; 95% CI: 1.00-13.18). The increasing frequencies of HLA-B*46, HLA-B*46-DRB1*09, and HLA-B*51-DRB1*09 were observed almost in severe/critical HFRS patients. The mean level of maximum serum creatinine was higher in HLA-B∗46-DRB1*09 (P = 0.011), HLA-B*51-DRB1*09 (P = 0.041), or HLA-B*46 (P = 0.011) positive patients than that in the negative patients. These findings suggest that the allele HLA-B*46 and haplotypes HLA-B*46-DRB1*09 and HLA-B*51-DRB1*09 in patients could contribute to a more severe degree of HFRS and more serious kidney injury, which improve our understanding of the HLA polymorphism for a different outcome of HTNV infection.","['Ma Y', 'Yuan B', 'Yi J', 'Zhuang R', 'Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu B', 'Wei C', 'Zhang C', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Ma Y, et al.

The fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become the touchstone for target gene quantification. In the present study, standard curves for Hantaan virus (HTNV), mouse, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were generated by serial 10-fold dilutions of the constructed recombinant plasmid pGEM-T/HTNV, pGEM-T/mouse-GAPDH, and pGEM-T/human-GAPDH, respectively. Comparisons between the indirect immunofluorescence assay and qPCR assay in the detection of HTNV-infected Vero E6 cells showed improved detection limit and sensitivity of latter method. To characterize the inhibitory effect of several conventional antivirals (arbidol and ribavirin) and unconventional antivirals (indomethacin and curcumin) on HTNV, the levels of viral RNAs were measured for 4 days post-treatment of HTNV-infected Vero E6 cells and 18 days post-inoculation of HTNV-infected suckling mice. Our results validated that HTNV was sensitive to ribavirin and arbidol treatment, while indomethacin and curcumin may also be therapeutically effective in treating HTNV infection. As a result, the establishment and application of qPCR may be a useful tool for the evaluation of potential antivirals for Hantaan virus infection in vitro and in vivo.","['Wei F', 'Li JL', 'Ling JX', 'Chen LJ', 'Li N', 'Liu YY', 'Luo F', 'Xiong HR', 'Hou W', 'Yang ZQ']",2013,46,1,Virus Genes,"Wei F, et al.

22984887,Modelling zoonotic diseases in humans: comparison of methods for hantavirus in Sweden.,"Because their distribution usually depends on the presence of more than one species, modelling zoonotic diseases in humans differs from modelling individual species distribution even though the data are similar in nature. Three approaches can be used to model spatial distributions recorded by points: based on presence/absence, presence/available or presence data. Here, we compared one or two of several existing methods for each of these approaches. Human cases of hantavirus infection reported by place of infection between 1991 and 1998 in Sweden were used as a case study. Puumala virus (PUUV), the most common hantavirus in Europe, circulates among bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In northern Sweden, it causes nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.Logistic binomial regression and boosted regression trees were used to model presence and absence data. Presence and available sites (where the disease may occur) were modelled using cross-validated logistic regression. Finally, the ecological niche model MaxEnt, based on presence-only data, was used.In our study, logistic regression had the best predictive power, followed by boosted regression trees, MaxEnt and cross-validated logistic regression. It is also the most statistically reliable but requires absence data. The cross-validated method partly avoids the issue of absence data but requires fastidious calculations. MaxEnt accounts for non-linear responses but the estimators can be complex. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are reviewed.","['Zeimes CB', 'Olsson GE', 'Ahlm C', 'Vanwambeke SO']",2012,11,,Int J Health Geogr,"Zeimes CB, et al.

METHODS: Descriptive methods were conducted to analyze the surveillance data in 2010 which were collected from the internet-based National Notifiable Disease Reporting System and 40 HFRS sentinels in China.
RESULTS: There were 9526 cases of HFRS reported in 2010 in the country with an annual morbidity of 0.71/10(5), which was higher than that reported in 2009. And the case fatality rate in 2010 was 1.24%. During the year 2010, most cases were reported in spring and autumn-winter season, with November as the peak month. The proportion of cases reported in autumn-winter season was higher than that in spring. The number of cases reported in males was higher than that in females among all the age groups, and similar pattern of mortality could be seen in most of the age groups. The percentage of cases over 60 years old had increased in recent years. Farmers were still under the highest risk. Density and the virus-carrying rate of animal hosts, as well as the infection rate were relatively stable and similar to the previous findings. As to the prevailing species, Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus were still the most common and leading animal hosts. However, the dominant species in sentinel of Yunnan were Rattus flavipectus and Eothenomys miletus respectively, and a new hantavirus called LUXV was found, namely Eothenomys miletus.
CONCLUSION: HFRS cases were widely distributed in most provinces of China, but cases mainly focus on certain areas and present the nature of aggregation.

22934002,In Search for Factors that Drive Hantavirus Epidemics.,"In Europe, hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) are small mammal-associated zoonotic and emerging pathogens that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Puumala virus, the main etiological agent carried by the bank vole Myodes glareolus is responsible for a mild form of HFRS while Dobrava virus induces less frequent but more severe cases of HFRS. Since 2000 in Europe, more than 3000 cases of HFRS have been recorded, in average, each year, which is nearly double compared to the previous decade. In addition to this upside long-term trend, significant oscillations occur. Epidemic years appear, usually every 2-4 years, with an increased incidence, generally in localized hot spots. Moreover, the virus has been identified in new areas in the recent years. A great number of surveys have been carried out in order to assess the prevalence of the infection in the reservoir host and to identify links with different biotic and abiotic factors. The factors that drive the infections are related to the density and diversity of bank vole populations, prevalence of infection in the reservoir host, viral excretion in the environment, survival of the virus outside its host, and human behavior, which affect the main transmission virus route through inhalation of infected rodent excreta. At the scale of a rodent population, the prevalence of the infection increases with the age of the individuals but also other parameters, such as sex and genetic variability, interfere. The contamination of the environment may be correlated to the number of newly infected rodents, which heavily excrete the virus. The interactions between these different parameters add to the complexity of the situation and explain the absence of reliable tools to predict epidemics. In this review, the factors that drive the epidemics of hantaviruses in Middle Europe are discussed through a panorama of the epidemiological situation in Belgium, France, and Germany.","['Heyman P', 'Thoma BR', 'Marié JL', 'Cochez C', 'Essbauer SS']",2012,3,,Front Physiol,"Heyman P, et al.

Epidemiological surveys were carried out to better understand the dynamics of hantavirus infection in humans and animals in Wuhan. During 1961-2011, a total of 21,820 HFRS cases were registered in Wuhan. The two large epidemics had occurred during 1970-1991. They reached peaks in 1973 and 1983, respectively. There have been <10 cases since 2005. The disease occurred in the whole region including the downtown areas, but mainly in two districts. Although in 1980s and 1990s HFRS cases mainly recorded in August and winter, since 2000 the disease has mainly occurred in spring and summer. In this study, hantaviruses were identified in Apodemus mice, Rattus rats, and Mus mice by indirect immunofluorescent-assay and RT-PCR. Serological and genetic analyses showed that Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) co-circulated in rodents. Phylogenetic analysis of hantaviral genome sequences revealed a novel genetic lineage of HTNV circulating in rodents in Wuhan. Another lineage of HTNV was closely related to the lineages from the provinces located in the origin and delta of Yangtze River. Remarkably, SEOV variants identified in Wuhan were more closely related to the variants found outside China. Results of the present study showed that HFRS cases in Wuhan are caused by HTNV and SEOV. Phylogenetic analysis of the hantavirus sequences revealed that a novel genetic lineage of HTNV is present in rodents in Wuhan.","['Kang YJ', 'Zhou DJ', 'Tian JH', 'Yu B', 'Guo WP', 'Wang W', 'Li MH', 'Wu TP', 'Peng JS', 'Plyusnin A', 'Zhang YZ']",2012,12,8,Infect Genet Evol,"Kang YJ, et al.

22894742,Relating land cover and spatial distribution of nephropathia epidemica and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium.,"Lyme borreliosis (LB) and nephropathia epidemica (NE) are zoonoses resulting from two different transmission mechanisms and the action of two different pathogens: the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and the Puumala virus, respectively. The landscape configuration is known to influence the spatial spread of both diseases by affecting vector demography and human exposure to infection. Yet, the connections between landscape and disease have rarely been quantified, thereby hampering the exploitation of land cover data sources to segment areas in function of risk. This study implemented a data-driven approach to relate land cover metrics and an indicator of NE/LB risk at different scales of observation of the landscape. Our results showed the suitability of the modeling approach (r² > 0.75, ρ < 0.001) and highlighted the relevance of the scale of observation in the set of landscape attributes found to influence disease risk as well as common and specific risk factors of NE and LB.","['Barrios JM', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Maes P', 'Aerts JM', 'Farifteh J', 'Coppin P']",2013,23,2,Int J Environ Health Res,"Barrios JM, et al.

The ARIMA (0, 1, 1) × (2, 1, 0)(12) models fitted exactly with the number of cases during January 1986-December 2009. The fitted model was then used to predict HFRS incidence during 2010, and the number of cases during January-December 2010 fell within the model's confidence interval for the predicted number of cases in 2010. This finding suggests that the ARIMA model fits the fluctuations in HFRS frequency and it can be used for future forecasting when applied to HFRS prevention and control.","['Li Q', 'Guo NN', 'Han ZY', 'Zhang YB', 'Qi SX', 'Xu YG', 'Wei YM', 'Han X', 'Liu YY']",2012,87,2,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Li Q, et al.

Since these analyses are unavailable in routine clinical practice, the aim of this study was to assess clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings associated with clinical presentation of disease severity.
METHODS: A total of 30 patients (27 men and 3 women), average age 40 +/- 14.9 years, treated for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2009 in Clinical Center of Serbia, were included in the study. Nine patients (30%) had mild, 14 (46.7%) moderate and 7 (23.3%) severe form of the disease; 24 (800%) recovered, 6 (20%) died in the acute phase of the illness, and 19 patients (63.3%) required hemodialysis.
RESULTS: The average titer of antiviral antibodies in patients infected with Belgrade serotype virus were significantly higher in those with severe clinical presentation. Hypotension, anuria, macrohaematuria, pulmonary infiltration, pleural effusion, hepatomegalia and positive meningeal signs were more frequent in the patients with severe form of the disease. Statistically significant differences between groups with mild, moderate and severe clinical picture were found in serum total protein, albumin, calcium, glutamate pyruvate and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase on admittance; serum creatinine and phosphorus concentration on day 14 and day 21; serum sodium and calciums on day 14; hemoglobine concentration on day 21. A statistically significant correlation was found between clinical presentation of the disease severity and platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobine concentration, serum calcium and serum transaminases on admittance. Multivariate analysis identified variables' combinations associated with clinical presentation of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that we can distinguish patients who will manifest different severities of the disease on the basis of careful consideration of laboratory and clinical findings on admission.","['Lausević M', 'Lausević Z', 'Stojimirović B']",2012,69,7,Vojnosanit Pregl,"Lausević M, et al.

22837422,"Hantaviruses in rodents and humans, Xi'an, PR China.","Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, located in north-west China, is one of the major endemic areas for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In this study, the epidemiological data of HFRS in Xi'an from 1959 to 2010, especially in the past ten years (2001-2010), were surveyed. The features of hantavirus (HV) host carriers, the molecular characteristics of the HV S gene from hosts and patients, and the genome of the viral isolate were also investigated. Data showed that there might be a ten-year cycle of HFRS in Xi'an. Although the main population group infected over the past ten years was still the 16-59-year-old male farmers, the composition of the population and geographical distribution of HFRS cases have changed slowly, accompanied by the development of environmental and socio-economic situations. Apodemus agrarius remains the dominant host of HV. The HV strains from host rodents and patients in Xi'an belonged to the Hantaan virus (HTNV); no Seoul virus strains were found. Phylogenetic analysis of the small segments of strains taken from hosts and patients, and the whole genome of a viral isolate showed that the virus circulating in Xi'an had high similarity to Guizhou strains. The study also indicated that the vaccine candidate strain A16 isolated during the past century in Xi'an might be a recombinant strain of HTNV and the Amur virus, thus it may not be an optimal vaccine strain.","['Ma C', 'Yu P', 'Nawaz M', 'Zuo S', 'Jin T', 'Li Y', 'Li J', 'Li H', 'Xu J']",2012,93,Pt 10,J Gen Virol,"Ma C, et al.

22830303,Signs of general inflammation and kidney function are associated with the ocular features of acute Puumala hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes nephropathia epidemica (NE), a type of viral haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). This febrile infection may affect the kidneys, central nervous system (CNS), and the eye. Acute illness is associated with increased tissue permeability and tissue oedema, and many patients experience reduced vision. The aim of this study was to explore the physiological events associated with the ocular features of acute NE.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 46 NE patients who were examined during the acute infection and 1 month after hospitalization. Visual acuity, refraction, intraocular pressure (IOP), and ocular dimensions were evaluated. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples were collected, brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were recorded, and HLA haplotype was analyzed. The degrees of tissue oedema and fluid imbalance were evaluated.
RESULTS: CNS examinations did not reveal the source of the ocular changes in acute NE. The plasma C-reactive protein concentration correlated with the lens thickness and the IOP. The plasma creatinine level was associated with the change in anterior chamber depth. However, oliguric and polyuric patients displayed similar ocular findings. Patients positive for the DR3-DQ2 haplotype experienced the least diminished visual acuity.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of systemic inflammation rather than CNS involvement appears to account for the ocular changes during acute PUUV infection, and the severity of kidney dysfunction may also have a significant role. In addition, the genetic properties of the host may well explain the ocular features of acute hantavirus infection.","['Hautala N', 'Kauma H', 'Rajaniemi SM', 'Sironen T', 'Vapalahti O', 'Pääkkö E', 'Karttunen A', 'Ilonen J', 'Rytky S', 'Vainio O', 'Vaheri A', 'Hautala T']",2012,44,12,Scand J Infect Dis,"Hautala N, et al.

METHODS: A total of 327 cases of HFRS diagnosed between year 2005 - 2009 were recruited in the study. Based on the demographic data, meteorological data and the data of second national land survey during the same period, a GIS landscape elements database of HFRS at the township scale of Changsha was established. Spatial-temporal cluster analysis methods were adopted to explore the influence of landscape elements on the spatial-temporal distribution of HFRS in Changsha during the year of 2005 - 2009.
RESULTS: The annual incidences of HFRS in Changsha between year 2005 - 2009 were 1.16/100 000 (70 cases), 0.95/100 000 (58 cases), 1.40/100 000(87 cases), 0.75/100 000(47 cases) and 1.02/100 000(65 cases) respectively. The results of poisson regression model analysis of principal component showed that the incidence of HFRS was positively correlated with farmland area (M = 29.00 km2) and urban and rural area (M = 6.12 km2; incidence rate ratios (IRR) = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.27 - 1.41); but negatively correlated with forestland area (M = 39.00 km2; IRR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55 - 0.81) and garden plot area (M = 0.99 km2; IRR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63 - 0.86). A significant cluster of the spatial-temporal distribution of HFRS cases was found in the study.

22775464,Hantaan virus triggers TLR4-dependent innate immune responses.,"The innate immune response induced by Hantavirus is responsible for endothelial cell dysfunction and viral pathogenicity. Recent studies demonstrate that TLR4 expression is upregulated and mediates the secretion of several cytokines in Hantaan virus (HTNV)-infected endothelial cells. To examine viral interactions with host endothelial cells and characterize the innate antiviral responses associated with Toll-like receptors, we selected TLR4 as the target molecule to investigate anti-hantavirus immunity. TLR4 mRNA-silenced EVC-304 (EVC-304 TLR4-) cells and EVC-304 cells were used to investigate signaling molecules downstream of TLR4. The expression of the adaptor protein TRIF was higher in HTNV-infected EVC-304 cells than in EVC-304 TLR4- cells. However, there was no apparent difference in the expression of MyD88 in either cell line. The transcription factors for NF-κB and IRF-3 were translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HTNV-infected EVC-304 cells, but not in HTNV-infected EVC-304 TLR4- cells. Our results demonstrate that TLR4 may play an important role in the antiviral immunity of the host against HTNV infection through an MyD88-independent signaling pathway.","['Yu HT', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Nan XP', 'Li Y', 'Wang W', 'Jiang W', 'Yang DQ', 'Su WJ', 'Wang JP', 'Wang PZ', 'Bai XF']",2012,25,5,Viral Immunol,"Yu HT, et al.

22761056,Hantavirus infections in Europe and their impact on public health.,"Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) are enveloped tri-segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses each carried by a specific rodent or insectivore host species. Several different hantaviruses known to infect humans circulate in Europe. The most common is Puumala (PUUV) carried by the bank vole; another two important, genetically closely related ones are Dobrava-Belgrade (DOBV) and Saaremaa viruses (SAAV) carried by Apodemus mice (species names follow the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses nomenclature). Of the two hantaviral diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantaviral cardiopulmonary syndrome, the European viruses cause only HFRS: DOBV with often severe symptoms and a high case fatality rate, and PUUV and SAAV more often mild disease. More than 10,000 HFRS cases are diagnosed annually in Europe and in increasing numbers. Whether this is because of increasing recognition by the medical community or due to environmental factors such as climate change, or both, is not known. Nevertheless, in large areas of Europe, the population has a considerable seroprevalence but only relatively few HFRS cases are reported. Moreover, no epidemiological data are available from many countries. We know now that cardiac, pulmonary, ocular and hormonal disorders are, besides renal changes, common during the acute stage of PUUV and DOBV infection. About 5% of hospitalized PUUV and 16%-48% of DOBV patients require dialysis and some prolonged intensive-care treatment. Although PUUV-HFRS has a low case fatality rate, complications and long-term hormonal, renal, and cardiovascular consequences commonly occur. No vaccine or specific therapy is in general use in Europe. We conclude that hantaviruses have a significant impact on public health in Europe.","['Vaheri A', 'Henttonen H', 'Voutilainen L', 'Mustonen J', 'Sironen T', 'Vapalahti O']",2013,23,1,Rev Med Virol,"Vaheri A, et al.

22711359,Genetic characterization of seoul hantavirus originated from norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in Belgium.,"Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus (cardio)pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. So far, in Europe, four pathogenic hantaviruses have been found, often in co-circulation: Puumala virus (PUUV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), Saaremaa virus (SAAV), and Seoul virus (SEOV). Of those, only PUUV was found in Belgium. Recently, in our search for hantaviruses in the Flanders region of Belgium we collected genetic and serological evidence for the presence of SEOV virus in local brown rats. In this article, the results of (phylo)genetic analysis of wild-type SEOV strain from the Flanders are presented. The analysis based on the complete S segment sequence and also partial M- and L-segment sequences revealed that the Belgian SEOV strain was related most closely to strains from France, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Cambodia (those associated with the species Rattus norvegicus) and Vietnam. Such a clustering was in perfect agreement with the results of direct sequence comparison and suggested the same evolutionary history for all three genome segments of the Belgian SEOV strain (i.e., no reassortment of genome segments). So far, SEOV has been found in two European countries, France and Belgium, and there is every reason to believe that the area of the virus distribution in Europe is not restricted to those countries.","['Plyusnina A', 'Heyman P', 'Baert K', 'Stuyck J', 'Cochez C', 'Plyusnin A']",2012,84,8,J Med Virol,"Plyusnina A, et al.

22696643,Andes virus infection of lymphatic endothelial cells causes giant cell and enhanced permeability responses that are rapamycin and vascular endothelial growth factor C sensitive.,"Hantaviruses primarily infect endothelial cells (ECs) and nonlytically cause vascular changes that result in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Acute pulmonary edema during HPS may be caused by capillary leakage and failure of lymphatic vessels to clear fluids. Uniquely regulated lymphatic ECs (LECs) control fluid clearance, although roles for lymphatics in hantavirus disease remain undetermined. Here we report that hantaviruses productively infect LECs and that LEC infection by HPS causing Andes virus (ANDV) and HFRS causing Hantaan virus (HTNV) are inhibited by α(v)β(3) integrin antibodies. Although α(v)β(3) integrins regulate permeabilizing responses directed by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), we found that only ANDV-infected LECs were hyperpermeabilized by the addition of VEGF-A. However, VEGF-C activation of LEC-specific VEGFR3 receptors blocked ANDV- and VEGF-A-induced LEC permeability. In addition, ∼75% of ANDV-infected LECs became viable mononuclear giant cells, >4 times larger than normal, in response to VEGF-A. Giant cells are associated with constitutive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, and we found that both giant LECs and LEC permeability were sensitive to rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and VEGF-C addition. These findings indicate that ANDV uniquely alters VEGFR2-mTOR signaling responses of LECs, resulting in giant cell and LEC permeability responses. This suggests that ANDV infection alters normal LEC and lymphatic vessel functions which may contribute to edematous fluid accumulation during HPS. Moreover, the ability of VEGF-C and rapamycin to normalize LEC responses suggests a potential therapeutic approach for reducing pulmonary edema and the severity of HPS following ANDV infection.","['Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Gorbunova EE', 'Mackow ER']",2012,86,16,J Virol,"Gavrilovskaya IN, et al.

In Scandinavia and northern Europe, a milder form of HFRS is prevalent, termed nephropathica epidemica (NE). HPS presents with acute respiratory failure, mild-moderate renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and reactive lymphocytosis. HFRS has pronounced renal dysfunction and less prominent respiratory involvement, with thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic findings. Both syndromes have long-term sequelae. Common symptomatology is due to underlying pathophysiology, mainly increased vascular permeability and immune activation. Laboratory and imaging markers predicting disease severity are under research, allowing for more efficient patient management. Diagnosis is presumptive, based on typical clinical findings and patient history of likely rodent exposure. Confirmation of diagnosis is by serological testing and/or RT-PCR. Treatment is mainly comprised of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal function support, with fluid and electrolyte homeostasis being crucial components of care. In HPS, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in decompensated patients has also shown to be beneficial.","['Sargianou M', 'Watson DC', 'Chra P', 'Papa A', 'Starakis I', 'Gogos C', 'Panos G']",2012,38,4,Crit Rev Microbiol,"Sargianou M, et al.

The clinical features of leptospirosis have been little studied in patients with comorbidities. Its poor outcomes are generally due to the development of serious complications, such as infection-toxic shock, acute renal and hepatic failure, massive hemorrhagic syndrome, infectious myocarditis, etc. This communication describes a case of the disease with developed irreversible complications: involvement of the kidney and heart in 1 case and that of the kidney with a fatal outcome. Leptospirosis mortality is frequently associated with delayed diagnosis due to the misunderstanding of the clinical picture of this disease (particularly in its similarity to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome). The severer acute course of the infectious process in leptospirosis is burdened with the activation of the infection foci existing in the body or the exacerbation of somatic comorbidity, which substantiates the necessity of goal-oriented early individual, background pathology-depended correction of diagnostic, etiotropic, and pathogenetic therapy, rehabilitative measures. Comorbidities in patients with leptospirosis exert a significant impact on the development of its clinical form and the course of the infectious process manifesting itself as its worsening, the more frequent and more prolonged signs ofendogenous intoxication and multiple organ dysfunction, and a larger number of nonspecific complications in the structure of causes of deaths.","['Nafeev AA', 'Nechaeva AS', 'Salina GV', 'Abbiazova VI', 'Vetlugin NI']",2012,,1,Med Parazitol (Mosk),"Nafeev AA, et al.

Serial daily blood and urine samples were collected throughout acute illness and at 2 week and 6 month convalescent visits. By univariate analyses, the maximum white blood cell count during acute illness was a risk factor for severe AKI. There were no significant associations between PUUV-induced AKI severity and platelet counts, C-reactive protein, or alanine aminotransferase levels. Maximum plasma interleukin (IL)-6, urine IL-6, and urine IL-8 concentrations were positively associated with PUUV-induced AKI. Finally, the maximum urinary sediment GATA-3 mRNA level was positively correlated with the peak fold-change in serum creatinine, regardless of AKI severity classification.

The purpose of this second EQA study is to collect updated information on the efficiency and accurateness of hantavirus serological methods applied by expert laboratories. A serum panel of 14 samples was sent to 28 participants in Europe of which 27 sent results. Performance in hantavirus diagnosis varied not only on the method used but also on the laboratories and the subclass of antibodies tested. Commercial and in-house assays performed almost equally. Enzyme immunoassays were mainly used but did not show the best performances while immunoblot assays were the less employed and showed overall better performances. IgM antibodies were not detected in 61% of the positive IgM samples and IgM detection was not performed by 7% of the laboratories indicating a risk of overlooking acute infections in patients.

Vaccination of BALb/c mice with SHP multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses. The SHP vaccine DNA was detected in many organs but not for more than 60 d. There was no risk of mutation due to integration. Thus, the SHP multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine is a potential effective and safe DNA vaccine against infection by SEOV, HTNV, and PUUV.","['Zhao C', 'Sun Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang S', 'Yu T', 'Du F', 'Yang XF', 'Luo E']",2012,8,2,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Zhao C, et al.

22407444,Dysregulation of the β3 integrin-VEGFR2 complex in Hantaan virus-directed hyperpermeability upon treatment with VEGF.,"Hantaviruses infect human endothelial cells (ECs) and are known to cause vascular-permeability-based diseases, including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The αvβ3 integrins, which are highly expressed on the surface of ECs, serve as hantavirus receptors. Specifically, the β3 integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) form a functional complex and interact with each other. Signaling through this complex causes cytoskeletal reorganization, which is one of the most important mechanisms underlying hyperpermeability. In this study, we show that VEGF dramatically enhances Hantaan virus (HTNV)-directed permeability and increases the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the disruption of junctional organizations in an EC monolayer at 3 days postinfection. HTNV infection reduced the effect of VEGF on adhesion, migration, and the upregulation of β3 expression, but the infection alone upregulated the expression of β3 and VEGFR2. These results indicate that in addition to its role in blocking β3 integrin activation as reported previously, HTNV blocks the function of the complex of VEGFR2 and β3 integrin, and the dysfunction of the complex may contribute to cytoskeletal reorganization in an HTNV-directed hyperpermeability response to VEGF.","['Wang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Pan L', 'Bai L', 'Zhuang Y', 'Huang CX', 'Wang JP', 'Yu HT', 'Wei X', 'Jiang W', 'Nan YY', 'Yang DQ', 'Su WJ', 'Wang PZ', 'Bai XF']",2012,157,6,Arch Virol,"Wang W, et al.

22363829,Fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in adults: emphasizing the evolutionary pre-fatal clinical and laboratory manifestations.,"BACKGROUND: A better description of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 309 adults with DHF, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone in 2; DSS/subarachnoid hemorrhage, Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and massive GI bleeding/Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. Fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered consciousness (≤24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, GI bleeding/massive GI bleeding, DSS, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among those experienced early altered consciousness, massive GI bleeding alone/with uremia/with E. faecalis bacteremia, and K. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. Significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory data of fatal patients were found. Massive GI bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000/µL), and 50% of the patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (PT) prolongation experienced massive GI bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights causes of fatality other than DSS in patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and/or leukocytosis. Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis.","['Lee IK', 'Liu JW', 'Yang KD']",2012,6,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lee IK, et al.

22347483,Plasma cell-free DNA levels are elevated in acute Puumala hantavirus infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome called nephropathia epidemica (NE). The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) levels and urinary cf-DNA excretion in acute NE as well as their associations with the severity of the disease.
METHODS: Total plasma cf-DNA was quantified directly in plasma of 61 patients and urine of 20 patients with acute NE. We also carried out a qualitative high-sensitivity lab-on-a-chip DNA assay in 20 patients to elucidate the appearance of cf-DNA in plasma and urine.
RESULTS: The maximum plasma cf-DNA values taken during acute NE were significantly higher than the control values taken after the hospitalization period (median 1.33 µg/ml, range 0.94-3.29 µg/ml vs. median 0.77 µg/ml, range 0.55-0.99 µg/ml, P<0.001). The maximum plasma cf-DNA levels correlated positively with maximum blood leukocyte count (r = 0.388, P = 0.002) and the length of hospital stay (r = 0.376, P = 0.003), and inversely with minimum blood platelet count (r = -0.297, P = 0.020). Qualitative analysis of plasma cf-DNA revealed that in most of the patients cf-DNA displayed a low-molecular weight appearance, corresponding to the size of apoptotic DNA (150-200 bp). The visually graded maximum cf-DNA band intensity correlated positively with the maximum quantity of total plasma cf-DNA (r = 0.513, P = 0.021). Maximum urinary excretion of cf-DNA in turn was not markedly increased during the acute phase of NE and did not correlate with any of the variables reflecting severity of the disease or with the maximum plasma cf-DNA level.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma levels of cf-DNA are elevated during acute PUUV infection and correlate with the apoptotic cf-DNA-band intensity. The plasma cf-DNA concentration correlates with some variables reflecting the severity of the disease. The urinary excretion of cf-DNA does not reflect the degree of inflammation in the kidney.","['Outinen TK', 'Kuparinen T', 'Jylhävä J', 'Leppänen S', 'Mustonen J', 'Mäkelä S', 'Pörsti I', 'Syrjänen J', 'Vaheri A', 'Hurme M']",2012,7,2,PLoS One,"Outinen TK, et al.

Clinical features of leptospirosis in patients with comorbid diseases are not studied adequately. Lethal outcomes are often caused by such serious complications as infectious-toxic shock, acute renal-hepatic failure, massive hemorrhagic syndrome, infectious myocarditis, etc. Two cases of leptospirosis with irreversible complications are reported: one case with severe lesion of the kidneys and heart, and the other case with lethal damage to the kidneys. The evidence for a severe course of leptospirosis complicated with renal insufficiency is provided. Lethal outcomes in leptospirosis are often associated with late diagnosis because of the disease manifestation similarity with such diseases as hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome. It is shown that leptospirosis runs a very severe cause in exacerbation of preexisting infection or somatic disease. The necessity of consideration of the background pathology demands an early and individual correction of diagnostic algorithms, conduction of etiotropic and pathogenetic therapy, rehabilitation measures. Comorbid diseases in leptospirosis patients have an essential negative effect on leptospirosis clinical picture, on a course of infectious process (aggravation of endogenic intoxication, polyorganic disorders, nonspecific complications).","['Nafeev AA', 'Vetlugin NI', 'Feofanova SG', 'Nechaeva AS', 'Savinova GA']",2011,83,11,Ter Arkh,"Nafeev AA, et al.

22266976,Gene expression of estrogen receptors in PBMC from patients with Puumala virus infection.,"The influence of estrogen signaling on infectious diseases is not fully known. Males seem to be more susceptible to infections than females. This has also been noted for the Scandinavian form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). To investigate the differences in estrogen receptors in relation to sex and clinical severity, 20 patients (10 males, 10 females) with confirmed PUUV infection were studied. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for analyzing mRNA expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα), ERβ, and ERβ2 (ERβ cx) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors. Blood chemistry and peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampling were performed during the acute and convalescent phases. None or very small amounts of ERβ were detected, and ERα and ERβ2 mRNA were elevated in the patient group. The samples from the males were correlated with ERβ2; the female samples, with ERα. Furthermore, the female and male samples are partly separated using multivariate statistic analysis (principal component analysis), supporting findings that clinical symptoms differ depending on sex.","['Brundin P', 'Zhao C', 'Dahlman-Wright K', 'Ahlm C', 'Evengård B']",2012,37,4,Shock,"Brundin P, et al.

In KM mice, there was no statistical difference between the death rate with CGRn9415 and that of L99, while 76-118 killed all mice even at low dosage; CGRn9415 killed all infected rats similar to L99 at the dosage of 10(5) f.f.u., while no death occurred in rats infected with 76-118 even as high as 2 × 10(5) f.f.u., suggesting that the reassortant CGRn9415 possesses similar pathogenicity as L99. Furthermore, the reassortant CGRn9415 could establish a persistent infection in both KM mice and Wistar rats more easily than 76-118 or L99. These data suggest that the reassorted hantavirus behaves more like SEOV as far as the pathogenicity is concerned.","['Chen XP', 'Yu J', 'Li MH', 'Zhao GY', 'Wang W', 'Guo WP', 'Deng XZ', 'Zhang Y', 'Fu ZF', 'Qin XC', 'Zhang YZ']",2012,93,Pt 5,J Gen Virol,"Chen XP, et al.

The volunteers were vaccinated by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) three times at four-week intervals with the HTNV DNA vaccine, the PUUV DNA vaccine or both vaccines. At each dosing, the volunteers received 8 μg DNA/4 mg gold. There were no study-related serious adverse events, and all injection site pain was graded as mild. The most commonly reported systemic adverse events were fatigue, headache, malaise, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 28, 56, 84, 140, and 180, and assayed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. In the single vaccine groups, neutralizing antibodies to HTNV or PUUV were detected in 30% or 44% of individuals, respectively. In the combined vaccine group, 56% of the volunteers developed neutralizing antibodies to one or both viruses. These results demonstrate that the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines are safe and can be immunogenic in humans when delivered by PMED.","['Boudreau EF', 'Josleyn M', 'Ullman D', 'Fisher D', 'Dalrymple L', 'Sellers-Myers K', 'Loudon P', 'Rusnak J', 'Rivard R', 'Schmaljohn C', 'Hooper JW']",2012,30,11,Vaccine,"Boudreau EF, et al.

22247383,Impact of Puumala virus infection on maturation and survival in bank voles: a capture-mark-recapture analysis.,"Many zoonotic diseases are caused by rodent-borne viruses. Major fluctuations in the transmission of these viruses have been related to large changes in reservoir host population numbers due to external factors. However, the impact of the pathogen itself on the demography of its reservoir host is often overlooked. We investigated the impact of Puumala virus (PUUV) on survival and reproductive maturation probability of its reservoir host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Three years (2004-06) of data from nine independent sites in southern Belgium were collected and analyzed with a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method that includes statistical correction for the variation in capture probability of voles. A multistate model based on four states of reproductive activity and PUUV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody status was used to estimate survival and probability of transition from one reproductive or infection state to another. Although survival estimates for reproductively active voles were similar between infected and noninfected individuals, PUUV infection in reproductively inactive voles decreased mean monthly survival by 14%. PUUV infection was associated with a threefold increase in the probability of reproductive maturation in bank voles. Moreover, the probability of PUUV IgG seroconversion was three times higher for reproductively active voles compared to reproductively inactive voles. Our model indicates that PUUV infection may alter bank vole population dynamics by affecting both survival and maturation in its host. Additional studies, using CMR methodology with shorter time intervals between trapping sessions and possibly a longer duration, are needed to confirm these findings.","['Tersago K', 'Crespin L', 'Verhagen R', 'Leirs H']",2012,48,1,J Wildl Dis,"Tersago K, et al.

Little is known about how these viruses interact with host cells, though pathogenic hantaviruses interact with α(v)β(3) integrin. To study host cell interactions and rapidly test the ability of antibodies to prevent infection, we produced HTNV and PUUV pseudovirions on a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) core. Similar to replication-competent hantaviruses, infection was low-pH-dependent. Despite broad cell tropism, several human T cell lines were poorly permissive to hantavirus pseudovirions, compared to VSV, indicating a relative block to infection at the level of entry. Stable expression of α(v)β(3) integrin in SupT1 cells did not restore infectivity. Finally, the pseudovirion system provided a rapid, quantitative, and specific method to screen for neutralizing antibodies in immune sera.","['Higa MM', 'Petersen J', 'Hooper J', 'Doms RW']",2012,423,2,Virology,"Higa MM, et al.

23908902,Epidemiologic characteristics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Mainland China from 2006 to 2010.,"OBJECTIVE: To design effective prevention and control strategies for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Mainland China, we evaluated the epidemiologic characteristics and trends of HFRS cases reported between 2006 and 2010.
METHODS: HFRS data from 1970 to 2010 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Reporting System (CNDRS). The cases analysed included clinical cases and laboratory-confirmed cases. Data was extracted for statistical analysis by time, region and profession; the incidence rate was obtained directly from CNDRS. In this study, we analysed the morbidity and mortality data of HFRS from 2006 to 2010.
RESULTS: HFRS cases trended downward from 2006 (15 098) to 2009 (8745), but exhibited a slight increase in 2010 (9526). Twenty-nine of 31 provinces reported HFRS cases between 2006 and 2010. Five provinces, namely, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning in the North-eastern, Shandong in the east, and Shaanxi in the central part of China, were characterized as high-endemic areas. Seasonal case distribution was bimodal, with peaks of cases in spring and winter. Young male farmers were the most susceptible population to HFRS. Early- to middle-aged adults (20-50 years old) represented the largest groups of HFRS cases.
CONCLUSION: The overall number of cases of HFRS in China has trended downward possibly due to national vaccine and rodent vector control programmes implemented in the past 25 years. However, this trend slowed down in the last five years. High-endemic regions and at-risk population groups still exist and will benefit from further targeted prevention strategies.","['Huang X', 'Yin H', 'Yan L', 'Wang X', 'Wang S']",2012,3,1,Western Pac Surveill Response J,"Huang X, et al.

Its etiologic agents are viruses of the genus Hantavirus of the virus family Bunyaviridae. Hypothetical ease of production and distribution of these agents, with their propensity to incapacitate victims and overwhelm health care resources, lend themselves as significant potential biological agents of terrorism. HFRS has protean clinical manifestations, which may mimic upper respiratory tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and may delay proper treatment. Sequelae of HFRS, such as hemorrhage, acute renal failure, retroperitoneal edema, pancreatitis, pulmonary edema, and neurologic symptoms, can be detected by different imaging modalities. Medical providers caring for HFRS patients must be aware of its radiologic features, which may help to confirm its clinical diagnosis.

22133347,"Temporal trend and climate factors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemic in Shenyang City, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an important infectious disease caused by different species of hantaviruses. As a rodent-borne disease with a seasonal distribution, external environmental factors including climate factors may play a significant role in its transmission. The city of Shenyang is one of the most seriously endemic areas for HFRS. Here, we characterized the dynamic temporal trend of HFRS, and identified climate-related risk factors and their roles in HFRS transmission in Shenyang, China.
METHODS: The annual and monthly cumulative numbers of HFRS cases from 2004 to 2009 were calculated and plotted to show the annual and seasonal fluctuation in Shenyang. Cross-correlation and autocorrelation analyses were performed to detect the lagged effect of climate factors on HFRS transmission and the autocorrelation of monthly HFRS cases. Principal component analysis was constructed by using climate data from 2004 to 2009 to extract principal components of climate factors to reduce co-linearity. The extracted principal components and autocorrelation terms of monthly HFRS cases were added into a multiple regression model called principal components regression model (PCR) to quantify the relationship between climate factors, autocorrelation terms and transmission of HFRS. The PCR model was compared to a general multiple regression model conducted only with climate factors as independent variables.
RESULTS: A distinctly declining temporal trend of annual HFRS incidence was identified. HFRS cases were reported every month, and the two peak periods occurred in spring (March to May) and winter (November to January), during which, nearly 75% of the HFRS cases were reported. Three principal components were extracted with a cumulative contribution rate of 86.06%. Component 1 represented MinRH0, MT1, RH1, and MWV1; component 2 represented RH2, MaxT3, and MAP3; and component 3 represented MaxT2, MAP2, and MWV2. The PCR model was composed of three principal components and two autocorrelation terms. The association between HFRS epidemics and climate factors was better explained in the PCR model (F = 446.452, P < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.75) than in the general multiple regression model (F = 223.670, P < 0.000, adjusted R2 = 0.51).
CONCLUSION: The temporal distribution of HFRS in Shenyang varied in different years with a distinctly declining trend. The monthly trends of HFRS were significantly associated with local temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, air pressure, and wind velocity of the different previous months. The model conducted in this study will make HFRS surveillance simpler and the control of HFRS more targeted in Shenyang.","['Liu X', 'Jiang B', 'Gu W', 'Liu Q']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Liu X, et al.

22133274,Polymorphisms of PAI-1 and platelet GP Ia may associate with impairment of renal function and thrombocytopenia in Puumala hantavirus infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Puumala virus (PUUV) infection is a viral hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) characterized by thrombocytopenia and acute impairment of renal function. We aimed to assess whether genetic polymorphisms of platelet antigens together with those of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) correlate with disease severity. Patients and methods 172 consecutive hospital-treated patients with serologically confirmed acute PUUV infection were included. Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa T>C (rs5918), GP Ia T>C (rs1126643), GP Ib C>T (rs6065), GP VI T>C (rs1613662), VWF A>G (rs1063856) and PAI-1 A>G (rs2227631) were genotyped. The associations of the rarer alleles with variables reflecting the severity of the disease were analyzed.
RESULTS: PAI-1G-carriers had higher maximum creatinine level compared with the non-carriers (median 213 μmol/l, range 60-1499 μmol/l vs. median 122 μmol/l, range 51-1156 μmol/l, p = 0.01). The GG-genotypes had higher creatinine levels than GA- and AA-genotypes (medians 249 μmol/l, 204 μmol/l and 122 μmol/l, respectively, p = 0.03). Polymorphisms of GP VI and VWF associated with lower creatinine levels during PUUV infection. The minor C-allele of GP Ia associated with lower platelet counts (median 44 × 10(9)/l, range 20-90 × 10(9)/l vs median 64 × 10(9)/l, range 3-238 × 10(9)/l; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism of PAI-1, a major regulator of fibrinolysis, has an adverse impact on the outcome of kidney function in PUUV-HFRS. Platelet collagen receptor GP Ia polymorphism associates with lower platelet count.","['Laine O', 'Joutsi-Korhonen L', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mikkelsson J', 'Pessi T', 'Tuomisto S', 'Huhtala H', 'Libraty D', 'Vaheri A', 'Karhunen P', 'Mustonen J']",2012,129,5,Thromb Res,"Laine O, et al.

From April 2001-December 2005, 1,848 small mammals were captured. Apodemus agrarius accounted for 92.5%, followed by Mus musculus (3.6%), Crocidura lasiura (2.1%), and Microtus fortis (1.1%). Three species of rodents were found to be antibody-positive (Ab+) for Hantaan virus (HTNV): A. agrarius (22.3%), M. musculus (9.1%), and M. fortis (5.0%). Ab+ rates for A. agrarius increased with increasing weight (age), except for those weighing <10 g. The peak HTNV transmission period in Korea coincided with the peak reproductive potential of A. agrarius during the fall (August/September) surveys. HTNV strains from DNTA were distinct from HTNV strains from the People's Republic of China. From these studies, more accurate risk assessments can be developed to better protect personnel from rodent-borne diseases.","['Klein TA', 'Kang HJ', 'Gu SH', 'Moon S', 'Shim SH', 'Park YM', 'Lee SY', 'Kim HC', 'Chong ST', ""O'Guinn M"", 'Lee JS', 'Turell MJ', 'Song JW']",2011,36,2,J Vector Ecol,"Klein TA, et al.

22111596,Identification of three novel CTL epitopes within nucleocapsid protein of Hantaan virus.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a member of the Hantavirus genus that causes human hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. The CTL response seems to play a key role in control of viral infection, but only a few HTNV epitopes recognized by the CTLs have been reported. Herein, we screened a panel of overlapping peptides covering the HTNV nucleocapsid protein by ELISPOT assays for those that can elicit IFN-γ production in vitro. Three novel CD8(+) CTL epitopes, N197-205 (RYRTAVCGL), N245-253 (KLLPDTAAV), and N258-266 (GPATNRDYL), were defined on the nucleocapsid protein and were found to be restricted by various HLA alleles including A11, A24, and B7. The epitopes were highly conserved among the reported HTNV strains and other hantanviruses, including Dobrava-Belgrade virus and Seoul virus, supporting their potential use in vaccine designs.","['Wang M', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang J', 'Lv T', 'Jin B']",2011,24,6,Viral Immunol,"Wang M, et al.

22108583,Genetic analysis of hantaviruses and their rodent hosts in central-south China.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) are two major zoonotic pathogens of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia. Hubei province, which is located in the central-south China, had been one of the most severe epidemic areas of HFRS. To investigate phylogenetic relationships, genetic diversity and geographic distribution of HTNV and SEOV in their reservoir hosts, a total of 687 rodents were trapped in this area between 2000 and 2009. Sequences of partial S- and M-segments of hantaviruses and mitochondrial D-loop gene from 30 positive samples were determined. Our data indicated that SEOV and HTNV were co-circulating in Hubei. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S- and M-segment sequences revealed two and three previously undefined lineages of SEOV, and a novel genetic lineage of HTNV, respectively. Four inter-lineage reassortment SEOVs carried by Rattus norvegicus and Apodemus agrarius were observed. It suggests that SEOV may cause spillover infections to A. agrarius naturally. The abundance of the phylogenetic lineages of SEOV suggested that central-south China was a radiation center for SEOVs.","['Liu J', 'Liu DY', 'Chen W', 'Li JL', 'Luo F', 'Li Q', 'Ling JX', 'Liu YY', 'Xiong HR', 'Ding XH', 'Hou W', 'Zhang Y', 'Li SY', 'Wang J', 'Yang ZQ']",2012,163,2,Virus Res,"Liu J, et al.

22090114,Migration of Norway rats resulted in the worldwide distribution of Seoul hantavirus today.,"Despite the worldwide distribution, most of the known Seoul viruses (SEOV) are closely related to each other. In this study, the M and the S segment sequences of SEOV were recovered from 130 lung tissue samples (mostly of Norway rats) and from six patient serum samples by reverse transcription-PCR. Genetic analysis revealed that all sequences belong to SEOV and represent 136 novel strains. Phylogenetic analysis of all available M and S segment sequences of SEOV, including 136 novel Chinese strains, revealed four distinct groups. All non-Chinese SEOV strains and most of the Chinese variants fell into the phylogroup A, while the Chinese strains originating from mountainous areas clustered into three other distinct groups (B, C, and D). We estimated that phylogroup A viruses may have arisen only within the last several centuries. All non-Chinese variants appeared to be directly originated from China. Thus, phylogroup A viruses distributed worldwide may share a recent ancestor, whereas SEOV seems to be as diversified genetically as other hantaviruses. In addition, all available mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of Norway rats, including our 44 newly recovered mtDNA sequences, were divided into two phylogenetic groups. The first group, which is associated with the group A SEOV variants, included most of rats from China and also all non-Chinese rats, while the second group consisted of a few rats originating only from mountain areas in China. We hypothesize that an ancestor of phylogroup A SEOV variants was first exported from China to Europe and then spread through the New World following the migration of Norway rats.","['Lin XD', 'Guo WP', 'Wang W', 'Zou Y', 'Hao ZY', 'Zhou DJ', 'Dong X', 'Qu YG', 'Li MH', 'Tian HF', 'Wen JF', 'Plyusnin A', 'Xu J', 'Zhang YZ']",2012,86,2,J Virol,"Lin XD, et al.

22085404,Cytokine expression during early and late phase of acute Puumala hantavirus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses of the family Bunyaviridae are emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Old World and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the New World. An immune-mediated pathogenesis is discussed for both syndromes. The aim of our study was to investigate cytokine expression during the course of acute Puumala hantavirus infection.
RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 64 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala hantavirus infection in 2010 during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-hantavirus IgG/IgM. Cytokine expression of IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TGF-β1 was analysed by ELISA during the early and late phase of acute hantavirus infection (average 6 and 12 days after onset of symptoms, respectively). A detailed description of the demographic and clinical presentation of severe hantavirus infection requiring hospitalization during the 2010 hantavirus epidemic in Germany is given. Acute hantavirus infection was characterized by significantly elevated levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1 and TNF-α in both early and late phase compared to healthy controls. From early to late phase of disease, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α significantly decreased whereas TGF-β1 levels increased. Disease severity characterized by elevated creatinine and low platelet counts was correlated with high pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α but low immunosuppressive TGF-β1 levels and vice versa .
CONCLUSION: High expression of cytokines activating T-lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages in the early phase of disease supports the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In the late phase of disease, immunosuppressive TGF-β1 level increase significantly. We suggest that delayed induction of a protective immune mechanism to downregulate a massive early pro-inflammatory immune response might contribute to the pathologies characteristic of human hantavirus infection.","['Sadeghi M', 'Eckerle I', 'Daniel V', 'Burkhardt U', 'Opelz G', 'Schnitzler P']",2011,12,,BMC Immunol,"Sadeghi M, et al.

22044619,Infection of Hantaan virus strain AA57 leading to pulmonary disease in laboratory mice.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The pathogenesis of HFRS has not been fully elucidated, mainly due to the lack of a suitable animal model. In laboratory mice, HTNV causes encephalitis. However, that symptom is dissimilar to human hantavirus infections. We found that HTNV strain AA57 (isolated from Apodemus agrarius in Far East Russia) caused pulmonary disease in 2-week-old ICR mice. The clinical signs of the infected mice were piloerection, trembling, hunching, labored breathing, and body-weight loss. A large volume of pleural effusion was collected from thoracic cavities of the dead mice. Overall, 45% of the mice inoculated with 3000 focus forming units (FFU) of the virus began to show clinical symptoms at 8 days post-inoculation, and 25% of the inoculated mice died within 3 days of onset of the disease. The morbidity and mortality rates of the mice inoculated with 30-30,000FFU of HTNV strain AA57 were roughly equivalent. The highest rates of virus positivity (11/12) and the highest titers of HTNV strain AA57 were detected in the lungs of the dead mice, while lower detection rates and viral titers were found in the heart, kidneys, spleen, and brain. Interstitial pneumonia, perivascular edema, hemorrhage, inflammatory infiltration and vascular failure were observed in the lungs of the sick mice. Hantaviral antigens were detected in the lung endothelial cells of the sick mice. The symptoms and pathology of this mouse model resemble those of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and, to a certain extent, those of HFRS. This is the first report that, in laboratory mice, the HFRS-related hantavirus causes a HPS-like disease and shares some symptom similarities with HFRS.","['Seto T', 'Nagata N', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Ichii O', 'Sanada T', 'Saasa N', 'Ozaki Y', 'Kon Y', 'Yoshii K', 'Takashima I', 'Kariwa H']",2012,163,1,Virus Res,"Seto T, et al.

To circumvent this problem, a 0.7-kb fragment of the S segment was fused to Gn, and a hybrid CAG promoter/enhancer in conjunction with (or without) the WPRE (Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element) was used to improve the expression of fusion protein GnS0.7 in the adenoviral expression system. The expression level of the fusion protein as well as the response of mice immunized with recombinant adenoviruses containing GnS0.7 was investigated. In addition, a series of immunological assays were conducted to determine the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenoviruses. The results showed that the recombinant adenovirus with the CAG promoter/enhancer (rAd-GnS0.7-pCAG) expressed approximately 2.1-fold more GnS0.7 than the unmodified recombinant adenovirus containing GnS0.7 (rAd-GnS0.7-pShuttle). This enhanced expression level was also higher than for other modified recombinant adenoviruses studied. Animal experiments showed that rAd-GnS0.7-pCAG induced a stronger Hantaan virus (HTNV)-specific humoral and cellular immune response in mice, with the cellular immune response to the GnS0.7 being stronger than the HFRS vaccine control. These results demonstrate that the CAG promoter/enhancer improved significantly the expression of the chimeric gene GnS0.7 in the adenovirus expression system. These findings may have significant implications for the development of genetically engineered vaccines for HFRS.","['Li PY', 'Yu L', 'Wu XA', 'Bai WT', 'Li K', 'Wang HT', 'Hu G', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang FL', 'Xu ZK']",2012,179,1,J Virol Methods,"Li PY, et al.

After a flu-like prodrome, this viral disease often manifests with acute kidney injury. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is discouraged during the disease, but no data from clinical investigations are available on the association between disease course and the use of analgesics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The charts of 59 patients admitted with NE to a hospital in 2007 were retrospectively analysed. Creatinine levels were compared between users of different analgesics.
RESULTS: Patients taking analgesics before admission had higher peak creatinine levels, but not after adjustment for confounders. The subgroup taking ibuprofen or diclofenac had higher initial and peak creatinine levels than the group who did not, even after adjustment for confounders.
CONCLUSION: Since NE cannot be accurately diagnosed in the early disease phase, metamizole, acetaminophen or acetylsalicylic acid may be preferable analgesics to ibuprofen or diclofenac for flu-like symptoms in endemic areas.","['Wagner R', 'Leicht-Biener U', 'Mucsi I', 'Seitz K']",2012,46,1,Scand J Urol Nephrol,"Wagner R, et al.

21958155,Are reductions in industrial organic contaminants emissions in rich countries achieved partly by export of toxic wastes?,"Recent studies show that PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) air concentrations remain surprisingly high in parts of Africa and Asia. These are regions where PCBs were never extensively used, but which are implicated as recipients of obsolete products and wastes containing PCBs and other industrial organic contaminants, such as halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). We hypothesize that there may be different trends in emissions across the globe, whereby emissions of some industrial organic contaminants may be decreasing faster in former use regions (due to emission reductions combined with uncontrolled export), at the expense of regions receiving these substances as obsolete products and wastes. We conclude that the potential for detrimental effects on the environment and human health due to long-range transport by air, water, or wastes should be of equal concern when managing and regulating industrial organic contaminants. This calls for a better integration of life-cycle approaches in the management and regulation of industrial organic contaminants in order to protect environmental and human health on a global scale. Yet, little remains known about the amounts of industrial organic contaminants exported outside former use regions as different types of wastes because of the often illicit nature of these operations.","['Breivik K', 'Gioia R', 'Chakraborty P', 'Zhang G', 'Jones KC']",2011,45,21,Environ Sci Technol,"Breivik K, et al.

High PTX3 level was also associated with several other variables reflecting the severity of the disease: patients with high PTX3 level had higher maximum blood leukocyte (16.1 vs. 9.7 × 10(9)/l, p < 0.001), plasma IL-6 (16.9 vs. 9.0 pg/ml, p = 0.007), and creatinine (282 vs. 124 μmol/l, p = 0.007) levels than patients with low maximum PTX3 level. They also had longer hospital stays (8 vs. 5 days, p = 0.015) compared to patients with low PTX3 level. High plasma PTX3 levels are associated with thrombocytopenia and the overall severity of NE.","['Outinen TK', 'Mäkelä S', 'Huhtala H', 'Hurme M', 'Meri S', 'Pörsti I', 'Sane J', 'Vaheri A', 'Syrjänen J', 'Mustonen J']",2012,31,6,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Outinen TK, et al.

21867563,"Clusters of spatial, temporal, and space-time distribution of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Liaoning Province, Northeastern China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by Hantavirus, with characteristics of fever, hemorrhage, kidney damage, and hypotension. HFRS is recognized as a notifiable public health problem in China, and Liaoning Province is one of the most seriously affected areas with the most cases in China. It is necessary to investigate the spatial, temporal, and space-time distribution of confirmed cases of HFRS in Liaoning Province, China for future research into risk factors.
METHODS: A cartogram map was constructed; spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial, temporal, and space-time cluster analysis were conducted in Liaoning Province, China over the period 1988-2001.
RESULTS: When the number of permutation test was set to 999, Moran's I was 0.3854, and was significant at significance level of 0.001. Spatial cluster analysis identified one most likely cluster and four secondary likely clusters. Temporal cluster analysis identified 1998-2001 as the most likely cluster. Space-time cluster analysis identified one most likely cluster and two secondary likely clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: Spatial, temporal, and space-time scan statistics may be useful in supervising the occurrence of HFRS in Liaoning Province, China. The result of this study can not only assist health departments to develop a better prevention strategy but also potentially increase the public health intervention's effectiveness.","['Wu W', 'Guo J', 'Guan P', 'Sun Y', 'Zhou B']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Wu W, et al.

HFRS from Dobrava virus (DOBV) is a seldom reported disease in Albania. Clinically HFRS is manifested as mild, moderate, or severe. Therefore, the number of cases of Hantavirus' infection may be underestimated, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of many acute infections, hematologic diseases, acute abdominal diseases and renal diseases complicated by acute renal failure.

21838933,Forecasting incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China using ARIMA model.,"BACKGROUND: China is a country that is most seriously affected by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with 90% of HFRS cases reported globally. At present, HFRS is getting worse with increasing cases and natural foci in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we applied a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the objective of monitoring and short-term forecasting HFRS incidence in China.
METHODS: Chinese HFRS data from 1975 to 2008 were used to fit ARIMA model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Ljung-Box test were used to evaluate the constructed models. Subsequently, the fitted ARIMA model was applied to obtain the fitted HFRS incidence from 1978 to 2008 and contrast with corresponding observed values. To assess the validity of the proposed model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the observed and fitted HFRS incidence (1978-2008) was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA model was used to forecast the incidence of HFRS of the years 2009 to 2011. All analyses were performed using SAS9.1 with a significant level of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit test of the optimum ARIMA (0,3,1) model showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (Ljung-Box Q statistic = 5.95,P = 0.3113). The fitted values made by ARIMA (0,3,1) model for years 1978-2008 closely followed the observed values for the same years, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.20%. The forecast values from 2009 to 2011 were 0.69, 0.86, and 1.21per 100,000 population, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ARIMA models applied to historical HFRS incidence data are an important tool for HFRS surveillance in China. This study shows that accurate forecasting of the HFRS incidence is possible using an ARIMA model. If predicted values from this study are accurate, China can expect a rise in HFRS incidence.","['Liu Q', 'Liu X', 'Jiang B', 'Yang W']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Liu Q, et al.

21820021,Comparison of innate immune responses to pathogenic and putative non-pathogenic hantaviruses in vitro.,"Hantaviruses are human pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The mechanisms accounting for the differences in virulence between pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses are not well known. We have examined the pathogenesis of different hantavirus groups by comparing the innate immune responses induced in the host cell following infection by pathogenic (Sin Nombre, Hantaan, and Seoul virus) and putative non-pathogenic (Prospect Hill, Tula, and Thottapalayam virus) hantaviruses. Pathogenic hantaviruses were found to replicate more efficiently in interferon-competent A549 cells than putative non-pathogenic hantaviruses. The former also suppressed the expression of the interferon-β and myxovirus resistance protein genes, while the transcription level of both genes increased rapidly within 24 h post-infection in the latter. In addition, the induction level of interferon correlated with the activation level of interferon regulatory factor-3. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed differences are correlated with viral pathogenesis and further indicate that pathogenic and putative non-pathogenic hantaviruses differ in terms of early interferon induction via activation of the interferon regulatory factor-3 in infected host cells.","['Shim SH', 'Park MS', 'Moon S', 'Park KS', 'Song JW', 'Song KJ', 'Baek LJ']",2011,160,1-2,Virus Res,"Shim SH, et al.

METHODS: Small mammals were captured by night trap, and lung tissue samples were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. HV antigens were detected by indirect immuno-fluorescence assay (IFA). The partial S genome segment sequences were amplified by RT-PCR. DNAStar program was used for editing and comparing the sequences. Phylogeny was analyzed through PAUP*4.0 software.
RESULTS: 319 small animals were collected in Longquan, and 9 hantavirus antigen-positive samples were identified. The positive rate of hantavirus in Apodemus agrarius was 4.97%. Phylogenetic tree constructed by partial S segment (620 - 999 nt) showed that the 9 strains carried by A. agrarius from Longquan all belonged to HTNV, and had a closer evolutionary relationship with isolate Z251 from Zhejiang province.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the main host was A. agrarius and the infection rate of HTNV was high in Longquan area.","['Wang MR', 'Wang W', 'Lin XD', 'Mei SH', 'Guo WP', 'Zhang YZ']",2011,32,6,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Wang MR, et al.

21775516,HLA-associated hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome disease progression in slovenian patients.,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II genes regulate the balance between appropriate aggressive responses and invading pathogens while minimizing the destruction of host tissue. Several studies have shown that in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients, the disease outcome is determined by a complex interaction between the virus and immunopathologic and human genetic factors. In Slovenia, the severity of the disease caused by Puumala virus (PUUV) is significantly lower than that of HFRS due to Dobrava virus (DOBV). We have determined 23 different HLA-B and 12 different HLA-DRB1 types in Slovenian HFRS patients. Comparison of HLA frequencies between healthy individuals and HFRS patients showed no strong association with the susceptibility for hantaviral infection. Significant associations were recognized when the patient group was separated according to the virus responsible for the infection. DOBV-infected patients have a significantly higher frequency of HLA-B*35 than PUUV-infected patients. For HLA class II genes, the biggest difference between the PUUV- and DOBV-infected groups of patients was in HLA-DRB1*13, where this phenotype was more frequent in PUUV-infected patients, especially in the severe form of the disease. HLA-B*07 could play a protective role in PUUV-caused HFRS in the Slovenian population. Our study shows diverse associations of HLA molecules with DOBV- and PUUV-induced HFRS, and therefore, we presume that different hantaviruses are presented differently through the same HLA molecules and that this might lead to either a more severe or a milder form of the disease. In line with this idea, we have noticed that HLA-B*35 might be a genetic risk factor for DOBV infection in the Slovenian population.","['Korva M', 'Saksida A', 'Kunilo S', 'Vidan Jeras B', 'Avsic-Zupanc T']",2011,18,9,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Korva M, et al.

21775443,Pathogenic old world hantaviruses infect renal glomerular and tubular cells and induce disassembling of cell-to-cell contacts.,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers are characterized by enhanced permeability. One of the most affected target organs of hantavirus-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is the kidney, and an infection often results in acute renal failure. To study the underlying cellular effects leading to kidney dysfunction, we infected human renal cell types in vitro that are critical for the barrier functions of the kidney, and we examined kidney biopsy specimens obtained from hantavirus-infected patients. We analyzed the infection and pathogenic effects in tubular epithelial and glomerular endothelial renal cells and in podocytes. Both epithelial and endothelial cells and podocytes were susceptible to hantavirus infection in vitro. The infection disturbed the structure and integrity of cell-to-cell contacts, as demonstrated by redistribution and reduction of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the decrease in the transepithelial resistance in infected epithelial monolayers. An analysis of renal biopsy specimens from hantavirus-infected patients revealed that the expression and the localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 were altered compared to renal biopsy specimens from noninfected individuals. Both tubular and glomerular cells were affected by the infection. Furthermore, the decrease in glomerular ZO-1 correlates with disease severity induced by glomerular dysfunction. The finding that different renal cell types are susceptible to hantaviral infection and the fact that infection results in the breakdown of cell-to-cell contacts provide useful insights in hantaviral pathogenesis.","['Krautkrämer E', 'Grouls S', 'Stein N', 'Reiser J', 'Zeier M']",2011,85,19,J Virol,"Krautkrämer E, et al.

21756028,Dynamics of hantavirus infection in Peromyscus leucopus of central Pennsylvania.,"Hantaviruses are distributed throughout the United States and are the etiologic agents for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hantavirus genotypes and epidemiologic patterns vary spatially across the United States. While several longitudinal studies have been performed in the western United States, little is known about the virus in the eastern United States. We undertook a longitudinal study of hantaviruses in the primary rodent reservoir host in central Pennsylvania, Peromyscus leucopus. Prevalence of hantavirus antibodies varied both by year and site, but was not correlated with host abundance. Males were significantly more likely to have antibodies to a hantavirus than females, and both antibody sero-conversion and antibody prevalence increased with mass class (indicator for age). Our findings suggest that one or more hantaviruses are present and circulating among P. leucopus of central Pennsylvania, and understanding the dynamics in this region could help prevent zoonotic transmission to humans. Our aim was to describe the differences in epizootiology of hantavirus infection in rodents from various geographical locations to enable improved analysis of the risk of rodent-to-human transmission and obtain insights that may indicate improved means of disease intervention.","['Luong LT', 'Vigliotti BA', 'Campbell S', 'Comer JA', 'Mills JN', 'Hudson PJ']",2011,11,11,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Luong LT, et al.

21740769,Spatial structure of rodent populations and infection patterns of hantavirus in seven villages of Shandong Province from February 2006 to January 2007.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in Junan county, Shandong Province, China. We conducted geographic information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis with the objective of estimating the spatial distribution of rodent populations and their hantavirus infection patterns, to describe the spatial relationships of hantavirus strains in small ecological areas and to identify key areas in endemic areas of HFRS for future public health planning and resource allocation.
METHODS: Rodent sampling was conducted in seven villages in Junan county from February 2006 to January 2007 using field epidemiological surveillance. Dynamics of hantavirus infection and population densities in rodents were investigated. Spatial statistical techniques including Ripley' L index and nearest neighbour hierarchical (NNH) clustering analysis were conducted to reveal the spatial structure of rodent populations in seven villages. Phylogenetic analysis and two-dimensional minimal spanning tree (2-D MST) models were employed to describe the spatial relationship of hantavirus strains.
RESULTS: Data showed that Mus musculus was the most common species in our study area, followed by Rattus norvegicus. Ripley's L index and NNH analysis showed that the spatial distribution of all captured rodents, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus in seven villages were clustered and there were hotspot areas of rodent distribution. The branches of 2-D MSTs had similar topologies to those of corresponding phylogenetic trees, and hantavirus strains exhibited obvious connective traces in seven villages.
CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to the understanding of the spatial distribution of rodent populations and hantavirus infection patterns in small areas, and identify priority areas within the epidemic areas for the development of a better prevention strategy against hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in a small ecological area.","['Sun L', 'Shao Q', 'Wang ZQ', 'Kang DM', 'Li SW', 'Li XG', 'Xue FZ', 'Wang JZ']",2011,124,11,Chin Med J (Engl),"Sun L, et al.

21731657,Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation in a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome-scoring models and severe illness.,"BACKGROUND: Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are considered to be a serious threat to public health worldwide with up to 100 million cases annually. The general hypothesis is that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an important part of the pathogenesis. The study objectives were to study the variability of DIC in consecutive patients with acute hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and to evaluate if different established DIC-scores can be used as a prognostic marker for a more severe illness.
METHOD AND FINDINGS: In a prospective study 2006-2008, data from 106 patients with confirmed HFRS were analyzed and scored for the presence of DIC according to six different templates based on criteria from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). The DIC-scoring templates with a fibrinogen/CRP-ratio were most predictive, with predictions for moderate/severe illness (p<0.01) and bleeding of moderate/major importance (p<0.05). With these templates, 18.9-28.3% of the patients were diagnosed with DIC.
CONCLUSIONS: DIC was found in about one fourth of the patients and correlated with a more severe disease. This supports that DIC is an important part of the pathogenesis in HFRS. ISTH-scores including fibrinogen/CRP-ratio outperform models without. The high negative predictive value could be a valuable tool for the clinician. We also believe that our findings could be relevant for other VHFs.","['Sundberg E', 'Hultdin J', 'Nilsson S', 'Ahlm C']",2011,6,6,PLoS One,"Sundberg E, et al.

21678038,Hantavirus infection--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: the first case series reported in Romania and review of the literature.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by Hantaviruses, a group of RNA viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family. Humans may get the disease by contamination with excreta of carrier rodents. The disease typically manifests with the triad fever-thrombocytopenia-acute kidney injury (AKI). Although its global prevalence seems to be increasing, Hantavirus infection is still commonly overlooked, because of its clinical polymorphism and non-specific symptoms, particularly in mild cases. Until recently, the disease was virtually unknown in Romania, due to lack of physicians' awareness and of adequate laboratory diagnostic techniques. In this article, we present the first six cases of HFRS diagnosed in our country, based on serology testing. We review the existing literature on HFRS and discuss our findings in comparison with other reports. All our patients presented with fever, flu syndrome, bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and oliguria. Among laboratory abnormalities, elevated serum creatinine and liver enzymes, high C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, low platelet count, and hematuria were constantly seen. Five patients required hemodialysis. All patients survived and five of them completely recovered their renal function, while only one patient retained a mild impairment of the glomerular filtration rate. From a clinical viewpoint, we believe that Hantavirus infection should be considered in all patients presenting with fever, thrombocytopenia, and AKI, when specific serology testing would be indicated. From a public health perspective, we suggest that future efforts in our country should be directed toward (1) increasing the understanding and the awareness of this disease among health care professionals, (2) educating the population at risk on the application of prophylactic measures, (3) expanding the availability of diagnostic laboratory tools, and (4) developing research on national zoonotic virus reservoirs.","['Maftei ID', 'Segall L', 'Panculescu-Gatej R', 'Ceianu C', 'Covic A']",2012,44,4,Int Urol Nephrol,"Maftei ID, et al.

IgG and IgM antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid protein and neutralizing antibody were first detectable at 14 days postinoculation (dpi) and maintained through 70 dpi. Viral RNA was first detected from 3 dpi in lungs and blood clots, and was detected in all tissues tested at 7 dpi. The viral RNA persisted for at least 70 days in the lungs, kidney, spleen, heart, and brain. The highest level of RNA copies was observed at 14 dpi in the lungs. Slight inflammatory reactions were observed in the lungs, adrenal glands, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PUUV antigen persisted until 56 dpi in the kidneys and adrenal glands. Infected hamsters showed no body weight loss or clinical signs. These results indicate that PUUV infection in hamsters is quite similar to the hantavirus infection of natural host rodents.","['Sanada T', 'Kariwa H', 'Nagata N', 'Tanikawa Y', 'Seto T', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Yoshii K', 'Takashima I']",2011,160,1-2,Virus Res,"Sanada T, et al.

To explore the relationship between Hantaan (HTNV)-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the immune pathogenesis of HFRS, the levels of interferon γ (IFN-γ) secreted by HTNV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Levels of HTNV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes in patients with HFRS were associated with different phases of HFRS. In fever phase, it was significantly elevated. The levels of HTNV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes in PBMC of patients with HFRS were negatively correlated with the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in plasma. The results show that the HTNV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte levels correlate with disease phases.

The sera from vaccinated rabbits was evaluated to determine antibody titer and specificity using different tested methods including hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), neutralizing assay (NT), cross-HI assay, cross-single immunodiffusion assay and cross-neutralization assay. The titer of HI antibody from rabbits immunized with different doses of HA were no less than 1:40 among groups 14 days after the first immunization. Whereas the NT antibody titer was less than 1:10 among groups 14 days after the first immunization. NT antibodies can be detected 14 days after the second immunization in rabbits immunized at HA doses higher than 6 μg, and the NT antibody titers were equal to or higher than 1:40. A good concentration-dependent NT antibody response can be detected in the vaccinated rabbits 14 days after the second immunization, and in contrast, no concentration-dependent relationship can be seen for HA antibody. The cross-HI test showed sera from vaccinated rabbits could cross react with influenza A H5N1 virus with the titers higher than 1:40. No cross reaction among different types (influenza A/H1N1 virus, influenza A/H3N2 virus, influenza B virus and influenza A/H5N1 virus) can be detected in the sera using the single immunodiffusion assay and using NT antibody test. This showed NT antibody test was demonstrated as a more accurate assay method for evaluating vaccination and quality of the vaccine than HI antibody test.","['Zhu H', 'Ding X', 'Chen X', 'Yao P', 'Xu F', 'Xie R', 'Yang Z', 'Liang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Shen J', 'He P', 'Guo Z', 'Su B', 'Sun S', 'Zhu Z']",2011,29,33,Vaccine,"Zhu H, et al.

21628481,"Sex differences in the incidence and case fatality rates from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China, 2004-2008.","BACKGROUND: Differences between male and female individuals in response to infectious diseases are an overlooked global health problem.
METHODS: The relationship between sex and disease outcome was examined in populations of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in mainland China, where most cases of hantavirus exposure occur. HFRS in China is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and is confirmed with serological testing. The geographical distribution, incidence, and case fatality rates (CFRs) of HFRS in China were estimated and compared by patient sex and age. In a subset of patients with HFRS, clinical manifestations of HFRS were assessed using latent class analysis and compared by sex.
RESULTS: There were 80,671 HFRS cases reported during the period 2004-2008, with a majority of HFRS cases (39.2%) occurring among individuals 20-39 years of age. The incidence of HFRS was higher among male patients than among female patients for all individuals >10 years of age. There were 945 deaths (CFR, 1.17%) due to HFRS in China during the period 2004-2008. CFRs were higher among women than among men between the ages of 20-39 and ≥ 50 years of age. There were no sex differences in the geographical distribution of HFRS cases or deaths. Although the prevalence of each clinical marker did not differ by sex, 2 profiles of clinical markers were identified that were related to both severity of disease and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate a paradox in which the incidence of disease is greater for males, but the severity of disease outcome is worse for females. Several behavioral, societal, and biological factors are hypothesized to be involved.","['Klein SL', 'Marks MA', 'Li W', 'Glass GE', 'Fang LQ', 'Ma JQ', 'Cao WC']",2011,52,12,Clin Infect Dis,"Klein SL, et al.

21612760,Glomerulonephritis emerging shortly after Puumala hantavirus infection: a report on 7 patients.,"AIMS: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is mild type of hemorrhagic fever caused by Puumala (PUU) hantavirus. Renal biopsy typically shows acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and complete recovery is the usual outcome. We previously described 5 patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) after acute NE. We now report on 7 more patients who developed biopsy-confirmed glomerulonephritis (GN) during the convalescent phase of NE.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present case histories of 7 patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria concomitant with hematuria after serologically verified NE.
RESULTS: Renal biopsy specimens disclosed MPGN in 5 patients, membranous GN (MGN) in 1 and mesangial GN (MesGN) in 1. All patients achieved remission of nephrotic syndrome within a median time of 0.6 years (range 0.5 - 5.5 y). The median follow-up time was 1.7 years (0.7 - 15.6 y).
CONCLUSIONS: As a rare phenomenon, nephrotic syndrome may emerge during the convalescent phase of acute PUU hantavirus infection. In most cases the prognosis of GN caused by NE seems to be favorable.","['Miettinen M', 'Mäkelä S', 'Haapala M', 'Helanterä A', 'Helin H', 'Vänttinen T', 'Mustonen J']",2011,75,6,Clin Nephrol,"Miettinen M, et al.

21600717,Pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography findings in nephropathia epidemica.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in patients with Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE), and to determine if these findings correspond to chest radiograph findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT.
CONCLUSION: Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.","['Paakkala A', 'Järvenpää R', 'Mäkelä S', 'Huhtala H', 'Mustonen J']",2012,81,8,Eur J Radiol,"Paakkala A, et al.

21598005,"Phylogenetic analysis of Puumala virus subtype Bavaria, characterization and diagnostic use of its recombinant nucleocapsid protein.","Puumala virus (PUUV) is the predominant hantavirus species in Germany causing large numbers of mild to moderate cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). During an outbreak in South-East Germany in 2004 a novel PUUV subtype designated Bavaria was identified as the causative agent of HFRS in humans [1]. Here we present a molecular characterization of this PUUV strain by investigating novel partial and almost entire nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding small (S-) segment sequences and partial medium (M-) segment sequences from bank voles (Myodes glareolus) trapped in Lower Bavaria during 2004 and 2005. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed their classification as subtype Bavaria, which is further subdivided into four geographical clusters. The entire N protein, harbouring an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag, of the Bavarian strain was produced in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed a slightly different reactivity with N-specific monoclonal antibodies, compared to the yeast-expressed N protein of the PUUV strain Vranica/Hällnäs. Endpoint titration of human sera from different parts of Germany and from Finland revealed only very slight differences in the diagnostic value of the different recombinant proteins. Based on the novel N antigen indirect and monoclonal antibody capture IgG-ELISAs were established. By using serum panels from Germany and Finland their validation demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity. In summary, our investigations demonstrated the Bavarian PUUV strain to be genetically divergent from other PUUV strains and the potential of its N protein for diagnostic applications.","['Mertens M', 'Kindler E', 'Emmerich P', 'Esser J', 'Wagner-Wiening C', 'Wölfel R', 'Petraityte-Burneikiene R', 'Schmidt-Chanasit J', 'Zvirbliene A', 'Groschup MH', 'Dobler G', 'Pfeffer M', 'Heckel G', 'Ulrich RG', 'Essbauer SS']",2011,43,2,Virus Genes,"Mertens M, et al.

METHODS: Integrated monitoring plan was used. A designated office coordinated 5 departments' actions within the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cage-trapping method was conducted to monitor the density of mice from June to October, respectively.
RESULTS: Lishui municipal CDC had finished the integrated monitoring program on mouse and mouse-borne disease while the Longyou CDC had finished the field investigation, using the integrated monitoring program. Specimens were sent to provincial CDC. The integrated monitoring program needed more number of personnel and better coordination.Lishui reported 3 leptospirosis cases and 58 HFRS cases in 2009, with the incidence rates as 0.13 and 2.44 per 100 000, respectively.

21566265,Maporal virus as a surrogate for pathogenic New World hantaviruses and its inhibition by favipiravir.,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic hantaviruses geographically distributed in the Old World cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), whereas New World hantaviruses are the aetiological agents of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Ribavirin, a drug associated with toxicities, is presently indicated for treatment of HFRS, whereas treatment of the more frequently lethal HCPS is limited to supportive care. Because of the need for safe and effective antivirals to treat severe hantaviral infections, we evaluated favipiravir (T-705) against Dobrava and Maporal viruses as representative Old World and New World hantaviruses, respectively. Dobrava virus causes HFRS in Europe. Maporal virus (MPRLV), recently isolated from western Venezuela, is phylogenetically similar to Andes virus, the principal cause of HCPS in Argentina.
METHODS: Hantavirus replication in the presence of various inhibitors was measured by focus-forming unit assays and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed by the neighbour-joining and bootstrap consensus methods.
RESULTS: Here, we show that infection of Vero E6 cells with MPRLV is dependent on β3 integrins, similar to that reported for pathogenic hantaviruses. Furthermore, by analysis of molecular determinants associated with the G1 glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail, we show the close genetic proximity of MPRLV to other HCPS-causing hantaviruses in these regions predictive of pathogenicity. We also demonstrate anti-hantavirus activity by favipiravir with inhibitory concentrations ranging from 65 to 93 μM and selectivity indices>50.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MPRLV may serve as a safer alternative to modelling infection caused by the highly lethal Andes virus and that hantaviruses are sensitive to the effects of favipiravir in cell culture.","['Buys KK', 'Jung KH', 'Smee DF', 'Furuta Y', 'Gowen BB']",2011,21,5,Antivir Chem Chemother,"Buys KK, et al.

The deposition fluxes of total HFRs at the urban (99.3-1327 ng m(-2) day(-1)) and e-waste (79.1-1200 ng m(-2) day(-1)) sites were much higher than at the rural site (9.27-79.5 ng m(-2) day(-1)), demonstrating that e-waste recycling and industrial activities in southern China are two important sources of HFRs in the environment. The urban deposition profile was dominated by current-use HFRs (decabrominated diphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ethane), whereas the profile at the e-waste site reflects the past when significant amounts of PBDEs and Dechlorane Plus were used. Source apportionment estimated by principal component analyses with multiple linear regression analysis showed that deposition HFRs at the rural site were primarily contributed by the urban and e-waste sources (45% and 38%, respectively) compared to the contribution from local emission (17%). Our results suggest that the HFRs that are readily present in gas or sorbed onto fine particle phases have enhanced potential for long-range atmospheric transport.","['Tian M', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang J', 'Shi T', 'Luo XJ', 'Mai BX']",2011,45,11,Environ Sci Technol,"Tian M, et al.

21508829,Platelet ligands and ADAMTS13 during Puumala hantavirus infection and associated thrombocytopenia.,"We aimed here to elucidate the role of adhesive platelet ligands and endothelial involvement during the acute phase of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection. Nineteen hospital-treated patients with serologically confirmed diagnosis of acute PUUV infection were included. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical and basic laboratory data. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo), factor VIII (FVIII:C) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 domain 13 (ADAMTS13) activities as well as fibrinogen and fibronectin were measured three times acutely and once during the recovery phase. VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo were nearly three-fold higher acutely compared with recovery (median 252 vs. 88%, and mean 267 vs. 98%, respectively; P<0.001 for both), whereas FVIII:C was only slightly elevated (median 118 vs. 88%, P=0.002) and remarkably failed to show association with VWF in the acute phase. ADAMTS13 activity and fibronectin concentration were lower in the acute compared with the recovery phase (median 56 vs. 63%, P=0.003, and median 221 vs. 330 μmol/l, P=0.001, respectively). Fibrinogen raised acutely (mean 5.0 vs. 3.3 g/l, P<0.001), negatively correlating with the platelet count (r=-0.468, P=0.043). Markedly upregulated fibrinogen and VWF together with decreased levels of ADAMTS13 activity and fibronectin were observed during acute PUUV infection. VWF and FVIII:C did not associate during the acute phase, whereas thrombocytopenia correlated negatively with fibrinogen. These findings imply several rearranged interactions between platelets and their ligands.","['Laine O', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Helminen M', 'Vaheri A', 'Lassila R', 'Joutsi-Korhonen L']",2011,22,6,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,"Laine O, et al.

When transmitted to humans, they can cause two clinical syndromes, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The review compiles the current list of hantaviruses which are thought to be pathogenic in humans on the basis of molecular or at least serological evidence. Whereas induction of a neutralizing humoral immune response is considered to be protective against infection, the dual role of cellular immunity (protection versus immunopathogenicity) is discussed. For active immunisation, inactivated virus vaccines are licensed in certain Asian countries. Moreover, several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development. The development of hantavirus vaccines is hampered by the lack of adequate animal models of hantavirus-associated disease. In addition to active immunization strategies, the review summarizes other ways of infection prevention, as passive immunization, chemoprophylaxis, and exposition prophylaxis.","['Krüger DH', 'Schönrich G', 'Klempa B']",2011,7,6,Hum Vaccin,"Krüger DH, et al.

21495786,Complement activation in Puumala hantavirus infection correlates with disease severity.,"INTRODUCTION: Hantaviruses are important human pathogens that cause clinical diseases characterized by renal and cardiopulmonary manifestations. Their pathogenesis is currently poorly understood. We have studied the role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of Puumala (PUUV) hantavirus infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the activation of complement by measuring the terminal complement complex SC5b-9 and complement component C3 and C4 levels in patients with acute PUUV infection. Several laboratory parameters and clinical findings reflecting the severity of PUUV-HFRS were evaluated with regard to complement activation.
RESULTS: The levels of SC5b-9 were significantly increased and C3 decreased in the acute stage as compared to the levels at full recovery (P < 0.001). We found that SC5b-9 levels were higher in patients with chest X-ray abnormalities than in patients with a normal X-ray during the acute stage (P = 0.028). Furthermore, SC5b-9 and C3 levels showed significant correlation with several clinical and laboratory parameters that reflect the severity of the acute PUUV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the complement system becomes activated via the alternative pathway in the acute stage of PUUV infection and the level of activation correlates with disease severity. The results further suggest that complement activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute PUUV infection.","['Sane J', 'Laine O', 'Mäkelä S', 'Paakkala A', 'Jarva H', 'Mustonen J', 'Vapalahti O', 'Meri S', 'Vaheri A']",2012,44,5,Ann Med,"Sane J, et al.

21464543,Epidemiological study on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in flood areas.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the infection of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in host animals and inapparent infection of HFRS in general population in Dongting Lake areas after floods.
METHODS: The night trapping method was used to capture rodents. The immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the hantavirus (HV) antigens and antibodies in rodents lung and in the serum of general population. Nonconditional logistic regression was applied to analyze risk factors for inapparent infection with HV.
RESULTS: In flood region,draw-near flood region and new migration region,rodent density was 6.95%,6.28%, and 8.67%, respectively, and the virus-carrying rate in rodents was 15.07%,9.25%, and 4.47%, respectively. The virus-carrying rat index was the highest in flood region (0.10). Apodemus agrarius was the dominant species. The standardized positive rate of HV antibody in general population from above mentioned regions was 4.49%, 3.11%, and 3.13%, respectively. There was no significant difference among different age or gender groups. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that people who were involved in construction of water conservancy facilities in winter or practice of rat extermination at home were the principal factors related to inapparent infection with HV.
CONCLUSION: The virus-carrying rate in main host animals of HV in the 3 regions is high, whereas the positive rate of HV antibody is low in general population. Comprehensive measures should be taken to prevent and control HFRS, such as reinforcing surveillance of HFRS, strengthening deratization, and preventive inoculation.","['Zhou J', 'Zhang X', 'Chen M', 'Huang X', 'Liu A', 'Yang T', 'Tan H']",2011,36,3,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"Zhou J, et al.

21459193,Recent advances in hantavirus molecular biology and disease.,"Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.","['Hussein IT', 'Haseeb A', 'Haque A', 'Mir MA']",2011,74,,Adv Appl Microbiol,"Hussein IT, et al.

21436245,Presence of activated airway T lymphocytes in human puumala hantavirus disease.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses cause two clinical syndromes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The clinical spectrum in HFRS also often involves respiratory symptoms. As information about the pulmonary pathogenesis in HFRS is limited, we aimed to further study the local airway immune response in the lower airways.
METHODS: Bronchoscopy was performed in 15 hospitalized patients with HFRS, with sampling of endobronchial mucosal biopsies and BAL fluid. Biopsies were stained for leukocytes, lymphocyte subsets, and vascular endothelial adhesion molecules. BAL fluid and blood lymphocyte subsets were determined using flow cytometry. Fourteen healthy volunteers acted as a control group.
RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, endobronchial mucosal biopsies from patients with HFRS revealed increased numbers of CD8(+) T cells in both epithelium and submucosa (P ≤ .001), along with an increase in submucosal CD4(+) T cells (P = .001). In contrast, patients' submucosal neutrophil and eosinophil numbers were reduced (P < .001). The expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was enhanced in patients with HFRS (P < .001). In patients with HFRS, analyses of T-cell subsets in BAL fluid showed higher proportions of CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cells (P = .011 and P = .025) and natural killer cells (P < .001), together with an increased expression of activation markers human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and CD25 on T cells (P < .001 and P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate a local immune response in terms of activated T lymphocytes in the lungs of patients with HFRS. The elevated expression of activation markers and VCAM-1 further implies the importance of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of pulmonary involvement in HFRS.","['Rasmuson J', 'Pourazar J', 'Linderholm M', 'Sandström T', 'Blomberg A', 'Ahlm C']",2011,140,3,Chest,"Rasmuson J, et al.

21417923,"Seroepidemiological survey of hantavirus infection in healthy people in Vallès Occidental, Barcelona.","INTRODUCTION: Hantaviruses are the etiological agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Europe and Asia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in America. Approximately 150,000 cases are reported annually worldwide. In Spain, some hantavirus infection cases have been described. Besides, rodents that have been described as hantavirus reservoirs are present. The aim of the present study was to determinate the seroprevalence of hantavirus in humans in the northeast of Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 5-month period, 217 serum samples were collected. The study population was stratified by age, gender, and residential area. Age, gender, residential area, contact with pets, contact with wild animals, contact with farm animals, and occupation were surveyed. Immunoglobulin G antibodies to Hantaan virus, Seoul virus, or Puumala virus were examined by immunofluorescence assay. Titles ≥1/32 against any of the hantavirus were considered positive.
RESULTS: Four (1.8%) positive samples were detected. Age ranged from 14 to 67 years. Two subjects were male. Three samples reacted to both Puumala virus and Hantaan virus. The other one reacted against all three hantavirus surveyed. Titles ranged from 32 to 1024. The highest titles were found against Seoul virus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show serological evidence about hantavirus infection among population of Catalonia, northeast of Spain. Seroprevalence rate was (around 2%) similar to other regions of Spain.","['Sanfeliu I', 'Nogueras MM', 'Gegúndez MI', 'Segura F', 'Lledó L', 'Font B', 'Saz JV']",2011,11,6,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Sanfeliu I, et al.

Surveillance of hantaviruses in rodents plays an important role in the prevention and control of HFRS and HPS. In this study, small mammals were captured in an HFRS-endemic region, Luxi County within the Yunnan Province of China, from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010, and assessed for the presence of hantaviruses. A high ratio of hantavirus infection was detected in the Yunnan red-backed vole (Eothenomys miletus). Full-length sequences of the small, middle and large segments were determined from one positive sample (designated Luxi hantavirus). Analyses of the coding sequences indicated that this virus represents a distinct hantavirus species within the hantavirus group identified from the Rodentia subfamily Arvicolinae.","['Zhang Y', 'Yuan J', 'Yang X', 'Zhou J', 'Yang W', 'Peng C', 'Zhang HL', 'Shi Z']",2011,92,Pt 6,J Gen Virol,"Zhang Y, et al.

21360546,Hantavirus-specific IgA in saliva and viral antigen in the parotid gland in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"The Hantavirus genus comprises rodent borne, zoonotic viruses of the Bunyaviridae family that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. Rodent saliva contains infectious hantavirus and evidence suggests that hantavirus is also shed in human saliva, but person-to-person transmission is rare. In saliva, immunoglobulin (Ig) A is the predominant immunoglobulin class. Secretory IgA serves as an important first line of defence on epithelial surfaces and the binding of secretory IgA to pathogens can inhibit adherence of microorganisms to mucosal cells and neutralize viruses. This study investigated the presence and importance of salivary IgA in relation to viral antigen in the saliva by testing Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) specific IgA, and RNA in saliva in acutely ill patients with HFRS. In saliva samples, PUUV specific IgA was detected in 12 of 33 (36%) patients with HFRS and 20 (61%) were PUUV RNA positive. There was a statistically significant inverse association between the presence of salivary IgA antibodies and PUUV RNA in the saliva. PUUV-specific IgA in saliva was not found in a long-term follow-up, while PUUV IgA in serum was detected in three patients, 28-32 months after the initial study. Notably, both PUUV RNA and PUUV nucleocapsid antigen were detected in endothelial cells within the parotid gland of a deceased patient with HFRS.","['Pettersson L', 'Rasmuson J', 'Andersson C', 'Ahlm C', 'Evander M']",2011,83,5,J Med Virol,"Pettersson L, et al.

However, procalcitonin in patients infected with hantavirus has not yet been discussed in the literature. A total of 29 adult patients with hantavirus infection, 30 with sepsis, and 19 with tick-borne encephalitis were included in this observational retrospective study. The median procalcitonin level in patients with hantavirus infection was 0.53 μg/L (range 0.09-11.71 μg/L), in the group with sepsis 4.33 μg/L (range 0.08-161.1 μg/L) and in patients with viral meningitis 0.08 μg/L (range 0.05-0.12 μg/L). The difference between all three groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A higher procalcitonin level was found in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Dobrava virus (0.74 μg/L; range 0.09-2.83 μg/L) than in those with Puumala virus infections (0.50 μg/L; range 0.10-11.71 μg/L). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.895). This study confirmed previous findings demonstrating the association of elevated procalcitonin with bacterial infection. However, increased procalcitonin serum level was also found in hantavirus infections with overlapping results between viral and severe bacterial infections.","['Jereb M', 'Lunaček NK', 'Kotar T', 'Saksida A', 'Petrovec M', 'Avšič-Županc T']",2011,71,4,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,"Jereb M, et al.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HTN and SEO strains were co-circulating in Zhejiang Province, and the difference in sequence similarity and the phylogeny was closely related to the isolated regions, but had no distinct relationship with the isolate year and the host, indicating a relationship between epidemiology of HFRS and the distribution region, especially in HTNV. The isolates in the same region could be assigned in same or near phylogenetic clade sharing high sequence similarity. Interestingly, the Gou3 strain and ZJ5 strain isolated from Jiande region in Zhejiang Province formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage in SEOV clade, and different from the other SEOV variants outside China.

The epidemiology of hantavirosis in Brazil shows that the number of cases notified and the number of variants discovered in several states and the Federal District have been increasing year by year. Within this context, the main objective of this study was to examine land use and occupation in relation to the spread of hantavirosis in the Federal District, between 2004 and 2008.
METHODS: To carry out this investigation, epidemiological and land use data were used to drafting tables and cartograms in order to detail the special spread of hantavirosis in this area.
RESULTS: Out of the 40 likely infection sites plotted on the coverage and land use map, 19 (47%) were in pasture areas, 10 (25%) in urban areas (periurban), 6 (15%) in areas used for agriculture and 5 (12%) in savanna areas.
CONCLUSIONS: It can thus be seen that agricultural activities and urban expansion towards the savanna areas have favored the spread of hantavirosis in the Federal District and especially in São Sebastião.","['Santos JP', 'Steinke ET', 'García-Zapata MT']",2011,44,1,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Santos JP, et al.

The severity of NE varies greatly. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether serum indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity is associated with the severity of NE. A prospectively collected cohort of 102 consecutive patients with acute serologically confirmed NE was examined. Serum kynurenine, tryptophan, creatinine, CRP, and blood cell count were measured for up to 5 consecutive days after admission. The kynurenine to tryptophan (kyn/trp) ratio reflecting IDO activity was calculated. A maximum kyn/trp ratio >202 µmol/mmol had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 75% for detecting maximum serum creatinine values >250 µmol/L by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A maximum kyn/trp ratio >202 µmol/mmol (high IDO level) was also associated with other parameters reflecting the severity of the disease and renal impairment. Patients with high IDO levels had higher maximum serum creatinine (379 vs. 102 µmol/L, P<0.001), plasma C-reactive protein (104.1 vs. 72.1 mg/L, P=0.029), and blood leukocyte values (11.9 vs. 9.0 × 10(9) /L, P<0.001) compared to patients with kyn/trp ratio ≤ 202 µmol/mmol. They also had lower minimum urinary output (1,100 vs. 1,900 ml/day, P<0.001) and longer hospital stays (8 vs. 5 days, P<0.001).

We examined the levels of VLA-4 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The levels of VLA-4 in PBMC samples collected from 53 patients by immunohistochemical staining were detected.
RESULTS: The expression of VLA-4 in PBMC of HFRS patients at different stages were significantly higher than those in normal controls (P < 0.05), except recovery stage (P > 0.05). The expression of VLA-4 in PBMC of HFRS patients at different types were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05). The levels of VLA-4 in patients with HFRS were positively correlated with serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr).
CONCLUSIONS: VLA-4 might play an important role in the immunopathological lesions of HFRS.

Beijing metropolis is a novel affected region, where the HFRS incidence seems to be diverse from place to place.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The spatial scan analysis based on geographical information system (GIS) identified three geo-spatial ""hotspots"" of HFRS in Beijing when the passive surveillance data from 2004 to 2006 were used. The Relative Risk (RR) of the three ""hotspots"" was 5.45, 3.57 and 3.30, respectively. The Phylogenetic analysis based on entire coding region sequence of S segment and partial L segment sequence of Seoul virus (SEOV) revealed that the SEOV strains circulating in Beijing could be classified into at least three lineages regardless of their host origins. Two potential recombination events that happened in lineage #1 were detected and supported by comparative phylogenetic analysis. The SEOV strains in different lineages and strains with distinct special amino acid substitutions for N protein were partially associated with different spatial clustered areas of HFRS.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Hotspots of HFRS were found in Beijing, a novel endemic region, where intervention should be enhanced. Our data suggested that the genetic variation and recombination of SEOV strains was related to the high risk areas of HFRS, which merited further investigation.","['Zuo SQ', 'Fang LQ', 'Zhan L', 'Zhang PH', 'Jiang JF', 'Wang LP', 'Ma JQ', 'Wang BC', 'Wang RM', 'Wu XM', 'Yang H', 'Cao ZW', 'Cao WC']",2011,5,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zuo SQ, et al.

Forty-eight pairs of acute and convalescent sera were collected from HFRS patients in Hubei, China (1985-2002) and tested by indirect IgG, IgA, and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with six rNPs of European hantaviruses as coated antigens, respectively. The results showed that the sensitivity of rNPs against IgG was HTNV-rNP > DOBV-rNP > PUUV-rNP, while the sensitivity against IgA was DOBV-rNP > HTNV-rNP > PUUV-rNP. Quantitative analysis revealed both acute and convalescent sera from HFRS patients predominantly exhibit high levels of IgA. Although PUUV-rNPs showed very weak reactivity to the three kinds of immunoglobulins in all samples, three pairs of sera unexpectedly cross-reacted strongly to all three PUUV-rNP subtypes.

In this case, there was a diagnostic delay, resulting in numerous unnecessary investigations, prolonged hospital stay and almost an invasive renal biopsy. A travel history is therefore essential, to establish travel to an endemic region within the previous 2-6 weeks. With increasing travel and immigration, hantavirus is likely to be seen more frequently as an imported infection into the UK. However, further research is required to establish the potential for acquisition of infection here, as the animal host, the bank vole, is part of local wildlife. Therefore, the authors urge physicians to be alert to this possibility when faced with acute renal failure in association with an undiagnosed febrile illness, particularly when there is a history of an appropriate environmental or animal exposure.","['Fhogartaigh CN', 'Newsholme W', 'Kinirons M', 'Tong W']",2011,2011,,BMJ Case Rep,"Fhogartaigh CN, et al.

Hemorrhagic fever with kidney syndrome can have mild, moderate and severe clinical picture and the mortality ranges from 5% -15% in our area. The purpose of this study was to try to present criteria on the basis of which it would be possible to forsee, on time, the severity of the clinical picture and to recognize the patient with the most severe disease form.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within the period often years, 87 patients became ill of hemorrhagic fever with kidney syndrome and were treated at General Hospital in Berane, where they were followed from the aspect of clinical and laboratory analyses while the serologic confirmation of the disease was done at the Institute of Immunology and Virology ""Torlak"" in Belgrade.
RESULTS: The results show that the severity of the clinical picture can be forseen on time on the basis of the dynamics of increase of the values of urea and creatinine, duration of the shock condition, duration of the oliguria less than 300 ml/24 h, number of the collapses, presence of the meningitic syndromes and appearance of the asciteses and pleuritic hemorrhage. When, on the basis of these parameters, we classify the patients into the categories of mild, moderate and severe clinical picture, using the appropriate statistics methods we find out the differences in duration of the disease as well as in the result of treatment and number of the dialysed patients.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to forsee clinical course in a patient on time by making timely diagnosis and careful following the clinical and laboratory parameters, important for the result of treatment.","['Zivković M', 'Todorović Z', 'Gajović O', 'Nesić L', 'Mihailović Z']",2010,63,5-6,Med Pregl,"Zivković M, et al.

Successful infection is a conditio sine qua non for the virulence of a virus and it is well-known that the innate interferon (IFN) system generally plays a decisive role to prevent establishment of an infection. The importance of the IFN system is underscored by the fact that viruses have developed an amazing number of different escape mechanisms to enable replication in face of the antiviral host response. Interestingly, pathogenic hantaviruses escape induction of innate antiviral responses in the early phase of the infection, which are elicited in a pronounced manner by nonpathogenic hantaviruses in vitro. This differential response might be important for the pathogenicity of hantaviruses in humans. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about the interaction between hantaviruses and the innate IFN system. Detailed characterization of the cellular sensors and pathways that lead to activation of the IFN system on one side and the viral escape mechanisms on the other might help to develop novel vaccination strategies and therapeutic approaches.",['Rang A'],2010,30,6,Crit Rev Immunol,Rang A.

21171876,Hantavirus protein interactions regulate cellular functions and signaling responses.,"Rodent-borne pathogenic hantaviruses cause two severe and often lethal zoonotic diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. Currently, no US FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines are available for HFRS/HCPS. Infections with hantaviruses are not lytic, and it is currently not known exactly why infections in humans cause disease. A better understanding of how hantaviruses interfere with normal cell functions and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses might provide clues to future development of specific treatment and/or vaccines against hantavirus infection. In this article, the current knowledge regarding immune responses observed in patients, hantavirus interference with cellular proteins and signaling pathways, and possible approaches in the development of therapeutics are discussed.","['Klingström J', 'Ahlm C']",2011,9,1,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,Klingström J and Ahlm C.

21163102,"[Epidemiology and surveillance programs on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Mainland China, 2005 - 2008].","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiologic and surveillance data of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in China, from 2005 to 2008, to describe the epidemiology and trend of HFRS.
METHODS: Descriptive epidemiology were studied to analyze the surveillance data from 2005 to 2008, collected from both the internet-based national notifiable disease reporting system and 40 HFRS sentinel sites developed since 2005 in 40 counties around China.
RESULTS: A total of 56 077 HFRS cases and 692 deaths reported in China with case fatality rate as 1.23%. Morbidity and mortality had been annually decreasing since 2004. The top 7 provinces with HFRS cases were Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei and Zhejiang, which had a total of 44 081 cases reported, accounting for 78.61% of the total number of cases, in the nation. More cases were reported in spring and autumn-winter season, with the peak in November. Cases reported in males were 3.13 times of the females and most cases seen in young and middle-aged farmers. The density and the virus carrying rate of animal hosts and the distribution of dominant species were relatively stable and similar to the previous findings. Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus were still the most common and predominant animal hosts. No genetic mutation of Hantavirus was detected in the surveillance program.
CONCLUSION: The continuous descending trend of the HFRS epidemics could be related to the successful strategies on comprehensive prevention and control measures, as controlling the number of rodents and vectors, carrying out HFRS vaccination campaign and health education by the local health care takers in the recent years. Implementation of the new national Expanded Program of Immunization on HFRS vaccine in high-risk areas may further reduce the epidemics. However, both the density and the virus carried rate among the host animals remain high in some areas, together with the emergence of new epidemic areas, all call for more attention to be paid on the disease.","['Wang Q', 'Zhou H', 'Han YH', 'Wang XF', 'Wang SW', 'Yin WW', 'Li Q', 'Xu Z']",2010,31,6,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Wang Q, et al.

21162996,[Genetic characterization of two Seoul virus strains isolated from patients and rats in Hebei province].,"OBJECTIVE: Complete S and M segments of two Seoul virus (SEOV) strains were obtained to determine their genetic types and characteristics.
METHODS: The complete S and M segments from the isolate Li and lung tissue (sample LF18) were amplified by RT-PCR. Genetic analyses were performed by using DNAStar and PHYLIP program package.
RESULTS: Their sequences consisted of 1772 nucleotides, and had an open reading frame (ORF, 43 to 1332 nt) encoding a nucleoprotein of 429 amino acids for both two strains. The complete M segment sequences consisted of 3653 nucleotides and had an ORF encoding a GnGc precursor of 1133 amino acids. The GnGc precursor of the two strains had 62 cysteine and 6 N-glycosylation sites. Both two strains shared a high degree of homology with other known SEOV strains including strains L99, Gou3, and vaccine strain Z37, with 87.6% to 99.2% and 83.6% to 97.3% nucleotide identities, respectively. On the S- and M-trees, the two strains LF18 and Li were grouped into the third cluster of SEOV.
CONCLUSION: Both LF18 and Li strains belonged to SEOV and shared the congruent genetic characteristics with the vaccine strains Z37. Thus, the bivalent vaccine including the strain Z37 could effectively prevent HFRS which was caused by SEOV in Hebei province.","['Guo WP', 'Lin XD', 'Wang W', 'Li MH', 'Zhu HB', 'Zhang YZ']",2010,31,8,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Guo WP, et al.

METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues with Trizol reagent. The complete M and S segment sequences of strains NM133 and Q12 were amplified by RT-PCR. The purified DNA fragments were directly subjected to sequencing, and then to sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: The complete S segment sequences of strains NM133 and Q12 were found to be 1770 nt and 1772 nt in length respectively, with one open reading frame encoding 429 amino acids. The complete M segment sequences of both two strains are 3654 nucleotide in length encoding a protein of 1133 amino acids.

21142962,Acute kidney injury in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Hantaan virus: comparative evaluation by RIFLE and AKIN criteria.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most prominent characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan virus. The present study evaluated the incidence and severity of AKI classified by both the RIFLE and AKIN criteria in 120 HFRS patients at 48  h and 1 week of the patient admission. The agreements between RIFLE and AKIN and RIFLE and AKIN defined by serum creatinine (AKINc and RIFLEc) were examined by Kappa statistics. AKI occurred in 79.2% and 82.5% at 48  h and in 84.2% and 89.2% at 1 week of admission by RIFLE and AKIN criteria, respectively. RIFLE and AKIN showed very good agreement in classifying AKI at 48  h and 1 week of admission (κ > 0.900). RIFLE and RIFLEc and AKIN and AKINc at 48  h and 1 week of admission had almost perfect agreement (κ > 0.900). The classifications of RIFLE and RIFLEc and AKIN and AKINc at 48  h and 1 week were in good agreement (κ > 0.650). AKI classifications by RIFLE and AKIN were associated with mortality, occurrence of complications, and length of hospital stay. We conclude that AKI occurs in nearly 90% of HFRS patients during the disease course. RIFLE and AKIN classify AKI in HFRS with similar sensitivity. RIFLEc and AKINc may be used as alternatives of standard RIFLE and AKIN in the settings of general wards. The AKI classifications defined at 48  h of admission have predictive value for HFRS disease progression and severity.","['Han D', 'Liu Z', 'Han Q', 'Li Z', 'Zhang G', 'Qiu J', 'Lou S', 'Li N', 'Wang Y', 'Li M']",2011,11,6,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Han D, et al.

21142469,Temporal variation in individual factors associated with hantavirus infection in bank voles during an epizootic: implications for Puumala virus transmission dynamics.,"Puumala virus (PUUV), the causal agent of nephropathia epidemica in humans, is one of the many hantaviruses included in the list of emerging pathogens. Hantavirus infection is not distributed evenly among PUUV reservoir hosts (i.e., bank voles [Myodes glareolus]). Besides environmental factors and local population features, individual characteristics play an important role in vole PUUV infection risk. Identifying the relative importance of these individual characteristics can provide crucial information on PUUV transmission processes. In the present study, bank voles were monitored during the nephropathia epidemica outbreak of 2005 in Belgium. Vole sera were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G against PUUV, and a logistic mixed model was built to investigate the temporal variation in individual characteristics and their relative importance to PUUV infection risk in bank voles. Relative risk calculations for individual vole characteristics related to PUUV infection in the reservoir host show that reproductive activity dominates infection risk. The gender effect is only found in reproductively active voles, where reproductively active males have the highest infection risk. Results also revealed a clear seasonal variation in the importance of reproductive activity linked to PUUV infection. In contrast to the main effect found in other trapping sessions, no difference in infection risk ratio was found between reproductively active and nonactive voles in the spring period. Combined with increased infection risk for the reproductively nonactive group at that time, these results indicate a shift in the transmission process due to changes in bank vole behavior, physiology, or climate conditions. Hence, our results suggest that mathematical models should take into account seasonal shifts in transmission mechanisms. When these results are combined with the seasonal changes in population structure during the epizootic period, we identify vole reproductive activity and length of the breeding season as potential drivers of PUUV epizootics in west-central European regions.","['Tersago K', 'Verhagen R', 'Leirs H']",2011,11,6,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Tersago K, et al.

21140328,[Nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala hantavirus infection: a case report from the outpatient sector].,"HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 42-year-old man without pre-existing health problems presented to his family practitioner in Baden-Württemberg with fever (up to 39˚ C for two days), headache, abdominal pain, back pain and aching limbs. Ten days before, he had done heavy gardening work. He felt diffuse pain on abdominal palpation. The physical examination of the skin, lymph nodes, the heart, the lungs and the oral mucosa was unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: Erythrocytes, leukocytes and sporadic bacteria were found in the urine. Urine test strip analysis gave a threefold positive result for protein. The blood test revealed in an elevated C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine and thrombocytopenia. Enlarged kidneys and an enlarged spleen were found on ultra sound examination. IgG and IgM tested for Hantavirus infection were detected by IFA (Immunofluorescence antibody assay) and by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
TREATMENT AND COURSE: The blood tests had returned to normal by 15 days after onset of the fever which had persisted for 7 days. Oliguria and/or anuria did not occur. After three weeks of illness, the blood pressure was found to be at hypertensive levels and the patient was treated with antihypertensive drugs.
CONCLUSION: A history of gardening work (exposure to rodents) and nonspecific symptoms (like headache and fever), in combination with elevated serum creatinine and thrombocytopenia, should raise the suspicion of nephropathia epidemica (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) caused by hantavirus infection. As sequelae of hantavirus infection may persist, patients should subsequently be followed for clinical and laboratory evidence of renal disease.

Some emerging halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), such as dechlorane plus (DP), 2,3,4,5,6-pentabromoethyl benzene (PBEB), pentabromotoluene (PBT), and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), were also quantified. Stable isotopes (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) were analyzed to assess the trophic levels and dietary sources of the birds. PBDEs were found to be the predominant HFRs, followed by DP, PBT, PBEB, and BTBPE. The birds in which BDE209 was predominant have differential δ(13)C and δ(15)N signatures compared with other birds, suggesting that dietary source is one of the important factors in determining the PBDE congener profile in birds. The levels of ΣPBDEs, PBEB, and PBT were significantly correlated with the trophic level (δ(15)N) for avian species which are located in a food chain, indicating the biomagnification potential of these compounds. No correlation was found between DP concentrations and trophic level of the birds. There is a significantly negative correlation between the fraction of anti-DP and δ(15)N, suggesting that the metabolic capability of DP in birds increases with the trophic level of the birds.","['Zhang XL', 'Luo XJ', 'Liu HY', 'Yu LH', 'Chen SJ', 'Mai BX']",2011,45,2,Environ Sci Technol,"Zhang XL, et al.

We have determined the structure of the tetrameric Gn-Gc spike complex to a resolution of 2.5 nm and show that spikes are ordered in lattices on the virion surface. Large cytoplasmic extensions associated with each Gn-Gc spike also form a lattice on the inner surface of the viral membrane. Rod-shaped ribonucleoprotein complexes are arranged into nearly parallel pairs and triplets within virions. Our results differ from the T=12 icosahedral organization found for some bunyaviruses.

More than 200.000 cases of hantavirus infections are reported annually worldwide. Hantaviruses can lead to two different types of infection in humans, namely, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS is the most common type of hantavirus infection in Europe and Asia and the most common virus types are Dobrava, Puumala, Hantaan and Seoul. A total of 25 hantavirus suspected cases have been reported from the Western Black Sea region of Turkey and 12 of these were confirmed serologically as ""Puumala"" subtype. Serological tests such as indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), are used for diagnosis and typing of the hantaviruses, however, since cross-reactions are common between the subtypes, the results of these tests should be confirmed by other methods. In this report two cases with hantavirus infection defined serologically were presented. Two male patients, 55 and 50 years old, respectively, living in Giresun province of Eastern Black Sea region, Turkey, were admitted to the State Hospital with the complaints of fever, sweating and diarrhoea without blood or mucus. Since thrombocytopenia and renal failure were detected in these two cases, they were transferred to the University Hospital. Presence of fever, thrombocytopenia and renal failure, with no laboratory findings of a bacterial infection and no growth of microoorganisms in the clinical specimens, admittance of the patients during summer and history of being present in the fields, necessitated to rule out leptospirosis, Crimean Kongo hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus infection which were all endemic in our area. Further investigation of the serum samples at the National Reference Virology Laboratory by IFA (Hantavirus Mosaic-1, Euroimmun, Germany) revealed hantavirus IgM and IgG antibodies ≥ 1:100 titer and the results were confirmed by immunoblot test (Hantavirus Profile 1 EUROLINE IgG and IgM, Euroimmun, Germany).

HFWRS during the pregnancy has relatively low occurrence, with only few described cases mostly in the region of the former Soviet Union. Although, according to the data from the literature, the disease is less severe during the pregnancy, the eclampsy, stillbirth and fetal infection were also described.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the summer period, June-September 2002 in the area of northeast Montenegro, and mainly among people whose job was connected with rural areas, the HFRS was observed more frequently. In that area during the stated period, 12 patients underwent treatment whose disease was confirmed by the IIF method at the Torlak Institute of Virology in Belgrade. Among the patients there were two pregnant women aged 23 and 29 (both in their second pregnancies), in the 23rd and 26th gestational week, respectively. The aim of this study is to present 2 case studies and to show the disease impact on fetal development.
RESULTS: The patients aged 23 and 29 yrs, were previously healthy women in their second pregnancies (23rd and 26th gestational week, respectively). The disease had typical beginning. The predictions made according to the laboratory abnormalities and the level of oliguria were that the disease would have a less severe course. Hemorrraghic syndrome was less prominent, and the laboratory analyses were normalized after 15 to 18 days. The monitoring of pregnancy during the disease period and after recovering showed no fetal suffering. The patients had PV delivery, in 39-th an 40-th, respectively.

20972691,Pathogenicity and virulence of the present hantaviruses in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the impact on renal function.,"Dobrava (DOBV) and Puumala (PUUV) viruses are endemic throughout the Balkans and cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of two different hantaviruses on renal function in HFRS patients during the acute stage of illness. We also aimed to assess the DOBV and PUUV distribution between symptomatic HFRS patients and asymptomatic hantavirus antibody-positive subjects. The study included 264 symptomatic HFRS patients and 63 asymptomatic hantavirus antibody-positive healthy subjects. In our study, 131 (49.6%) HFRS patients were regarded as PUUV- and 69 (26.1%) as DOBV-infected patients, while in 64 (24.2%) of HFRS patients that showed all clinical and biochemical signs of HFRS, the causal hantavirus could not be determined with commercially available tests. DOBV-infected patients were associated with more requirements for haemodialysis treatment, lower diuresis and higher serum creatinine and urea values compared to PUUV-infected patients. PUUV was significantly predominant in asymptomatic hantavirus antibody-positive subjects (69.8%) compared to HFRS patients. DOBV was present in 17.5% of asymptomatic subjects and, interestingly, the preferential hantavirus serotype could not be determined in 12.7% of the asymptomatic antibody-positive subjects.","['Hukić M', 'Valjevac A', 'Tulumovic D', 'Numanovic F', 'Heyman P']",2011,30,3,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Hukić M, et al.

20959714,[Correlations between climate change-related infectious diseases and meteorological factors in Korea].,"OBJECTIVES: Infectious diseases are known to be affected by climate change. We investigated if the infectious diseases were related to meteorological factors in Korea.
METHODS: Scrub typhus, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), leptospirosis, malaria and Vibrio vulnificus sepsis among the National Notifiable Infectious Diseases were selected as the climate change-related infectious diseases. Temperature, relative humidity and precipitation were used as meteorological factors. The study period was from 2001 through 2008. We examined the seasonality of the diseases and those correlations with meteorological factors. We also analyzed the correlations between the incidences of the diseases during the outbreak periods and monthly meteorological factors in the hyper-endemic regions.
RESULTS: All of the investigated diseases showed strong seasonality; malaria and V. vulnificus sepsis were prevalent in summer and scrub typhus, HFRS and leptospirosis were prevalent in the autumn. There were significant correlations between the monthly numbers of cases and all the meteorological factors for malaria and V. vulnificus sepsis, but there were no correlation for the other diseases. However, the incidence of scrub typhus in hyper-endemic region during the outbreak period was positively correlated with temperature and humidity during the summer. The incidences of HFRS and leptospirosis had positive correlations with precipitation in November and temperature and humidity in February, respectively. V. vulnificus sepsis showed positive correlations with precipitation in April/May/July.
CONCLUSIONS: In Korea, the incidences of the infectious diseases were correlated with meteorological factors, and this implies that the incidences could be influenced by climate change.","['Kim SH', 'Jang JY']",2010,43,5,J Prev Med Public Health,Kim SH and Jang JY.

20939264,Characterization of a natural focus of Puumala hantavirus infection in the Czech Republic.,"Hantaviruses are RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family, represented in the Czech Republic by three genospecies: Dobrava-Belgrade, Puumala and Tula. They persist in natural foci of infection. In 2004 to 2009, a local outbreak with 18 reported cases of nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala hantavirus occurred in the Sumava mountains and foothills and was spacially associated with another outbreak in Lower Bavaria, Germany. In the Jeleni locality in the Sumava mountains at 880 m above sea level, we identified a natural focus of infection suspected to be the source of hantavirus infection in forest workers. The focus was characterized geobotanically as a montane mixed forest with the predominance of beeches within the association Dentario enneaphylli-Fagetum, alliance Fagion, sub-alliance Eu-Fagenion, in a cold climate region with a podzolic soil. The biocenoses where hantaviruses are circulating typically show higher microclimate humidity. Their characteristization can be helpful in predicting where hantaviruses are likely to circulate.","['Pejcoch M', 'Unar J', 'Kríz B', 'Pauchová E', 'Rose R']",2010,18,2,Cent Eur J Public Health,"Pejcoch M, et al.

20822577,Environmental risk factors for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in a French new epidemic area.,"In France, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic along the Belgian border. However, this rodent-borne zoonosis caused by the Puumala virus has recently spread south to the Franche-Comté region. We investigated the space-time distribution of HFRS and evaluated the influence of environmental factors that drive the hantavirus reservoir abundance and/or the disease transmission in this area. A scan test clearly indicated space-time clustering, highlighting a single-year (2005) epidemic in the southern part of the region, preceded by a heat-wave 2 years earlier. A Bayesian regression approach showed an association between a variable reflecting biomass (normalized difference vegetation index) and HFRS incidence. The reasons why HFRS cases recently emerged remain largely unknown, and climate parameters alone do not reliably predict outbreaks. Concerted efforts that combine reservoir monitoring, surveillance, and investigation of human cases are warranted to better understand the epidemiological patterns of HFRS in this area.","['Viel JF', 'Lefebvre A', 'Marianneau P', 'Joly D', 'Giraudoux P', 'Upegui E', 'Tordo N', 'Hoen B']",2011,139,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Viel JF, et al.

20810734,Andes virus disrupts the endothelial cell barrier by induction of vascular endothelial growth factor and downregulation of VE-cadherin.,"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are severe diseases associated with hantavirus infection. High levels of virus replication occur in microvascular endothelial cells but without a virus-induced cytopathic effect. However, virus infection results in microvascular leakage, which is the hallmark of these diseases. VE-cadherin is a major component of adherens junctions, and its interaction with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, VEGF-R2, is important for maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier. Here we report that increased secreted VEGF and concomitant decreased VE-cadherin are seen at early times postinfection of human primary lung endothelial cells with an HPS-associated hantavirus, Andes virus. Furthermore, active virus replication results in increased permeability and loss of the integrity of the endothelial cell barrier. VEGF binding to VEGF-R2 is known to result in dissociation of VEGF-R2 from VE-cadherin and in VE-cadherin activation, internalization, and degradation. Consistent with this, we showed that an antibody which blocks VEGF-R2 activation resulted in inhibition of the Andes virus-induced VE-cadherin reduction. These data implicate virus induction of VEGF and reduction in VE-cadherin in the endothelial cell permeability seen in HPS and suggest potential immunotherapeutic targets for the treatment of the disease.","['Shrivastava-Ranjan P', 'Rollin PE', 'Spiropoulou CF']",2010,84,21,J Virol,"Shrivastava-Ranjan P, et al.

Serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles were assessed during the oliguric and recovery phases in six male patients with HFRS. In the oliguric phase of HFRS, the apolipoprotein (apo) C-III content in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) was elevated, whereas the apoA-I content was lowered. The level of expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes were severely reduced during the oliguric phase, while the cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity and protein level were unchanged between the phases. In the oliguric phase, electromobility of HDL2 and HDL3 was faster than in the recovery phase. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size was smaller and the distribution was less homogeneous.

20725844,Elevated sICAM-1 levels in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Hantaan virus.,"Increased vascular permeability and vascular leakage are characteristic pathological changes in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Vascular endothelial cells are the main targets of Hantaan virus, the etiological agent of the severe form of HFRS. Hantaan virus can induce extensive damage of small blood vessels and capillaries. In vitro infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by Hantaan virus can induce the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The involvement of this molecule is implied in human HFRS. In the present study, serum-soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) levels were determined and their relationships with the clinical course and disease severity were investigated in 112 HFRS patients and 30 healthy controls. The results showed that the serum levels of sICAM-1 in HFRS patients at fever, hypotensive, oliguric, and polyuric phases were significantly higher than those in controls (p < 0.001). However, no significant differences between the serum concentrations of sICAM-1 in the milder and more severe groups of patients were observed (p > 0.05). It is suggested that sICAM-1 was involved in the progression of HFRS. Time-dependent determinations of sICAM-1 levels may be indicators for the progression of disease, and elevated levels of sICAM-1 were not suggested to be correlated to disease severity.","['Han Q', 'Zhang L', 'Liu Z', 'Kang W', 'Lou S', 'Qiu J', 'Li Z', 'Zhang G', 'Wang Y', 'Li M', 'Li N']",2010,29,12,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Han Q, et al.

20706629,"Spatiotemporal trends and climatic factors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemic in Shandong Province, China.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by Hantaviruses. It is endemic in all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and metropolitan areas in mainland China where human cases account for 90% of the total global cases. Shandong Province is among the most serious endemic areas. HFRS cases in Shandong Province were first reported in Yutai County in 1968. Since then, the disease has spread across the province, and as of 2005, all 111 counties were reported to have local human infections. However, causes underlying such rapid spread and wide distribution remain less well understood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here we report a spatiotemporal analysis of human HFRS cases in Shandong using data spanning 1973 to 2005. Seasonal incidence maps and velocity vector maps were produced to analyze the spread of HFRS over time in Shandong Province, and a panel data analysis was conducted to explore the association between HFRS incidence and climatic factors. Results show a rapid spread of HFRS from its epicenter in Rizhao, Linyi, Weifang Regions in southern Shandong to north, east, and west parts of the province. Based on seasonal shifts of epidemics, three epidemic phases were identified over the 33-year period. The first phase occurred between 1973 and 1982 during which the foci of HFRS was located in the south Shandong and the epidemic peak occurred in the fall and winter, presenting a seasonal characteristic of Hantaan virus (HTNV) transmission. The second phase between 1983 and 1985 was characterized by northward and westward spread of HFRS foci, and increases in incidence of HFRS in both fall-winter and spring seasons. The human infections in the spring reflected a characteristic pattern of Seoul virus (SEOV) transmission. The third phase between 1986 and 2005 was characterized by the northeast spread of the HFRS foci until it covered all counties, and the HFRS incidence in the fall-winter season decreased while it remained high in the spring. In addition, our findings suggest that precipitation, humidity, and temperature are major environmental variables that are associated with the seasonal variation of HFRS incidence in Shandong Province.
CONCLUSIONS: The spread of HFRS in Shandong Province may have been accompanied by seasonal shifts of HTNV-dominated transmission to SEOV-dominated transmission over the past three decades. The variations in HFRS incidence were significantly associated with local precipitation, humidity, and temperature.","['Fang LQ', 'Wang XJ', 'Liang S', 'Li YL', 'Song SX', 'Zhang WY', 'Qian Q', 'Li YP', 'Wei L', 'Wang ZQ', 'Yang H', 'Cao WC']",2010,4,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Fang LQ, et al.

20691810,Tnf-α expression and promoter sequences reflect the balance of tolerance/resistance to Puumala hantavirus infection in European bank vole populations.,"The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) influences the ability to limit parasite infection but its over-production might result in inflammatory disorders. The level of Tnf-α gene expression could thus mediate a balance of tolerance/resistance to infections. This study focused on Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection in its rodent host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). In humans, PUUV is responsible of a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, nephropathia epidemica (NE). The severity of NE is associated with an over-production of TNF-α. By contrast, PUUV infection in bank vole is chronic and asymptomatic. It is likely that different coevolutionary histories between PUUV and its hosts could lead to different balances of resistance/tolerance to PUUV infection, at least partly mediated by variable production levels of TNF-α. We investigated the hypothesis that bank voles from PUUV endemic areas should exhibit higher levels of tolerance, i.e. lower levels of TNF-α production, than bank voles from areas where PUUV prevalence is low. For this purpose, we analysed variations of Tnf-α gene expression and promoter sequences among European populations of bank voles. Our results revealed an absence of up-regulation of Tnf-α gene expression in PUUV infected bank voles and significant differences in Tnf-α gene expression level with regard to PUUV endemicity. These results corroborated the hypothesis of different balances of tolerance/resistance to PUUV. Two single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes within the Tnf-α promoter (-302 GG/GG and -296 A/A) were associated with higher Tnf-α gene expression and were more frequent in non-endemic areas. This study emphasized the potential influence of selection acting on TNF-α production and mediating a tolerance/resistance balance to PUUV in bank voles. Further investigations, including the role of phenotypic plasticity and parasite communities on Tnf-α expression levels, should provide important keys to understand the prevalence of PUUV over Europe.","['Guivier E', 'Galan M', 'Salvador AR', 'Xuéreb A', 'Chaval Y', 'Olsson GE', 'Essbauer S', 'Henttonen H', 'Voutilainen L', 'Cosson JF', 'Charbonnel N']",2010,10,8,Infect Genet Evol,"Guivier E, et al.

METHODS: 92 eyes of 46 patients with serologically proven NE were examined during the acute phase and after clinical recovery. Ocular symptoms were recorded, and visual acuity, refraction, intraocular pressure and ocular dimensions were evaluated.
RESULTS: 88% of the patients experienced decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) (p<0.001), 87% reduced visual acuity, 87% conjunctival chemosis, 82% thickening of the lens (p<0.05), 78% myopic shift (p<0.001), 64% shallowing of the anterior chamber (p<0.05) and 52% shallowing of vitreous length (p<0.05) during the acute phase compared with that measured after clinical recovery. In all, 70% of the patients reported ocular symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Ocular symptoms and disturbances are common in acute NE, and the symmetry of the ocular changes reflects the systemic nature of the disease. A decrease in IOP and myopic shift mainly due to thickening of the lens are evident in acute disease. The myopic shift only partially explains the visual disturbances supporting the possible multifactorial origin of the ocular findings in patients with NE.","['Hautala N', 'Kauma H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Mähönen SM', 'Vainio O', 'Vaheri A', 'Hautala T']",2011,95,4,Br J Ophthalmol,"Hautala N, et al.

Hemorrhage is due to endothelial barrier damage and a sharp decrease in platelet counts. The mechanisms underlying HTNV-associated acute thrombocytopenia have not been elucidated so far. Platelets are produced by mature megakaryocytes that develop during megakaryopoiesis. In this study, we show that HTNV targets megakaryocytic cells whereas rather non-pathogenic hantaviruses did not infect this cell type. After induction of differentiation megakaryocytic cells switched from low-level to high-level HTNV production without reduction in cell survival or alteration in differentiation. However, increased HTNV replication resulted in strong upregulation of HLA class I molecules although HTNV escaped type I interferon (IFN)-associated innate responses. Taken together, HTNV efficiently replicates in differentiating megakaryocytic cells resulting in upregulation of HLA class I molecules, the target structures for cytotoxic T cells (CTLs).","['Lütteke N', 'Raftery MJ', 'Lalwani P', 'Lee MH', 'Giese T', 'Voigt S', 'Bannert N', 'Schulze H', 'Krüger DH', 'Schönrich G']",2010,405,1,Virology,"Lütteke N, et al.

METHODS: 3459 Leptotrombidium scutellares from mice bodies and 3265 which were free were collected in the epidemic area of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and tsutsugamushi disease.15 days later, the suspensions of lung and spleen of mice with 6 in a group stung by 1, 5 or 10 infected mites were injected intra-cerebrally into other mice for the detection of HV and OT in the next 6 generations of the mice, with immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) and Giemsa staining technique. The passages of Vero-E6 cells inoculated on the aseptic filtrations from different number of infected mites were used to detect HV and OT pathogens. HV-RNA and OT-DNA were detected by PCR.
RESULTS: After passage, HV positive mouse body mite group out of both 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, OT positive mouse body mite group out of the 10 mites in the sixth generation, both HV and OT positive mouse body mite group out of 1 mite in the fifth and sixth generation, both HV and OT positive mouse body mite group out of 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, and free mites group out of 1, 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, were found one mouse infected by both HV and OT, respectively. Out of the fourth generation of Vero-E6 cells, one sample was found both HV and OT positive out of 5 and 10 HV and OT mouse body mite group, respectively. In the sixth generation, both HV and OT positive cells were detected in one mouse mite group and the 1, 5, 10 free mite groups, respectively. HV-RNA and OT-DNA were all detected by PCR.
CONCLUSION: Both HV and OT could be coexisted in wild Leptotrombidium scutellare and transmitted by stinging.","['Yu J', 'Deng XZ', 'Yang ZQ', 'Yao PP', 'Zhu HP', 'Xiong HR', 'Li CL', 'Zhang Y']",2010,44,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Yu J, et al.

20644685,Satellite derived forest phenology and its relation with nephropathia epidemica in Belgium.,"The connection between nephropathia epidemica (NE) and vegetation dynamics has been emphasized in recent studies. Changing climate has been suggested as a triggering factor of recently observed epidemiologic peaks in reported NE cases. We have investigated whether there is a connection between the NE occurrence pattern in Belgium and specific trends in remotely sensed phenology parameters of broad-leaved forests. The analysis of time series of the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index revealed that changes in forest phenology, considered in literature as an effect of climate change, may affect the mechanics of NE transmission.","['Barrios JM', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Maes P', 'Clement J', 'Aerts JM', 'Haredasht SA', 'Wambacq J', 'Lagrou K', 'Ducoffre G', 'Van Ranst M', 'Berckmans D', 'Coppin P']",2010,7,6,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Barrios JM, et al.

20642397,Early diagnosis of hantavirus infection by family doctors can reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and hospitalization.,"OBJECTIVE: Hantavirus infections are emerging infections that cause either Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). A recent Swedish outbreak of nephropathia epidemica, a European HFRS, was analysed to study the patient flow and clinical picture and to investigate the value of an early diagnosis in general practice. Design. In a retrospective design, medical records of verified cases of Hantavirus infection were studied.
SETTING: The study was conducted in the county of Norrbotten, Sweden.
SUBJECTS: Data from Hantavirus patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2008 were analysed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic data, level of care, treatment, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings were obtained.
RESULTS: In total, 456 cases were included (58% males and 42% females). The majority of patients first saw their general practitioner and were exclusively treated in general practice (83% and 56%, respectively). When diagnosed correctly at the first visit, antibiotics and hospitalization were significantly lowered compared with delayed diagnosis (14% vs. 53% and 30% vs. 54%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The clinical picture was diverse. Early thrombocytopenia was found in 65% of the patients, and haemorrhagic manifestations were documented in a few cases. Signs of renal involvement--haematuria, proteinuria, and raised levels of serum creatinine--were found in a majority of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Raised awareness in general practice regarding emerging infections and better diagnostic tools are desirable. This study of a Hantavirus outbreak shows that general practitioners are frontline doctors during outbreaks and through early and correct diagnosis they can reduce antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.","['Brorstad A', 'Oscarsson KB', 'Ahlm C']",2010,28,3,Scand J Prim Health Care,"Brorstad A, et al.

20579693,Enhanced thrombin formation and fibrinolysis during acute Puumala hantavirus infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a viral hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome associated with thrombocytopenia and mild bleeding. We assessed activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis during the acute phase of NE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 19 hospital-treated patients were involved. Plasma levels of D-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT%), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), protein S free antigen (PS), protein C (PC) and complete blood count (CBC) were measured three times during the acute phase and once at 32-54 days after the onset of fever (recovery phase). Laboratory abnormalities were evaluated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring advocated by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH).
RESULTS: APTT was prolonged and D-dimer and F1+2 increased during the acute phase of NE. AT, PC and PS decreased, and TT was shortened, all implying increased thrombin generation. Acutely F1+2 was 3.4-fold and D-dimer even 24-fold higher compared with the recovery phase (median 726 vs 213 pmol/l, and median 4.8 vs 0.2mg/l, respectively, p<0.001 for both). Platelet count correlated with AT, PC, and PS (r=0.73, r=0.81, and r=0.71, respectively, p<0.001 for all) as well as with fibrinogen (r=0.72, p<0.001). Only five patients fulfilled the ISTH diagnosis of DIC.
CONCLUSIONS: During acute NE thrombocytopenia was associated with decreased natural anticoagulants, shortened thrombin time and enhanced fibrinolysis. Augmented thrombin formation and fibrinolysis characterize this hantavirus infection.","['Laine O', 'Mäkelä S', 'Mustonen J', 'Huhtala H', 'Szanto T', 'Vaheri A', 'Lassila R', 'Joutsi-Korhonen L']",2010,126,2,Thromb Res,"Laine O, et al.

We considered voles sampled in five European localities or derived from a previous experiment that showed variable infection success of PUUV. The genetic variation observed in the Dqa and Drb genes was assessed by using single-strand conformation polymorphism and pyrosequencing methods, respectively. Patterns were compared with those obtained from 13 microsatellites. We revealed significant genetic differentiation between PUUV-seronegative and -seropositive bank voles sampled in wild populations, at the Drb gene only. The absence of genetic differentiation observed at neutral microsatellites confirmed the important role of selective pressures in shaping these Drb patterns. Also, we found no significant associations between infection success and MHC alleles among laboratory-colonized bank voles, which is explained by a loss of genetic variability that occurred during the captivity of these voles.","['Guivier E', 'Galan M', 'Malé PJ', 'Kallio ER', 'Voutilainen L', 'Henttonen H', 'Olsson GE', 'Lundkvist A', 'Tersago K', 'Augot D', 'Cosson JF', 'Charbonnel N']",2010,91,Pt 10,J Gen Virol,"Guivier E, et al.

20517744,Snakebites in adults from the Diyarbakir region in southeast Turkey.,"BACKGROUND: Snake venom poisoning is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention. Bites from poisonous Turkish snakes can lead to local tissue damage and systemic symptoms. The Vipera ammodytes species accounts for the majority of envenomation in southeast Turkey.
METHODS: The demographic and epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcome of 79 consecutive victims of V. ammodytes poisoning admitted to our hospital from 2003 to 2005 were reviewed and analyzed prospectively.
RESULTS: The most common symptoms and signs included fang marks (100%), pain (100%), swelling (83.5%), ecchymosis (92.4%), tachycardia (24.1%), fainting or dizziness (14.5%), fever (19.0%), enlargement of regional lymph nodes (43.0%), nausea (70.9%), hypotension (21.5%), vomiting (36.7%), and dyspnea (3.2%). The main complications were thrombophlebitis, reduced range of motion, local hemorrhagic blister formation, bleeding from skin, rhabdomyolysis, reduced sensation, acute renal failure, necrosis with tissue loss, digit amputation, carpal tunnel syndrome, and compartment syndrome.
CONCLUSION: A V. Ammodytes bite is a potentially serious event that requires immediate hospital care. Nevertheless, the majority of victims can be treated successfully with conservative methods.

20502044,The severity of acute Puumala hantavirus infection does not predict the long-term outcome of patients.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We have found greater urinary protein excretion and higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood pressure in patients 6 years after acute nephropathia epidemica (NE) compared with seronegative controls. The present aim was to establish whether the long-term outcome is determined by the severity of acute illness.
METHODS: Serial plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), creatinine, C-reactive protein, blood cell count as well as 24-hour urinary protein and overnight α(1)-microglobulin and albumin excretions were measured in 37 patients with acute NE. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B, HLA-DRB1, TNF-α(-308) and IL-6(-174) alleles were also analyzed. After 6 years, GFR, blood pressure and urinary protein excretion were examined.
RESULTS: There were no associations between the clinical severity of acute NE or the genetic factors determined and the increased GFR, hypertension or 24-hour urinary protein excretion observed 6 years later. The degree of inflammation during the acute phase was higher in patients who had increased urinary excretion of α(1)-microglobulin 6 years later compared with those with no α(1)-microglobulin excretion.
CONCLUSION: Neither the severity of acute NE nor the host genetic factors determined the predicted renal function, blood pressure or 24-hour urinary protein excretion 6 years later.","['Miettinen MH', 'Mäkelä SM', 'Ala-Houhala IO', 'Huhtala HS', 'Hurme MA', 'Kööbi T', 'Partanen JA', 'Pasternack AI', 'Vaheri A', 'Pörsti IH', 'Mustonen JT']",2010,116,2,Nephron Clin Pract,"Miettinen MH, et al.

20500875,The severity of Puumala hantavirus induced nephropathia epidemica can be better evaluated using plasma interleukin-6 than C-reactive protein determinations.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a Scandinavian type of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus. The clinical course of the disease varies greatly in severity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels associate with the severity of NE.
METHODS: A prospectively collected cohort of 118 consecutive hospital-treated patients with acute serologically confirmed NE was examined. Plasma IL-6, CRP, and creatinine, as well as blood cell count and daily urinary protein excretion were measured on three consecutive days after admission. Plasma IL-6 and CRP levels higher than the median were considered high.
RESULTS: We found that high IL-6 associated with most variables reflecting the severity of the disease. When compared to patients with low IL-6, patients with high IL-6 had higher maximum blood leukocyte count (11.9 vs 9.0 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.001) and urinary protein excretion (2.51 vs 1.68 g/day, P = 0.017), as well as a lower minimum blood platelet count (55 vs 80 x 10(9)/l, P < 0.001), hematocrit (0.34 vs 0.38, P = 0.001), and urinary output (1040 vs 2180 ml/day, P < 0.001). They also stayed longer in hospital than patients with low IL-6 (8 vs 6 days, P < 0.001). In contrast, high CRP did not associate with severe disease.
CONCLUSIONS: High plasma IL-6 concentrations associate with a clinically severe acute Puumala hantavirus infection, whereas high plasma CRP as such does not reflect the severity of the disease.","['Outinen TK', 'Mäkelä SM', 'Ala-Houhala IO', 'Huhtala HS', 'Hurme M', 'Paakkala AS', 'Pörsti IH', 'Syrjänen JT', 'Mustonen JT']",2010,10,,BMC Infect Dis,"Outinen TK, et al.

METHODS: Cross-sectional studies were conducted to test the kidney function and blood pressure of HFRS-affected patients and to follow them up 10 years after. Eighty-two PUUV- and 53 DOBV-induced HFRS patients and 14 and 31 participants 10 years after having contracted PUUV- and DOBV-related diseases, respectively were evaluated.
RESULTS: Serum creatinine concentrations were 279.5 and 410 mcmol/L in PUUV and DOBV groups, respectively (P = 0.005). There were six and 13 anuric (P < 0.05), none and seven dialysis-dependant (P < 0.05), and nine and 18 hypotensive patients (P < 0.05) in PUUV and DOBV groups, respectively.

Acute liver injury is a severe complicating factor in dengue, predisposing to life-threatening hemorrhage, Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and encephalopathy. Therefore we sought to determine the frequency of hepatitis in dengue infection and to compare the outcome (length of stay, in hospital mortality, complications) between patients of Dengue who have mild/moderate (ALT 23-300 IU/L) v/s severe acute hepatitis (ALT > 300 IU/L).
METHODS: A Cohort study of inpatients with dengue viral infection done at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. All patients (> or = 14 yrs age) admitted with diagnosis of Dengue Fever (DF), Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) were included. Chi square test was used to compare categorical variables and fischer exact test where applicable. Survival analysis (Cox regression and log rank) for primary outcome was done. Student t test was used to compare continuous variables. A p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was taken as significant.
RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety nine patients were enrolled, including 87% (605) patients with DF and 13% (94) patients with DHF or DSS. Liver functions tests showed median ALT of 88.50 IU/L; IQR 43.25-188 IU/L, median AST of 174 IU/L; IQR 87-371.5 IU/L and median T.Bil of 0.8 mg/dl; IQR 0.6-1.3 mg/dl.

The serum and urinary cystatin C concentrations significantly increased in HFRS patients compared with normal controls (p < 0.001). In the acute phase of HFRS, urinary cystatin C increased to higher levels than serum creatinine, especially in severe or critical cases in the oliguric stage. Furthermore, higher levels of urinary cystatin C in the acute phase positively correlated with increased severity of the subsequent kidney injury. In conclusion, urinary cystatin C is a more sensitive clinical marker for AKI in HFRS, which may enable us to initiate treatment measures as early as possible.","['Ma Y', 'Li Q', 'Wang J', 'Xu Z', 'Song C', 'Zhuang R', 'Yang K', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2010,15,5,Biomarkers,"Ma Y, et al.

20433802,Hantavirus-like particles generated in CHO cells induce specific immune responses in C57BL/6 mice.,"A safe and effective hantavirus vaccine is highly desirable since hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and cause an acute and often fatal disease (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, HFRS). Virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying functional viral proteins could provide effective vaccines against a few viruses, but their ability to induce hantavirus-specific immune response has not been adequately investigated. To measure the immunogenicity of Hantaan virus-like particles (HTN-VLPs) vaccine, we generated recombinant HTN-VLPs by co-expressing Hantaan virus nucleocapsid (N) protein and glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We compared intramuscular versus subcutaneous administration of HTN-VLPs for the ability to induce specific immune response against Hantaan virus infection. Mice that received both intramuscular and subcutaneous immunizations of HTN-VLPs were sufficiently stimulated specific antibody response against Hantaan virus N protein and glycoproteins, which was comparable to Chinese commercial inactivated bivalent hantaviruses vaccine. Moreover, vaccination with HTN-VLPs also resulted in the induction of higher levels of specific cellular response to N protein than that of inactivated vaccine. Our results provide an important insight towards the development of hantaviruses-like particles as a potential candidate vaccine for the control and prevention of hantaviruses infection.","['Li C', 'Liu F', 'Liang M', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang X', 'Wang T', 'Li J', 'Li D']",2010,28,26,Vaccine,"Li C, et al.

20397036,Hormonal deficiencies during and after Puumala hantavirus infection.,"Previous reports have described panhypopituitarism associated with severe cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), but the prevalence of hormonal deficiencies after nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of HFRS, has not been studied. This study was conducted in order to determine the prevalence of hormonal defects in patients with acute NE and during long-term follow-up. Fifty-four patients with serologically confirmed acute NE were examined by serum hormonal measurements during the acute NE, after 3 months, and after 1 to 10 (median 5) years. Thirty out of 54 (56%) patients had abnormalities of the gonadal and/or thyroid axis during the acute NE. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 9 (17%) patients were diagnosed with a chronic, overt hormonal deficit: hypopituitarism was found in five patients and primary hypothyroidism in five patients. In addition, chronic subclinical testicular failure was found in five men. High creatinine levels and inflammatory markers during NE were associated with the acute central hormone deficiencies, but not with the chronic deficiencies. Hormonal defects are common during acute NE and, surprisingly, many patients develop chronic hormonal deficiencies after NE. The occurrence of long-term hormonal defects cannot be predicted by the severity of acute NE.","['Mäkelä S', 'Jaatinen P', 'Miettinen M', 'Salmi J', 'Ala-Houhala I', 'Huhtala H', 'Hurme M', 'Pörsti I', 'Vaheri A', 'Mustonen J']",2010,29,6,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Mäkelä S, et al.

20375360,"A global perspective on hantavirus ecology, epidemiology, and disease.","Hantaviruses are enzootic viruses that maintain persistent infections in their rodent hosts without apparent disease symptoms. The spillover of these viruses to humans can lead to one of two serious illnesses, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In recent years, there has been an improved understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of these viruses following an increase in the number of outbreaks in the Americas. In this review, current concepts regarding the ecology of and disease associated with these serious human pathogens are presented. Priorities for future research suggest an integration of the ecology and evolution of these and other host-virus ecosystems through modeling and hypothesis-driven research with the risk of emergence, host switching/spillover, and disease transmission to humans.","['Jonsson CB', 'Figueiredo LT', 'Vapalahti O']",2010,23,2,Clin Microbiol Rev,"Jonsson CB, et al.

20236599,[Change of plasma TH1/TH2 cytokines levels in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"OBJECTIVE: To observe changes in T cell subsets and TH1/TH2 secreted cytokines in the plasma of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: Totally 22 patients with HFRS (9 mild cases and 13 moderate cases) were enrolled. Blood samples were taken 1, 4, and 12 weeks after presentation. T cell subsets were tested by flow cytometry (FCM), and the expression of cytokines in plasma were analysed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Another 16 healthy blood donors were enrolled as the control group.
RESULTS: CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes increased at week 1 and 4 (P < 0.01), which was more significant in mild cases than in moderate cases (P < 0.05). The change of CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes during the disease course were not significantly different from that in control group (P > 0.05). One week after presentation, TH1 [interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)] and TH2 (IL-6, IL-10) cytokine productions were significantly higher in HFRS patients than in the control group (P < 0.01); IL-2 and IL-10 remained high levels during the whole observation period, and were still significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.01). At week 4, the plasma IL-5 level was significantly higher in HFRS patients than in the control group (P < 0.01), and were still significantly higher than in the control group at week 12 (P < 0.01). At week 1 and 4, the plasma INF-gamma levels were significantly higher in moderate patients than in mild patients (P < 0.05); at week 12, the plasma IL-10 level was significantly higher in moderate patients than in mild patients(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes remarkably increases at the early stage of disease in patients with mild HFRS. The early cell mediated immune response is helpful for disease control. The cytokines INF-gamma and IL-10 increase more obviously in moderate patients, indicating that cytokines also are key pathogenic factors of HRFS.","['Dai Y', 'Li XL', 'Wang L', 'Qiu ZF', 'Li TS']",2010,32,1,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,"Dai Y, et al.

20223893,Characterization and outcome following Puumala virus infection: a retrospective analysis of 75 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Infection with the Puumala virus (PUUV), which belongs to the Hantavirus family, is a common but often neglected cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in endemic areas of Europe. The objective of the present study was to systematically analyse clinical presentation and renal outcomes following PUUV infection.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, we analysed data from 75 patients who were admitted to two large hospitals in Germany over an 8-year period and who tested positive for PUUV infection. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from patient files; creatinine levels before admission and during follow-up were obtained from phone calls.
RESULTS: Patients were between 16 and 82 years old (average +/- SD, 40.4 +/- 13.4) with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1. They showed a wide variety of clinical presentations with renal failure being the cause of admission in only 50%. AKI developed in 95% of patients who showed maximum creatinine levels of 4.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dl. Four patients required temporary dialysis, and one patient died from pulmonary complications. Thrombocytopaenia (137 +/- 11 x 10(3)/microl) was present in almost all cases, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed in 57 and 100% of patients, respectively. Urinalysis revealed mild to nephrotic proteinuria in 85%, which was often associated with haemoglobinuria. All patients showed full recovery of renal function and return to pre-existing normal serum creatinine levels.
CONCLUSION: In a majority of cases, PUUV infection results in thrombocytopenic AKI. Fever is a requirement for diagnosis, while elevated LDH and CRP values are also frequently observed. Overall, early renal outcomes were excellent.","['Braun N', 'Haap M', 'Overkamp D', 'Kimmel M', 'Alscher MD', 'Lehnert H', 'Haas CS']",2010,25,9,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Braun N, et al.

METHODS: HLA-DR allele polymorphism was detected by PCR-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). Hantavirus (HV) typed as Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) in patients were detected by RT-heminested PCR.
RESULTS: The gene frequency of DRB1*0401-0411, *1001 and *1101-1105 in HFRS case group were 3.1%, 2.2% and 15.7% respectively. Compared with control group, it was significant higher in HFRS case group (RR = 13.87, 9.72 and 2.00 respectively with Chi-square value as 10.006, 6.324 and 6.472 respectively, P < 0.05). When compared with HFRS case group, the gene frequency of DRB1*1501-1502, DRB4 and DRB5 in control group were 11.0%, 19.0% and 16.9% respectively, markedly lower than in patients (RR = 0.45, 0.58 and 0.23 respectively. Chi-square values were 6.138, 4.583 and 21.076 respectively, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in other HLA-DR gene frequencies. Mixed infection was found in Hubei, with HTNV slightly more than SEOV. Distinct hantaviruses could coexist in either different or the same geographic or ecological zores in Hubei province. Patients with HLA-DRB1*1101-1105 alleles were 81.8% (27/33) infected by HTNV and only 18.2% infected by SEOV, which had significant difference (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: DRB1*0401-0411, *1001 and *1101-1105 were possibly associated with increased susceptibility to HV infection.

20142167,Climate variability and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome transmission in Northeastern China.,"BACKGROUND: The transmission of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is influenced by climatic variables. However, few studies have examined the quantitative relationship between climate variation and HFRS transmission.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the potential impact of climate variability on HFRS transmission and developed climate-based forecasting models for HFRS in northeastern China.
METHODS: We obtained data on monthly counts of reported HFRS cases in Elunchun and Molidawahaner counties for 1997-2007 from the Inner Mongolia Center for Disease Control and Prevention and climate data from the Chinese Bureau of Meteorology. Cross-correlations assessed crude associations between climate variables, including rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), relative humidity (RH), and the multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (MEI) and monthly HFRS cases over a range of lags. We used time-series Poisson regression models to examine the independent contribution of climatic variables to HFRS transmission.
RESULTS: Cross-correlation analyses showed that rainfall, LST, RH, and MEI were significantly associated with monthly HFRS cases with lags of 3-5 months in both study areas. The results of Poisson regression indicated that after controlling for the autocorrelation, seasonality, and long-term trend, rainfall, LST, RH, and MEI with lags of 3-5 months were associated with HFRS in both study areas. The final model had good accuracy in forecasting the occurrence of HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: Climate variability plays a significant role in HFRS transmission in northeastern China. The model developed in this study has implications for HFRS control and prevention.","['Zhang WY', 'Guo WD', 'Fang LQ', 'Li CP', 'Bi P', 'Glass GE', 'Jiang JF', 'Sun SH', 'Qian Q', 'Liu W', 'Yan L', 'Yang H', 'Tong SL', 'Cao WC']",2010,118,7,Environ Health Perspect,"Zhang WY, et al.

20120399,The occurrence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.,"Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) has been known as an endemic region for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) for over 50 years. Multiple epidemics of this disease have been registered so far, especially in endemic parts of Central and Northeastern Bosnia, as well as the Sarajevo region. Seroepidemiological investigations demonstrate naturalization of Hantaviruses and their wide spread in B&H. However, there are no studies from the southern areas of B&H, and endemic foci of this disease are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and serologic prevalence of Hantavirus infections by testing for specific IgG antibodies against hantaviruses in the population of Herzegovina. This study included two groups of participants. The target group consisted of 300 participants from exposed professional and population groups, and control group included 100 educators with lower exposure to HFRS. Identification of specific IgG antibodies against hantaviruses in 16 participants confirmed an initial assumption about the presence of Hantavirus infections in the region of interest. Seroprevalence of 5% was registered in the ""exposed"" and 1% in the ""unexposed"" group. Simultaneous circulation of Puumala (PUU) and Dobrava (DOB) viruses was discovered. The frequency of positive antibody results was higher in the population above 50 years of age, and three times more prevalent in men then at women. The highest proportion of exposed participants (80%) was registered in the municipalities which geographically belong to high or mountainous Herzegovina.","['Nikolić J', 'Kuzman I', 'Markotić A', 'Rode OD', 'Curić I', 'Ivanković HB', 'Grgić S']",2009,33 Suppl 2,,Coll Antropol,"Nikolić J, et al.

20116854,Different cross-reactivity of human and rodent sera to Tula virus and Puumala virus.,"Tula virus (TULV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are hantaviruses carried by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and European common vole (Microtus arvalis), respectively. PUUV is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), while TULV is thought to be apathogenic to humans. The N-terminal regions of the N proteins from TULV and PUUV were expressed and applied as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Colonized Japanese grass voles (Microtus montebelli) and BALB/c mice were used for experimental inoculation of the vole-borne hantaviruses TULV and PUUV. Voles and mice showed significant antibody production toward both viruses, but these antisera showed little cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV in the immunofluorescence antibody assay and ELISA. In contrast, sera from patients with HFRS caused by PUUV exhibited high cross-reactivity against the TULV antigen, and sera from a natural rodent reservoir showed moderate cross-reactivity against the heterologous antigen, indicating that the antigenic cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV differs in sera from rodents and humans.","['Tegshduuren E', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Taruishi M', 'Endo R', 'Shimizu K', 'Koma T', 'Yasuda SP', 'Kariwa H', 'Arikawa J', 'Ishihara C']",2010,33,6,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Tegshduuren E, et al.

20088164,Collective immunity of the population from endemic zones of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Kosovo.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), also known as mice fever is an acute viral zoonosis and it appears in the natural focus after the human contact with Hantaan virus infected mice. The objective (purpose) of this study was to investigate the prevalence of specific antibodies in HFRS, in convalescent persons (collective immunity in endemic hearths). In this project we applied the epidemiological method of studying with retrospective-perspective, the serological method for determination and detecting antibodies from the persons of epidemical focus and statistical methods. The disease diagnosis is based on the epidemiological, clinical and serological records. The collected samples have been sent to referral laboratory in Medical Faculty-Institute of Microbiology Ljubljana for laboratory confirmation. From the results we came to conclusion that in the territory of Republic of Kosovo, the HFRS is still a serious health, economic and biological problem. The lethality rate from HFRS in 1986 was 15.4%, 1986-89 10.8%, from 1995-2006 8.70%. The lowest rates of morbidity, mortality and lethality of HFRS compared with the previous periods of time, prove collective immunity growth in Dukagjini valley. For collective immunity research and to conduct the persistence of antibodies for viral corresponding (relative) antigen, after the disease, the samples were collected in the time period of May-June 2008, with 203 persons that were tested with serological method IIF (Indirect immune fluorescence) from which 187 cases (92.1%) resulted sero-negative and 16 cases (7.9%) resulted sero-positive with HFRS. This proves the collective immunity increase for HFRS. From 13 recovered patients previously diagnosed with HFRS (1986-1989-1995), levels of antibodies were screened in 2008 with IIF. Out of 13 persons, positive antibodies were found in 10 cases, while 3 cases were negative for antibodies (HTN, PUU, and DOB). After 13, 19 and 22 years HTN, PUU and DOB antibodies persisted in level (1:16-1:512).

20046023,Epidemiological study of hantavirus infection in the Samara Region of European Russia.,"European Russia is a highly endemic area of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne zoonotic disease, caused by hantaviruses. In total, 145 small mammals of four species (Myodes glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, A. agrarius, and A. uralensis) were trapped in the Samara region of European Russia in August 2005 and examined for the presence of hantavirus (HV). Anti-HV antibodies were found in six of 68 (8.8%) M. glareolus and in one of 19 (5.3%) A. flavicollis by indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). The Puumala virus (PUUV), which is one of the hantavirus species, was detected in the lungs of seven M. glareolus by RT-PCR. The virus S-segment was extremely similar (96.2% to 99.3%) to the sequence found in a fatal case of HFRS in the Samara region. Phylogenetic analyses of S and M segments showed that the Samara PUUVs form a cluster within the Russian Volga lineage and apparently differ from other European PUUVs. Anti-PUUV antibodies were found in blood sera from seven HFRS patients and from one undiagnosed patient from the Samara region, using IFA and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These data suggest that the bank vole M. glareolus is a primary natural reservoir and vector for PUUV, which is the main causative agent of HFRS in humans in the Samara region.","['Kariwa H', 'Tkachenko EA', 'Morozov VG', 'Seto T', 'Tanikawa Y', 'Kolominov SI', 'Belov SN', 'Nakamura I', 'Hashimoto N', 'Balakiev AE', 'Dzagurnova TK', 'Daud NH', 'Miyashita D', 'Medvedkina OA', 'Nakauchi M', 'Ishizuka M', 'Yoshii K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Takashima I']",2009,71,12,J Vet Med Sci,"Kariwa H, et al.

Under the optimized LC conditions, all of the HFRs eluted from the LC column within 14min, while maintaining good chromatographic separation for the isomers. Introduction of the pre-heated dopant to the APPI source decreased the background noise fivefold, which enhanced sensitivity. An empirical equation was proposed to describe the relation between the ion intensity and dopant flow. The excellent on-column instrument detection limits averaged 4.7pg, which was similar to the sensitivity offered by gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). This method was used to analyze a series of fish samples. Good agreement was found between the results for PBDEs from LC-APPI-MS/MS and GC-HRMS.","['Zhou SN', 'Reiner EJ', 'Marvin C', 'Kolic T', 'Riddell N', 'Helm P', 'Dorman F', 'Misselwitz M', 'Brindle ID']",2010,1217,5,J Chromatogr A,"Zhou SN, et al.

20012277,Production and characterization of a recombinant single-chain antibody against Hantaan virus envelop glycoprotein.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is the type of Hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, for which no specific therapeutics are available so far. Cell type-specific internalizing antibodies can be used to deliver therapeutics intracellularly to target cell and thus, have potential application in anti-HTNV infection. To achieve intracellular delivery of therapeutics, it is necessary to obtain antibodies that demonstrate sufficient cell type-specific binding, internalizing, and desired cellular trafficking. Here, we describe the prokaryotic expression, affinity purification, and functional testing of a single-chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) against HTNV envelop glycoprotein (GP), an HTNV-specific antigen normally located on the membranes of HTNV-infected cells. This HTNV GP-targeting antibody, scFv3G1, was produced in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells as a soluble protein and was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified scFv possessed a high specific antigen-binding activity to HTNV GP and HTNV-infected Vero E6 cells and could be internalized into HTNV-infected cells probably through the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways similar to that observed with transferrin. Our results showed that the E. coli-produced scFv had potential applications in targeted and intracellular delivery of therapeutics against HTNV infections.","['Yang J', 'Chen R', 'Wei J', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Jia L', 'Yan Y', 'Luo W', 'Cao Y', 'Yao L', 'Sun J', 'Xu Z', 'Yang A']",2010,86,4,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Yang J, et al.

19999378,[From mice to men: the threat of hantavirus infections].,"Hantaviruses are naturally hosted by small mammals. Virus transmission to humans can result in the development of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (Asia, Europe) or Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (The Americas). Certain hantaviruses can cause life-treatening infections with case fatality indices up to about 50%. Different virus types have evolved which use different species of small mammals (mainly but not exclusively rodent species) as natural reservoirs. It is still unknown why these different hantaviruses exhibit a different virulence when transmitted to humans as accidental hosts.

19967132,Hantavirus regulation of endothelial cell functions.,"Hantaviruses cause two vascular permeability-based diseases and primarily infect endothelial cells which form the primary fluid barrier of the vasculature. Since hantavirus infections are not lytic, the mechanisms by which hantaviruses cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) are indeterminate. HPS is associated with acute pulmonary oedema and HFRS with moderate haemorrhage and renal sequelae, perhaps reflecting the location of vast microvascular beds and endothelial cell reservoirs available for hantavirus infection. Endothelial cells regulate capillary integrity, and hantavirus infection provides a primary means for altering vascular permeability that contributes to pathogenesis. The central importance of endothelial cells in regulating oedema, vascular repair, angiogenesis, immune cell recruitment, platelet deposition as well as gas exchange and solute delivery suggest that a multitude of inputs and cellular responses may be influenced by hantavirus infection and contribute to pathogenic changes in vascular permeability. Here we focus on understanding hantavirus interactions with endothelial cells which are linked to vascular permeability, and provide insight into the contribution of endothelial cell responses in hantavirus pathogenesis.","['Mackow ER', 'Gavrilovskaya IN']",2009,102,6,Thromb Haemost,Mackow ER and Gavrilovskaya IN.

However, during the most recent decade, there has been a paucity of human cases despite the detection of hantavirus in rodents of this area.
CASE REPORTS: We present herein the cases of two patients with VHF, arising in the same area, hospitalized for a short period of time. One patient presented with renal failure, while severe hepatic involvement was predominant in the other. Significantly high ELISA antibody titers for hantavirus established the diagnosis. Supportive treatment led to a successful outcome in both cases. We further discuss the difficulties in differential diagnosis of VHF from other zoonoses with similar endemicity, such as leptospirosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the continuing presence of VHF in rural Greece is needed, and a rapid diagnosis is important for the correct therapeutic approach. Continuous surveillance for such diseases, at both the animal (rodents) and human level, is warranted.","['Akritidis N', 'Boboyianni C', 'Pappas G']",2010,14,1,Int J Infect Dis,"Akritidis N, et al.

HFRS is caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), Saaremaa virus (SAAV), and Puumala virus (PUUV). Of those, only HTNV is not present in Europe. In recent years, hantaviruses, described in other parts of Europe, were also detected at various locations in Hungary. To study the genetic properties of Hungarian hantaviruses in detail, sequences of the viral S and M segments were recovered from bank voles (Myodes glareolus), yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), and striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) trapped in the Transdanubian region. As expected, the sequences recovered belonged, respectively, to PUUV (two strains), DOBV (one strain), and SAAV (one strain). On phylogenetic trees two new Hungarian PUUV strains located within the well- supported Alpe-Adrian (ALAD) genetic lineage that included also Austrian, Slovenian, and Croatian strains. Analysis of the Hungarian SAAV and DOBV genetic variants showed host-specific clustering and also geographical clustering within each of these hantavirus species. Hungarian SAAV and DOBV strains were related most closely to strains from Slovenia (Prekmurje region). This study confirms that multiple hantaviruses can co-circulate in the same locality and can be maintained side-by-side in different rodent species.","['Plyusnina A', 'Ferenczi E', 'Rácz GR', 'Nemirov K', 'Lundkvist A', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O', 'Plyusnin A']",2009,81,12,J Med Virol,"Plyusnina A, et al.

Sixteen midlactation multiparous goats received diets differing in forage-to-concentrate ratio [high forage (HF) 64:36, and low forage (LF) 43:57] supplemented or not with lipids [HF with 130 g/d of oil from whole intact rapeseeds (RS) and LF with 130 g/d of sunflower oil (SO)] in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Milk yield, milk composition, FA profile, and FA secretion were measured, as well as the expression profiles of key genes in mammary metabolism and of 8,382 genes, using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray. After 3 wk of treatment, milk, lactose, and protein yields were lower with HF-RS than with the other diets, whereas treatment had no effect on milk protein content. Milk fat content was higher with the HF-RS and LF-SO diets than with the HF and LF diets, and SO supplementation increased milk fat yield compared with the LF diet. Decreasing the forage-to-concentrate ratio from 64:36 to 43:57 had a limited effect on goat milk FA concentrations and secretions. Supplementing the LF diet with SO changed almost all the FA concentrations, including decreases in medium-chain saturated FA and large increases in trans C18:1 and C18:2 isomers (particularly trans-11 C18:1 and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid), without significant changes in C18:0 and cis-9 C18:1, whereas supplementing the HF diet with RS led to a strong decrease in short- and medium-chain saturated FA and a very strong increase in C18:0 and cis-9 C18:1, without significant changes in trans C18:1 and conjugated linoleic acid. Despite the decreases in milk lactose and protein yields observed with HF-RS, and despite the decrease in milk medium-chain FA and the increase in C18 FA secretion with RS or SO supplementation, none of the dietary treatments had any effect on mammary mRNA expression of the key genes involved in lactose (e.g., alpha-lactalbumin), protein (e.g., beta-casein), and lipid metabolism (e.g., lipoprotein lipase) after 3 wk of treatment. In addition, transcriptome analysis did not provide evidence of treatments inducing significant changes in the expression of specific genes in the mammary gland. However, 2-way hierarchical clustering analysis highlighted different global mammary expression profiles between diets, showing that the gene expression profiles corresponding to the same diet were gathered by common groups of genes. This experiment suggests that after 3 wk of dietary treatment, other factors, such as substrate availability for mammary metabolism, could play an important role in contributing to milk FA responses to changes in diet composition in the goat.","['Ollier S', 'Leroux C', 'de la Foye A', 'Bernard L', 'Rouel J', 'Chilliard Y']",2009,92,11,J Dairy Sci,"Ollier S, et al.

19828747,Molecular diagnostics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome during a Dobrava virus infection outbreak in the European part of Russia.,"A large outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) occurred in the winter of 2006-2007 in a region southeast of Moscow in Central European Russia. Of the 422 patients with HFRS investigated in this study, 58 patients were found to be infected by Puumala virus, whereas as many as 364 were infected by Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV). Early serum samples from 10 DOBV-infected patients were used for nucleic acid amplification, which was successful for 5 patients. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the causative hantavirus belongs to the DOBV-Aa genetic lineage, which is carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) as the natural reservoir host. Neutralization assays with convalescent-phase sera from these patients confirmed infection by DOBV-Aa; related viruses, such as the Dobrava-Slovenia virus (DOBV-Af) and the Dobrava-Sochi virus (DOBV-Ap), were neutralized at lower efficiencies. The clinical courses of the 205 patients enrolled in the study were found to be mostly mild to moderate; however, an unexpectedly high fraction (27%) of patients exhibited severe illness. One patient died from kidney failure and showed symptoms of generalized subcutaneous hemorrhage. The results provide molecular, serodiagnostic, and clinical evidence that DOBV-Aa is a common pathogen in East Europe that causes large outbreaks of HFRS.","['Dzagurova TK', 'Klempa B', 'Tkachenko EA', 'Slyusareva GP', 'Morozov VG', 'Auste B', 'Kruger DH']",2009,47,12,J Clin Microbiol,"Dzagurova TK, et al.

An epidemiological study during the peak of an epidemic season in Finland was conducted based on 282 acute clinical PUUV infections and 204 controls without PUUV infection or immunity. The main risk factors adjusted by age, sex and living environment were cigarette smoking [odds ratio (OR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-5.9, P<0.0001] and buildings with holes allowing rodents to enter (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.0-5.6); these results were similar in two subsets. Further, use of rodent traps (OR3.5, 95% CI 2.2-5.7) and handling firewood (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.4) were associated with a risk. The risk attributed to smoking also remained high using simulated population controls with average smoking habits.

19767836,Identification of oligopeptides mimicking the receptor-binding domain of Hantaan virus envelope glycoprotein from a phage-displayed peptide library.,"Attachment of enveloped viruses to cells is triggered by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on envelope glycoproteins (GP) binding to receptors located on the cell surface. To date, recognized receptors and RBD of hantaan virus (HTNV) have not been exactly defined. In this study, one monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3G1 possessing high neutralizing activity, which is directed against HTNV envelope glycoprotein G2, was used to determine the crucial motif of RBD. Peptide ligands binding to MAb 3G1 were selected from a 12 amino acid peptide library displayed on filamentous phages. After 3 rounds of selection, the binding capacity between phages and MAb 3G1 was examined byELISA. Afterwards the positive phage clones with high binding activity to MAb 3G1 were chosen and sequenced. The peptide sequences of positive phage clones were compared with that of HTNV 76-118 strain G2. A motif Y/F/WPW(X)HX1-2HY, aligned to the primary sequences of G2 96YPWHTAKCHY105, was identified from the peptide inserts in the 9 positive clones. Positive phages and synthesized peptide containing the motif were bound significantly to virus-susceptible cell (Vero-E6) membranes by ELISA and immunofluorescence assay, respectively. Therefore, the sequence on G2 between amino acid 96 and 105 may be a key motif of HTNV RBD recognized by viral receptors on target cell membranes. Further characterization of the motif would provide useful information in understanding of the cellular entry of HTNV.","['Lü X', 'Yin W', 'Yang Q', 'Lei Y', 'Yang J', 'Sun M', 'Yao M', 'Xu Z', 'Xue X']",2009,55,6,Can J Microbiol,"Lü X, et al.

We recently reported that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of HFRS-causing Hantaan virus (HTNV) inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Here we measured the ability of other hantaviral N proteins to similarly interfere with the inflammatory process of TNF-alpha. We found that like HTNV N, the N proteins of HFRS-causing Seoul and Dobrava viruses inhibited TNF-alpha activation of NF-kappaB and translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, but did not interfere with degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB). In contrast, the HFRS-causing Puumala virus and the HPS-causing Andes and Sin Nombre viruses did not prevent TNF-alpha activation of NF-kappaB or nuclear translocation of p65.

The real-time RT-PCR reactive condition was optimized and the sensitivity, specificity and the stability of the assay were evaluated. Mosquitoes collected from Zhejiang province were detected by this assay.
RESULTS: Mg2+, primer and probe were optimized at 5 mmol/L, 0.2 micromol/L and 0.1 micromol/L respectively. The specificity of the assay was high and there were no cross reactions with dengue virus, rabies virus, seoul virus or hantan virus. The detection limits of the assay was 0.1 TCID50. Results from preliminary application showed that TaqMan RT-PCR for Japanese encephalitis virus was sensitive, easier and faster to perform the process of traditional virus isolation and identification. It took only three hours to extract viral RNA and perform the real-time RT-PCR.
CONCLUSION: This TaqMan-based one-step RT-PCR assay was a quick, sensitive and specific tool for molecular diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis virus.","['Xie RH', 'Xu F', 'Zhu HP', 'Cheng YK', 'Fu GM', 'Yao PP', 'Weng JQ', 'Lu YY', 'Yang ZN', 'Zhu ZY']",2009,30,3,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Xie RH, et al.

19642377,"[Survey on host animal and molecular epidemiology of hantavirus in Chuxiong prefecture, Yunnan province].","OBJECTIVE: To determine the hosts of hantavirus (HV) and its molecular epidemiological characteristics, to provide evidence for prevention and control on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: Rodents were captured by a special trap within the residential area. The antigens of HV in lung tissues were detected by direct immuno-fluorescence assay (DFA). Nucleotide sequences of HV were amplified by RT-PCR with HV genotype-specific primer. The amplified genes were then sequenced. Phylogenetic tree were built on nucleotide sequence with ClustalX 1.83 software.
RESULTS: 1421 rodents were captured and classified into 8 species of 4 Genera in the epidemic area within 10 counties of Chuxiong prefecture, Yunnan province, between 2005 and 2006. Out of the 1421 rodents, 1056 (74.31% ) of them were Rattus norvegicus and 280 (19.70%) belonged to Rattus flavipectus. The antigens of HV were detected by DFA in lung tissues and the total positive rate of HV was 5.15% (53/ 1029). After applying the sequencing nucleotide method to the 53 positive specimens, data showed that 21 specimens were positive and all of them belonged to Seoul type (15 samples were from Rattus norvegicus, 4 samples Rattus flavipectus, 2 samples Rattus nitidus). The partial S segments from 12 specimens were sequenced which appeared homologic with R22, L99 and HLD65 from GenBank in relatively high level (87.1% -99.7%). When compared to 76-118 strain of Hantaan type, their homologic degree was only 64.4%-69.1%. Results from Phylogenetic analysis showed that 12 specimens belonged to Seoul type. As for their homology, they were significantly similar to Seoul type and could be tentatively divided into two subtypes S1 and S3.
CONCLUSION: It was confirmed that the Seoul type virus, as HFRS's pathogenetic agent mainly carried by rats, prevailed widely in Chuxiong prefecture. Owing to the local ecological environment, we also noticed the characteristics of different HV subtypes among Seoul type.","['Zhou JH', 'Zhang HL', 'Wang JL', 'Yang WH', 'Mi ZQ', 'Zhang YZ', 'Zhang YZ', 'Song XY', 'Hu QL', 'Dong YK', 'Pu WH', 'Hu HM', 'Gao LF', 'Yuan QH', 'Ya HX', 'Feng Y']",2009,30,3,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Zhou JH, et al.

19602267,"Temporal and geographic evidence for evolution of Sin Nombre virus using molecular analyses of viral RNA from Colorado, New Mexico and Montana.","BACKGROUND: All viruses in the family Bunyaviridae possess a tripartite genome, consisting of a small, a medium, and a large RNA segment. Bunyaviruses therefore possess considerable evolutionary potential, attributable to both intramolecular changes and to genome segment reassortment. Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are known to cause human hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The primary reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is widely distributed in North America. We investigated the prevalence of intramolecular changes and of genomic reassortment among Sin Nombre viruses detected in deer mice in three western states.
METHODS: Portions of the Sin Nombre virus small (S) and medium (M) RNA segments were amplified by RT-PCR from kidney, lung, liver and spleen of seropositive peromyscine rodents, principally deer mice, collected in Colorado, New Mexico and Montana from 1995 to 2007. Both a 142 nucleotide (nt) amplicon of the M segment, encoding a portion of the G2 transmembrane glycoprotein, and a 751 nt amplicon of the S segment, encoding part of the nucleocapsid protein, were cloned and sequenced from 19 deer mice and from one brush mouse (P. boylii), S RNA but not M RNA from one deer mouse, and M RNA but not S RNA from another deer mouse.
RESULTS: Two of 20 viruses were found to be reassortants. Within virus sequences from different rodents, the average rate of synonymous substitutions among all pair-wise comparisons (pis) was 0.378 in the M segment and 0.312 in the S segment sequences. The replacement substitution rate (pia) was 7.0 x 10-4 in the M segment and 17.3 x 10-4 in the S segment sequences. The low pia relative to pis suggests strong purifying selection and this was confirmed by a Fu and Li analysis. The absolute rate of molecular evolution of the M segment was 6.76 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year. The absolute age of the M segment tree was estimated to be 37 years. In the S segment the rate of molecular evolution was 1.93 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year and the absolute age of the tree was 106 years. Assuming that mice were infected with a single Sin Nombre virus genotype, phylogenetic analyses revealed that 10% (2/20) of viruses were reassortants, similar to the 14% (6/43) found in a previous report.
CONCLUSION: Age estimates from both segments suggest that Sin Nombre virus has evolved within the past 37-106 years. The rates of evolutionary changes reported here suggest that Sin Nombre virus M and S segment reassortment occurs frequently in nature.","['Black WC', 'Doty JB', 'Hughes MT', 'Beaty BJ', 'Calisher CH']",2009,6,,Virol J,"Black WC, et al.

19594396,Analysis of the immune response to Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein C-terminal-specific CD8(+) T cells in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hantaan virus (HTNV), the prototype member of the Hantavirus genus in the family Bunyaviridae, causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized by capillary leakage, hemorrhage, and renal injury, and is an important public health problem in China. Some kinds of immune cells, particularly CD8(+) T cells, are involved in the pathogenesis of Hantavirus infection. The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of the Hantavirus is the most conserved structural protein and the most abundant viral protein produced during infection. It is one of the important target antigens that induce the CD8(+) T-cell response. In this study, we examined the CD8(+) T-cell response to HTNV NP C-terminal polypeptides. We synthesized 23 overlapping C-terminal polypeptides and detected the antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell response in 15 patients with HFRS. The results demonstrated that there were NP-specific T-cell responses in bulk cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 9 of 15 patients. The peptide 51 (aa 301-315: SPSSIWVFAGAPDRC), peptide 60 (aa 355-369: LRKKSSFYQSYLRRT), and peptide 70 (aa 415-429: DVKVKEISNQEPLKL) induced strong CD8(+) T-cell responses. Among them, peptide 70 induced CTL responses in donors 7, 9, and 11, and the strongest responses were seen in donor 11. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells from PBMCs completely abrogated the peptide-specific T-cell response, while depletion of CD4(+) T cells did not diminish the number of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells. These data suggest that infection with HTNV results in CTL responses to immunodominant regions on the NP.","['Wang PZ', 'Huang CX', 'Zhang Y', 'Li ZD', 'Yo HT', 'Zhang Y', 'Jia ZS', 'Wang JP', 'Lian JQ', 'Sun YT', 'Bai XF']",2009,22,4,Viral Immunol,"Wang PZ, et al.

In this paper, we evaluate the immune response induced by a replication-competent recombinant canine adenovirus type 2 expressing the Gn protein of SEOV (rCAV-2-Gn) in BALB/c mice. Sera from immunized mice contained neutralizing antibodies that could specifically recognize SEOV and neutralize its infectivity in vitro. Moreover, the recombinant virus induced complete protection against a lethal challenge with the highly virulent SEOV strain CC-2. Protective level neutralizing antibodies were maintained for at least 20 weeks. The efficacy of the recombinant was similar to that induced by a currently available inactivated HFRS vaccine. This recombinant virus is therefore a potential alternative to the inactivated vaccine.","['Yuan ZG', 'Li XM', 'Mahmmod YS', 'Wang XH', 'Xu HJ', 'Zhang XX']",2009,27,38,Vaccine,"Yuan ZG, et al.

19583875,"Investigating the effects of climatic variables and reservoir on the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Huludao City, China: a 17-year data analysis based on structure equation model.","BACKGROUND: HFRS is a serious public health problem in China and the study on HFRS is important in China for its large population. The present study aimed to explore the impact of climatic variables and reservoir on the incidence of HFRS in Huludao City, an epidemic focus of the disease in northeastern China.
METHODS: Structure Equation Model (SEM), a statistical technique for testing and estimating causal relationships, was conducted based on climatic variables, virus-carrying index among rodents, and incidence of HFRS in the city during the period 1990 to 2006. The linear structural relationships (LISREL) software (Scientific Software International, Lincolnwood, IL) was used to fit SEMs.
RESULTS: Temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and virus-carrying index among rodents have shown positive correlations with the monthly incidence of HFRS, while air pressure had a negative correlation with the incidence. The best-fit SEM model fitted well with the data-based correlation matrix, P value was more than 0.56, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) equaled to 0, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was more than 0.99.
CONCLUSION: Climate and reservoirs have affected the incidence of HFRS in Huludao City, located in northeastern China. Climate affects HFRS incidence mainly through the effect on reservoir in the study area. HFRS prevention and control should give more consideration to rodent control and climate variations.","['Guan P', 'Huang D', 'He M', 'Shen T', 'Guo J', 'Zhou B']",2009,9,,BMC Infect Dis,"Guan P, et al.

19575005,Efficacy of arbidol on lethal hantaan virus infections in suckling mice and in vitro.,"AIM: Arbidol is an immunomodulator that was first developed in Russia. In this study, we report the antiviral activity of arbidol against Hantaan virus (HTNV) in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The antiviral activity of arbidol in vitro was determined by plaque-forming assay, ranging from 0.5 to 8 microg/mL. To investigate whether arbidol has an antiviral effect in vivo, suckling BALB/c mice infected with HTNV were treated with arbidol at 24 h before infection with a 5, 10 or 20 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), once per day, for 10 days. On day 12 and 28 post infection (pi), histopathological changes and viral antigen were detected. On days 4, 8, 12, and 16 pi, the viral load of target organs and serum TNF-alpha levels of arbidol-treated animals were determined.
RESULTS: Arbidol was found to have potent inhibitory activity against HTNV when added in vitro before or after viral infection, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.9 and 1.2 microg/mL, respectively. The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of arbidol for suckling mice was 78.42 mg.kg(-1).d(-1). Oral administration of arbidol increased both survival rate and mean time to death (MTD). Treatment with arbidol reduced histopathological changes, decreased viral load and viral antigen levels, and modulated the level of serum TNF-alpha.

METHODS: Data on the host animals was collected from Lishui, Zhejiang province in 2007. Direct immunofluorscece assay was adopted to determine HFRS antigens and the lung tissues from HV infected Vero-E6 cells for HV isolation, then total RNA was extracted from Hantavirus Lishui strains and amplified by RT-PCR M, S segments of strains genome were also cloned and sequenced and compared with those of other strains of HV.
RESULTS: 2 strains virus (ZLS6-11 and ZLS-12) were successfully isolated from 7 positive lung samples of mice and were identified as HTNV by anti-McAb and phylogenetic analysis. With sequence compation,we found that 2 strains with complete M and S segment had higher homology with HTN-type strains than with other types of HV, but 13.4%-20.7% and 10.3%-16.1% of the genes were found which were different from HTNV. The phylogenetic trees constructed by complete S and M segment showed that ZLS6-11 and ZLS-12 strains were located in HTNV group,and structured independent embranchment.

19514603,[Application of ribavirin in patients having hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute infective disease of a zoonose type characterized by an abrupt beginning, prominent hemorrhagic syndrome as well as symptoms and signs of acute renal insufficiency. The clinical picture of this disease, which is leading in terms of its natural principal seat in the region of Northern-east Montenegro, ranges from non-apparent to very severe forms and mortality it causes is about 10%. Up to date, no efficient etio-trophic means has been discovered. Several studies suggest that an early use of anti virus medicament Ribavirine leads to decrease of mortality rate. The main aim of this study is to present our results achieved in an attempt to apply this medicament in treating HFRS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, we have treated 58 patients with symptoms and signs of HGSBS. Five of them, who were admitted to the Department in the first three days were treated by Ribavirine orally in doses of 2 x 400 mg. Compared to patients who were not treated by Ribavirine, a faster decrease of thrombocytes was noticed in them, which required the discontinuation of the medicament treatment. Thereafter, thrombocytes started to increase and their normalization followed faster than in patients who were not treated by this medicament. The above patients developed a moderately severe clinical picture of the disease, and middle maximum values of urea and creatinine were lower in patients who were not treated by the medicament. No patient developed a severe form of the disease and there were neither dialyzed nor died ones. The mortality rate in patients who were not treated by the medicament was 3.44% and the percent of the dialyzed was 5.17%.
RESULTS: Application of Ribavirine at the very beginning of HFRS is considered to be with a very good reason in combination with obligatory follow up of clinical and laboratory parameters and particularly of thrombocyte values, the decrease of which can lead to spontaneous bleedings. Because of the small number of patients to whom we gave this medicament it is difficult to come to a conclusion on the extent of its affect on the clinical picture in our patients.","['Zivković M', 'Todorović Z', 'Canović P', 'Mijanović Z']",2009,62,1-2,Med Pregl,"Zivković M, et al.

19486318,Genetic diversity and geographic distribution of hantaviruses in Russia.,"Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the most prevalent zoonotic disease in Russia. It is caused by several hantavirus species hosted by small rodents. We describe spatial and temporal patterns of HFRS incidence in the Russian Federation, and the geographic distribution of prevalent hantavirus species: Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava (DOBV). Partial sequencing of nucleocapsid and glycoprotein genes of 117 PUUV strains and 78 DOBV strains revealed several distinct genetic subgroups. The RNA of Volga PUUV subgroup was detected in patients with HFRS and bank voles Myodes glareolus in the Volga Federal District, where the highest HFRS incidence rate has been registered yearly. The RNA of Siberian PUUV subgroup was found in M. glareolus in the trans-Ural Tyumen and Omsk Provinces, where human HFRS cases have been rare. During an HFRS outbreak in 2007 in the Central Federal District, when more than 1000 patients were affected, specific subgroups of DOBV were discovered in patients and rodents, mainly in the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius. DOBV strains might have 8–9% of nucleotide difference although they were collected at places separated by 30–100 km. The RNA of a unique DOBV subgroup was discovered in the southern semi-desert Astrakhan Province, mainly in A. agrarius and tamarisk jird Meriones tamariscinus. No human HFRS cases were diagnosed in this province. Russian PUUV and DOBV strains have no close homologues among European strains. Our DOBV strains might be genetically grouped together with Central European DOBV strains isolated from A. agrarius, but not from Apodemus flavicollis. The Volga PUUV subgroup is to some extent similar to Baltic PUUV strain, and Finnish PUUV strains resemble the strains from the Siberian PUUV subgroup. Thus, PCRbased monitoring and typing provided the opportunity to delineate and expand the area of hantaviruses in Russia and to identify their new genetic variants.","['Garanina SB', 'Platonov AE', 'Zhuravlev VI', 'Murashkina AN', 'Yakimenko VV', 'Korneev AG', 'Shipulin GA']",2009,56,6-7,Zoonoses Public Health,"Garanina SB, et al.

21352757,Cyclic hantavirus epidemics in humans--predicted by rodent host dynamics.,"Wildlife-originated zoonotic diseases are a major contributor to emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses cause thousands of human disease cases annually worldwide, and understanding and predicting human hantavirus epidemics still poses unsolved challenges. Here we studied the three-level relationships between the human disease nephropathia epidemica (NE), its etiological agent Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) and the rodent host of the virus, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). A large and long-term data set (14 years, 2583 human NE cases and 4751 trapped bank voles) indicates that the number of human infections shows both seasonal and multi-annual fluctuations, is influenced by the phase of vole cycle and time of the year, and follows vole abundance with a lag of a few months. Our results suggest that although human hantavirus epidemics are preceded by high sero prevalence in the host population, they may be accurately predicted solely by the population dynamics of the carrier species, even without any knowledge about hantavirus dynamics in the host populations.","['Kallio ER', 'Begon M', 'Henttonen H', 'Koskela E', 'Mappes T', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O']",2009,1,2,Epidemics,"Kallio ER, et al.

19434035,Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: a concise clinical review.,"In 1978, hantaviruses were first described as the etiological agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Korea. Since then, numerous related, enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses have been identified, forming the genus Hantavirus within the family Bunyaviridae. These pathogens are distributed worldwide and thus can be classified, on the basis of phylogenetic origins, into Old World viruses or New World viruses (ie North, Central, and South America). Similarly, these viruses cause two major types of syndromes, corresponding respectively to their phylogenies: the original HFRS or the more recently described hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). As the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is the primary hantaviral disease in North America, it will thus be the focus of this review.","['Vinh DC', 'Embil JM']",2009,102,6,South Med J,Vinh DC and Embil JM.

19408099,Low levels of serum vitronectin associated with clinical phases in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"beta(3) integrin has been identified as a cellular receptor for Hantaan virus which causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). As one of the ligands of beta(3) integrin, vitronectin (VN) may be altered in HFRS. In this study, changes of serum VN levels were determined in 112 patients with HFRS and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. The levels of serum VN were analyzed in patients at various phases of HFRS and with different severity of clinical types. Serum VN levels in patients with HFRS, at all clinical phases except the convalescent phase, were significantly decreased compared with those in the controls (P < 0.01). The serum levels of VN decreased at febrile phase, maintained at the lowest status during hypotensive and oliguric phases, started to increase from polyuric phase and reached almost normal condition till convalescent phase. The levels of serum VN between patients with milder and more severe clinical types showed no significant difference at each phase (P > 0.05). These results suggest that VN level was altered during the course of HFRS and chronological changes of serum levels of VN may correlate with the evolution of the disease.","['Liu Z', 'Han Q', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao Q', 'Chen J', 'Lou S']",2009,9,4,Clin Exp Med,"Liu Z, et al.

A neutralization test based on quantitative RT-PCR, the replication reduction neutralization test (RRNT), was developed for efficient detection of hantavirus-neutralizing antibodies. The effectiveness of the RRNT was evaluated by examining several hantaviruses and hantavirus-specific convalescent human serum samples. All convalescent serum samples tested by RRNT caused significant decreases in hantavirus genomes with only one specific hantavirus species, which allowed a straightforward identification of the related hantavirus. The results obtained by RRNT were completely comparable with the results obtained by focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). The RRNT approach is a reliable and rapid alternative for FRNT, hitherto considered as the gold standard for hantavirus serology.","['Maes P', 'Keyaerts E', 'Li S', 'Nlandu-Masunda V', 'Clement J', 'Van Ranst M']",2009,159,2,J Virol Methods,"Maes P, et al.

19403663,Adenovirus vectors expressing hantavirus proteins protect hamsters against lethal challenge with andes virus.,"Hantaviruses infect humans following aerosolization from rodent feces and urine, producing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Due to the high rates of mortality and lack of therapies, vaccines are urgently needed. Nonreplicating adenovirus (Ad) vectors that express Andes hantavirus (ANDV) nucleocapsid protein (AdN) or glycoproteins (AdG(N) and AdG(C)) were constructed. Ad vectors were tested for their ability to protect Syrian hamsters from a lethal ANDV infection that mimics the pulmonary disease seen in humans. When administered once, all three Ad vectors, individually or in combination, elicited a robust immune response that protected hamsters. No vaccinated animal died, and there were no obvious clinical signs of disease. Further, hantavirus RNA was not detected by sensitive reverse transcription-PCR in tissues and blood of hamsters immunized with both AdG(N) and AdG(C). Cellular immunity appeared to be important for protection because the AdN vector completely protected animals. All three Ad vectors produced strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses directed to hantavirus proteins in mice. Moreover, hamsters vaccinated with AdN, AdG(N), or AdG(C) produced no detectable neutralizing antibodies yet were protected. These Ad vectors represent the first vaccines that prevent lethal hantavirus disease and, in some instances (AdG(N) and AdG(C)), provide sterile immunity. These observations set the stage for a more detailed characterization of the types of immunity required to protect humans from hantavirus infections.","['Safronetz D', 'Hegde NR', 'Ebihara H', 'Denton M', 'Kobinger GP', 'St Jeor S', 'Feldmann H', 'Johnson DC']",2009,83,14,J Virol,"Safronetz D, et al.

19393771,"A proposal for new criteria for the classification of hantaviruses, based on S and M segment protein sequences.","Hantaviruses, members of the family Bunyaviridae, are the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Hantaviruses are currently demarcated into species based on the guidelines provided by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). These guidelines however, are often ignored by the descriptors of novel hantaviruses. With this study we attempted to refine the second ICTV guideline for hantavirus species demarcation by phylogenetically analyzing all in Genbank available complete sequences derived from the S, M or L segments of hantaviruses. S and M segment amino acid sequence comparison allowed clear and unequivocal distinction between different hantavirus species, and lead us to propose additional criteria for the demarcation of hantavirus species (S segment amino acid distance >10% or M segment amino acid distance >12%) and hantavirus groups (S segment amino distance >24% or M segment amino acid distance >32%). With this study, we propose to adjust the second rule of the ICTV classification guidelines (""a 7% difference in amino acid identity when comparing the complete S segment and M segment sequences"") to a more appropriate rule, ""a 10% difference in S segment similarity and a 12% difference in M segment similarity based on complete amino acid sequences"" in accordance with the current situation in the hantavirus field.","['Maes P', 'Klempa B', 'Clement J', 'Matthijnssens J', 'Gajdusek DC', 'Krüger DH', 'Van Ranst M']",2009,9,5,Infect Genet Evol,"Maes P, et al.

Here, we evaluated the long-term outcome after NE in a prospectively recruited patient group.
METHODS: Proteinuria, GFR and ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure were assessed 4-7 years (mean 6) after acute NE in 37 patients, and these values were compared to those from 38 seronegative controls.
RESULTS: Six years after NE, the prevalence of elevated urinary alpha(1)-microglobulin excretion was higher in the patients than controls (9/35 vs. 1/38; p = 0.005). The patients also had higher urinary protein excretion (0.17 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.04 g/day; p = 0.006), GFR (119 +/- 19 vs. 109 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.016) and mean systolic (123 +/- 11 vs. 117 +/- 9 mm Hg; p = 0.012), nighttime systolic (109 +/- 11 vs. 100 +/- 9 mm Hg; p = 0.001) and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (70 +/- 7 vs. 66 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.035) than the controls.

19386780,Analysis of Puumala hantavirus in a bank vole population in northern Finland: evidence for co-circulation of two genetic lineages and frequent reassortment between strains.,"In this study, for the first time, two distinct genetic lineages of Puumala virus (PUUV) were found within a small sampling area and within a single host genetic lineage (Ural mtDNA) at Pallasjärvi, northern Finland. Lung tissue samples of 171 bank voles (Myodes glareolus) trapped in September 1998 were screened for the presence of PUUV nucleocapsid antigen and 25 were found to be positive. Partial sequences of the PUUV small (S), medium (M) and large (L) genome segments were recovered from these samples using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two genetic groups of PUUV sequences that belonged to the Finnish and north Scandinavian lineages. This presented a unique opportunity to study inter-lineage reassortment in PUUV; indeed, 32 % of the studied bank voles appeared to carry reassortant virus genomes. Thus, the frequency of inter-lineage reassortment in PUUV was comparable to that of intra-lineage reassortment observed previously (Razzauti, M., Plyusnina, A., Henttonen, H. & Plyusnin, A. (2008). J Gen Virol 89, 1649-1660). Of six possible reassortant S/M/L combinations, only two were found at Pallasjärvi and, notably, in all reassortants, both S and L segments originated from the same genetic lineage, suggesting a non-random pattern for the reassortment. These findings are discussed in connection to PUUV evolution in Fennoscandia.","['Razzauti M', 'Plyusnina A', 'Sironen T', 'Henttonen H', 'Plyusnin A']",2009,90,Pt 8,J Gen Virol,"Razzauti M, et al.

19331696,Timeliness of national notifiable diseases surveillance system in Korea: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: With the increase of international travels, infectious disease control is gaining a greater importance across regional borders. Adequate surveillance system function is crucial to prevent a global spread of infectious disease at the earliest stage. There have been limited reports on the characteristics of infectious disease surveillance in Asia. The authors studied the timeliness of the Korean National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System with regard to major notifiable diseases from 2001 to 2006.
METHODS: Six notifiable infectious diseases reported relatively frequently were included in this study. Five diseases were selected by the criteria of reported cases > 100 per year: typhoid fever, shigellosis, mumps, scrub typhus, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In addition, dengue fever was also included to represent an emerging disease, despite its low number of cases. The diseases were compared for the proportion notified within the recommended time limits, median time lags, and for the cumulative distribution of time lags at each surveillance step between symptom onset and date of notification to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
RESULTS: The proportion of cases reported in time was lower for disease groups with a recommended time limit of 1 day compared with 7 days (60%-70% vs. > 80%). The median time from disease onset to notification to KCDC ranged between 6 and 20 days. The median time from onset to registration at the local level ranged between 2 and 15 days. Distribution of time lags showed that main delays arose in the time from onset to diagnosis. There were variations in timeliness by disease categories and surveillance steps.
CONCLUSION: Time from disease onset to diagnosis generally contributed most to the delay in reporting. It is needed to promote public education and to improve clinical guidelines. Rapid reporting by doctors should be encouraged, and unification of recommended reporting time limit can be helpful. Our study also demonstrates the utility of the overall assessment of time-lag distributions for disease-specific strategies to improve surveillance.","['Yoo HS', 'Park O', 'Park HK', 'Lee EG', 'Jeong EK', 'Lee JK', 'Cho SI']",2009,9,,BMC Public Health,"Yoo HS, et al.

Case-patients were interviewed about clinical outcome and both case-patients and randomly recruited controls were interviewed about exposure. We calculated matched odds ratios (mOR) using a conditional logistic regression model. Multivariable analysis of 191 matched case-control pairs showed that case-patients were more likely than controls to have seen small rodents/their droppings (mOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.0), cleaned utility rooms (mOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.4) and visited forest shelters (mOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-14.3).

This report describes two rare medico-legal autopsy cases died from epidemic hemorrhagic fever. The victims were two male individuals aged 34 years and 29 years. The medico-legal autopsies were requested for alleged medical negligence. In both cases, autopsy reveals lesions to kidneys and lungs with multiple organ hemorrhage and edema, indicative of the generalized capillary damage. On admission to hospital, both patients had the symptom of fever, lumbago, renal failure and recent outdoor activities. The laboratory diagnosis results indicating multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are also important for certificating of EHF. Though the ELISA-based detection of virus-specific IgM antibody which has the highest titers between 8 and 25d after onset of disease is positive in the 34-year-old case and negative in 29-year-old case, the pathological findings and clinical laboratory analysis suggested the both victims died of EHF.

19254169,Hantavirus infections in Europe: from virus carriers to a major public-health problem.,"In Europe, hantavirus disease or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is an endemic zoonosis that affects tens of thousands of individuals each year. The causative agents are viruses of the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae, rodents and insectivores act as carriers. In all European countries there is a seroprevalence for hantaviruses in the general population but not all countries report cases. Here, we give an overview of the hantavirus situation in Europe.","['Heyman P', 'Vaheri A', 'Lundkvist A', 'Avsic-Zupanc T']",2009,7,2,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,"Heyman P, et al.

19237179,Acute febrile illness caused by hantavirus: serological and molecular evidence from India.,"Study of hantavirus infections in India is in its early stages. As early symptoms of hantavirus disease can be non-specific and the diagnosis confirmed only by laboratory testing, use of appropriate diagnostic tools is important. To improve the diagnosis of hantavirus infections in India, commercial ELISA systems followed by indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect anti-hantavirus IgM and IgG in samples from patients with acute febrile illness. Of 347 patients tested, 5.2% showed serological evidence of hantavirus infection. Sequences obtained from patients showing molecular evidence of hantavirus infection were related to Hantaan virus. In the absence of mu-capture ELISA, we recommend the use of combination testing systems in areas non-endemic for hantavirus infections. In India there is an increased risk of rodent-borne infections and the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated febrile illness should include hantavirus infection.","['Chandy S', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Boorugu HK', 'Chrispal A', 'Thomas K', 'Peedicayil A', 'Abraham P', 'Arikawa J', 'Sridharan G']",2009,103,4,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Chandy S, et al.

Loin pain (P < 0.001), abdominal pains (P = 0.007), rise of blood pressure (P < 0.001) and pharyngitis (P = 0.01) were more frequently found in NE patients. Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (P = 0,006), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (P < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.0001) were higher in leptospirosis, whereas creatinine (P = 0.009) was higher in NE. Leptospirosis mainly concerns occupational hazards, e.g. farmers, and leisure activities like swimming, and NE concerns professional foresters or leisure activities in the forest and the cleaning of attics. During hospitalisation, patients receiving antibiotics were more frequent among leptospirosis than among NE patients (80% versus 59%, P = 0.06). Among the various common clinical signs, only acute myopia appeared to be a pathognomonic but inconsistently observed clinical sign, which was only observed in 47% of NE cases.","['Strady C', 'Penalba C', 'Baumard S', 'Brodard V', 'Wynckel A', 'Auvray C', 'Jaussaud R', 'Andreoletti L']",2009,28,7,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Strady C, et al.

19210520,Reduced circulating CD4+CD25+ cell populations in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Immunopathological mechanisms are speculated to underlie haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaviruses. CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (T(regs)), a subset of CD4+ T cells, expressed high levels of CD25 and the forkhead box transcription factor P3 (FoxP3), plays an important role in the down-regulation of various immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that in patients with HFRS the immunopathology could be, at least in part, the result of an inefficient control of pathogenic effector T cells by T(regs). The number of T(regs) was determined by flow cytometry according to their characteristic CD4+CD25(high) membrane phenotype. The functional characterization of T(regs) was analysed by suppression of proliferation and secretion of cytokines by co-cultured effector CD4+CD25(-) T cells. FoxP3 mRNA level was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that CD4+CD25(high) cells of patients with HFRS showed a conventional phenotype. Furthermore, acute-stage patients with HFRS exhibited significantly reduced numbers of peripheral T(regs) compared with healthy donors, and marked improvement was observed in convalescent-phase patients. The frequency of T(regs) was correlated positively with platelet count, and was correlated negatively with blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and serum aspartate aminotransferase. On the other hand, T(regs) from both healthy individuals and patients with HFRS exhibited equal FoxP3 expression of mRNA, and their ability to suppress the proliferation and cytokine secretion of CD4+ effector T cells was unimpaired in HFRS patients.","['Zhu LY', 'Chi LJ', 'Wang X', 'Zhou H']",2009,156,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Zhu LY, et al.

19208975,Hantaviruses: an emerging public health threat in India? A review.,"The emerging viral diseases haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) are a cause of global concern as they are increasingly reported from newer regions of the world. The hantavirus species causing HFRS include Hantaan virus,Seoul virus, Puumala virus, and Dobrava-Belgrade virus while Sin Nombre virus was responsible for the 1993 outbreak of HCPS in the Four Corners Region of the US. Humans are accidental hosts and get infected by aerosols generated from contaminated urine,feces and saliva of infected rodents. Rodents are the natural hosts of these viruses and develop persistent infection. Human to human infections are rare and the evolution of the virus depends largely on that of the rodent host. The first hantavirus isolate to be cultured, Thottapalayam virus,is the only indigenous isolate from India,isolated from an insectivore in 1964 in Vellore, South India. Research on hantaviruses in India has been slow but steady since 2005. Serological investigation of patients with pyrexic illness revealed presence of anti-hantavirus IgM antibodies in 14.7% of them. The seropositivity of hantavirus infections in the general population is about 4% and people who live and work in close proximity with rodents have a greater risk of acquiring hantavirus infections. Molecular and serological evidence of hantavirus infections in rodents and man has also been documented in this country. The present review on hantaviruses is to increase awareness of these emerging pathogens and the threats they pose to the public health system.","['Chandy S', 'Abraham S', 'Sridharan G']",2008,33,4,J Biosci,"Chandy S, et al.

19177744,Genetic and antigenic analyses of a Puumala virus isolate as a potential vaccine strain.,"Puumala virus (PUUV), a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), is prevalent in Europe and European Russia. No vaccine has been developed for PUUV-associated HFRS, primarily because of the low viral yield in cultured cells. A PUUV strain known as DTK/Ufa-97 was isolated in Russia and adapted for growth in Vero E6 cells maintained in serum-free medium. The DTK/Ufa-97 strain produced a higher viral titer in serum-free medium, suggesting that it may prove useful in the development of an HFRS vaccine. When PUUV-infected Vero E6 cells were grown in serum-free medium, the DTK/Ufa-97 strain yielded more copies of intracellular viral RNA and a higher viral titer in the culture fluid than did the Sotkamo strain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PUUVs can be classified into multiple lineages according to geographical origin, and that the DTK/Ufa-97 strain is a member of the Bashkiria-Saratov lineage. The deduced amino acid sequences of the small, medium, and large segments of the DTK/Ufa-97 strain were 99.2% to 100%, 99.3% to 99.8%, and 99.8% identical, respectively, to those of the Bashkirian PUUV strains and 96.9%, 92.6%, and 97.4% identical, respectively, to those of the Sotkamo strain, indicating that the PUUVs are genetically diverse. However, DTK/Ufa-97 and other strains of PUUV exhibited similar patterns of binding to a panel of monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan virus. In addition, diluted antisera (i.e., ranging from 1:160 to 1:640) specific to three strains of PUUV neutralized both homologous and heterologous viruses. These results suggest that the DTK/Ufa-97 strain is capable of extensive growth and is antigenically similar to genetically distant strains of PUUV.","['Abu Daude NH', 'Kariwa H', 'Tkachenko E', 'Dzagurnova T', 'Medvedkina O', 'Tkachenko P', 'Ishizuka M', 'Seto T', 'Miyashita D', 'Sanada T', 'Nakauchi M', 'Yoshii K', 'Maeda A', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Takashima I']",2008,56,3,Jpn J Vet Res,"Abu Daude NH, et al.

METHODS: National data on the prevalence of HFRS during 1998 to 2007 were collected and analyzed. Spatial, time and population distributions of HFRS cases were described.
RESULTS: HFRS appeared to remain endemic in the country, while the majority of cases (accounting for 81.76% of total cases), were located in Shandong, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jilin and Zhejiang provinces. The occurrence of HFRS appeared to be seasonal, with two peaks in spring season and autumn/winter season, with 10.00% of the cases occurred in these peak months. The incidence rates were at a relatively low level because of the continuous decline of HFRS in the recent years. With age distribution, 0.97% were younger than 10, 96.71% were between 10 and 70, 87.32% were between 15 and 60, and 2.31% were older than 70. The proportion of male patients accounted for three quarters. Around 70.00% of the cases were farmers. Young and middle-aged male farmers were at high risk.
CONCLUSION: The descriptive study on epidemiological characteristics of HFRS in the recent years had provided scientific evidence for vaccination strategy, suggesting the key regions, sub-populations as well as types of vaccines be determined.","['Luo CW', 'Chen HX']",2008,29,10,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Luo CW and Chen HX.

METHODS: Rodents were captured in Wenzhou, where hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) had been endemic. Hantavirus antigens in the rat lungs were detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Partial S segment (nt 620-999) and partial M segment (nt 2001-2301) sequences were amplified by RT-PCR, and then sequenced. Neighbor-joining method was used to construct for phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 96 rodents were trapped in the epidemic areas, and 6 hantavirus antigens were identified from these lung samples (6.3%). Partial S and partial M segment sequences were successfully recovered from 5 samples and determined. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that all viruses belonged to Seoul virus (SEOV), regardless of the sources (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi and Rattus rattoide) that they were derived. However, the clustering pattern in the partial S-tree was different from that in the partial M-tree, suggesting that the re-assortment between SEOVs had occurred.
CONCLUSION: All Rattus rats carried SEOV in Wenzhou and the genetic reassortment with SEOV had occurred naturally.","['Lin XD', 'Yang PF', 'Liao XW', 'Li MF', 'Gao N', 'Chen Y', 'Zeng SD', 'Wen HJ', 'Chen LP', 'Li MH', 'Zhang YZ']",2008,29,9,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Lin XD, et al.

19149870,Relating increasing hantavirus incidences to the changing climate: the mast connection.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica (NE), an emerging rodent-borne viral disease, has become the most important cause of infectious acute renal failure in Belgium, with sharp increases in incidence occurring for more than a decade. Bank voles are the rodent reservoir of the responsible hantavirus and are known to display cyclic population peaks. We tried to relate these peaks to the cyclic NE outbreaks observed since 1993. Our hypothesis was that the ecological causal connection was the staple food source for voles, being seeds of deciduous broad-leaf trees, commonly called ""mast"". We also examined whether past temperature and precipitation preceding ""mast years"" were statistically linked to these NE outbreaks.
RESULTS: Since 1993, each NE peak is immediately preceded by a mast year, resulting in significantly higher NE case numbers during these peaks (Spearman R = -0.82; P = 0.034). NE peaks are significantly related to warmer autumns the year before (R = 0.51; P < 0.001), hotter summers two years before (R = 0.32; P < 0.001), but also to colder (R = -0.25; P < 0.01) and more moist summers (R = 0.39; P < 0.001) three years before. Summer correlations were even more pronounced, when only July was singled out as the most representative summer month.
CONCLUSION: NE peaks in year 0 are induced by abundant mast formation in year-1, facilitating bank vole survival during winter, thus putting the local human population at risk from the spring onwards of year 0. This bank vole survival is further promoted by higher autumn temperatures in year-1, whereas mast formation itself is primed by higher summer temperatures in year-2. Both summer and autumn temperatures have been rising to significantly higher levels during recent years, explaining the virtually continuous epidemic state since 2005 of a zoonosis, considered rare until recently. Moreover, in 2007 a NE peak and an abundant mast formation occurred for the first time within the same year, thus forecasting yet another record NE incidence for 2008. We therefore predict that with the anticipated climate changes due to global warming, NE might become a highly endemic disease in Belgium and surrounding countries.","['Clement J', 'Vercauteren J', 'Verstraeten WW', 'Ducoffre G', 'Barrios JM', 'Vandamme AM', 'Maes P', 'Van Ranst M']",2009,8,,Int J Health Geogr,"Clement J, et al.

In 2004, a nephropathia epidemica outbreak was recorded in Lower Bavaria, South-East Germany. For a seroepidemiological study in this region including the resident population at four locations (n = 178) and soldiers from one location (n = 208) indirect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and immunoblot tests based on a yeast-expressed PUUV nucleocapsid protein were established. The validation using human serum panels originating from Germany revealed a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 98/100% for the IgM ELISA, 99/99% for the IgG ELISA, 99/100% for the IgM immunoblot test and 100/96% for the IgG immunoblot test. Using the novel IgG assays as well as a commercial IgG ELISA and an immunofluorescence assay for the resident population an average prevalence of 6.7% (12 of 178) with a range of 0% (0 of 21) to 11.9% (7 of 59) was observed. Positive serological results were equally distributed between males and females with an average age of 63 for males and 52 for females. The seroprevalence in the soldier group was found to be about 1% with one positive male of 203 (age 46 years) and one positive female of five (age 47 years).

CAT could be detected in cells after transfection, indicating the successful encapsidation, transcription and replication of the pol I-derived minigenomes. The passaged transfer of CAT demonstrates that recombinant virus containing packaged pol I-derived minigenomes has been produced.

19123130,The heart forming region of early chick embryo is an alternative source of embryonic stem cells.,"In early chick embryo, the precardiac cells reside within distinct groups of mesodermal cells known as presumptive heart forming regions (HFRs). HFRs are located on the lateral sides of the Hensens node. In an effort to study fate of HFRs in isolation, HFRs were excised from early gastrulating chick embryos and cultured in vitro. A very small proportion of HFRs from 18 h incubated embryos differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes whereas about 43% of HFRs from embryos incubated for longer durations (20, 23 and 28 h) showed beating activity. The potential of HFRs, from 18 h incubated embryos, to differentiate into cardiomyocytes increased significantly in presence of Hensens node. About one third of the HFR cells underwent spontaneous differentiation into adipocytes in culture. Simultaneously, some of the cells derived from HFRs exhibited alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity indicating presence of stem cells in the culture. HFR cells were positive for vimentin indicating their mesenchymal origin. FGF supplement increased the proportion of AP-positive cells in a dose dependent manner. The present study demonstrates that HFRs can serve as a source of mesenchymal stem cells which can be gainfully employed for various purposes. The results also suggest that even though the in vitro cultured HFRs from 18 h incubated HH stage 4 chick embryo retain the potential to undergo cardiac differentiation, certain instructive signals from Hensens node may reinforce the fate.","['Borgave S', 'Ghodke K', 'Ghaskadbi S']",2009,53,1,Int J Dev Biol,"Borgave S, et al.

METHODS: By field epidemiological study, Leptotrombidium scutellare (3829) was collected and separated from mice(166) in epidemic areas. The cells of mites separated from their host and role were cultured. PCR was used to detect HV-RNA and OT-DNA in the cell culture.
RESULTS: In 105 Apodemus agrarius, 3 HV-RNA positive, 2 OT-DNA positive and 2 coinfection with HV and OT were detected;in 41 Brown rattus, 2 HV-RNA positive, 1 OT-DNA positive and 1 co-infection with HV and OT were detected. From 15 mites co-infected with HV and OT, 2 strains of HV pathogen, 2 strains of OT pathogen were separated and 1 HV and OT pathogen in the same mite were separate.

METHODS: 22 HFRS patients who were diagnosed in Qin Huang Dao Third Hospital from April 2005 to July 2005 were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups according to clinical manifestations. T cell subsets of the 22 patients were monitored at week 1, 4 and 12. Another 56 subjects were enrolled as healthy controls.
RESULTS: B cell count was normal during the 12 weeks in all the subjects. NK cell decreased significantly at week 1, and recovered at week 4 rapidly. CD(4)(+)T cell count was normal throughout the course of the disease, but the percentage of memory phenotype increased at week 1 and 4, reaching(64.1 +/- 17.5)% and (59.9 +/- 10.1)%, but recovered at week 12. CD(4)(+)CD(28)(+)T cells were normal throughout the entire study. CD(8)(+)T cell count increased dramatically at week 1 and 4, but finally recovered at week 12. The count of CD(8)(+)CD(28)(-)T cells increased significantly at week 1 in low-grade goup, but in median-grade group, this increase lagged to week 4 and was not as significant as in low-grade group.

19072554,Cellular immune response to Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein in the acute phase of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: correlation with disease severity.,"BACKGROUND: The cellular immune response to Hantaan virus (HTNV) is incompletely understood, especially in humans.
METHODS: To investigate the cellular immunity during acute HTNV infection, the magnitude of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to HTNV nucleocapsid protein was quantitated by direct ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot analysis, using an array of overlapping peptides.
RESULTS: We found that the combined frequencies of HTNV-specific T cells at the earliest available time point (5-8 days after fever onset) were significantly higher in patients who had mild or moderate hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) than in those who had severe or critical HFRS (P= .006). Moreover, these frequencies were higher in patients with subsequent mild renal failure (maximum serum creatinine level, <or=707 micromol/L) than in those with subsequent severe renal failure (maximum serum creatinine level, >707 micromol/L) (P= .006). Kinetic analysis showed that a decrease in the serum creatinine level during the acute phase of illness was often accompanied by an increase in the magnitude of IFN-gamma-producing T cells.
CONCLUSION: Taken together with published data on the similar associations with neutralizing antibody, these data suggest that IFN-gamma-producing T cells may help reduce the risk of progression to acute renal failure caused by HTNV infection.","['Wang M', 'Wang J', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu Z', 'Yang K', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2009,199,2,J Infect Dis,"Wang M, et al.

19040041,[The reactivity of sera from hemorrhagic fever in patients with renal syndromes to the recombination nucleotide proteins from European hantaviruses in Hubei province].,"OBJECTIVE: Five yeast-expressed recombination nucleotide proteins of European hantaviruses were prepared as coated antigens to detect hantavirus-specific antibodies in sera from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndromes (HFRS) in Hubei province, through ELISA assay. The relativity among hantaviruses prevailing in different areas was investigated.
METHODS: 34 pairs of acute/convalescent serum samples were collected from HFRS patients in Hubei during 1985-1989 and 1996-2000. ELISA assay was performed to detect the reactivity of these sera to different hantavirus-recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (HV-rNP) which were derived from puumala virus (PUUV), dobrava virus (DOBV) while using hantaan virus (HTNV) to serve as control. Qualitative results were used to analyze the detection rate and thequantitative results of optical density values were used to investigate the antibodies' level and the changes.
RESULTS: The detective efficiency of rNP against IgG antibody in samples was as follows: HTNV-rNP > DOBV-rNP > PUUV-rNP. As to the detection of IgA, it was: DOBV-rNP > HTNV-rNP > PUUV-rNP. However, there was no difference between DOBV-rNP and HTNV-rNP when the hantavirus-specific IgM was detected. PUUV-rNP showed a very weak reactivity to all the antibodies in samples, but 3-pair samples reacted strongly to all the three subtype-rNP of PUUV. Results from quantitative analysis revealed that there was a relative higher level of IgM and IgA in acute phase sera. No significant difference between IgM and IgA levels was found and the level of IgG was low. A high level of IgA was detected in convalescent sera. Moreover, the level of IgA and IgG significantly increased with the progress of the disease.
CONCLUSION: DOBV-rNP had a high detective efficiency to serum samples from HFRS patients in Hubei. HV-specific IgA was kept on a high level in acute and convalescent phases and had important implications for the surveillance of HFRS. Also, it is assumed that PUUV and DOBV might have existed in Hubei province.","['Li Q', 'Chen W', 'Yang ZQ']",2008,29,6,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Li Q, et al.

METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected from Zhejiang province in 2007. Virus strains were isolated by the inoculation of homogenates of the mosquitoes onto BHK-21 cell line. The isolated strains were identified by serological (IFA) and molecular methods (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Two strains were isolated from mosquitoes causing cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in BHK-21 cells. Results from serological tests showed that both of the two strains were positive for the antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). PrM and E gene were then cloned and sequenced. Results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates belonged to genotype I JEV while through sequence analysis it showed that the homology of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences between the two strains were 99.0% and 98.8% respectively. Compared with the JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 and two strains, the homology of nucleotide sequences was up to 87.7% and homology of amino acid sequences was up to 96.4%.

A total of 38 individuals enrolled in the study had subsequent serological confirmation of HFRS. Four of the 38 individuals received three or fewer doses of ribavirin and were excluded from treatment analysis. Of the remaining 34 individuals, oliguria was present in one individual at treatment initiation; none of the remaining 33 subjects developed oliguria or required dialysis. The mean peak serum creatinine was 3.46 mg/dl and occurred on day 2 of ribavirin therapy. Both the peak serum creatinine and the onset of polyuria occurred on mean day 6.8 of illness. Reversible hemolytic anemia was the main adverse event of ribavirin, with a >or=25% decrease in hematocrit observed in 26/34 (76.5%) individuals. While inability to adjust for all baseline variables prevents comparison to historical cohorts in Korea where oliguria has been reported in 39-69% cases and dialysis required in approximately 40% HFRS cases caused by Hantaan virus, the occurrence of 3% oliguria and 0% dialysis requirement in the treatment cohort is supportive of a previous placebo-controlled HFRS trial in China where IV ribavirin given early resulted in decreased occurrence of oliguria and decreased severity of renal insufficiency.","['Rusnak JM', 'Byrne WR', 'Chung KN', 'Gibbs PH', 'Kim TT', 'Boudreau EF', 'Cosgriff T', 'Pittman P', 'Kim KY', 'Erlichman MS', 'Rezvani DF', 'Huggins JW']",2009,81,1,Antiviral Res,"Rusnak JM, et al.

18931068,"Corticosteroids modulate Seoul virus infection, regulatory T-cell responses and matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in male, but not female, Norway rats.","Human hantaviral disease is mediated by excessive proinflammatory and CD8+ T-cell responses, which can be alleviated by administration of corticosteroids. In contrast with humans, male rats that are infected with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), have reduced proinflammatory and elevated regulatory T-cell responses in tissues where virus persists. To determine the effects of glucocorticoids on SEOV persistence and immune responses during infection, male and female Norway rats received sham surgeries (sham) or were adrenalectomized (ADX0), in some of which corticosterone was replaced at low (ADX10) or high (ADX80) doses. Rats were inoculated with SEOV and serum corticosterone, SEOV RNA, gene expression and protein production were measured at different time points post-inoculation. We observed that SEOV infection suppressed corticosterone in sham males to concentrations seen in ADX0 males. Furthermore, males with low corticosterone had more SEOV RNA in the lungs than either females or males with high corticosterone concentrations during peak infection. Although high concentrations of corticosterone suppressed the expression of innate antiviral and proinflammatory mediators to a greater extent in females than in males, these immunomodulatory effects did not correlate with SEOV load. Males with low corticosterone concentrations and high viral load had elevated regulatory T-cell responses and expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9. MMP-9 is a glycogenase that disrupts cellular matrices and may facilitate extravasation of SEOV-infected cells from circulation into lung tissue. Suppression of glucocorticoids may thus contribute to more efficient dissemination of SEOV in male than in female rats.","['Easterbrook JD', 'Klein SL']",2008,89,Pt 11,J Gen Virol,"Easterbrook JD and Klein SL.

RNAi-mediated suppression of gC1qR/p32 markedly reduced HTNV binding and infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells.

Acute oliguric renal failure occurred within a few days.
INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasonography revealed symmetrically enlarged kidneys with a small amount of perirenal fluids. The blood count showed thrombocytopenia, and viral serology verified a recent infection with Puumala virus (species of Hantavirus).
TREATMENT AND COURSE: Epidemic nephropathy was diagnosed. The patient underwent one session of hemodialysis and soon recovered without any residual renal damage. The pregnancy continued without any further complications.
CONCLUSIONS: There are only few reports on infections with Puumala virus during pregnancy are. None of theses described any fetal abnormalities causes by the maternal infection, as in our patient. Hantavirus infections should be considered in differential diagnosis of acute renal failure in endemic regions.","['Georges CG', 'Artunc F', 'Weyrich P', 'Friedrich B', 'Wolf SC']",2008,133,37,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Georges CG, et al.

18761927,Situation of hantavirus infections and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in European countries as of December 2006.,"Hantavirus infections are widely distributed in Europe with the exception of the far north and the Mediterranean regions. The underlying causes of varying epidemiological patterns differ among regions: in western and central Europe epidemics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantavirus infections follow mast years with increased seed production by oak and beech trees followed by increased rodent reproduction. In the northern regions, hantavirus infections and HFRS epidemics occur in three to four year cycles and are thought to be driven by prey - predator interactions. Hantavirus infections and HFRS seem to be on the increase in Europe, partly because of better diagnostics, partly perhaps due to environmental changes. Unfortunately, hantavirus infections are still heavily under-diagnosed in many European countries. Here we report the results of a survey conducted in 2007 amongst the member laboratories of the European Network for diagnostics of Imported Viral Diseases (ENIVD).","['Heyman P', 'Vaheri A', 'ENIVD Members']",2008,13,28,Euro Surveill,"Heyman P, et al.

18716663,Pathology of Puumala hantavirus infection in macaques.,"Hantaviruses are globally important human pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Capillary leakage is central to hantaviral diseases, but how it develops, has remained unknown. It has been hypothesized that the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection would be a complex interplay between direct viral effects and immunopathological mechanisms. Both of these were studied in the so far best model of mild hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, i.e. cynomolgus macaques infected with wild-type Puumala hantavirus. Viral RNA detected by in situ hybridization and nucleocapsid protein detected by immunohistochemical staining were observed in kidney, spleen and liver tissues. Inflammatory cell infiltrations and tubular damage were found in the kidneys, and these infiltrations contained mainly CD8-type T-cells. Importantly, these results are consistent with those obtained from patients with hantaviral disease, thus showing that the macaque model of hantavirus infection mimics human infection also on the tissue level. Furthermore, both the markers of viral replication and the T-cells appeared to co-localize in the kidneys to the sites of tissue damage, suggesting that these two together might be responsible for the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection.","['Sironen T', 'Klingström J', 'Vaheri A', 'Andersson LC', 'Lundkvist A', 'Plyusnin A']",2008,3,8,PLoS One,"Sironen T, et al.

In this study, serum thrombospondin (TSP)-1 concentration in patients with HFRS was determined to explore its possible role in the pathogenesis of HFRS. The concentration of TSP-1 was measured using a competitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Significantly decreased levels of serum TSP-1 were observed in HFRS patients at febrile and hypotensive phases compared with those in the controls. The serum levels of TSP-1 in HFRS patients with more severe clinical types was reduced more profoundly than those in patients with milder clinical types at febrile and hypotensive phases, although the differences in TSP-1 were not significant. It was indicated that insufficient production or increased consumption of TSP-1, or both of these, may contribute to the impairment of capillary and small vessels and the development of hypotension at the early stage of HFRS, and the decreased degree may be associated with disease severity.","['Liu Z', 'Zhao Q', 'Han Q', 'Gao M', 'Zhang N']",2008,80,10,J Med Virol,"Liu Z, et al.

The pattern of increased vascular permeability is mediated by immune response. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the mechanism of HTNV involvement in the host's innate immune. In this study, the expression of five toll-like receptors (TLRs) was analyzed in Endothelial vein cells (EVC-304) following HTNV infection in vitro. TLR4 showed an altered expression after HTNV infection. HTNV infection significantly increased IFN-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion from EVC-304 cells, particularly after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The increased IFN-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production was mediated by TLR4 induction, since the introduction of the small interfering RNA against TLR4 specifically inhibited the HTNV-induced cytokine production. In conclusion, HTNV infection directly induces TLR4 expression and thereby enhanced production of IFN-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, which may contribute to the host's innate immune response.","['Jiang H', 'Wang PZ', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Sun L', 'Wang LM', 'Huang CX', 'Lian JQ', 'Jia ZS', 'Li ZD', 'Bai XF']",2008,380,1,Virology,"Jiang H, et al.

18687679,NMR structure of the N-terminal coiled coil domain of the Andes hantavirus nucleocapsid protein.,"The hantaviruses are emerging infectious viruses that in humans can cause a cardiopulmonary syndrome or a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The nucleocapsid (N) is the most abundant viral protein, and during viral assembly, the N protein forms trimers and packages the viral RNA genome. Here, we report the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-74, called N1-74) of the Andes hantavirus N protein. N1-74 forms two long helices (alpha1 and alpha2) that intertwine into a coiled coil domain. The conserved hydrophobic residues at the helix alpha1-alpha2 interface stabilize the coiled coil; however, there are many conserved surface residues whose function is not known. Site-directed mutagenesis, CD spectroscopy, and immunocytochemistry reveal that a point mutation in the conserved basic surface formed by Arg22 or Lys26 lead to antibody recognition based on the subcellular localization of the N protein. Thus, Arg22 and Lys26 are likely involved in a conformational change or molecular recognition when the N protein is trafficked from the cytoplasm to the Golgi, the site of viral assembly and maturation.","['Wang Y', 'Boudreaux DM', 'Estrada DF', 'Egan CW', 'St Jeor SC', 'De Guzman RN']",2008,283,42,J Biol Chem,"Wang Y, et al.

It is necessary to develop safe and effective adjuvants capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. We previously showed that activation-associated protein-1 (ASP-1) derived from Onchocerca volvulus has potent adjuvant activity. In this study, we have further evaluated the adjuvanticity of recombinant ASP-1 using a panel of recombinant proteins or synthetic peptide-based antigens, including ovalbumin (OVA), synthetic HIV peptide (HIV-p), recombinant HIV gp41 (rgp41) and HBV HBsAg, as well as three commercially available inactivated vaccines against haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Influenza and Rabies. Our results indicate that ASP-1 induced significantly higher IgG1 (Th2-associated) and IgG2a (Th1-associated) responses than alum adjuvant against OVA antigen, HIV-p, and rgp41. Consistently, it induced similar level of IgG1 responses as alum but higher level of IgG2a and IFN-gamma-producing T cell responses than alum adjuvant against HBsAg. Further, ASP-1 improved both IgG1 and IgG2a responses to three commercial inactivated vaccines when used separately or in combination. In conclusion, the recombinant ASP-1, unlike alum adjuvant, is able to induce both Th1 and Th2-associated humoral responses and Th1 cellular responses, suggesting that it can be further developed as a promising adjuvant for subunit-based and inactivated vaccines.","['Xiao W', 'Du L', 'Liang C', 'Guan J', 'Jiang S', 'Lustigman S', 'He Y', 'Zhou Y']",2008,26,39,Vaccine,"Xiao W, et al.

18667746,Impact of renal failure on the outcome of dengue viral infection.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the 2002 dengue outbreak in Taiwan, some fatal cases had the underlying disease of renal failure (RF). Physicians faced difficulty in diagnosis and treatment of these patients; however, the impacts of RF on the clinical presentations and outcomes of dengue infection have not been reported previously.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and underlying diseases for all cases of dengue infection in a medical center. Characteristics and outcomes of dengue-infected patients with and without RF were compared.
RESULTS: From January 2002 through January 2003, 519 dengue-infected patients were enrolled, including 412 patients with classical dengue fever (DF) and 107 patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Twelve patients died in this outbreak, and all had DHF/DSS. Twenty-one (4.0%) patients were defined as being in the RF group. The RF group had a higher mortality rate than non-RF group (28.6 versus 1.2%; P < 0.001). The severity of GFR impairment was associated with higher percentages of DHF/DSS (P = 0.029) and mortality (P < 0.001). Differences in symptoms/signs and laboratory abnormalities between DF and DHF/DSS were significant in the non-RF group but not apparent in the RF group.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and management of dengue infection among patients with RF must be cautious, because complicated clinical courses with a higher mortality rate were well observed.","['Kuo MC', 'Lu PL', 'Chang JM', 'Lin MY', 'Tsai JJ', 'Chen YH', 'Chang K', 'Chen HC', 'Hwang SJ']",2008,3,5,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,"Kuo MC, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 370 HFRS convalescents were examined with estimation of renal functional reserve, albuminuria, uric acid clearance, activity of urine N-acetil-beta-D-hexosaminidase in the urine, 18-h deprevation test, duplex scanning of renal vessels. Correlation between prevalence of chronic renal failure in Udmurtia and HFRS incidence was analysed.
RESULTS: Glomerular and tubular dysfunctions in HFRS convalescents (intraglomerular hypertension, albuminuria, regress of a concentration ability of the kidneys, impairment of tubular transport) are characterized by persistence in the presence of renal hypoperfusion and hypoexcretory hyperuricemia. 13% convalescents developed chronic disease of the kidneys (CDK) which clinically presented as chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. HFRS may contribute to formation of population of patients with chronic renal failure in the territory of active natural foci. A significant positive correlation was registered between mean annual levels of HFRS morbidity and prevalence of chronic renal failure in different regions of Udmurtia. According to clinical data, chronic renal failure develops in patients who earlier have suffered from renal disease.
CONCLUSION: Persistance of renal dysfunctions in HFRS convalescents and possible onset of chronic disease of the kidneys necessitate active follow-up of the disease convalescents.","['Dudarev MV', 'Pimenov LT']",2008,80,6,Ter Arkh,Dudarev MV and Pimenov LT.

In addition, serum samples were collected from four patients. Ten hantaviruses were isolated successfully in cell culture from four humans, two Apodemus agrarius, three Rattus norvegicus and one Rattus nitidus. The nucleotide sequences for their small (S), medium (M) and partial large (L) segments were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the S and M segment sequences revealed that all of these isolates belong to the species HTNV, suggesting a spillover of HTNV from A. agrarius to Rattus rats. All available isolates from Guizhou were divided into four distinct groups either in the S segment tree or in the M segment tree. The clustering pattern of these isolates in the S segment tree was not in agreement with that in the M or L segment tree, showing that genetic reassortment between HTNV had occurred naturally. Analysis of the S segment sequences from available HTNV strains indicated that they formed three clades. The first clade, which comprised only viruses from Guizhou, was the outgroup of clades II and III. The viruses in the second clade were found in Guizhou and mainly in the far-east Asian region, including China. However, the viruses in the third clade were found in most areas of China, including Guizhou, in which haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic.

The mapping was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis on a panel of N protein derivatives and alanine-substitution mutants in the three different hantavirus backgrounds. Four regions with different serological profiles were identified encompassing the amino acids (aa) 14-17, 22-24, 26, and 35-38. One of the regions showed strong cross-reactivity and was important for the recognition of SEOV and SNV antigens, but not the PUUV antigen (aa 35-38). Two regions displayed perceivable SEOV characteristics (aa 14-17 and aa 22-24 and 26) and the combined result of the alanine replacements resulted in a synergetic effect against the PUUV antigen (aa 14-17, 22-24, 26).","['Lindkvist M', 'Näslund J', 'Ahlm C', 'Bucht G']",2008,137,1,Virus Res,"Lindkvist M, et al.

18614628,The NY-1 hantavirus Gn cytoplasmic tail coprecipitates TRAF3 and inhibits cellular interferon responses by disrupting TBK1-TRAF3 complex formation.,"Pathogenic hantaviruses replicate within human endothelial cells and cause two diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In order to replicate in endothelial cells pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit the early induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta). Expression of the cytoplasmic tail of the pathogenic NY-1 hantavirus Gn protein is sufficient to inhibit RIG-I- and TBK1-directed IFN responses. The formation of TBK1-TRAF3 complexes directs IRF-3 phosphorylation, and both IRF-3 and NF-kappaB activation are required for transcription from the IFN-beta promoter. Here we report that the NY-1 virus (NY-1V) Gn tail inhibits both TBK1-directed NF-kappaB activation and TBK1-directed transcription from promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements. The NY-1V Gn tail coprecipitated TRAF3 from cellular lysates, and analysis of TRAF3 deletion mutants demonstrated that the TRAF3 N terminus is sufficient for interacting with the NY-1V Gn tail. In contrast, the Gn tail of the nonpathogenic hantavirus Prospect Hill virus (PHV) failed to coprecipitate TRAF3 or inhibit NF-kappaB or IFN-beta transcriptional responses. Further, expression of the NY-1V Gn tail blocked TBK1 coprecipitation of TRAF3 and infection by NY-1V, but not PHV, blocked the formation of TBK1-TRAF3 complexes. These findings indicate that the NY-1V Gn cytoplasmic tail forms a complex with TRAF3 which disrupts the formation of TBK1-TRAF3 complexes and downstream signaling responses required for IFN-beta transcription.","['Alff PJ', 'Sen N', 'Gorbunova E', 'Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Mackow ER']",2008,82,18,J Virol,"Alff PJ, et al.

18606026,Hantavirus disease (nephropathia epidemica) in Belgium: effects of tree seed production and climate.,"Recently, human cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE) due to Puumala virus infection in Europe have increased. Following the hypothesis that high reservoir host abundance induces higher transmission rates to humans, explanations for this altered epidemiology must be sought in factors that cause bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance peaks. In Western Europe, these abundance peaks are often related to high tree seed production, which is supposedly triggered by specific weather conditions. We evaluated the relationship between tree seed production, climate and NE incidence in Belgium and show that NE epidemics are indeed preceded by abundant tree seed production. Moreover, a direct link between climate and NE incidence is found. High summer and autumn temperatures, 2 years and 1 year respectively before NE occurrence, relate to high NE incidence.

The hantavirus infection belong to the one of them. The aim of this paper was to present current knowledge about relationship between hantavirus, their natural host and the spread of the infection to people. Rodents constitute both the natural host of the hantaviruses and the reservoir of hantavirus for environment. Circulation of the virus in the rodent population is crucial to maintain the virus in the environment. The individual characteristics of rodents influence on risk of infection with hantavirus. However, this relationship is still unexplained. Risk of pathogen exposure often increases with age and behavioral differences associated with the sex of the susceptible individual. Mating behaviors seem to play an important role in the spread of the virus among rodents. Human incidence of hantavirus infection has in general been found to correlate to the population size of rodent host especially in the model of nephropathia epidemica (NE; a mild form of HFRS), Puumala virus (PUU) and bank voles. The occurrence of hantavirus infections in humans is assumed to rise as a secondary effect from altered population sizes of rodents in a changing environment due to e.g. mast years, forest fragmentation, global warming.","['Baumann A', 'Dudek D', 'Sadkowska-Todys M']",2007,61,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Baumann A, et al.

18497244,[Hantavirus infections].,"Hantaviruses are enveloped single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses that belong to the family Bunyaviridae. They are widely distributed and maintained in populations of specific insectivores or rodent host species (mice or rats). In their natural host, hantaviruses develop persistent and asymptomatic infections with lifelong virus shedding in excreta. Transmission to humans occurs via direct contact with faeces, urine and saliva of infected rodents, in particular by inhaling virus contaminated aerosol. There are a variety of virus types that occur in different geographic areas, dependent on the natural distribution of the host. Unlike asymptomatic infection in rodents, several types of hantaviruses cause acute febrile diseases in humans, known as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). In Germany, human hantavirus infections frequently represent as nephropathia epidemica (NE), a generally mild HFRS form with influenza-like symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache and gastrointestinal disorders. Kidney failure, a characteristic sign of hantavirus infections, is also common. German NE cases are primarily caused by Puumala viruses (PUUV) which naturally persist in the bank vole, a mouse species that is widely distributed in the whole area of Germany. During 2005 and 2007, in several regions of Southern and Western Germany there was an unexpected increase in PUUV-associated NE cases. Currently, 1687 symptomatic hantavirus infections have been reported until the end of 2007, which is the highest number of hantavirus diseases in Germany since the introduction of the German infection protective law (Deutsches Infektionsschutzgesetz) in 2001. Treatment of hantavirus infections is mainly supportive and involves intensive medical care. A specific antiviral therapy with ribavirin has been shown to be successful for treatment of HFRS patients in the early stage of disease. In Germany, there is no licensed vaccine applicable for the prevention of hantavirus diseases. Anti-infectious measures are, therefore, regarded to be the most effective strategy to prevent illnesses due to these emerging RNA viruses.",['Stock I'],2008,31,4,Med Monatsschr Pharm,Stock I.

METHODS: With DFA, the HV antigen in lung tissues of rodents was detected. The total viral RNA was extracted from the lung tissues of the HV infected rats and amplified with reverse transcrition-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using the HV genotype specific primers. The amplified genes were then sequenced and subjected to genotyping and homologic analysis.
RESULTS: The average density of rodents was 3.15% and the virus carrying rate among rodents was 1.31%. Data from genotype analysis showed that the HV isolated from seven lung specimens taken from Rattus norvgicus, Apodemus agraius, Mus musculus, Rattus flavipectus among indoor rodents in Shaodong and Liuyang belonged to HV type II (SEOV), and one isolated from Apodemus agraius in Shaungfen belonged to HV type I (HTNV) among outdoor rodents.

18464294,How to diagnose hantavirus infections and detect them in rodents and insectivores.,"Hantaviruses are carried by rodents and insectivores in which they cause persistent and generally asymptomatic infections. Several hantaviruses can infect humans and many of them cause either haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. In humans hantavirus infections are diagnosed using IgM-capture tests but also by RT-PCR detection of viral RNA. For detection of hantavirus infections in rodents and insectivores, serology followed by immunoblotting of, for example, lung tissue, and RT-PCR detection of viral RNA may be used, and if of interest followed by sequencing and virus isolation. For sero/genotyping of hantavirus infections in humans and carrier animals neutralisation tests/RNA sequencing are required. Hantaviruses are prime examples of emerging and re-emerging infections and it seems likely that many new hantaviruses will be detected in the near future.","['Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O', 'Plyusnin A']",2008,18,4,Rev Med Virol,"Vaheri A, et al.

18461618,Seoul virus enhances regulatory and reduces proinflammatory responses in male Norway rats.,"Zoonotic pathogens, including hantaviruses, are maintained in the environment by causing persistent infection in the absence of disease in their reservoir hosts. Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15-30 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF-beta and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL-1beta or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL-1beta treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL-1beta-treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra-physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory-mediated disease in reservoir hosts.","['Easterbrook JD', 'Klein SL']",2008,80,7,J Med Virol,Easterbrook JD and Klein SL.

18430769,High risk of hypopituitarism in patients who recovered from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"CONTEXT: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantaviruses, is a severe systemic infection, with acute shock, vascular leakage, hypotension, and acute renal failure. Pituitary ischemia/infarction and necrosis are known causes of hypopituitarism, often remaining unrecognized due to subtle clinical manifestations. Cases of hypopituitarism after HFRS were previously only sporadically reported.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the prevalence of hypopituitarism among HFRS survivors.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 60 adults (aged 35.8+/-1.3 yr) who recovered from HFRS 3.7 +/- 0.5 yr ago (median 2 yr), assessment of serum T(4), free T(4), TSH, IGF-I, prolactin, cortisol, and testosterone (in males) was followed by insulin tolerance test and/or GHRH+GH-releasing peptide-6 stimulation tests.
RESULTS: Severe GH deficiency was confirmed in eight of 60 patients (13.3%): in five with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHDs) and isolated in three. Thyroid axis deficiency was confirmed in five of 60 patients (8.3%), all with MPHD. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis deficiency was observed in six of 60 (10.0%); in five with MPHD and isolated in one. Gonadal axis deficiency was confirmed in seven of 56 male subjects (12.5%): five with MPHD and isolated in two. Overall six patients (10.0%) had a single pituitary deficit (three GH, two gonadal, and one adrenal), and five (8.3%) had MPHD. The prevalence of patients having any endocrine deficiency was 18% (11 of 60).
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of hypopituitarism after recovery from HFRS is identified, with magnetic resonance imaging revealing atrophic pituitary and empty sella. Awareness is raised to neuroendocrine consequences of HFRS because unrecognized hypopituitarism significantly affects the physical and psychological well-being.","['Stojanovic M', 'Pekic S', 'Cvijovic G', 'Miljic D', 'Doknic M', 'Nikolic-Djurovic M', 'Micic D', 'Hrvacevic R', 'Nesic V', 'Popovic V']",2008,93,7,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"Stojanovic M, et al.

METHODS: Epidemiological surveillance data during the period of the past 52 years were analyzed. An epidemiological survey was carried out in the main epidemic areas in 2005.
RESULTS: A total of 8310 hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases were reported in Inner Mongolia from 1955 to 2006, and distributed in 61 counties. HFRS cases were mainly distributed in the east part of Inner Mongolia before 1990. However, HFRS cases had occurred in the middle and western parts since 1990. Hulunbeier prefecture, from the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, had been the most severe area being hit by HERS since the first outbreak in 1955, with 7369 cases reported over the past 52 years, and accounted for 88.68% of the total cases in the whole autonomous region.

18389907,Passive immunization protects cynomolgus macaques against Puumala hantavirus challenge.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses cause two severe and often fatal human diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Presently, there is no effective prevention available for HFRS or HPS. Here, we studied the effect of passive immunization on the course of infection in cynomolgus macaques challenged with wild-type Puumala hantavirus (PUUV-wt).
METHODS: A pool of serum drawn from previously PUUV-wt-infected monkeys was used for immunization; a pool of serum from the same monkeys that was obtained before infection was used as a control. Immunizations were administered 3 days before and 15 days after challenge with PUUV-wt. After challenge, monkeys were sampled once a week and analysed for PUUV-infection markers.
RESULTS: All three monkeys treated with non-immune serum became positive for PUUV RNA in plasma and showed PUUV nucleocapsid-specific immunoglobin M (IgM) responses after challenge. In contrast, no PUUV RNA or anti-PUUV-specific IgM response was detected in the three passively immunized monkeys. As seen in PUUV-infected humans, the control monkeys showed a marked decrease in the amount of platelets and increased levels of creatinine, interleukin (1L)-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) after inoculation. In contrast, no marked changes in the amount of platelets were observed in the immunized monkeys and they did not show increased levels of creatinine, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF after virus challenge.
CONCLUSION: The results show that passive immunization in monkeys, using serum from previously hantavirus-infected monkeys, can induce sterile protection and protect against pathogenesis. Convalescent-phase antibodies may represent a potential therapy that can induce immediate protection against HFRS and HPS.","['Klingström J', 'Stoltz M', 'Hardestam J', 'Ahlm C', 'Lundkvist A']",2008,13,1,Antivir Ther,"Klingström J, et al.

18370592,"Population, environmental, and community effects on local bank vole (Myodes glareolus) Puumala virus infection in an area with low human incidence.","In this study, the distribution of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection in local bank vole Myodes glareolus populations in an area with low human PUUV infection (nephropathia epidemica [NE]) incidence in northern Belgium was monitored for 2 consecutive years. Bank voles were trapped in preferred habitat and tested for anti-PUUV IgG. Infection data were related to individual bank vole features, population demography, and environmental variables. Rare occurrence of PUUV infection was found and PUUV prevalence was low compared with data from the high NE incidence area in southern Belgium. Small-scale climatic differences seemed to play a role in PUUV occurrence, vegetation index and deciduous forest patch size both influenced PUUV prevalence and number of infected voles in a positive way. The data suggested a density threshold in vole populations below which PUUV infection does not occur. This threshold may vary between years, but the abundance of bank voles does not seem to affect the degree of PUUV seroprevalence further. We found indications for a dilution effect on PUUV prevalence, dependent on the relative proportion of nonhost wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus in a study site. In conclusion, we regard the combination of a dilution effect, a possible threshold density that depends on local conditions, and a higher fragmentation of suitable bank vole habitat in our study area as plausible explanations for the sparse occurrence of PUUV infection and low prevalence detected. Thus, beside human activity patterns, local environmental conditions and rodent community structure are also likely to play a role in determining PUUV infection risk for humans.","['Tersago K', 'Schreurs A', 'Linard C', 'Verhagen R', 'Van Dongen S', 'Leirs H']",2008,8,2,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Tersago K, et al.

18367532,"Hantaviruses direct endothelial cell permeability by sensitizing cells to the vascular permeability factor VEGF, while angiopoietin 1 and sphingosine 1-phosphate inhibit hantavirus-directed permeability.","Hantaviruses infect human endothelial cells and cause two vascular permeability-based diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus infection alone does not permeabilize endothelial cell monolayers. However, pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit the function of alphav beta3 integrins on endothelial cells, and hemorrhagic disease and vascular permeability deficits are consequences of dysfunctional beta3 integrins that normally regulate permeabilizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) responses. Here we show that pathogenic Hantaan, Andes, and New York-1 hantaviruses dramatically enhance the permeability of endothelial cells in response to VEGF, while the nonpathogenic hantaviruses Prospect Hill and Tula have no effect on endothelial cell permeability. Pathogenic hantaviruses directed endothelial cell permeability 2 to 3 days postinfection, coincident with pathogenic hantavirus inhibition of alphav beta3 integrin functions, and hantavirus-directed permeability was inhibited by antibodies to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). These studies demonstrate that pathogenic hantaviruses, similar to alphav beta3 integrin-deficient cells, specifically enhance VEGF-directed permeabilizing responses. Using the hantavirus permeability assay we further demonstrate that the endothelial-cell-specific growth factor angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) and the platelet-derived lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) inhibit hantavirus directed endothelial cell permeability at physiologic concentrations. These results demonstrate the utility of a hantavirus permeability assay and rationalize the testing of Ang-1, S1P, and antibodies to VEGFR2 as potential hantavirus therapeutics. The central importance of beta3 integrins and VEGF responses in vascular leak and hemorrhagic disease further suggest that altering beta3 or VEGF responses may be a common feature of additional viral hemorrhagic diseases. As a result, our findings provide a potential mechanism for vascular leakage after infection by pathogenic hantaviruses and the means to inhibit hantavirus-directed endothelial cell permeability that may be applicable to additional vascular leak syndromes.","['Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Gorbunova EE', 'Mackow NA', 'Mackow ER']",2008,82,12,J Virol,"Gavrilovskaya IN, et al.

18355122,Truncated recombinant puumala virus nucleocapsid proteins protect mice against challenge in vivo.,"In Europe, Puumala virus and Dobrava virus are the major hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. As hantaviruses can cause diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates, and as to date there is no specific treatment, efforts are concentrated on the development of vaccines. In this study we characterized the immunogenicity of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of Puumala virus (PUUV) linked to a carrier protein corresponding to the outer membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae (rP40). The rP40 molecule is a novel carrier protein that facilitates exogenous antigen uptake by dendritic cells. We cloned and expressed the recombinant PUUV proteins in the E. coli mutant ICONE 200 using the tryptophan promoter-controlled pTEXmp18 expression vector. All recombinant PUUV proteins were found to be highly immunogenic in NMRI mice after three immunizations of 10 microg each of the protein. Only the truncated construct, P40-Puu118, gave high antibody titers after two vaccinations of 0.2 microg each. Likewise in the challenge experiments in NMRI mice, only the truncated construct P40-Puu118 resulted in 100% protection after three immunizations of 10 microg each. The results suggest that P40-Puu118 in particular is a good candidate for a recombinant vaccine against Puumala virus. All recombinant proteins linked to rP40 induced high antibody responses, indicating that rP40 is a carrier protein with potential for use in other vaccines.","['Maes P', 'Clement J', 'Cauwe B', 'Bonnet V', 'Keyaerts E', 'Robert A', 'Van Ranst M']",2008,21,1,Viral Immunol,"Maes P, et al.

Four monitored trapping sites were established in two forests located in two cantons (Flize and Monthermé). We captured 912 bank voles corresponding to 557 different individuals during 8820 trapping nights for an overall trapping success of 10.34%. The average PUUV seroprevalence was 22.4%. Characteristics of the system reported in North European countries are confirmed in France. PUUV seroprevalence and abundance of rodents appeared weakly linked. Adult voles were more frequently antibody-positive, but no difference between sexes was established. Anti-PUUV seropositive voles were captured and high seroprevalence was observed from both forests, without human infection reported in Flize canton during the study. One site among the four exhibited peculiar infection dynamics, where vole weight and infection risk were negatively correlated.","['Augot D', 'Sauvage F', 'Boue F', 'Bouloy M', 'Artois M', 'Demerson JM', 'Combes B', 'Coudrier D', 'Zeller H', 'Cliquet F', 'Pontier D']",2008,136,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Augot D, et al.

18305044,Hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome enters from the apical surface and requires decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55).,"The Old World hantaviruses, members of the family Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Transmission to humans occurs via inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the excreta of infected rodents. The viral antigen is detectable in dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and, most importantly, microvascular endothelial cells. However, the site and detailed mechanism of entry of HFRS-causing hantaviruses in polarized epithelial cells have not yet been defined. Therefore, this study focused on the entry of the pathogenic hantaviruses Hantaan and Puumala into African green monkey kidney epithelial cells and primary human endothelial cells. The polarized epithelial and endothelial cells were found to be susceptible to hantavirus infection exclusively from the apical surface. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which removes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from the cell surface, protects cells from infection, indicating that hantaviruses require a GPI-anchored protein as a cofactor for entry. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF)/CD55 is a GPI-anchored protein of the complement regulatory system and serves as a receptor for attachment to the apical cell surface for a number of viruses. Infection was reduced by the pretreatment of hantaviral particles with human recombinant DAF. Moreover, the treatment of permissive cells with DAF-specific antibody blocked infection. These results demonstrate that the Old World hantaviruses Hantaan and Puumala enter polarized target cells from the apical site and that DAF is a critical cofactor for infection.","['Krautkrämer E', 'Zeier M']",2008,82,9,J Virol,Krautkrämer E and Zeier M.

18296126,Puumala hantavirus genetic variability in an endemic region (Northern Sweden).,"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), naturally harboured and shed by bank voles (Myodes [Clethrionomys] glareolus), is the etiological agent to nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Both host and virus are found throughout much of the European continent and in northern Sweden NE is the second most prevalent serious febrile viral infection after influenza. The reliability of diagnostics by PCR depends on genetic variability for the detection of viral nucleic acids in unknown samples. In the present study we evaluated the genetic variability of PUUV isolated from bank voles in an area of northern Sweden highly endemic for NE. Genetic variability among bank voles was also investigated to evaluate co-evolutionary patterns. We found that the viral sequence appeared stable across the 80km study region, with the exception of the southernmost sampling site, which differed from its nearest neighbour by 7%, despite a geographical separation of only 10km. The southernmost sampling site demonstrated a higher degree of genetic similarity to PUUV previously isolated 100km south thereof; two locations appear to constitute a separate PUUV phylogenetic branch. In contrast to the viral genome, no phylogenetic variance was observed in the bank vole mtDNA in this study. Previous studies have shown that as a result of terrestrial mammals' postglacial re-colonization routes, bank voles and associated PUUV of a southern and a northern lineage established a dichotomous contact zone across the Scandinavian peninsula approximately 100-150km south of the present study sites. Our observations reveal evolutionary divergence of PUUV that has led to dissimilarities within the restricted geographical scale of the northern host re-colonization route as well. These results suggest either a static situation in which PUUV strains are regionally well adapted, or an ongoing process in which strains of PUUV circulate on a geographical scale not yet reliably described.","['Johansson P', 'Olsson GE', 'Low HT', 'Bucht G', 'Ahlm C', 'Juto P', 'Elgh F']",2008,8,3,Infect Genet Evol,"Johansson P, et al.

Monocytes/macrophages are thought to be the main target cells for hantaviruses and important sources of and targets for cytokines/chemokines secretion. THP-1 cells have been used extensively as models for primary monocytes in biocompatibility research. The aim of our study was to determine if hantaviruses induce the same immunoreactions in THP-1 cells and primary monocytes/ macrophages and might therefore be suitable for immune studies of hantaviral infections. For that purpose we compared various cytokines/chemokines and their receptors in THP-1 cell line and primary monocytes/macrophages. Infected primary monocytes/macrophages induced mostly beta-chemokines and their receptors. In contrast, THP-1 cells, expressed receptors for CXC chemokines. Surprisingly, infected macrophages underwent morphological changes toward dendritic-like cells and increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules: CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86. Our data indicate that THP-1 cells are not ideal for in vitro research of the immunopathogenesis of hantaviruses in humans.

19736383,Hantavirus infection: a review and global update.,"Hantaviruses have the potential to cause two different types of diseases in human: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS, initially described clinically at the turn of the 20th century, occurs endemically in the Asian and European continents, while HPS, recognized as a clinical entity since 1993, represents the prototype of emerging diseases occurring in the Western hemisphere. Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 cases of HFRS are hospitalized each year world wide, with most of the cases occurring in the developing countries. The case fatality rate of HFRS varies from <1% to 12% depending on the viruses. Although HPS is much smaller in number than HFRS, with approximately 200 HPS cases per year in the Americas, the average case fatality rate is 40%. The reported cases of hantaviral infection is increasing in many countries and new hantavirus strains have been increasingly identified worldwide, which constitutes a public health problem of increasing global concern. Hantaviral infection might be underestimated due to its asymptomatic and non-specific mild infection, and the lack of simple standardized laboratory diagnostics in hospitals, especially in the developing countries.

18078526,Environmental conditions and Puumala virus transmission in Belgium.,"BACKGROUND: Non-vector-borne zoonoses such as Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) can be transmitted directly, by physical contact between infected and susceptible hosts, or indirectly, with the environment as an intermediate. The objective of this study is to better understand the causal link between environmental features and PUUV prevalence in bank vole population in Belgium, and hence with transmission risk to humans. Our hypothesis was that environmental conditions controlling the direct and indirect transmission paths differ, such that the risk of transmission to humans is not only determined by host abundance. We explored the relationship between, on one hand, environmental variables and, on the other hand, host abundance, PUUV prevalence in the host, and human cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE). Statistical analyses were carried out on 17 field sites situated in Belgian broadleaf forests.
RESULTS: Linear regressions showed that landscape attributes, particularly landscape configuration, influence the abundance of hosts in broadleaf forests. Based on logistic regressions, we show that PUUV prevalence among bank voles is more linked to variables favouring the survival of the virus in the environment, and thus the indirect transmission: low winter temperatures are strongly linked to prevalence among bank voles, and high soil moisture is linked to the number of NE cases among humans. The transmission risk to humans therefore depends on the efficiency of the indirect transmission path. Human risk behaviours, such as the propensity for people to go in forest areas that best support the virus, also influence the number of human cases.
CONCLUSION: The transmission risk to humans of non-vector-borne zoonoses such as PUUV depends on a combination of various environmental factors. To understand the complex causal pathways between the environment and disease risk, one should distinguish between environmental factors related to the abundance of hosts such as land-surface attributes, landscape configuration, and climate - i.e., host ecology, - and environmental factors related to PUUV prevalence, mainly winter temperatures and soil moisture - i.e., virus ecology. Beyond a threshold abundance of hosts, environmental factors favouring the indirect transmission path (soil and climate) can better predict the number of NE cases among humans than factors influencing the abundance of hosts.","['Linard C', 'Tersago K', 'Leirs H', 'Lambin EF']",2007,6,,Int J Health Geogr,"Linard C, et al.

18069562,[Study on the recombinant expression of Hantaan virus protein N and the establishment and application of rNP-IgM direct capture ELISA].,"OBJECTIVE: To clone the gene encoding nucleocapsid protein (NP) of hantavirus strain Z10 (HV-Z10), to construct its prokaryotic expression system as well as to establish a rNP-IgM direct capture ELISA based on HRP-labeled recombinant NP (rNP), in order to detect serum samples of patients suffering from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and to evaluate the effects of detection.
METHODS: Gene encoding NP of strain HV-Z10 was amplified by PCR and then its prokaryotic expression system pET28a-Z10N-E. coli BL21DE3 was constructed, using routine genetic engineering method. SDS-PAGE was applied to measure the expression of rNP and ion-exchange plus Ni-NTA-affinity chromatography was performed to purify the recombinant product. Western blot assay was used to determine the specific immuno-reactivity of rNP while HRP-labeled rNP-IgM direct capture ELISA was established to detect the serum samples from 95 cases of confirmed HFRS patients. The detection effect was compared with that by routine HV-IgM indirect capture ELISA method.
RESULTS: pET28a-Z10N-E. coli BL21DE3 was able to express rNP with high efficiency. The purified rNP only showed a single protein fragment in the gel after SDS-PAGE. HV-IgG could efficiently recognize rNP and hybridize with the recombinant protein. 94.73% (90/95) of HFRS patients' serum samples were positively confirmed by rNP-IgM direct capture ELISA, while a positive rate of 92.63% (88/95) in the same samples was confirmed by HV-IgM indirect capture ELISA. The distributions of A450 values of the serum samples detected by the two IgM capture ELISAs as well as the changes of the A450 mean values from several serum samples with different dilutions were similar.
CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed a high efficient prokaryotic expression system of NP encoding gene of hantavirus strain HV-Z10. The rNP-IgM direct capture ELISA that established in this study could be used as a new serological test for HFRS diagnosis because of its simplicity, safety, with high sensitivity and specificity.","['Zhu HP', 'Yao PP', 'Xu F', 'Weng JQ', 'Xie RH', 'Lu QY', 'Zhu ZY', 'Yan J']",2007,28,7,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Zhu HP, et al.

18069386,[Occurrence of human hantavirus infections in Poland].,"A spread of hantavirus infections causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is one of the rising epidemiological problems in the world. There is evidence that this type of viruses exists in almost all European countries. It is known that in Poland all the species of wild rodents hosting European hantaviruses are present. However, the data on hantavirus are very limited and information on incidence and prevalence of hantavirus infections among humans and animals in our country is lacking. Up to now, only one study in Poland has dealt with hantavirus infections in humans. Therefore the aim of the presented study was to show whether those infections are present in Poland and how prevalent they are. Two risk groups of hantavirus infection were investigated: group I--people with renal disorders (hospitalized patients with proteinuria and people suspected to hantavirus infection; n=30 people) and group II--healthy people employed at the universities, scientific institutions who due to their profession have contact with small rodents as well as students who captured those rodents when practicing or preparing their master theses (n=76) and forest workers (n=86). No one from the group of patients with renal disorders was positive for hantavirus Puumala IgG. Moreover, none of the forest workers had evidence of hantavirus infection. The hantavirus IgG were found only in the group of mammologists--19% persons were positive. Mammologists are an occupational subpopulation who remain in direct contact with host and/or with host excretions (virus is present in urine, feces, saliva of infected animals) and seem to be the most sensitive indicator of hantaviruses presence in environment. These results prove occurrence of hantavirus infections in Poland, however it seems that they are not very prevalent.","['Sadkowska-Todys M', 'Gut W', 'Baumann A', 'Siennicka J', 'Litwińska B', 'Zieliński A']",2007,61,3,Przegl Epidemiol,"Sadkowska-Todys M, et al.

The transmission is related to the intimal contact with rodents. It causes two syndromes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), endemic in Asia and Europe and the Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), found in the American continent, including Brazil, with high mortality rates. The aim of this study is to report a case of HPS with multiple organ failure, managed with early goal-directed therapy guided by flow and tissue perfusion parameters.
CASE REPORT: A 36 year-old male had fever with progressive dispnea, severe hypoxia and acute respiratory failure. Diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrates were seen in the chest X-Ray. He developed multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (pulmonary, renal, coagulation, cardiovascular and metabolic). Treatment and invasive hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheter was early instituted. The most important laboratory findings were thrombocytopenia, elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and a positive sorology for Hantavirus (ELISA IgM positive). Organ dysfunctions reverted to normal and he was discharged after 21 days in hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: An early and adequate resuscitation with goal-directed therapy enabled the reversion of the multiple organ failure syndromes and a favorable outcome, despite the severity of the disease.","['Moreno MS', 'Castelão RC', 'Braga RT', 'Lobo SM']",2007,19,4,Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,"Moreno MS, et al.

We investigated the prevalence of hantavirus in the Indian population and tried to identify potential risk groups for hantavirus infections. The presence of hantavirus-specific IgG antibodies was prospectively evaluated in 661 subjects belonging to different groups, i.e. patients with chronic renal disease, warehouse workers and tribal members engaged in rodent trapping. Healthy volunteer blood donors were included as a control group. Thirty-eight seropositive samples were found using a combination of a commercial ELISA followed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Western blot using recombinant Hantaan virus nucleocapsid antigen confirmed the presence of anti-hantavirus IgG in 28 (74%) of the 38 sera tested. This study confirms the presence of hantaviruses in India and warrants increasing awareness of the problems of emerging pathogens and the threats they may pose to the public health system.","['Chandy S', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Ulrich RG', 'Mertens M', 'Okumura M', 'Rajendran P', 'John GT', 'Balraj V', 'Muliyil J', 'Mammen J', 'Abraham P', 'Arikawa J', 'Sridharan G']",2008,102,1,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Chandy S, et al.

17996200,"The function, composition, and particle size of high-density lipoprotein were severely impaired in an oliguric phase of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome patients.","BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) often showed strikingly reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels during the oliguric phase, indicating severe alterations in lipoprotein metabolism.
OBJECTIVE: To compare changes in the functions and composition of HDL, lipoprotein metabolism parameters were analyzed in the sera of HFRS patients in the oliguric phase and after recovery.
METHODS: The serum cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and lipoprotein/apolipoprotein profiles of HFRS patients in the oliguric and recovery phases were compared with those of normal reference sera. The activities of HDL-associated enzymes, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and paraoxonase (PON) were also assessed.
RESULTS: In the oliguric phase, serum cholesterol was substantially decreased and serum TG was increased. As observed by electron microscopy, the sizes of the HDL particles from the HFRS patients were smaller than those seen in the reference sera, with more heterogeneous distribution. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and apolipoprotein (apo) C-III were overexpressed in the oliguric phase, particularly in the HDL fraction. However, in immunodetection, the levels of apoA-I in the HDL(2) and HDL(3) of the HFRS patients were lower than those of the reference HDL. Serum LCAT and PON activities were reduced significantly in the oliguric phase, which is associated with a reduction in HDL-cholesterol levels and HDL particle size.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of both apoC-III and apoSAA in HDL and attenuated serum LCAT and PON activity were observed during the oliguric phase in HFRS patients. These results demonstrate that structural, functional, and compositional changes of HDL occurred to a substantial degree in the oliguric phase.","['Cho KH', 'Park SH', 'Park JE', 'Kim YO', 'Choi I', 'Kim JJ', 'Kim JR']",2008,41,1-2,Clin Biochem,"Cho KH, et al.

17963942,Genetic characterization and phylogeny of a hantavirus from Western Mexico.,"Hantaviruses can cause two serious illnesses when transmitted from their rodent reservoirs to humans; hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the New World and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Old World. Cases of HPS were first recognized in the Americas in small, focal outbreaks in rural populations in the Southwestern USA in 1993. Since that time, outbreaks as well as sporadic cases of HPS have been recognized throughout the Americas. Remarkably, HPS cases have not been reported in Mexico. Mexico is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world and this is reflected in the species diversity of the peromyscine, sigmodontine and oryzomyine rodents; all potential hosts of hantaviruses. Hence, we collected and surveyed several rodent species in Western Mexico and identified three previously unrecognized rodents with antibodies to hantaviral antigens: Oryzomys couesi, Sigmodon mascotensis and Baiomys musculus. The S and M segments cloned from O. couesi and S. mascotensis, referred to herein as Playa de Oro (ORO) virus, showed strongest similarity to Bayou and Catacamas viruses with 92/93% and 92/92% similarity based on S/M amino acid sequences, respectively.

17913864,Use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid protein to detect Hantaan virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM in oral fluid.,"Hantaan virus is the causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Clinical surveillance for Hantaan virus infection is unreliable, and laboratory verification is essential. The detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG in serum is most commonly used for the diagnosis of hantavirus infection. Testing of oral fluid samples instead of serum offers many advantages for surveillance. However, commercial tests for hantavirus-specific antibodies are unavailable. For the detection of Hantaan virus in the oral fluid of humans, we have developed a monoclonal antibody-based capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent IgM assay (IgM capture ELISA) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent IgG and IgM assays (indirect IgG and IgM ELISAs) for paired serum and oral fluid samples using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast-expressed nucleocapsid protein of the Hantaan-Fojnica virus. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid IgM capture ELISA in comparison with the results of the serum Hantaan virus IgM assay were 96.7% and of 94.9%, respectively. Thus, data on the overall performance of the oral fluid IgM capture ELISA are in close agreement with those of the serum IgM assay, and the method exhibits the potential to serve as an easily transferable tool for large-scale epidemiological studies. Data on the indirect IgM ELISA also showed close agreement with the serum IgM assay data; however, the indirect IgG ELISA displayed a lower sensitivity and a lower specificity. In conclusion, the IgM capture ELISA can be used with oral fluid instead of serum samples for the diagnosis of Hantaan virus infection.","['Petraityte R', 'Jin L', 'Hunjan R', 'Razanskiene A', 'Zvirbliene A', 'Sasnauskas K']",2007,14,12,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Petraityte R, et al.

The mechanisms causing hemorrhage are likely to vary among viruses. Some viruses, such as Marburg virus, are directly cytopathic to infected endothelial cells, suggesting infection of endothelial cells alone can cause hemorrhage. On the other hand, there are viruses which infect endothelial cells without causing any cytopathic effects, suggesting the involvement of host immune responses in developing hemorrhage. Typical examples of these include viruses of the hantavirus species. We hypothesize that impairment of endothelial cell's defense mechanisms against cytotoxic CD8+ T cells is the mechanism of capillary leakage in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may be common to other viral hemorrhagic fevers. CD8+ T cells may be a potential target for therapy of some viral hemorrhagic fevers.","['Terajima M', 'Hayasaka D', 'Maeda K', 'Ennis FA']",2007,113,2,Immunol Lett,"Terajima M, et al.

17877180,[Identification of Amur like virus in Apodemus peninsulae and its molecular characteristics in China].,"OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of Amur-like viruses in Apodemus peninsulae in China, and to understand the molecular characteristics of these viruses.
METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from lungs of A. peninsulae captured in Jilin of Northeast China with Trizol reagent. Complete S and partial M segments of Amur virus were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses on multiple nucleotide sequences were performed with the Clustal method and DNASTAR software.
RESULTS: 383 bp cDNA of M segment and 1696 bp of S segment of Amur like virus were recovered from lung tissue of A. peninsulae, named JilinAP06. The full-length of its S gene comprised of 1696 nucleotides with ORF including 1287 nucleotides and encoding a protein which comprised 429 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis of this sample with other hantaviruses revealed that the complete S and partial M segment sequence of JilinAP06 both were closely related to those Amur viruses such as AP63, AP61, AP1371 and AP1168 found in A. peninsulae from Far East region of Russia and B78 strain, Liu strain and H5 strain, which were all from Chinese patients. The complete S and partial M segment sequence of JilinAP06 had only 81.0% identities with the nucleotide sequences of HV prototype 76-118 strain.
CONCLUSION: Amur-like viruses did exist in A. peninsulae from Northeasern China while A. peninsulae might be the natural reservoir of Amur-like viruses in China and was the important infectious source to HFRS patients which were caused by Amur-like viruses.","['Zhang WY', 'Jiang JF', 'Yao K', 'Wu XM', 'Zuo SG', 'Zhan L', 'Chu CY', 'Zhao QM', 'Zhang PH', 'Yang H', 'Cao WC']",2007,28,5,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Zhang WY, et al.

17877177,[Study on the incidence and spatiotemporal dynamic variation of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Shandong province].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence and spatiotemporal dynamic variation of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Shandong province.
METHODS: According to surveillance data on HFRS epidemics and host animals, a 'contour area multifractal model' was estimated on the HFRS' incidence and multi-analysis model was applied to study spatiotemporal dynamic variation.
RESULTS: The process could be classified into 5 periods: 1st period (1974-1981) when HFRS was in completely natural focal state in Shandong, and the nature of focus was typical Apodemus type. 2nd period (1982-1986) indicated the process of expanding and merging of the Apodemus type focus in the southeastern part of Linyi district and the Rattus type focus was in the southern part of Jining city. 3rd period (1987-1990) indicated that through the expanding and merging of the two epidemic focuses,one mixed focus dominated by the Apodemus type had been formed in the hilly area of the southern and middle part of Shandong while another one dominated by the Rattus type in the Yellow River valley of the northwestern part of Shandong. 4th period (1991-1993) showed that the process of the spatial pattern of the mixed focus dominated by the Rattus type in Shandong. 5th period (1994-2004) referred to the spatial pattern of the mixed focus dominated by the Rattus became stabilized.
CONCLUSION: Evolution of the characteristics of HFRS focus in Shandong province experienced the following three processes: the simple Apodemus type and the simple Rattus type were seen separately to the mixed foci with the Apodemus type dominant and the Rattus dominant type coexisted and merged to the stable state of the mixed focus with Rattus as the dominant one.","['Kand DM', 'Wang ZQ', 'Fu JH', 'Yuan Q', 'Chen RY', 'Zhang XF', 'Guo J', 'Fan YO', 'Xue FZ', 'Wang JZ']",2007,28,5,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Kand DM, et al.

17848067,Emergence and persistence of hantaviruses.,"Hantaviral diseases have been recognized for hundreds of years but, until 1976, they had not been associated with an infectious agent. When Lee and colleagues isolated what is now known as Hantaan virus, the techniques they introduced allowed further investigations into the etiology of the classical hantavirus disease, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), now known to be caused by any of multiple hantaviruses. The discovery of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the New World, and that it also can be caused by any of multiple hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus), has opened an entire field of epidemiologic, virologic, molecular, behavioral, and ecologic studies of these viruses. There appears to be a single hantavirus-single rodent host association, such that understanding the idiosyncrasies of each rodent host species and the ecologic variables that affect them are recognized as critical if we are to reduce human risk for infection. This chapter summarizes what is known about hantaviruses with regard to history of these viruses, their taxonomy, recognized geographical distribution, ecologic factors impacting their maintenance and spread of hantaviruses, effect of rodent behavior on hantavirus transmission, influence of host factors on susceptibility to and transmission of hantaviruses, and transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to humans. In addition, we summarize all these complexities and provide suggestions for future research directions.","['Klein SL', 'Calisher CH']",2007,315,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Klein SL and Calisher CH.

17826847,A soluble and heat-resistant form of hantavirus nucleocapsid protein for the serodiagnosis of HFRS.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne viral zoonosis characterized by fever, hemorrhagic manifestations, and renal disorder. The causative agent of HFRS has been identified as a hantavirus. Hantavirus nucleocapsid proteins have recently been shown to be immunodominant antigens in HFRS, inducing an early and long-lasting immune response, and their amino termini are sensitive tools for the detection of specific antibodies in HFRS patient sera. Previous work has demonstrated that the introduction of the acidic tail of alpha-synuclein (ATS) into heat-labile proteins protects them from heat-induced aggregation. In this study, the ATS peptide was introduced into the N-terminal antigenic portion of the nucleocapsid proteins (amino acid residues 1-70) of the Hantaan virus (HTNV-delta N) and Seoul virus (SEOV-delta N). The recombinant ATS-HTNV-delta N and ATS-SEOV-delta N fusion proteins were heat-resistant, and the proteins purified by heat treatment were immunoreactive to sera from patients with HFRS. Compared with sera from patients with leptospirosis and scrub typhus, sera from patients with HFRS showed much higher reactivity in ATS-HTNV-delta N- or ATS-SEOV-delta N-based IgG ELISAs. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that only sera from patients with HFRS specifically recognized the ATS-HTNV-delta N and ATS-SEOV-delta N, indicating that the ATS-HTNV-delta N and ATS-SEOV-delta N were highly purified species without any other immunoreactive proteins as contaminants. These data demonstrate that the ATS-HTNV-delta N and ATS-SEOV-delta N fusion proteins offer a safe and inexpensive source of pure and specific antigen for large-scale diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of HFRS, and that ATS-fusion technology can also be utilized to solubilize other antigens that could be used for large-scale diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of other diseases.","['Park SM', 'Kim J']",2008,147,1,J Virol Methods,Park SM and Kim J.

17824420,Endemic hantavirus infection impairs the winter survival of its rodent host.,"The influence of pathogens on host fitness is one of the key questions in infection ecology. Hantaviruses have coevolved with their hosts and are generally thought to have little or no effect on host survival or reproduction. We examined the effect of Puumala virus (PUUV) infection on the winter survival of bank voles (Myodes glareolus), the host of this virus. The data were collected by monitoring 22 islands over three consecutive winters (a total of 55 island populations) in an endemic area of central Finland. We show that PUUV infected bank voles had a significantly lower overwinter survival probability than antibody negative bank voles. Antibody negative female bank voles from low-density populations living on large islands had the highest survival. The results were similar at the population level as the spring population size and density were negatively correlated with PUUV prevalence in the autumn. Our results provide the first evidence for a significant effect of PUUV on host survival suggesting that hantaviruses, and endemic pathogens in general, deserve even more attention in studies of host population dynamics.","['Kallio ER', 'Voutilainen L', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Henttonen H', 'Koskela E', 'Mappes T']",2007,88,8,Ecology,"Kallio ER, et al.

17705180,Tula and Puumala hantavirus NSs ORFs are functional and the products inhibit activation of the interferon-beta promoter.,"The S RNA genome segment of hantaviruses carried by Arvicolinae and Sigmodontinae rodents encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein and has an overlapping (+1) open reading frame (ORF) for a putative nonstructural protein (NSs). The aim of this study was to determine whether the ORF is functional. A protein corresponding to the predicted size of Tula virus (TULV) NSs was detected using coupled in vitro transcription and translation from a cloned S segment cDNA, and a protein corresponding to the predicted size of Puumala virus (PUUV) NSs was detected in infected cells by Western blotting with an anti-peptide serum. The activities of the interferon beta (IFN-beta) promoter, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)- and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) responsive promoters, were inhibited in COS-7 cells transiently expressing TULV or PUUV NSs. Also IFN-beta mRNA levels in IFN-competent MRC5 cells either infected with TULV or transiently expressing NSs were decreased. These data demonstrate that Tula and Puumala hantaviruses have a functional NSs ORF. The findings may explain why the NSs ORF has been preserved in the genome of most hantaviruses during their long evolution and why hantavirus-infected cells secrete relatively low levels of IFNs.","['Jääskeläinen KM', 'Kaukinen P', 'Minskaya ES', 'Plyusnina A', 'Vapalahti O', 'Elliott RM', 'Weber F', 'Vaheri A', 'Plyusnin A']",2007,79,10,J Med Virol,"Jääskeläinen KM, et al.

17697362,Analysis of the geographic distribution of HFRS in Liaoning Province between 2000 and 2005.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in Liaoning Province, China, and this province was the most serious area affected by HFRS during 2004 to 2005. In this study, we conducted a spatial analysis of HFRS cases with the objective to determine the distribution of HFRS cases and to identify key areas for future public health planning and resource allocation in Liaoning Province.
METHODS: The annual average incidence at the county level was calculated using HFRS cases reported between 2000 and 2005 in Liaoning Province. GIS-based spatial analyses were conducted to detect spatial distribution and clustering of HFRS incidence at the county level, and the difference of relative humidity and forestation between the cluster areas and non-cluster areas was analyzed.
RESULTS: Spatial distribution of HFRS cases in Liaoning Province from 2000 to 2005 was mapped at the county level to show crude incidence, excess hazard, and spatial smoothed incidence. Spatial cluster analysis suggested 16 and 41 counties were at increased risk for HFRS (p < 0.01) with the maximum spatial cluster sizes at < or = 50% and < or = 30% of the total population, respectively, and the analysis showed relative humidity and forestation in the cluster areas were significantly higher than in other areas.
CONCLUSION: Some clustering of HFRS cases in Liaoning Province may be etiologically linked. There was strong evidence some HFRS cases in Liaoning Province formed clusters, but the mechanism underlying it remains unknown. In this study we found the clustering was consistent with the relative humidity and amount of forestation, and showed data indicating there may be some significant relationships.","['Lin H', 'Liu Q', 'Guo J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang J', 'Chen H']",2007,7,,BMC Public Health,"Lin H, et al.

17693139,"Association between the DQA MHC class II gene and Puumala virus infection in Myodes glareolus, the bank vole.","Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus specifically harboured by the bank vole, Myodes (earlier Clethrionomys) glareolus. It causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, called Nephropathia epidemica (NE). The clinical severity of NE is variable among patients and depends on their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetic background. In this study we investigated the potential role of class II MHC gene polymorphism in the susceptibility/resistance to PUUV in the wild reservoir M. glareolus. We performed an association study between the exon 2 of the DQA gene and PUUV antibodies considering a natural population of bank voles. Because immune gene polymorphism is likely to be driven by multiple parasites in the wild, we also screened bank voles for other potential viral and parasitic infections. We used multivariate analyses to explore DQA polymorphism/PUUV associations while considering the potential antagonist and/or synergistic effects of the whole parasite community. Our study suggests links between class II MHC characteristics and viral infections including PUUV and Cowpox virus. Several alleles are likely to be involved in the susceptibility or in the resistance of bank voles to these infections. Alternatively, heterozygosity does not seem to be associated with PUUV or any other parasite infections. This result thus provides no evidence in favour of the hypothesis of selection through overdominance. Finally this multivariate approach reveals a strong antagonism between ectoparasitic mites and PUUV, suggesting direct or indirect immunogenetic links between infections by these parasites. Other datasets are now required to confirm these results and to test whether the associations vary in space and/or time.","['Deter J', 'Bryja J', 'Chaval Y', 'Galan M', 'Henttonen H', 'Laakkonen J', 'Voutilainen L', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Salvador AR', 'Morand S', 'Cosson JF', 'Charbonnel N']",2008,8,4,Infect Genet Evol,"Deter J, et al.

We have studied the T cell response and the generation of memory during acute infection by the Puumala virus (PUUV), a hantavirus endemic to Europe. It causes a self-limiting infection with no viral persistence, manifesting as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. HLA tetramer staining of PBMC showed that the CD8(+) T cell response peaked at the onset of the clinical disease and decreased within the next 3 wk. Expression of activation markers on the tetramer-positive T cells was also highest during the acute phase, suggesting that the peak population consisted largely of effector cells. Despite the presence of tetramer-positive T cells expressing cytoplasmic IFN-gamma, PUUV-specific cells producing IFN-gamma in vitro were rare during the acute phase. Their frequency, as well as the expression of IL-7R alpha mRNA and surface protein, increased during a follow-up period of 6 wk and probably reflected the induction of memory T cells. Simultaneously with the PUUV-specific response, we also noted in seven of nine patients an increase in EBV-specific T cells and the transient presence of EBV DNA in three patients, indicative of viral reactivation. Our results show that in a natural human infection CD8(+) memory T cells are rare during the peak response, gradually emerging during the first weeks of convalescence. They also suggest that the boosting of unrelated memory T cells may be a common occurrence in human viral infections, which may have significant implications for the homeostasis of the memory T cell compartment.","['Tuuminen T', 'Kekäläinen E', 'Mäkelä S', 'Ala-Houhala I', 'Ennis FA', 'Hedman K', 'Mustonen J', 'Vaheri A', 'Arstila TP']",2007,179,3,J Immunol,"Tuuminen T, et al.

For 31 patients from a hantavirus disease outbreak in Lower Bavaria, a district in southeast Germany, serodiagnosis was undertaken by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence assay, and immunoblot analysis. In a few of these cases, however, PUUV-specific typing of antibodies by these standard assays failed and a virus neutralization assay under biosafety level 3 conditions was required to verify the infection by this virus type. PUUV RNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from acute-phase sera of three patients and was found to be very closely related to virus sequences obtained from bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) trapped in the same area. These findings link the outbreak with a novel PUUV lineage, ""Bavaria,"" circulating in the local rodent population. The Bavaria lineage associated with the outbreak is only distantly related to other PUUV lineages from Germany.","['Schilling S', 'Emmerich P', 'Klempa B', 'Auste B', 'Schnaith E', 'Schmitz H', 'Krüger DH', 'Günther S', 'Meisel H']",2007,45,9,J Clin Microbiol,"Schilling S, et al.

17537944,Puumala hantavirus viremia diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR using samples from patients with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is the endemic hantavirus in northern Sweden and causes nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. There is a need for fast and reliable diagnostics to differentiate the disease from other infections. By aligning virus RNA sequences isolated from 11 different bank voles and one human patient, we designed a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR method for detection of PUUV RNA. The real-time RT-PCR assay showed linearity from 20 to 2 x 10(6) virus copies with a correlation coefficient above 0.98 to 0.99 for all experiments. The detection threshold for PUUV cDNA was two copies per reaction. A two-step qualitative RT-PCR to detect PUUV RNA showed 100% concordance with the real-time RT-PCR assay. PUUV RNA viremia was detected in 33 of 34 PUUV immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive patients with typical clinical NE disease from the region of endemicity. One PUUV IgM-negative sample had PUUV RNA, and 4 days later, the patient was IgM positive. Of samples with indeterminate IgM, 43% were PUUV RNA positive. The kinetics of antibody titers and PUUV viremia were studied, and five of six NE patients displayed a decrease in PUUV viremia a few days after disease outbreak coupled with an increase in PUUV IgM and IgG. In one patient with continuously high PUUV RNA levels but low IgM and no IgG response, the infection was lethal. These findings demonstrated that real-time RT-PCR is a useful method for diagnosis of PUUV viremia and for detecting PUUV RNA at early time points, before the appearance of IgM antibodies.","['Evander M', 'Eriksson I', 'Pettersson L', 'Juto P', 'Ahlm C', 'Olsson GE', 'Bucht G', 'Allard A']",2007,45,8,J Clin Microbiol,"Evander M, et al.

17531126,"Nucleotide sequence characterization and phylogenetic analysis of hantaviruses isolated in Shandong Province, China.","BACKGROUND: China is the most severe endemic area of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the world with 30,000-50,000 cases reported annually, which accounts for more than 90% of total number of cases worldwide. The incidence rate of the syndrome in Shandong Province is one of the highest in China, which has ever reached 50 per 100,000 persons per year. However, the molecular characteristics of hantaviruses (HV) epidemic in Shandong Province remain unclear. Therefore it is useful to clarify nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic characteristics of HV isolated in Shandong Province in order to provide better advices to control and prevent HFRS.
METHODS: RNAs were extracted from sera of clinically diagnosed patients and positive rodent lungs that were detected by indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Partial M segments of HV were amplified from the RNAs with reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reactions (nested PCR) using hantavirus genotype specific primers. The nested PCR products were sequenced and compared with those from previously epidemic isolates in Shandong and with other representative HV sequences from GenBank. Phylogenetic tree analyses were performed based on the sequences of the M genes.
RESULTS: Thirty-four HV isolates in Shandong showed 67.1%-100% nucleotide identities. The nucleotide homologies among 6 Hantaan viruses (HTNV) isolates in Shandong were 78.1%-98.7%, while the homologies among 28 Seoul virus (SEOV) isolates in Shandong were 93.7%-100%. There were at least 3 subtypes HTNV (H2, H5, H9) and 2 subtypes SEOV (S2, S3) in Shandong Province.
CONCLUSIONS: In Shandong Province, the homologies of HTNV were lower and there were no predominant subtypes, while the homologies of SEOV were higher and S3 was the predominant subtype. The homologies of SEOV from rodents were higher than those from patients. The distribution of subtypes in Shandong was similar to that of the adjoining provinces. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences showed geographic clustering of HV in Shandong.","['Li J', 'Zhao ZT', 'Wang ZQ', 'Liu YX', 'Hu MH']",2007,120,9,Chin Med J (Engl),"Li J, et al.

17522204,"Lambda interferon (IFN-lambda) in serum is decreased in hantavirus-infected patients, and in vitro-established infection is insensitive to treatment with all IFNs and inhibits IFN-gamma-induced nitric oxide production.","Hantaviruses, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), are known to be sensitive to nitric oxide (NO) and to pretreatment with type I and II interferons (alpha interferon [IFN-alpha]/IFN-beta and IFN-gamma, respectively). Elevated serum levels of NO and IFN-gamma have been observed in HFRS patients, but little is known regarding the systemic levels of other IFNs and the possible effects of hantaviruses on innate antiviral immune responses. In Puumala virus-infected HFRS patients (n = 18), we report that the levels of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta are similar, whereas the level of IFN-lambda (type III IFN) is significantly decreased, during acute (day of hospitalization) compared to the convalescent phase. The possible antiviral effects of IFN-lambda on the prototypic hantavirus Hantaan virus (HTNV) replication was then investigated. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-lambda alone inhibited HTNV replication, and IFN-lambda combined with IFN-gamma induced additive antiviral effects. We then studied the effect of postinfection treatment with IFNs. Interestingly, an already-established HTNV infection was insensitive to subsequent IFN-alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -lambda stimulation, and HTNV-infected cells produced less NO compared to noninfected cells when stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-1beta. Furthermore, less phosphorylated STAT1 after IFN treatment was observed in the nuclei of infected cells than in those of noninfected cells. The results suggest that hantavirus can interfere with the activation of antiviral innate immune responses in patients and inhibit the antiviral effects of all IFNs. We believe that future studies addressing the mechanisms by which hantaviruses interfere with the activation and shaping of immune responses may bring more knowledge regarding HFRS and HCPS pathogenesis.","['Stoltz M', 'Ahlm C', 'Lundkvist A', 'Klingström J']",2007,81,16,J Virol,"Stoltz M, et al.

To correctly distinguish the two diseases at an early stage, we collected and compared clinical and routine laboratory data of 46 patients with confirmed scrub typhus and 49 patients with confirmed HFRS presenting to the outpatient departments of three town hospitals in northern China. Most patients with HFRS but none of the patients with scrub typhus had hemorrhagic manifestations. Retro-orbital pain, lumbar back pain, flank tenderness, proteinuria, and occult blood in urine often occurred in patients with HFRS. However, skin eschar, regional lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash were more commonly found in patients with scrub typhus. In addition, platelet counts in patients with HFRS were significantly lower than in patients with scrub typhus.

Using the MHC tetramer derived from the epitope, we found that the level of N-specific CD8(+) T cells increased to approximately 20% of all antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in a mouse model of transient infection. However, N-specific CD8(+) T cells were undetectable in a mouse model of persistent infection, both in the persistently infected phase and in the convalescent phase. Levels of CD8(+) T cells producing interferon-gamma were weak in both the acute and convalescent phases in the persistently infected model. These results indicate that hantavirus strongly suppresses the production of N-specific CD8(+) T cells throughout the course of infection in persistently infected mice. Moreover, N-specific CD8(+) T cells were not effective in recovering persistently infected mice, despite the existence of abundant N antigen in vivo.","['Taruishi M', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Araki K', 'Okumura M', 'Nakamura I', 'Kajino K', 'Arikawa J']",2007,365,2,Virology,"Taruishi M, et al.

17474974,Determinants of the geographic distribution of Puumala virus and Lyme borreliosis infections in Belgium.,"BACKGROUND: Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases generally display clear spatial patterns due to different space-dependent factors. Land cover and land use influence disease transmission by controlling both the spatial distribution of vectors or hosts, and the probability of contact with susceptible human populations. The objective of this study was to combine environmental and socio-economic factors to explain the spatial distribution of two emerging human diseases in Belgium, Puumala virus (PUUV) and Lyme borreliosis. Municipalities were taken as units of analysis.
RESULTS: Negative binomial regressions including a correction for spatial endogeneity show that the spatial distribution of PUUV and Lyme borreliosis infections are associated with a combination of factors linked to the vector and host populations, to human behaviours, and to landscape attributes. Both diseases are associated with the presence of forests, which are the preferred habitat for vector or host populations. The PUUV infection risk is higher in remote forest areas, where the level of urbanisation is low, and among low-income populations. The Lyme borreliosis transmission risk is higher in mixed landscapes with forests and spatially dispersed houses, mostly in wealthy peri-urban areas. The spatial dependence resulting from a combination of endogenous and exogenous processes could be accounted for in the model on PUUV but not for Lyme borreliosis.
CONCLUSION: A large part of the spatial variation in disease risk can be explained by environmental and socio-economic factors. The two diseases not only are most prevalent in different regions but also affect different groups of people. Combining these two criteria may increase the efficiency of information campaigns through appropriate targeting.","['Linard C', 'Lamarque P', 'Heyman P', 'Ducoffre G', 'Luyasu V', 'Tersago K', 'Vanwambeke SO', 'Lambin EF']",2007,6,,Int J Health Geogr,"Linard C, et al.

17457121,Evaluating teamwork in a simulated obstetric environment.,"BACKGROUND: The National Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths identified ""lack of communication and teamwork"" as a leading cause of substandard obstetric care. The authors used high-fidelity simulation to present obstetric scenarios for team assessment.
METHODS: Obstetric nurses, physicians, and resident physicians were repeatedly assigned to teams of five or six, each team managing one of four scenarios. Each person participated in two or three scenarios with differently constructed teams. Participants and nine external raters rated the teams' performances using a Human Factors Rating Scale (HFRS) and a Global Rating Scale (GRS). Interrater reliability was determined using intraclass correlations and the Cronbach alpha. Analyses of variance were used to determine the reliability of the two measures, and effects of both scenario and rater profession (R.N. vs. M.D.) on scores. Pearson product-moment correlations were used to compare external with self-generated assessments.
RESULTS: The average of nine external rater scores showed good reliability for both HFRS and GRS; however, the intraclass correlation coefficients for a single rater was low. There was some effect of rater profession on self-generated HFRS but not on GRS. An analysis of profession-specific subscores on the HFRS revealed no interaction between profession of rater and profession being rated. There was low correlation between externally and self-generated team assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the use of the HFRS for assessment of obstetric teams. The GRS shows promise as a summative but not a formative assessment tool. It is necessary to develop a domain specific behavioral marking system for obstetric teams.","['Morgan PJ', 'Pittini R', 'Regehr G', 'Marrs C', 'Haley MF']",2007,106,5,Anesthesiology,"Morgan PJ, et al.

17441904,Characterization and NMR solution structure of a novel cyclic pentapeptide inhibitor of pathogenic hantaviruses.,"Hantavirus-induced diseases such as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome are a global health concern. Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by Sin Nombre virus lacks specific therapy and its high mortality makes Sin Nombre virus a potential bioweapon agent. Sin Nombre virus entry into susceptible cells requires expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. We recently reported the sequence of a cyclic nonapeptide that inhibited Sin Nombre virus entry into Vero E6 cells at a level comparable to ReoPro, a Fab fragment of the anti-beta(3) antibody c7E3. Here, we refine the parental peptide, cyclo-[CPFVKTQLC], using alanine scanning and amino acid deletions, by optimizing for viral inhibition. The IC(50) of the resulting peptide, cyclo-[CPFVC], was 267 microM compared with 263 microM for the parental peptide. The solution structure of cyclo-[CPFVC] was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing the Phe ring in an extended conformation stacked against the Pro ring and containing a beta-turn encompassing Val-4 through Cys-1. As an initial step in identifying interactions between cyclo-[CPFVC] and its target cellular receptor, the refined peptide structure was docked into the ReoPro binding site of integrin beta(3). This structure will provide the basis for designing more potent peptidomimetic therapeutics to prevent Sin Nombre virus entry and treat hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.","['Hall PR', 'Malone L', 'Sillerud LO', 'Ye C', 'Hjelle BL', 'Larson RS']",2007,69,3,Chem Biol Drug Des,"Hall PR, et al.

17405352,A comparative epidemiological study of hantavirus infection in Japan and Far East Russia.,"Hantaviruses are causative agents of some severe human illnesses, including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The viruses are maintained by rodent hosts, and humans acquire infection by inhaling virus-contaminated excreta from infected animals. To examine the epidemiology of hantavirus infections in Japan and Far East Russia, we conducted epidemiological surveys in these regions. In Japan, anti-hantavirus antibodies were found in four rodent species, Clethrionomys rufocanus, Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, and Apodemus speciosus. Although no new HFRS cases have been officially reported over the past 20 years in Japan, one member of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force did test positive for hantavirus antibody. Repeated surveys in Far East Russia have revealed that two distinct hantavirus types cause severe HFRS in this region. Hantavirus sequences identified from A. peninsulae, fetal HFRS cases in Vladivostok, and Amur virus are highly similar to each other (> 92% identity), but they are less similar (approximately 84% identity) to the prototypical Hantaan virus, which is carried by A. agrarius. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that Amur and A. peninsulae-associated viruses are distinct from Hantaan virus, suggesting that A. peninsulae is the reservoir animal for Amur virus, which causes severe HFRS. From HFRS patients in the Khabarovsk region, we identified viruses with nucleotide sequences that are more similar to Far East virus (> 96%identity) than to the Hantaan (88-89% identity) or Amur (81-83% identity) viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that the viruses from Khabarovsk HFRS patients are closely related to the Far East virus, and distinct from Amur virus.","['Kariwa H', 'Lokugamage K', 'Lokugamage N', 'Miyamoto H', 'Yoshii K', 'Nakauchi M', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Ivanov LI', 'Iwasaki T', 'Takashima I']",2007,54,4,Jpn J Vet Res,"Kariwa H, et al.

Partial S and M segments were amplified from all of the antigen-positive samples. Furthermore, two hantaviruses (CJAp89 and CJAp93) were isolated successfully in cell culture and the entire S and M segments were amplified from one of them (CJAp93). Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences (partial or complete) showed that hantaviruses carried by A. peninsulae and A. agrarius form two distinct lineages, although viruses carried by A. peninsulae are similar to those isolated previously from A. agrarius in China and from HFRS patients in Russia. However, the viruses detected in A. peninsulae in China are genetically different from those detected in A. peninsulae in other countries. These data suggest that A. peninsulae is also a natural host for HTNV in north-eastern China.","['Zhang YZ', 'Zou Y', 'Yao LS', 'Hu GW', 'Du ZS', 'Jin LZ', 'Liu YY', 'Wang HX', 'Chen X', 'Chen HX', 'Fu ZF']",2007,88,Pt 4,J Gen Virol,"Zhang YZ, et al.

METHODS: The PBL-T of patients with HFRS were isolated by negative selection with magnetic beads and cultured with or without phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and ionomycin. The apoptotic ratio of PBL-T was detected with TUNEL staining and assessed with flow cytometry. The level of caspase-3 of PBL-T in patients with HFRS was detected with Western blot. Characteristic gene fragment of Hantaan virus and Seoul virus was detected with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: In HFRS patients, the apoptotic ratio (27.79 +/- 0.99)% of PBL-T activated with PHA and ionomycin was significantly higher than that without activation (17.16 +/- 1.14)%, (P < 0.01). The apoptotic ratio of PBL-T in HFRS patients was higher than that of healthy control (P < 0.01), no matter with or without activation. The expression level of caspase-3 increased in the induced group of patients with HFRS and the expression level of 17 000 (the active component of caspase-3) increased significantly. The results of sequencing showed that amplification production from the serum are positive in 19 cases, seven being Hantaan virus and twelve Seoul virus.
CONCLUSIONS: AICD in PBL-T was found in patients of with HFRS. The high expression rate of caspase-3 in the PBL-T of patients with HFRS was related with AICD in the patients with HFRS. In the HFRS patients with specific IgM antibody positive, characteristic fragments can be obtained with RT-PCR from 79.2% patients.

With the endemics data of schistosomiasis in Xichang, China, we demonstrate that the conceptual model is feasible; we introduce how remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques can be used in support of spatio-temporal modeling; we compare the different effects caused to the entire population when selecting different groups of people for schistosomiasis control. Our work illustrates the importance of such a modeling tool in supporting spatial decisions. Our modeling method can be directly applied to such infectious diseases as the plague, lyme disease, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The application of remote sensing and geographic information systems can shed light on the modeling of other infectious disease and invasive species studies.","['Gong P', 'Xu B', 'Liang S']",2006,49,6,Sci China C Life Sci,"Gong P, et al.

17267477,Degrons at the C terminus of the pathogenic but not the nonpathogenic hantavirus G1 tail direct proteasomal degradation.,"Pathogenic hantaviruses cause two human diseases: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The hantavirus G1 protein contains a long, 142-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail, which in NY-1 virus (NY-1V) is ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded (E. Geimonen, I. Fernandez, I. N. Gavrilovskaya, and E. R. Mackow, J. Virol. 77: 10760-10768, 2003). Here we report that the G1 cytoplasmic tails of pathogenic Andes (HPS) and Hantaan (HFRS) viruses are also degraded by the proteasome and that, in contrast, the G1 tail of nonpathogenic Prospect Hill virus (PHV) is stable and not proteasomally degraded. We determined that the signals which direct NY-1V G1 tail degradation are present in a hydrophobic region within the C-terminal 30 residues of the protein. In contrast to that of PHV, the NY-1V hydrophobic domain directs the proteasomal degradation of green fluorescent protein and constitutes an autonomous degradation signal, or ""degron,"" within the NY-1V G1 tail. Replacing 4 noncontiguous residues of the NY-1V G1 tail with residues present in the stable PHV G1 tail resulted in a NY-1V G1 tail that was not degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, changing a different but overlapping set of 4 PHV residues to corresponding NY-1V residues directed proteasomal degradation of the PHV G1 tail. The G1 tails of pathogenic, but not nonpathogenic, hantaviruses contain intervening hydrophilic residues within the C-terminal hydrophobic domain, and amino acid substitutions that alter the stability or degradation of NY-1V or PHV G1 tails result from removing or adding intervening hydrophilic residues. Our results identify residues that selectively direct the proteasomal degradation of pathogenic hantavirus G1 tails. Although a role for the proteasomal degradation of the G1 tail in HPS or HFRS is unclear, these findings link G1 tail degradation to viral pathogenesis and suggest that degrons within hantavirus G1 tails are potential virulence determinants.","['Sen N', 'Sen A', 'Mackow ER']",2007,81,8,J Virol,"Sen N, et al.

17266922,The expression and genetic immunization of chimeric fragment of Hantaan virus M and S segments.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized by severe symptoms and high mortality, is caused by hantavirus. There are still no effective prophylactic vaccines directed to HFRS until now. In this research, we fused expressed G2 fragment of M segment and 0.7kb fragment of S segment. We expect it could be a candidate vaccine. Chimeric gene G2S0.7 was first expressed in prokaryotic expression system pGEX-4T. After inducing expressed fusion proteins, GST-G2S0.7 was induced and its molecular weight was about 100kDa. Meanwhile, the fusion protein kept the activity of its parental proteins. Further, BALB/c mice were vaccinated by the chimeric gene. ELISA, cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. Lymphocyte proliferation assay was used to detect the cellular immune response. The results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously evoke specific antibody against nucleocapsid protein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP). And the immunized mice of every group elicited neutralizing antibodies with different titers. But the titers were low. Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of chimeric gene to NP and GP were significantly higher than that of control. It suggested that the chimeric gene of Hantaan virus containing G2 fragment of M segment and 0.7kb fragment of S segment could directly elicit specific anti-Hantaan virus humoral and cellular immune response in BALB/c mice.","['Zhang FL', 'Wu XA', 'Luo W', 'Bai WT', 'Liu Y', 'Yan Y', 'Wang HT', 'Xu ZK']",2007,354,4,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Zhang FL, et al.

17259735,Morphological characterization of hantavirus HV114 by electron microscopy.,"OBJECTIVE: This study was sought to investigate the propagation and morphogenesis of a new strain of hantavirus, HV114.
METHODS: The urine of patient with epidemic hemorrhagic fever was inoculated to Vero E6 cells for the virus isolation. Electron microscopy was used to observe the isolated virus, HV114 and the variation of infected Vero E6 cells.
RESULTS: According to our observations, the size (90-120 nm) of HV114 is smaller than that reported previously as 110- 160 nm. While ribosome-like particles associated with virions originating from rodent hantaviruses were not observed in HV114, virion budding was exhibited. It suggests that the dumbbell-shaped particles may generated from the process of virion budding. The budding processes suggest that there are several sites for HV114 assembly and maturation, including the host endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi compartment and the host plasma membranes.
CONCLUSIONS: The HV114 isolated from the urine of the patient is differed from other hantaviruses which were isolated from rat organs. HV114 might undergo changes during the viral transmission process from rodents to humans.","['Xu F', 'Yang Z', 'Wang L', 'Lee YL', 'Yang CC', 'Xiao SY', 'Xiao H', 'Wen L']",2007,50,3,Intervirology,"Xu F, et al.

The nucleocapsid protein of hantaviruses encapsidates viral genomic RNA and associates with transcription and replication complexes. Both the amino and carboxy termini of the nucleocapsid protein had been predicted to form trimers prior to the formation of the ribonucleoprotein. Crystal structures of amino-terminal fragments of the nucleocapsid protein showed the formation of intramolecular antiparallel coiled coils, but not intermolecular trimers.

17188760,Evaluation of the efficacy of disinfectants against Puumala hantavirus by real-time RT-PCR.,"Puumala virus, a hantavirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, causes a human disease known as nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The implementation of effective decontamination procedures is critical in hantavirus research to minimize the risk of personnel exposure. This study investigated the efficacy of Clidox((R)), Dettol((R)), ethanol, Halamid-d((R)), peracetic acid, sodium hypochloride and Virkon((R))S for inactivating Puumala virus. A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify Puumala virus before and after treatment with these products. Inactivation of Puumala virus was effective after 10min with all products except ethanol. Inactivation with absolute ethanol was effective only after 30min. Using the qRT-PCR method, this study has shown that the commercially available products Clidox((R)), Halamid-d((R)) and Virkon((R))S in particular represent a rapid and safe way to decontaminate surfaces with possible Puumala virus contamination. These products can be used in solutions of 1-2%, with contact times greater than 10min, for inactivating effectively Puumala virus.","['Maes P', 'Li S', 'Verbeeck J', 'Keyaerts E', 'Clement J', 'Van Ranst M']",2007,141,1,J Virol Methods,"Maes P, et al.

17161316,Andes Hantavirus as possible cause of disease in travellers to South America.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses in Europe and Asia cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and epidemic nephritis (mortality rate <1-15%). New strains of Hantaviruses cause Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) from Canada to South America. Andes virus mortality rate is about 30% in Chile.
METHOD: Clinical charts of 54 patients were reviewed.
RESULTS: Inhalation of aerosolized urine, faeces or saliva of rodents is the principal cause of infection. The incubation period is between 8 and 43 days. The main prodromal symptoms are: myalgias, fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, dyspnoea, petechiae and coughing. After the 4th day pulmonary oedema, hypotension and renal failure appear. Haemorrhagic disorders may occur. The first laboratory tests presenting alterations are: haemoconcentration, leukocytosis, low platelet count <150 micro/L, and presence of immunoblasts. The treatment is supportive: mechanical ventilation, vasopressor drugs, haemofiltration or haemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There is no specific treatment for HPS. Preventive measures must be empathised.
CONCLUSION: The principal risk factors for tourists are: accommodation in abandoned or closed up facilities; failure to use indicated pathways when walking in forests; camping outside recommended areas; drinking water from natural sources and fishing in risk areas. The risk of infection for foreign tourists in Chile is low.","['Castillo C', 'Nicklas C', 'Mardones J', 'Ossa G']",2007,5,1,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Castillo C, et al.

17133547,Rapid immunochromatographic test for hantavirus andes contrasted with capture-IgM ELISA for detection of Andes-specific IgM antibodies.,"Hantavirus is associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The clinical diagnosis of hantavirus infections has been confirmed routinely by the immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A rapid and easy diagnostic test for hantavirus infection is required. A new immunochromatographic assay for hantavirus, POC-PUU, useful for the diagnosis of epidemic nephrophaty associated with hantavirus Puumala in Europe, was evaluated in Chile. This test is based on recombinant N-protein of hantavirus Puumala, and cross-reacts with other hantaviruses. Eighty human sera were selected at random from patients from Southern Chile who were suspected with HPS. The hantavirus capture-IgM ELISA was compared with a commercially available POC-PUU test (POC PUUMALA, Reagena Ltd., Toivala, Finland). The test sensitivity and specificity of the POC-PUU test were 97 and 90%, respectively. It is important to note that although the test is not specific for Andes virus the sensitivity and specificity were above 90%, which indicates good reactivity to the Puumala nucleoprotein antigen. As this test is cost-effective, with a high negative value, rapid and easy to carry out, specialized personnel are not necessary, nor does it require specialized equipment. Its usefulness for diagnosis is important in hospitals far from reference centers and areas with a high incidence of HPS cases.","['Navarrete M', 'Barrera C', 'Zaror L', 'Otth C']",2007,79,1,J Med Virol,"Navarrete M, et al.

The antibody reactivity towards the NPs, and deleted or truncated variants thereof, were studied to localise and investigate the major polyclonal B-cell epitopes. Our findings clearly show that the antibody reactivity in each immunised mouse is unique, not only in a quantitative respect (titers) but also in cross-reactivity and most likely also in the epitope specificity.

17020633,A high frequency resonance in the responses of retinal ganglion cells to rapidly modulated stimuli: a computer model.,"Brisk Y-type ganglion cells in the cat retina exhibit a high frequency resonance (HFR) in their responses to large, rapidly modulated stimuli. We used a computer model to test whether negative feedback mediated by axon-bearing amacrine cells onto ganglion cells could account for the experimentally observed properties of HFRs. Temporal modulation transfer functions (tMTFs) recorded from model ganglion cells exhibited HFR peaks whose amplitude, width, and locations were qualitatively consistent with experimental data. Moreover, the wide spatial distribution of axon-mediated feedback accounted for the observed increase in HFR amplitude with stimulus size. Model phase plots were qualitatively similar to those recorded from Y ganglion cells, including an anomalous phase advance that in our model coincided with the amplification of low-order harmonics that overlapped the HFR peak. When axon-mediated feedback in the model was directed primarily to bipolar cells, whose synaptic output was graded, or else when the model was replaced with a simple cascade of linear filters, it was possible to produce large HFR peaks but the region of anomalous phase advance was always eliminated, suggesting the critical involvement of strongly non-linear feedback loops. To investigate whether HFRs might contribute to visual processing, we simulated high frequency ocular tremor by rapidly modulating a naturalistic image. Visual signals riding on top of the imposed jitter conveyed an enhanced representation of large objects. We conclude that by amplifying responses to ocular tremor, HFRs may selectively enhance the processing of large image features.","['Miller JA', 'Denning KS', 'George JS', 'Marshak DW', 'Kenyon GT']",2006,23,5,Vis Neurosci,"Miller JA, et al.

Serum samples from nine HFRS patients were included in the study. Rodents study sites were selected with regard to the HFRS cases. Partial S segment sequences were recovered from all nine patients and partial M segment sequences could be recovered from seven. Partial S and M segments sequences were also recovered from five C. glareouls captured at three different study sites. The sequences from Slovenian clinical specimens and rodent tissue samples belonged to the PUUV genotype and formed a distinct genetic lineage of PUUV. Human and rodent PUUV sequences located in the closest proximity to each other on the phylogenetic trees suggest genetic links between the human cases and the hantaviral strains circulating in natural foci of this zoonotic infection.

16977974,[The new-world hantaviruses. Ecology and epidemiology of an emerging virus in Latin America].,"The hantaviruses are a group of emerging rodent-borne pathogens (family Bunyaviridae; Genus Hantavirus) that are etiologic agents for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HFRS is associated with rodents of the family Muridae, subfamilies Murinae and Arvicolinae; HPS is associated with rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae. Since the identification of HCPS in USA in 1993, a large number of cases of HPS and an increasing number of hantaviruses and rodent reservoir hosts have been identified in Central and South America. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated important differences in frequency of infection with hantaviruses in both human and rodent host populations. Antibody prevalences in rodent and human populations may vary from less than 1% to more than 40%. Currently, more than 1500 cases of HCPS have been reported and more than 15 genetically distinct variants of hantaviruses, all associated with sigmodontine rodents, have been identified throughout the Americas. Several characteristics distinguish Latin American HCPS cases from the classical HCPS described for the first time in the USA. These include a variation in severity of disease from moderate and self-limiting to severe, the demonstration of person-to-person transmission, and a somewhat higher incidence of extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in the South American form of HCPS. Nevertheless, our understanding of hantaviruses in the Americas is still far from complete. The factors involved in the dynamics of these viruses in nature, their establishment and transmission within host populations and from hosts to humans, and the variable pathology of these viruses in humans are complex. It is likely that more hantaviruses will be described in the future, and much more data will be required in order to describe the diversity and evolution of this group of pathogens. Latin America, as the center of diversity for Sigmodontine rodents and their hantaviruses is presented with the unique opportunity as well as the challenge of being center stage for continued studies of the dynamics of hantaviruses in natural host populations and the links of host and virus to human populations.","['Puerta H', 'Cantillo C', 'Mills J', 'Hjelle B', 'Salazar-Bravo J', 'Mattar S']",2006,66,4,Medicina (B Aires),"Puerta H, et al.

Severe forms of this infection are typical for the Far East of Russia, countries of South-East Asia and especially for the American continent. The lethality from HFRS amounts to 15-50%. The main natural carriers and keepers of HFRS stimulus are various mouse-type rodents. In Russia besides well-studied natural focuses on the Far East, Siberia, Ural, Povolge other active HFRS focuses were determined not long ago (Moscow, Orel, Lipetsk, Tula and Voronezh regions, the territory of Big Sochi). A man is infected by an aerosol, forming during drying up of rodents' urine, feces, saliva containing HFRS virus. Vaccinal prevention of HFRS in Russia hasn't yet been worked out. Ribavirin is the most effective in the treatment for HFRS. The means of prevention of population and servicemen must exclude their contact with rodents both in natural conditions and in populated areas.","['Liashchenko NI', 'Grabarev PA', 'Lukin EP']",2006,327,7,Voen Med Zh,"Liashchenko NI, et al.

16973572,The pathogenic NY-1 hantavirus G1 cytoplasmic tail inhibits RIG-I- and TBK-1-directed interferon responses.,"Hantaviruses cause two diseases with prominent vascular permeability defects, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. All hantaviruses infect human endothelial cells, although it is unclear what differentiates pathogenic from nonpathogenic hantaviruses. We observed dramatic differences in interferon-specific transcriptional responses between pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses at 1 day postinfection, suggesting that hantavirus pathogenesis may in part be determined by viral regulation of cellular interferon responses. In contrast to pathogenic NY-1 virus (NY-1V) and Hantaan virus (HTNV), nonpathogenic Prospect Hill virus (PHV) elicits early interferon responses following infection of human endothelial cells. We determined that PHV replication is blocked in human endothelial cells and that RNA and protein synthesis by PHV, but not NY-1V or HTNV, is inhibited at 2 to 4 days postinfection. The addition of antibodies to beta interferon (IFN-beta) blocked interferon-directed MxA induction by >90% and demonstrated that hantavirus infection induces the secretion of IFN-beta from endothelial cells. Coinfecting endothelial cells with NY-1V and PHV resulted in a 60% decrease in the induction of interferon-responsive MxA transcripts by PHV and further suggested the potential for NY-1V to regulate early IFN responses. Expression of the NY-1V G1 cytoplasmic tail inhibited by >90% RIG-I- and downstream TBK-1-directed transcription from interferon-stimulated response elements or beta-interferon promoters in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of the NY-1V nucleocapsid or PHV G1 tail had no effect on RIG-I- or TBK-1-directed transcriptional responses. Further, neither the NY-1V nor PHV G1 tails inhibited transcriptional responses directed by a constitutively active form of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3 5D), and IRF-3 is a direct target of TBK-1 phosphorylation. These findings indicate that the pathogenic NY-1V G1 protein regulates cellular IFN responses upstream of IRF-3 phosphorylation at the level of the TBK-1 complex. These findings further suggest that the G1 cytoplasmic tail contains a virulence element which determines the ability of hantaviruses to bypass innate cellular immune responses and delineates a mechanism for pathogenic hantaviruses to successfully replicate within human endothelial cells.","['Alff PJ', 'Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Gorbunova E', 'Endriss K', 'Chong Y', 'Geimonen E', 'Sen N', 'Reich NC', 'Mackow ER']",2006,80,19,J Virol,"Alff PJ, et al.

16972031,Regions of importance for interaction of puumala virus nucleocapsid subunits.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus that causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in northern and central Europe, and in large parts of Russia. The nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded by hantaviruses plays an important role in the life-cycle of these viruses, and one important function for the N-protein is to oligomerize, surround and protect the viral RNAs. We have identified amino- and carboxy-terminal regions involved in PUUV N-N interactions, which comprise amino acids 100-120 and 330-405. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that the amino-terminus of the N-protein of hantaviruses holds a more regulatory function regarding N-N interactions, while conserved residues in the carboxy-terminal region, F335 together with F336 and W392, in concert with Y388 and/or F400 seems to play a more critical role in the PUUV N-N formation. This study provides evidence that the amino-terminal regions involved in the N-N interaction of Puumala virus are similar to those reported for Seoul virus (SEOV) and to some extent Hantaan virus (HTNV), even though the identity between PUUV N and SEOV/HTNV N is markedly lower than between PUUV N and Tula virus (TULV) N or Sin Nombre virus (SNV) N.","['Lindgren L', 'Lindkvist M', 'Overby A', 'Ahlm C', 'Bucht G', 'Holmström A']",2006,33,2,Virus Genes,"Lindgren L, et al.

We investigated the early predictive markers for oliguric ARF in HFRS patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of 61 patients with HFRS between 2000 and 2004. These patients were categorized into either oliguric or non-oliguric ARF groups according to their urine output (<400 ml/24 h). The clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 61 patients, 24 (39.3%) were classified as oliguric ARF and 37 (60.7%) as non-oliguric ARF. The peak serum Cr was 10.8 (IQR 9.1-12.4) mg/dl in oliguric ARF and 4.4 (IQR 3.1-6.0) mg/dl in non-oliguric ARF (p<0.001). The risk for developing oliguric ARF significantly increased in the cases with leukocyte count (> or =14 x 10(9)/L, aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.9; p=0.039), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (> or =110 U/L, aOR 11.0, 95% CI 2.1-57.9; p=0.005) and the presence of microscopic haematuria (> or =5/HPF, aOR 9.2, 95% CI 1.4-60.3; p=0.021) at the time of admission.
CONCLUSION: The leukocyte count, level of aspartate aminotransferase and microscopic haematuria at admission would be useful to predict for the subsequent development of oliguric ARF in HFRS.","['Kim YK', 'Lee SC', 'Kim C', 'Heo ST', 'Choi C', 'Kim JM']",2007,54,4,J Infect,"Kim YK, et al.

16847107,Prolonged survival of Puumala hantavirus outside the host: evidence for indirect transmission via the environment.,"The capability of rodent-borne viruses to survive outside the host is critical for the transmission dynamics within rodent populations and to humans. The transmission of Puumala virus (PUUV) in colonized bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) was investigated and additional longevity studies in cell culture with PUUV and Tula (TULV) hantaviruses were performed. Wild-type PUUV excreted by experimentally infected donor bank voles was shown to be transmitted indirectly between rodents through contaminated beddings, and maintained its infectivity to recipient voles at room temperature for 12-15 days. In cell culture supernatants, PUUV and TULV remained infectious for 5-11 days at room temperature and up to 18 days at 4 degrees C, but were inactivated after 24 h at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, a fraction of dried virus was still infectious after 1 h at 56 degrees C. These results demonstrated that hantavirus transmission does not require direct contact between rodents, or between rodents and humans, and that the indirect transmission of PUUV through contaminated environment takes place among the rodents for a prolonged period of time. The results also have implications for safety recommendations for work with hantaviruses and for preventive measures.","['Kallio ER', 'Klingström J', 'Gustafsson E', 'Manni T', 'Vaheri A', 'Henttonen H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Lundkvist Å']",2006,87,Pt 8,J Gen Virol,"Kallio ER, et al.

Model I was a linear time series with normally distributed residuals; model II was a generalized linear model with Poisson-distributed residuals and a log link; and model III was a generalized additive model with the same distributional features as model II. Model I was fitted using least squares whereas models II and III were fitted using maximum likelihood. The results show that the correlations between the HFRS incidence and the independent variables measured (i.e. difference in water level, autumn crop production and density of Apodemus agrarius) ranged from -0.40 to 0.89. The HFRS incidence was positively associated with density of A. agrarius and crop production, but was inversely associated with difference in water level.

METHODS: Rodents were collected in a large-scale railway station and a produce market with 'trap nights' method from April to May, 2004. The IgG reacting sera to HV antigen were detected using ELISA. The partial M and S segment of HV from captured rodent lung samples were amplified with RT-PCR. The PCR products were purified and sequenced. BLAST program was then used to perform on nucleotide pairwise alignment with all available sequence in GenBank. The alignment of the multiply nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences, together with phylogenetic analysis were completed with DNASTAR software.
RESULTS: The average population density was 3.49% (24/690). The overall seroprevalence of HV infection was 8.3% (2/24). RT-PCR positive rates were 8.3% (2/24). The nucleotide sequences of 356 bp region (1958 - 2313) of M segment obtained from 2 samples were all identified to Seoul virus (SEOV), with 7.6% heterogeneity. The dc501 strain from railway station was closely related to SD227 and Hebei4 from Shandong and Hebei provinces respectively. BjFT01 strain from the farm product market had more special nucleotide transitional mutations than other known SEOV from Beijing in GenBank. This strain, together with known HN71 from Hainan province, K24-E7 from Zhejiang province, L99 from Jiangxi province and R22 from Henan province, represented a monophylogentic linkage.
CONCLUSION: The higher HV prevalence of rodents in transportation center was the potential and important risk for HFRS epidemic in Beijing. The increasing prevalence of M. musculus should call for attention. It was possible that SEOV in Beijing was imported by infected rodents through vehicles from other provinces.","['Jiang JF', 'Wu XM', 'Wang RM', 'Zuo SQ', 'Xu WC', 'Guo TY', 'Chen LQ', 'Cao WC']",2006,27,2,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Jiang JF, et al.

16721853,Characterization of truncated hantavirus nucleocapsid proteins and their application for serotyping.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a fulminant infectious disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage, renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia. Hantaviruses associated with this belong to different serotypes: Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Dobrava/Belgrade (DOB), and Puumala (PUU). The first two, HTN and SEO, are endemic in China. To investigate the epidemiology of HFRS and virus transmission in China, we constructed prokaryotic plasmids encoding truncated recombinant HTN and SEO nucleocapsid proteins (NPs), which lacked 154 amino acid (aa), 99 aa, or 49 aa in the N-terminal region, respectively. After expression, the truncated rNPs were tested as serotyping antigens, particularly for use in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, 68 acute and 52 convalescent sera were collected from HFRS patients from Harbin, Lantian, and Kaifeng regions in China in 2004, which had hantavirus specific antibodies by IFA. A neutralization test was used to differentiate these, which showed that 73 were due to HTN infection, 33 to SEO infection, and 14 undetermined. By ELISA, the truncated rNPs, that lacked 99 (rNP100) or 49 (rNP50) N-terminal amino acids of the NPs of HTN and SEO, were able to differentiate HTNV and SEOV-specific immune sera, but the rNP155 could not. Particularly, the ELISAs based on the rNP50s had a result comparable to PRNT. Thus, the rNP50 is recommended as efficient serotyping antigen for hantavirus infection diagnosis by ELISA.","['Li G', 'Pan L', 'Mou D', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Ren J', 'Wang P', 'Zhang Y', 'Jia Z', 'Huang C', 'Sun Y', 'Yang W', 'Xiao SY', 'Bai X']",2006,78,7,J Med Virol,"Li G, et al.

Serological and genetic investigations revealed that Puumala virus (PUUV) is dominant in the local population of bank voles. Partial PUUV S segment nucleotide sequences originating from bank voles at four different trapping sites in Lower Bavaria showed a low divergence (up to 3.1%). This is contrasted by a nucleotide sequence divergence of 14-16% to PUUV strains detected in Belgium, France, Slovakia or North-Western Germany.

16641933,Ten-year prognosis of Puumala hantavirus-induced acute interstitial nephritis.,"Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus. Its long-term prognosis is considered favorable. There are, however, some reports about subsequent hypertension, glomerular hyperfiltration, and proteinuria after previous hantavirus infection. Therefore, we studied 36 patients 5 and 10 years after acute NE, with 29 seronegative controls. Office blood pressure, ambulatory 24-h blood pressure (ABP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and proteinuria were examined. Hypertensive subjects were defined as those patients having increased ambulatory or office blood pressure, or receiving antihypertensive therapy. Office blood pressure was used to define hypertension only if ABP was not determined. At 5 years, the prevalence of hypertension was higher among NE patients than in controls (50 vs 21%, P=0.020). At 10 years, the difference between the groups was no more significant (39 vs 17%, P=0.098). Five years after NE, patients showed higher GFR (121+/-19 vs 109+/-16 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P=0.012) and urinary protein excretion (0.19 g/day, range 0.12-0.38 vs 0.14 g/day, range 0.09-0.24, P=<0.001) than controls. At 10 years, there were no more differences in GFR or protein excretion between the groups (GFR: 113+/-20 vs 108+/-17 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P=0.370; proteinuria: 0.14 g/day, range 0.07-0.24 vs 0.13 g/day, range 0.06-0.31, P=0.610).

16638156,Spatial analysis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in many provinces with high incidence in mainland China, although integrated intervention measures including rodent control, environment management and vaccination have been implemented for over ten years. In this study, we conducted a geographic information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis on distribution of HFRS cases for the whole country with an objective to inform priority areas for public health planning and resource allocation.
METHODS: Annualized average incidence at a county level was calculated using HFRS cases reported during 1994-1998 in mainland China. GIS-based spatial analyses were conducted to detect spatial autocorrelation and clusters of HFRS incidence at the county level throughout the country.
RESULTS: Spatial distribution of HFRS cases in mainland China from 1994 to 1998 was mapped at county level in the aspects of crude incidence, excess hazard and spatial smoothed incidence. The spatial distribution of HFRS cases was nonrandom and clustered with a Moran's I = 0.5044 (p = 0.001). Spatial cluster analyses suggested that 26 and 39 areas were at increased risks of HFRS (p < 0.01) with maximum spatial cluster sizes of < or = 20% and < or = 10% of the total population, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The application of GIS, together with spatial statistical techniques, provide a means to quantify explicit HFRS risks and to further identify environmental factors responsible for the increasing disease risks. We demonstrate a new perspective of integrating such spatial analysis tools into the epidemiologic study and risk assessment of HFRS.","['Fang L', 'Yan L', 'Liang S', 'de Vlas SJ', 'Feng D', 'Han X', 'Zhao W', 'Xu B', 'Bian L', 'Yang H', 'Gong P', 'Richardus JH', 'Cao W']",2006,6,,BMC Infect Dis,"Fang L, et al.

The status of Th1, Th2, Tc1 and Tc2 subsets in PBMC was evaluated by intracellular cytokine staining and FCM. Compared to controls, the expression of membrane bound FasL and TRAIL was up-regulated on surface of PBMC isolated from the HFRS patients, particularly on CD8+ T lymphocytes. The levels of TNF-alpha, sFasL and sTRAIL in plasma from the HFRS patients in the acute phase increase 4.7-fold, 6.0-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, over those from the healthy donors. The percentage of Th1, Tc1 and Tc2 subsets in PBMC from the patients also increased significantly compared with those from healthy donors. These results indicate that dynamic changes occurred in both the membrane bound and soluble forms of apoptosis-inducing ligands (FasL, TRAIL and TNF-alpha) and proportions of Th1 and CTL in HFRS patients increased. Both factors may play an important role in the etiology of Hantaan virus infection in humans.","['Liu JM', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu ZW', 'Ouyang WM', 'Wang JP', 'Liu XS', 'Cao YX', 'Li Q', 'Fang L', 'Zhuang R', 'Yang AG', 'Jin BQ']",2006,119,3,Clin Immunol,"Liu JM, et al.

By analyzing a great body of data obtained in the Saratov Region in 1982-2000, it has been established that the frequency of manifestations of necrophagy depends on many factors, the most important of which are a season, the size (density) of populations of small mammals, their species composition and the type of biotopes inhabited by these animals. Necrophagy is ascertained to be of great importance in HFRS foci as one of the alimentary routes of infection transmission in the parasitic systems.

Mortality from HFRS varies between hantaviruses; Hantaan and Dobrava show the highest, Seoul intermediate, and Puumala low mortality. Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5,000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18-26 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5,000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS-/- mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia.

16417427,Habitat factors associated with bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and concomitant hantavirus in northern Sweden.,"Puumala virus (PUUV), genus hantavirus, causes nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. In this study, bank voles, the natural reservoir of PUUV, were captured at locations of previous human PUUV exposure and paired controls within a region of high incidence in northern Sweden. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on the abundance of bank voles and the occurrence of PUUV. The total number of voles and the number of PUUV-infected voles did not differ between locations of previous human PUUV exposure and paired controls. The number of bank voles expressing antibodies to PUUV infection increased linearly with total bank vole abundance implying density independent transmission. Using principal component and partial correlation analysis, we found that particular environmental characteristics associated with old-growth moist forests (i.e., those dominated by Alectoria spp., Picea abies, fallen wood, and Vaccinium myrtillus) were also associated with increased abundance of bank vole and hence the number of PUUV-infected bank voles, whereas there were no correlations with factors associated with dry environments (i.e., Pinus sylvestris and V. vitis-idea). This suggests that circulation and persistence of PUUV within bank vole populations was influenced by habitat factors. Future modeling of risk of exposure to hantavirus and transmission of PUUV within vole populations should include the influence of these factors.","['Olsson GE', 'White N', 'Hjältén J', 'Ahlm C']",2005,5,4,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Olsson GE, et al.

METHODS: The expression of CD178 and HLA-DR on T cell subsets in peripheral blood of patients with HFRS and their dynamic changes were detected by Flow cytometry.
RESULTS: CD4+ CD178+ and CD8+ CD178+ T lymphocytes both in fever and polyuria phases were significantly higher than those in normal controls, while there was no significant difference between the both phases of HFRS (P > 0.05). CD178 expression on CD4+ HLA-DR+ and CD8+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes were significantly higher than those in normal controls (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between CD4+ HLA-DR+ and CD8+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: CD178 was expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, but mainly on CD8+ T cell subsets both in early stage and in later stage in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) might kill target cells infected by hantavirus (HV) and eliminate HV via cell apoptosis mediated by CD178 in early stage of HFRS.

The most prevalent and lethal hantaviruses associated with HFRS and HPS are Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Andes virus (ANDV), respectively. Here, we constructed a DNA vaccine plasmid (pWRG/HA-M) that contains both the HTNV and ANDV M gene segments. Rhesus macaques vaccinated with pWRG/HA-M produced antibodies that bound the M gene products (i.e., G1 and G2 glycoproteins), and neutralized both HTNV and ANDV. Neutralizing antibody titers elicited by the dual-immunogen pWRG/HA-M, or single-immunogen plasmids expressing only the HTNV or ANDV glycoproteins, increased rapidly to high levels after a booster vaccination administered 1-2 years after the initial vaccination series. Memory responses elicited by this long-range boost exhibited an increased breadth of cross-neutralizing activity relative to the primary response. This is the first time that hantavirus M gene-based DNA vaccines have been shown to elicit a potent memory response, and to elicit antibody responses that neutralize viruses that cause both HFRS and HPS.","['Hooper JW', 'Custer DM', 'Smith J', 'Wahl-Jensen V']",2006,347,1,Virology,"Hooper JW, et al.

Found primarily in mountainous areas, the Korean field mouse (A. peninsulae) is the second-most dominant field rodent species found throughout Korea. A new hantavirus, designated Soochong (SOO), was isolated in Vero E6 cells from four A. peninsulae captured in August 1997 at Mt. Gyebang in Hongcheon-gun, Mt.

The entire S, M, and L genomic segments of SOO virus, amplified by RT-PCR from lung tissues of seropositive A. peninsulae and from virus-infected Vero E6 cells, diverged from HTN virus (strain 76-118) by 15.6%, 22.8%, and 21.7% at the nucleotide level and 3.5%, 9.5%, and 4.6% at the amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, using the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, indicated that SOO virus was distinct from A. agrarius-borne HTN virus. SOO virus shared a common ancestry with Amur virus from Far East Russia, as well as with H5 and B78 hantaviruses, previously isolated from HFRS patients in China.

According to this study, the diameter of derived complex is much smaller, compared with the diameter of glomerulus.

The assay was designed to detect specifically the strains from a phylogenetic cluster of CCHFV which encompasses the known CCHFV strains circulating in the Balkan region. The detection system was tested using CCHFV strain Kosovo Hoti, clinical serum samples and ticks. The real-time assay described is rapid, specific and sensitive. Since the Balkan peninsula is also an endemic region for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), this method is suggested as convenient for early differential diagnosis of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever patients.","['Duh D', 'Saksida A', 'Petrovec M', 'Dedushaj I', 'Avsic-Zupanc T']",2006,133,2,J Virol Methods,"Duh D, et al.

16334736,[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Bosnia and Herzegovina--history review till 1990].,"The first data on a disease that was clinically similar to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, date from 1952. Fifteen years later, an outbreak in the territory of Bosanska Krajina, turned to a great HFRS outbreak in the Sarajevo area. The outbreak was considered as the largest HFRS outbreak in Eastern Europe ever described. After that time, HFRS occurred mostly sporadically, or as small epidemics in 1970, 1975 and 1986. A new large epidemic was registered in 1989, again mostly affecting the population of the Sarajevo area. According to different data sources, 452 HFRS patients, 26 of them with lethal outcome, were recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, HFRS was recorded in 11 soldiers who were on military service in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the results of several field studies, it appears justifiable to assume that the true prevalence of the disease was higher than diagnosed and reported. The reason was probably our failure to recognize HFRS due to the variable clinical manifestation and significantly greater frequency of mild or atypical forms than of the typical form of the disease. This is supported by the fact that inapparent infections were proven in approximately 5% of the examined healthy persons living close to the focal areas. The disease and inapparent infection were mostly observed in the groups of active population. The infections were most common in rural regions among foresters and farmers. Appodemus flavicollis was the main reservoir of hantaviruses in Bosnia and Herzegovina till 1990, and transmission was mainly by aerosol in the conditions of fresh contamination of the environment with excretions and secretions of small mammals. The intensity of the epidemic process is directly correlated with the intensity of the epizootic process as well as with the extent of human population exposure.","['Ler Z', 'Cavaljuga S', 'Markotić A']",2005,59,4,Acta Med Croatica,"Ler Z, et al.

This electron microscopy study of peritubular capillaries was done on kidney biopsies performed on patients with conditions involving primarily glomeruli (diabetic glomerulopathy (23), Alport syndrome (37)) or causing more or less isolated changes of nephron structures outside the glomeruli (Balkan endemic nephropathy (15) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (19)). The aim was to explore the ultrastructural features of the PCBM. In patients with diabetic glomerulopathy, the PCBM was homogeneous, with a width ranging from normal to evidently increased (55-355 nm). In patients with Alport syndrome, the PCBM was homogeneous, with no substantial splitting or prominent thickening. Mean thickness varied between 80 (85-100) nm in children and 120 (46-250) nm in adults. Mean PCBM thickness in patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy was 209 (90-1270) nm. The thickened PCBM was also often split. In patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, peritubular capillaries and medular vasa recta were generally extremely congested and focally ruptured, and their basal lamina showed prevailing thinning and focal discontinuities.","['Hvala A', 'Ferluga D', 'Rott T', 'Kobenter T', 'Koselj-Kajtna M', 'Trnacević S']",2005,29,6,Ultrastruct Pathol,"Hvala A, et al.

16306571,Induction of innate immune response genes by Sin Nombre hantavirus does not require viral replication.,"Maladaptive immune responses are considered to be important factors in the pathogenesis of the two diseases caused by hantaviruses, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). While the intensity of adaptive antiviral T-cell responses seems to correlate with the severity of HCPS, there is increasing evidence that innate antiviral responses by endothelial cells, the native targets for hantavirus infection in vivo, are induced within hours of exposure to infectious hantaviruses. To investigate early events in the innate response to Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the principal etiologic agent of HCPS in North America, we treated human endothelial cells with live virus, or virus subjected to inactivation by UV irradiation at minimal doses required to inhibit replication, and assayed host expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) by microarray and reverse transcription-PCR. We show herein that a variety of ISG are induced between 4 and 24 h after exposure to both live and killed virus. The levels of such induction at early time points (before 24 h) were generally higher in cells treated with SNV particles that had been killed by exposure to UV irradiation. Additionally, SNV exposed to increasing doses of UV irradiation induced ISG better than live virus despite increased disruption of viral RNA integrity. However, SNV replication was required for continued ISG overexpression by 3 days posttreatment. These results suggest that hantavirus particles may themselves be capable of early induction of ISG and that ongoing production of viral particles during infection could contribute to the pathogenic process.","['Prescott J', 'Ye C', 'Sen G', 'Hjelle B']",2005,79,24,J Virol,"Prescott J, et al.

These cells are involved in distribution and persistence of viruses in the organism and also influence the regulation of immune reactions. The functional and enzymatic activities of macrophages infected with an agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were analyzed for the first time. This disease is caused by a virus of the Hantavirus genus, the Bunyaviridae family. Activities of ectoenzymes 5 -nucleotidase and ATPase of the plasma membrane of the hantavirus-infected macrophages decreased along with the antigen accumulation in the infected cells. The contact of phagocytes with hantavirus resulted in activation in the cells of the oxygen-dependent metabolism and NO-synthase. The NO-synthase-dependent system of the infected macrophages was activated earlier than their oxygen-dependent system. The intracellular contents of acid and alkaline phosphatases increased within the first hours after the infection. The bactericidal activity of the hantavirus-infected macrophages relatively to Staphylococcus aureus increased during the specific antigen accumulation in the phagocytes. Thus, the infection of macrophages with hantavirus was associated with intracellular metabolic changes.","['Plekhova NG', 'Somova LM', 'Slonova RA', 'Companets GG', ""Luk'yanova VV"", 'Yakubovich NV']",2005,70,9,Biochemistry (Mosc),"Plekhova NG, et al.

METHODS: T lymphocyte epitopes and frequencies of epitope-specific T cells were determined by ELISPOT using PBMCs from HFRS patients stimulated by individual or mixture of overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the amino acid sequence of HTNV-NP.
RESULTS: Out of 10 peptide mixtures, 8 elicited strong HTNV-NP-specific responses in 18 of 47 HFRS patients, and the T cell response was found at early stage of HFRS. Moreover, 17 HTNV-NP-specific T lymphocyte epitopes were identified in 11 patients, and most epitopes were clustered near the center of NP in linear structure. Among them, 14 T lymphocyte epitopes were described for the first time.

16251777,A pilot study for serological evidence of hantavirus infection in human population in south India.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses of the family Bunyaviridae that have been identified as aetiological agents of two human diseases, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). There are no reports of hantavirus infections in humans from India, hence this pilot study was undertaken to provide the serological evidence of hantavirus infections in humans in south India.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from individuals with acute febrile illness and from voluntary blood donors, majority of whom were from south India. Serum samples were tested for anti-hantavirus IgM using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Samples found positive by the EIA were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using slides coated with Seoul virus (SEOV) infected cells as substrate.
RESULTS: Of the 152 serum samples from individuals with pyrexic illness, 23 (14.7%) were positive for anti-hantavirus IgM by EIA. In contrast, only 5.7 per cent of healthy blood donors were positive by this assay. Eighteen of the 22 (82%) EIA-positive samples from patients were positive by the IFA assay. In contrast, only 2 of the 5 (40%) blood donor EIA positive samples were positive in the IFA assay.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: The finding of this study indicated the possible presence of hantavirus infections in the human population of India presenting both as asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Further studies need to be done to confirm the findings on a larger sample using molecular techniques.","['Chandy S', 'Mitra S', 'Sathish N', 'Vijayakumar TS', 'Abraham OC', 'Jesudason MV', 'Abraham P', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Sridharan G']",2005,122,3,Indian J Med Res,"Chandy S, et al.

PUUV was shown to be dominant pathogen during the last HFRS outbreak in Croatia in 2002. We focused our research on two newly discovered localities (Okucani and Nova Gradiska) with a high number of reported HFRS cases and a significant increase in rodent population. PUUV infection was verified in 84.2% of patients at this region during the 2002 outbreak. Genetic analysis of wild-type (wt) PUUV strains was performed. Fifty seven bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus originating from PUUV-associated HFRS areas were screened for the presence of PUUV N antigen and 15 (26%) were found positive. Total RNA isolated from rodent lung tissues was reverse transcribed followed by PCR amplification with primers specific for PUUV medium (M) or small (S) genome segments. Partial PUUV M segment sequences (approximately 450 bp long) were recovered from five bank voles and partial S segment sequences (app. 250 nt long)-from two bank voles. Genetic analysis of Croatian wt-PUUV strains revealed their close relatedness suggesting that the two localities belong to the same natural focus of infection.

16053195,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Pomurje region of Slovenia--an 18-year survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the north-eastern part of Slovenia (Pomurje region) together with demographic, epidemiological and clinical data on 25 patients from this region who were diagnosed and treated at the General Hospital in Murska Sobota between 1986 and 2003.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with a discharge diagnosis of HFRS who were either hospitalized or referred to an infectiologist as outpatients were included in this retrospective study. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters were collected from the patients' records. In addition, all available follow-up records were examined and information on general health, blood pressure, basic blood and biochemical examination and urine analysis was collected.
RESULTS: Infection with Puumala virus (PUUV) was indicated in 23 patients and Dobrava virus (DOBV) infection in two patients. The median age of patients was 39 years; 19 were male. The patients primarily had outdoor occupations. Most of the HFRS cases occurred between May and August. The most common findings were fever, vomiting, headache, myalgia, chills, cough, back and abdominal pain, and blurred vision. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration, thrombocytopenia, and leucocytosis with neutrophilia. The signs of renal dysfunction were observed in 24 of the 25 patients. Oliguric renal failure was seen in 13 of 23 (57%) PUUV-infected patients. Six of 23 (26%) patients infected with PUUV and one of two (50%) patients from the DOBV group had hypotension or developed signs of shock. Seven out of 15 (47%) patients had elevated protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sinus bradycardia was documented in 7 of 17 (41%) patients with PUUV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: HFRS is endemic in the north-eastern part of Slovenia; PUUV and DOBV infections coexist, with PUUV being the main causative agent of HFRS.

Aim of study was to estimate the renal failure and capillary leak during the acute stage of DOB-infection and PUU-infection. 50 patients with serological conformed diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection were included in the study. Diuresis, serum urea and creatinine were measured. Size of kidneys and presence of ascites was followed by ultrasonography. Enlargement of both kidneys were found in all (100%) patients. Ascites was present in 8/25 (32%) DOB patients; in 1/25 (4%) PUU patient and pleural effusion in four 4/25 (16%) DOB patients. The statistically significant difference in the mean urinary output was during 5th, 6th and 7th day of hospitalization (P<0,05). Serum creatinine and urea levels were at significantly higher levels for DOB than for PUU patients (P<0,05). Acute haemodialysis was needed in 7/25 (28 %) of the DOB patients. One DOB patient died. DOB virus infection is associated with a more severe kidney function disorders than PUU virus infection. Capillary leak, which caused swollen of kidney and ascites is probably the pathogenesis key factor.","['Hukić M', 'Tulumović D', 'Calkić L']",2005,59,4,Med Arh,"Hukić M, et al.

It is hosted by at least two rodent species, Apodemus flavicollis and A. agrarius. According to their natural hosts they form the distinct genetic lineages DOBV-Af and DOBV-Aa, respectively. We have now established a DOBV isolate named Slovakia (SK/Aa) from an A. agrarius animal captured in Slovakia. The complete S and M and partial L segment nucleotide sequences of the new isolate were determined. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the SK/Aa isolate clustered together with the other DOBV-Aa sequences amplified from A. agrarius before and can be taken as the representative of this genetic lineage. SK/Aa, in comparison with a DOBV-Af isolate, was used for serotyping neutralizing antibodies of HFRS patients in Central Europe. Most patients' sera exhibited a higher endpoint titer when probed with our new isolate, suggesting that DOBV-Aa strains are responsible for most of the DOBV-caused HFRS cases in this region.","['Klempa B', 'Stanko M', 'Labuda M', 'Ulrich R', 'Meisel H', 'Krüger DH']",2005,43,6,J Clin Microbiol,"Klempa B, et al.

A biosafety program must address handling and disposal of infectious materials as well as appropriate virus inactivation or depletion procedures to permit necessary further processing of specimens outside the biosafety level 3 laboratory.
METHODS: To study the elimination of hantavirus infectivity, the effects of different chemical and physical inactivation and depletion procedures were investigated on Hantaan virus-containing materials. An infectivity assay for hantaviruses was utilised to verify these procedures which are commonly preceding investigations such as ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, Western blot or immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Chemical inactivation with methanol, paraformaldehyde, acetone/methanol and detergent-containing lysis buffer as well as physical forces such as UV irradiation and filtration efficiently reduced viral infectivity in infected cells and their supernatants below the detection limit.
CONCLUSION: The virus inactivation and depletion methods described herein are suitable to prepare non-infectious samples for further use in immunological, virological and cell-biological assays.","['Kraus AA', 'Priemer C', 'Heider H', 'Kruger DH', 'Ulrich R']",2005,48,4,Intervirology,"Kraus AA, et al.

To determine whether long-term sequelae were present for these individuals, mortality and morbidity data were collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, and the National Death Index records. Control subjects were selected from military units in Korea with no reported cases of HFRS. Those with HFRS had a slightly higher mortality rate (33.2%) than did noninfected individuals (32.0%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Non-Caucasian cases had significantly higher morbidity rates than did non-Caucasian controls only for transient ischemic attacks (4.8% versus 0%) and diabetes mellitus (19.3% versus 8.1%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following laboratory findings were retrospectively analyzed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count and differential percentage (segmented neutrophils, band neutrophils, atypical lymphocytes), platelet count, coagulation tests, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, urine, potassium, bilirubin (BIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and serum protein electrophoresis. The study included 94 HFRS patients treated at the Dr Fran Mihaljević University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb during 2002.
RESULTS: ESR increase, mostly mild to moderate, was found in 86.2% of study patients. Increased CRP was recorded in 98.9% of study patients, however, one-fourth had CRP higher than 100 mg/L. Leukocytosis was recorded in 38.3% (10.1 +/- 4.2 x 10(9)/L), thrombocytopenia in 89.4% patients (68.2 +/- 48.3 x 10(9)/L), and severe thrombocytopenia (x 10(9)/L) in six patients. Three patients had abnormal coagulation tests. Increased values of BUN and creatinine were recorded in more than a half of patients, while only four patients had mild hyperkalemia. Only three patinets required hemodialysis. Mildly to moderately increased values of aminotransferases (AST, ALT, GT) were observed in more than 2/3; hypoalbuminaemia in nearly 1/3, and elevated alpha-2 fraction in more than 2/3 of patients. The majority of patients had pathologic urine findings. First laboratory abnormalities were usually found between day 5 and 7 of the disease (increased CRP level, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and elevation of hemoglobin and hematocrit). Biochemical abnormalities(elevation of cratinine and urea, increased levels of aminotransferases) usually occurred at the beginning of the second week, and ESR increase in the second week of disease.
CONCLUSION: The majority of our patients had laboratory findings characteristic of HFRS. Thrombocytopenia and increased level of CRP were the most common laboratory findings during the first week of the disease.

15886525,In vivo characterization of the integrin beta3 as a receptor for Hantaan virus cellular entry.,"Binding of viruses to cell surface molecules is an essential step in viral infection. In vitro studies suggested that the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor is the epithelial cell receptor for Hantaan virus (HTNV). Whether beta(3) is in vivo the only or central cellular receptor for HTNV infection is not known. To investigate the role of beta(3) integrin for cellular entry of HTNV, we established an HTNV infection model in newborn murine pups. Infected pups died at an average age of 14.2 +/- 1.1 days with high levels of viral antigen detected in their brain, lung, and kidney. Pre-injection of blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for either beta(3) or av prolonged survival significantly to a maximal average survival of 19.7 +/- 1.5 days (P <0.01) and 18.4 +/- 0.9 days (P < 0.01), respectively. XT-199, a chemical blocker of the alpha(v)beta(3) receptor also prolonged survival to 19.5 +/- 1.3 days (P < 0.01). In contrast to these receptor blockades, anti-HTNV antibody was not only able to prolong survival, but 20% of infected pups achieved long-term survival. An anti-murine beta(1) antibody comparatively prolonged survival (19.0 +/- 1.2 days), suggesting that HTNV infection is partly mediated through integrin beta(1) receptors as well as through beta(3) receptors in vivo. Our data demonstrate that the beta(3) receptor is important for HTNV infection in vivo, but also suggest that HTNV may utilize additional receptors beyond beta(3) for cellular entry within an organism.","['Song JW', 'Song KJ', 'Baek LJ', 'Frost B', 'Poncz M', 'Park K']",2005,37,2,Exp Mol Med,"Song JW, et al.

15859577,[Hantavirus infections].,"Hantaviruses are cosmopolite anthropozoonosis considered as an emerging disease. Four pathogenic types for humans and part of the Bunyaviridae species are hosted by rodents and have been isolated: the Sin nombre virus responsible for the severe American respiratory form; the Hantaan and Seoul viruses responsible for hemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome (HFRS) of severe to moderate expression in Asia and also in the Balkans; the Puumala virus responsible for HFRS of moderate expression or the socalled nephropathia epidemica in Europe. The Puumala virus is responsible for a minor form of the disease that is observed in areas of the Occidental sector of the ex-URSS, in Scandinavia and in the rest of Europe, notably in the North-East of France. The epidemic episodes occur every three years. They follow the proliferation of rodents, notably russet voles, the reservoir hosts, and their degree of infection. The concept of an occupation at risk in 20 to 49 year-old men (working in forests, agriculture, living near a forest, contact with wood) in an endemic area has not always been found. Its clinical form can vary greatly in its presentation. Basically it is a severe algic influenza syndrome accompanied by acute myopia in 38% of cases, but is nearly pathognomonic in the context. Respiratory involvement is frequent but benign. The initial syndrome can suggest an abdominal or urological surgical emergency, which is source of diagnostic and therapeutic errors. Early biological examination reveals thrombopenia and proteinuria. Then more or less severe acute kidney failure appears in slightly more than 50% of cases. Although it usually regresses with symptomatic treatment, after effects remain in some patients. The environmental changes, the geographical distribution depending on the biotope, the dynamics and behaviour of rodents and the viral circulation between them and its transmission to human beings and its risk factors must continue to be studied in order to gain further knowledge on the epidemiology of this anthropozoonosis.","['Strady C', 'Jaussaud R', 'Remy G', 'Penalba C']",2005,34,5,Presse Med,"Strady C, et al.

15827873,Detection of human hantavirus infections in Lithuania.,"BACKGROUND: In Europe certain hantaviruses are known to cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome of different severity. The objective of the present investigation was to study the presence of hantavirus infections in Lithuania.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two different serum panels from cancer patients (n = 438) and blood donors (n = 299) from Lithuania were tested by monoclonal antibody capture IgG ELISA using yeast-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) proteins of Puumala virus (PUUV), Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Dobrava virus (DOBV). The reactivity of ELISA-positive sera was proven in Western blot tests using various hantavirus rN proteins. Selected serum samples were further analyzed by focus reduction neutralization assays.
RESULTS: In the IgG ELISA 39 sera from the cancer patients and four sera from blood donors were found to be reactive with at least one of the rN proteins. By immunoblot using the three yeast-expressed rN proteins, the ELISA reactivity of 36 of 39 and two of four serum samples from cancer patients and blood donors, respectively, was confirmed; this corresponds to a seroprevalence of 8.2% and 0.7%, respectively. In ELISA, the majority of the samples reacted exclusively with rN proteins of HTNV and DOBV (31 of 36 and one of two in the two groups). In the group of sera selected for serotyping by focus reduction neutralization assay, this dominance was confirmed by the identification of eight DOBV but only four PUUV infections. No infection by HTNV or another hantavirus besides DOBV and PUUV was verified. Anti-hantavirus-positive human sera were detected in all seven investigated counties of Lithuania.
CONCLUSION: In Lithuania at least two hantaviruses, DOBV and PUUV, circulate and cause human infections. Additional investigations are needed to study the seroprevalence more precisely and to search for clinical cases of hantavirus infections.","['Sandmann S', 'Meisel H', 'Razanskiene A', 'Wolbert A', 'Pohl B', 'Krüger DH', 'Sasnauskas K', 'Ulrich R']",2005,33,2,Infection,"Sandmann S, et al.

Humans are contaminated by the inhalation of aerosols contaminated by rodent faeces. In February 2003, the National reference centre (NRC) for hemorrhagic fevers detected an increased number of cases. An investigation was carried out to confirm the outbreak and take appropriate control measures.
METHODS: Cases were collected by the NRC. A case was defined as a person living in France with symptoms compatible with hantaviral infection and a positive blood test both for specific Puumala IgM, and IgG. Clinical information and at-risk exposures during the 2 weeks before onset were recorded.
RESULTS: In 2003, 128 cases were diagnosed (61 in 2002). The median age of patients was 38, 77% were men and 82% were hospitalized. Patients were living in North-Eastern France. Clusters were detected in the Ardennes and Oise districts. Occupation (35%) (in agriculture, forestry, and construction work), manipulation of firewood (35%), gardening (29%), and outdoors leisure (14%) were identified as at-risk exposures in these cases.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased number of positive diagnoses of hantaviral infections was confirmed. The location and at-risk exposures of the cases were identical in previous investigations. Exclusion and prevention of rodents' access to houses and avoiding the inhalation of contaminated dust are the only possible prevention measures of hantaviral infections. Information about the disease and its prevention needs to be made widely available to both healthcare professionals and the general population living in endemic areas.","['Mailles A', 'Vaillant V', 'Haeghebaert S', 'Fradet MR', 'Capek I', 'Zeller H']",2005,35,2,Med Mal Infect,"Mailles A, et al.

METHODS: Data on serotype of HFRS patients from 122 regions and species as well as number of animal hosts from 41 national surveillance sites were collected and managed. The map of the types of epidemic areas from 1991-1999 in China was produced using inverse distance weighted technique in the ArcGIS 8.1 software. The map of the proportion of host animals was then overlapped on it and the surveillance sites of HFRS were clustered in terms of the proportion of host animals.
RESULTS: Variance in spatial distribution of the types of epidemic areas was observed. Two epidemic area types, namely Hantaan-dominant mixed epidemic areas and Soul-dominant mixed epidemic areas seemed to have transferred from the north-east to south-west of China in turns. There were more species of HFRS animal hosts in fields than those of in residential areas. The diversity of rodent species in fields was higher than that of the residential areas which predominant harbored rodent species of 2-3 kinds. Types of surveillance sites classified by cluster analysis of proportion of main animal hosts were consistent with the serotypes of HFRS patients.

15744574,New ecological aspects of hantavirus infection: a change of a paradigm and a challenge of prevention--a review.,"In the last decades a significant number of so far unknown or underestimated pathogens have emerged as fundamental health hazards of the human population despite intensive research and exceptional efforts of modern medicine to embank and eradicate infectious diseases. Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be ascribed to agents that are zoonotic or expanded their host range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status of a pathogen to remain unnoticed or evolves into a worldwide threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social, and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens having gained more and more attention in the last decades. These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in hitherto unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Middle, and South America) with characteristic features affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing an acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century fundamentally changed our knowledge about the appearance of the hantavirus specific clinical picture, mortality, origin, and transmission route in human beings. The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners Region of the United States and had a lethality of more than 50%. Although the causative virus was first termed in connection with the geographic name of its outbreak region the analysis of the individual viruses indicate that the causing virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and consequently termed as Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are assumed to share a long time period of co-evolution with specific rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes normally coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases that are associated with hantavirus infections in rodents underlining the amicable relationship between virus and host developed by mutual interaction in hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the major reservoir, antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild animals like cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live jointly in a similar habitat. Therefore the transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals seems to be possible, if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of the co-habitat domestic animals possess adequate virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of species other than rodents as for example humans turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents focusing the attention on this virus group, their ecology and evolution in order to prevent the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on the influence of non-natural hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses are needed to understand the directions that the hantavirus evolution could pursue. At least, domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans particularly in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions have to be copiously screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other often incidental hosts is accompanied by a change of ecology, a change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors probably influencing the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment exerts a modified evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably to adopt a form that is much more dangerous for other host species compared to the original one.","['Zeier M', 'Handermann M', 'Bahr U', 'Rensch B', 'Müller S', 'Kehm R', 'Muranyi W', 'Darai G']",2005,30,2,Virus Genes,"Zeier M, et al.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding sequence of SEOV (strain 80-39) was RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into a yeast expression vector containing a galactose-inducible promoter. A survey of the pattern of synonymous codon preferences for a total of 22 N protein-encoding hantavirus genes including 13 of SEOV strains revealed that there is minor variation in codon usage by the same gene in different viral genomes. Introduction of the expression plasmid into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the high-level expression of a hexahistidine-tagged N protein derivative. The nickel-chelation chromatography purified, yeast-expressed SEOV N protein reacted in the immunoblot with a SEOV-specific monoclonal antibody and certain HTNV- and PUUV-cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. The immunization of a rabbit with the recombinant N protein resulted in the induction of a high-titered antibody response. In ELISA studies, the N protein was able to detect antibodies in sera of experimentally infected laboratory rats and in human anti-hantavirus-positive sera or serum pools of patients from different geographical origin. The yeast-expressed SEOV N protein represents a promising antigen for development of diagnostic tools in serology, sero prevalence studies and vaccine development.","['Schmidt J', 'Jandrig B', 'Klempa B', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Meisel H', 'Niedrig M', 'Pitra C', 'Krüger DH', 'Ulrich R']",2005,30,1,Virus Genes,"Schmidt J, et al.

A patient with DHF/DSS who lacked three or more of the five most frequently observed manifestations other than fever in controls or showed disturbed consciousness was defined as one with unusual dengue manifestations. Patients with a dual infection were older, and tended to have prolonged fever, higher frequencies of acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered consciousness, unusual dengue manifestations, and DSS. Acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR] = 51.45, P = 0.002), and prolonged fever (> 5 days) (OR = 26.07, P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for dual infection.

15740670,Enhancing DNA vaccine potency against hantavirus by co-administration of interleukin-12 expression vector as a genetic adjuvant.,"BACKGROUND: The heavy incidence and mortality of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, as well as no specific drugs in curing the disease, clearly indicate the need for development of the more effective hantavirus vaccine. Refining the DNA vaccination strategy to elicit more clinically efficacious immune responses is now under intensive investigation. In the present study, we examined the effects of using an interleukin-12 expression plasmid as a genetic adjuvant to enhance the immune responses induced by a DNA vaccine based on the S gene encoding nucleocapsid protein against hantavirus.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized three times by intramuscular inoculations of DNA vaccine encoding of hantanvirus nucleocapsid protein alone or in combination with a plasmid expressing murine interleukin-12 (pcIL-12). Booster immunizations were employed 2 times at 2-week interval. To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses, antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production were assayed by MTT method and ELISA respectively. The level of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma in the splenic lymphocytic cultured supernatant were detected with ELISA kit at day 5, 10, 17, 35 and 42 after primary immunization.
RESULTS: Antigen-specific IgG antibodies was increased markedly at day 17 in the experiment groups and reached a plateau after day 35. As pcIL-12 co-injected, a significant inhibition of antigen-specific IgG levels was displayed over the period and the antibody mean titre was decreased to only about 1:50 at day 42 after primary immunization, significantly lower than the group immunized with pcDNA3.1 + S alone, in which the mean titre was about 1:70. Interferon-gamma was increased remarkably by the co-injection of pcIL-12 compared with the injection of pcDNA3.1 + S alone. However, the production of interleukin-4 was inhibited by pcIL-12 co-injection. Furthermore, pcIL-12 co-injection efficiently enhanced antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation.
CONCLUSION: Humoral and cytokine responses elicited by pcDNA3.1 + S inoculation can be modulated by co-inoculation with pcIL-12 and efficiently induced Th1-dominant immune responses.","['Zheng LY', 'Mou L', 'Lin S', 'Lu RM', 'Luo EJ']",2005,118,4,Chin Med J (Engl),"Zheng LY, et al.

These viruses, which are found throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas, are maintained by different species of rodents, in which they produce chronic, inapparent infections. Humans become infected through contact with urine, saliva or faeces from infected rodents, mainly via the aerosol route. In humans, clinical disease occurs in the form of two major syndromes: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome mainly occurs in Europe and Asia and HPS has only ever been reported in the Americas. Person-to-person transmission of hantaviruses, although uncommon, was described during an outbreak of HPS in southern Argentina.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal US was undertaken in 23 hospital-treated NE cases during the acute phase of the disease (first study). A second US study was performed 3-6 months later. Captured US images were used in the analysis.
RESULTS: From acute to control phase the overall rating of kidney status improved in 20 patients, parenchymal swelling decreased and corticomedullary border differentiation improved in 21, echogenicity decreased in 18, and patchy pattern in parenchymal echo-texture decreased in 15. The severity of findings in US evinced some association with fluid volume overload, high blood pressure level and blood leukocyte count, and severe clinical renal insufficiency. The degree of parenchymal swelling had more statistically significant associations with clinical course than other US features.
CONCLUSION: Qualitative US features are as sensitive as quantitative US parameters in assessment of NE patients' clinical course and recovery, assuming that a comparative study is available. US using only qualitative features is fairly limited in evaluating NE patients' clinical situation.","['Paakkala A', 'Kallio T', 'Huhtala H', 'Apuli P', 'Paakkala T', 'Mustonen J']",2004,45,7,Acta Radiol,"Paakkala A, et al.

METHODS: The cytokine levels were measured by double mAb sandwich ELISA. An automatic biochemical detector(RA-1000) was employed to determine the ALT level.
RESULTS: Levels of TNF, IL-6, IL-4, IFN-gamma and sIL-2R in plasma from the patients were(95.82+/-12.04), (362.46+/-141.26), (17.76+/-3.52), (116.18+/-19.80) ng/L and (898 820+/-127 200) U/L, respectively. These cytokines in plasma from healthy donors were (17.89+/-1.68), (43.81+/-18.08), (4.86+/-1.14), (7.57+/-2.41) ng/L and (66 730+/-29 690) U/L, respectively. The cytokine levels of the patients were notably higher than those of the healthy donors.(P<0.01). At the same time, the average ALT level in sera from the patients was 4.4 fold of that from the healthy donors. Statistical analysis showed that levels of TNF, sIL-2R, IL-6 and IFN-gamma were positively correlated with ALT level, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The HFRS patients have a significant increase in both cytokines (TNF, sIL-2R, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) and ALT levels. And there is a positive correlation between those cytokine and ALT levels, suggesting that the liver injury during HTNV infection may be related to the elevation of above cytokine levels.","['Liu JM', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang JP', 'Ouyang WM', 'Li Q', 'Zhuang R', 'Jin BQ']",2004,20,6,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Liu JM, et al.

15350516,Establishment of an ELISA system for determining soluble LAIR-1 levels in sera of patients with HFRS and kidney transplant.,"LAIR-1, the leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1, is a trans-membrane molecule that functions as an inhibitory receptor on natural killer cells, T lymphocytes and monocytes. It has been well known that many trans-membrane receptors can shed from the cell surface and be released into the circulation in soluble form when lymphocytes, endothelials and other immune cells are activated. In many cases, the levels of soluble receptors in the circulation can be used as markers of lymphocyte activation in transplant patients and virus infection patients. To investigate whether LAIR-1 is able to be released into the sera, we developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system based on two anti-LAIR-1 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) with different epitope specificities. Using this ELISA, we found that sLAIR-1 existed in the supernatants collected from PMA, PHA or CD3 MAb-stimulated lymphocytes cultures in vitro for the first time. Moreover, we found that LAIR-1 level in serum samples from healthy individuals was 6.2 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, whereas the levels in sera of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and patients 3-7 days after kidney transplant increased to 47.2 +/- 35.9 and 24.4 +/- 16.0 ng/ml, respectively. Furthermore, HFRS patients in oliguric phase showed higher serum sLAIR-1 levels than those in other phases, and transplant patients with rejection showed higher serum sLAIR-1 level than those without rejection. These findings demonstrated that LAIR-1 can be released when lymphocytes are activated, suggesting sLAIR-1 may be used as a predictor for monitoring immune reaction in some virus infections and organ transplants which may be useful in clinical treatment of these diseases.","['Ouyang W', 'Xue J', 'Liu J', 'Jia W', 'Li Z', 'Xie X', 'Liu X', 'Jian J', 'Li Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Yang A', 'Jin B']",2004,292,1-2,J Immunol Methods,"Ouyang W, et al.

15340571,"[Using recombinant antigens of Hantavirus to study the kinetics of serum IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies in the acute-phase of hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome].","BACKGROUND: To observe the features of serum specific IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies in the acute phase of hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: The nucleocapsid (NP) protein and glycoproteins (GP) of Hantavirus were expressed by recombinant baculovirus, and used as ELISA antigens to test 61 serial sera of 14 acute phase HFRS patients.
RESULTS: Seoul like virus RNA were detected from 11 of 14 patients. An early and strong IgA, IgG and IgM antibody response to recombinant NP (rNP) was observed in almost all HFRS cases. The titers of antibody to rNP was apparently higher than that to Rgp. In the early stage, titer of IgG antibody elevated most drastically among all the three classes of antibodies to rNP, followed by IgM and IgA antibody responses. The elevation trend of IgM and IgA antibodies to rNP stayed nearly at the same level, but the IgA titers to rNP were apparently higher than that of IgM. Among the antibodies to rGP, IgA changed distinctly greater than IgG. The elevation trend of IgM could be found during first week after the onset, and the titers dropped gradually after the second week. IgM antibodies of one case who was viral RNA positive were not detected at early stage, but IgA titers were high. The only severe case of the 14 patients kept the lower IgA, IgG and IgM during the whole acute phase.
CONCLUSION: HFRS patients kept an early and strong humoral response to NP and GPs in acute phase of HFRS.IgA could be used together with IgM to improve the diagnostic accuracy.","['Meng XS', 'Chen YP', 'Li C', 'Yu JS', 'Guo YM', 'Zhang QF', 'Sun YL', 'Li DX']",2003,17,3,Zhonghua Shi Yan He Lin Chuang Bing Du Xue Za Zhi,"Meng XS, et al.

METHODS: An immune enzyme dot assay (IEDA) with mixture of three sorts anti-HFRSV-IgG, which was obtained from rabbit vaccinated with EHFV R22, Chen and Hubei strain was employed to detect HFRSV antigen in serum and urine from epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) patients, and compared with indirect immune fluorescence assay (I-IFA), 76 serum samples and 40 urine samples were detected in this study.
RESULTS: The results showed that the total positive rate of HFRSV antigen detected by IEDA was 73.68% in serum and 65.00% in urine, while that detected by I-IFA was 75.00% and 70.00%, respectively. The positive rate in primary phase (within 5 days) of HFRSV antigen detected by IEDA was 94.34% in serum and 83.33% in urine, while that detected by I-IFA was 64.42% and 55.56%, respectively, there was significant difference in both serum and urine detections. Correlation study showed a high correlation in the result of IEDA and I-IFA.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that the IEDA, as compared with I-IFA, was a more specific, sensitive, rapid and simple method with higher positive rate in primary phase.

METHODS: The serum of 559 patients with HFRS were tested with colloidal gold immuno-dot assay (CGIDA) for sIgM and sIgG antibodies and compared with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). One hundred and one patients with HFRS were randomized into treatment group (n=50),treated with Kuhuang Injection, Shenmai Injection and Huangqi Liquid) and control group (n=51),treated with Ribarvirin and Ganlixin Injection).
RESULTS: The positive rate of sIgM detected with CGIDA was 70.8% and the positive rate of sIgG detected with CGIDA was 87.5%. The days for fever decline, symptoms alleviation and sign relief between the treatment group and control group were similar (P>0.05). The days for recovery of kidney function in the control group was less than that in the treatment group (P<0.01). The rate of crossing shock stage in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group (P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: CGIDA was more simple, speedy, specific and sensitive than ELISA or IFAT in detecting the sIgM or sIgG antibodies in serum of patients with HFRS. Although the sensitivity of CGIDA was lower than that of ELISA the CGIDA had no false positive reaction the sensitivity of CGIDA was higher than that of IFAT on detecting IgG. The effect of the treatment group was similar to that of the control group. But the crossing shock stage rate in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group while the control group was better than the treatment group in recovering the kidney function.","['Chu F', 'Ji Q', 'Yan RM', 'Wang XM', 'Pei B']",2004,2,1,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,"Chu F, et al.

The disease showed distinctive features which included high fever, low blood pressure, hemorrhagic tendency and acute renal failure. Historically it was apparently a similar disease to a clinical entity designated as Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in Manchuria or Hemorrhagic nephrosonephritis in Far Eastern Russia. After Lee Ho-Wang succeeded in demonstrating Hantaan virus which caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), many studies has revealed various biological and epidemiological aspects of the disease. But the origin of the disease in Korea still remains unknown. This article tests some hypotheses which explain the origin of the disease and reviews the relation between the Korean War and HFRS.

15258986,Differential expression of immunoregulatory genes in male and female Norway rats following infection with Seoul virus.,"Males of many species are more susceptible than females to infections caused by parasites, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Following inoculation with Seoul virus, male rats have more virus present in target organs and shed virus longer than females. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that variation in the expression of genes associated with immune function mediates sex differences in hantavirus infection. Using DNA microarrays, we examined changes in gene expression in lung tissue during the early (when animals are viremic and shedding virus; Day 15 post-inoculation (p.i.)) and late (animals have low levels of infectious virus, but high antibody titers; Day 40 p.i.) phases of infection in adult male and female rats. After normalizing the gene expression levels from infected animals to the gene expression levels from same-sex uninfected controls, our data revealed that 1,813 genes were differentially expressed between the sexes during infection. The expression of key transcriptional factors (e.g., eIF-2 alpha, NF-kappa B, IRF-1, NF-IL-6, and STAT6) and genes that encode for proinflammatory (e.g., TNF alpha R, IL-1R, and IL-1RAcP), antiviral (e.g., IFN gamma R and Mx proteins), T cell (e.g., CD3 and TCR), and Ig superfamily (e.g., IgM, IgG, and MHC class I and II) proteins was higher in females than males. Conversely, males had higher expression of heat shock protein genes (e.g., hsp70) suggesting that cellular stress is elevated in males. These data provide candidate genes and cellular pathways that may underlie sex differences in responses to Seoul virus and possibly other hemorrhagic fever viruses.","['Klein SL', 'Cernetich A', 'Hilmer S', 'Hoffman EP', 'Scott AL', 'Glass GE']",2004,74,1,J Med Virol,"Klein SL, et al.

15254821,[Prevalence of hantavirus infections in Germany].,"Hantaviruses belong to the group of ""emerging"" viruses. Pathogenic European hantaviruses can cause a human disease designated ""hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome"" of varying severity. In general, diagnostics of hantavirus infections are based on immunofluorescence assays using virus-infected cells or enzyme immunoassays and Western blot tests using recombinant nucleocapsid proteins. For highly sensitive detection of hantavirus-specific antibodies in the enzyme immunoassay, a homologous hantavirus nucleocapsid protein is needed as a diagnostic antigen. Serological typing of hantavirus infections can be obtained by neutralization assays, which in certain cases require the use of late convalescent sera. The seroprevalence in the normal German population is about 1%. In professionally exposed risk groups, e. g., forest workers, a seroprevalence higher than that in the normal population was observed. Endemic regions for hantavirus infections are located mainly in Baden-Württemberg. In the years 2001-2003 an annual number of about 200 clinically apparent hantavirus infections were registered in Germany. Neutralization assays detected almost exclusively human infections caused by Puumala and Dobrava viruses, only very rarely by Tula virus. Until this day in Germany mainly mild to moderate courses of human hantavirus infections have been documented. Besides infections caused by ""German"" hantaviruses, up to 10% of the clinically apparent hantavirus infections registered annually in Germany are caused by infections imported from other countries, mainly from Europe. So far only very limited molecular genetic data about the circulating hantaviruses in Germany are available. Additional investigations are needed to get a more precise picture about the distribution of hantaviruses in Germany and to calculate the resulting risk for the human population.","['Ulrich R', 'Meisel H', 'Schütt M', 'Schmidt J', 'Kunz A', 'Klempa B', 'Niedrig M', 'Pauli G', 'Krüger DH', 'Koch J']",2004,47,7,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Ulrich R, et al.

The production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells and the cytotoxic activity against HTNV-infected target cells were similar in immature and adult mice. However, the number of IFN-gamma-producing HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was significantly less in mice inoculated with HTNV at 3 days than in older mice. In addition, a strong correlation between HTNV persistence and a lack of HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was observed. These results suggest that mice over 7 days old have the ability to induce functional HTNV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses that are indistinguishable from the responses of adult mice, and that HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells are important for clearance of HTNV.","['Araki K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Lee BH', 'Okumura M', 'Kariwa H', 'Takashima I', 'Arikawa J']",2004,149,7,Arch Virol,"Araki K, et al.

This report describes findings from experimental infection of inbred Lewis rats with Seoul virus strain 80-39. Rats inoculated with virus intraperitoneally at 6 days of age became persistently infected without clinical signs. Tissues from Seoul virus-inoculated 6-day-old rats were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-inoculation for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) and for infectious virus by inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Virus was isolated from lung and kidney of infected rats at 6 weeks and viral RNA was detected in lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, brain, spleen, liver and skin at 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Rats inoculated with Seoul virus intraperitoneally at 10 or 21 days of age became infected without clinical signs but had low to undetectable levels of viral RNA in tissues at 6 weeks post-inoculation. ISH identified vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as common sites of persistent infection. Cultured rat smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent cultured endothelial cells also were susceptible to Seoul virus infection. Pancreatic infection resulted in insulitis with associated hyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that infant Lewis rats are uniformly susceptible to asymptomatic persistent Seoul virus infection. Additionally, they offer opportunities for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of Seoul virus interactions in host cell types that support persistent infection.","['Compton SR', 'Jacoby RO', 'Paturzo FX', 'Smith AL']",2004,149,7,Arch Virol,"Compton SR, et al.

The present paper analyses for the first time the ultrastructural changes in macrophages caused by an agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HERS)--hantavirus (HV). After a local fusion with the host cell plasmalemma and its adsorption on the cell surface, the HV penetrates through the macrophage membrane. This process occurred without destruction of cell plasmalemma. HV viral particles were observe within the macrophage cytoplasm mostly on the smooth granular endoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Viroplasts were defined in macrophages after a 2 h incubation, with synthesis of viral nucleoproteins and primary covers being observed on the surface of viroplasts. Viral particles left macrophages in the process of budding on the phagocyte surface. Thereby HV, similar to other enveloped viruses, realizes entrance and egress from the target cell without damaging its plasmalemma. This accounts for the viral ability to reproduce in macrophages for a long time without any cytopathological effect. Consequently, in the absence of obvious destruction changes, mononuclear phagocytes can serve as a long-term storage of viruses, and thus being involved in HV dissemination during HERS.","['Plekhova NG', 'Somova-Isachkova LM', 'Slonova RA', 'Kompanets GG', 'Pustovalov EV', 'Drobot EI']",2003,45,8,Tsitologiia,"Plekhova NG, et al.

Transgenic tobacco and potato plants expressing the nucleocapsid protein of Hantavirus serotype Puumala were generated and established. Puumala virus is a human pathogen causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. To investigate oral immunogenicity of the nucleocapsid protein expressed in plants, mice were fed with tubers of transgenic potato and tobacco leaf powder. The resulting antibodies were compared among groups. No significant difference could be found between the control group and the groups of animals, which had been fed with the recombinant plants expressing Puumala nucleocapsid protein. Hence, the effect of different enzymes, present in the gastro-intestinal tract, on the plant-derived antigen was investigated. It was found that the recombinant viral protein was completely degraded by trypsin and/or pepsin. In conclusion, the enzymes present in the intestine can degrade major antigenic domains of antigens, expressed in transgenic plants, thus preventing the induction of antibodies against the ingested viral antigen.","['Khattak S', 'Darai G', 'Rösen-Wolff A']",2004,29,1,Virus Genes,"Khattak S, et al.

15188724,Rapid field test for detection of hantavirus antibodies in rodents.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. PUUV is transmitted to humans via aerosolized excreta of the infected bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Current methods for screening of the PUUV prevalence among bank vole populations are laborious, combining sampling in the field and subsequent analyses in the laboratory. In order to facilitate animal testing, a new serological immunochromatographic rapid test was developed. The test uses PUUV nucleocapsid protein as antigen, and it detects anti-PUUV IgG antibodies in rodents.

15188654,[Hantaviruses and hantavirus infections].,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HVRS) has been for decades a topical problem for healthcare systems of many countries in the Eurasian continent. Viruses triggering HVRS alongside with other related viruses (but not pathogenic to man) were discovered in 70-80-ies and formed a new genus Hantavirus of the Bunyaviridae family. The study results of a severe outbreak of the respiratory disease with the mortality rate of 60% (South-West of the USA, 1933) showed that hantaviruses were also among the causative agents. Later, the disease was designated as hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome. By now, it has been established that hantaviruses are wide spread with different rodents being their carriers. The discussed viruses cause, in rodents, a chronic asymptomatic infection and are transferred, later, to man by the aerogenic path through excretions of infected animals. Studies of hantaviruses have been restricted for a long time due to their high pathogenicity (protection equipment not below than the P-3 level is needed), because of a lack of a laboratory model of infected animals and because of a low growth in cell cultures. With the rapid development and application of molecular biological techniques of the recent years, substantial progress has been made in studies of hantaviruses. Different aspects of hantavirus ecology, molecular biology, morphology, pathogenesis and diagnostics are discussed in the offered survey.","['Dekonenko AE', 'Tkachenko EA']",2004,49,3,Vopr Virusol,Dekonenko AE and Tkachenko EA.

Renal MRI was performed in 20 hospitalized NE patients during the acute phase of their disease. A repeat MRI study was made 5-8 months later. Renal parenchymal volume, renal length and parenchymal thickness were decreased in all patients in the repeat study. Edema/fluid collections were found bilaterally in 16 patients in the primary MRI study. Greater change in parenchymal volume, renal length and parenchymal thickness between the primary and the repeat MRI study as well as the presence of edema/fluid collections in the primary study evinced mild association with clinical fluid volume overload, high blood pressure level, inflammation, thrombocytopenia and severe clinical renal insufficiency. Change in parenchymal volume was associated with a severe clinical course more markedly than the other MRI findings. Measurable renal MRI changes occurred in every NE patient. The severity of the findings in MRI evinced mild association with clinical fluid volume overload, high blood pressure level, inflammation, thrombocytopenia and severe clinical renal insufficiency. Based on this study and our previous ultrasound (US) findings, we prefer US as the primary examination mode in NE patients.","['Paakkala A', 'Dastidar P', 'Ryymin P', 'Huhtala H', 'Mustonen J']",2005,15,5,Eur Radiol,"Paakkala A, et al.

15163707,Differential antiviral response of endothelial cells after infection with pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses.,"Hantaviruses represent important human pathogens and can induce hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Both pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses replicate without causing any apparent cytopathic effect, suggesting that immunopathological mechanisms play an important role in pathogenesis. We compared the antiviral responses triggered by Hantaan virus (HTNV), a pathogenic hantavirus associated with HFRS, and Tula virus (TULV), a rather nonpathogenic hantavirus, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Both HTNV- and TULV-infected cells showed increased levels of molecules involved in antigen presentation. However, TULV-infected HUVECs upregulated HLA class I molecules more rapidly. Interestingly, HTNV clearly induced the production of beta interferon (IFN-beta), whereas expression of this cytokine was barely detectable in the supernatant or in extracts from TULV-infected HUVECs. Nevertheless, the upregulation of HLA class I on both TULV- and HTNV-infected cells could be blocked by neutralizing anti-IFN-beta antibodies. Most strikingly, the antiviral MxA protein, which interferes with hantavirus replication, was already induced 16 h after infection with TULV. In contrast, HTNV-infected HUVECs showed no expression of MxA until 48 h postinfection. In accordance with the kinetics of MxA expression, TULV replicated only inefficiently in HUVECs, whereas HTNV-infected cells produced high titers of virus particles that decreased after 48 h postinfection. Both hantavirus species, however, could replicate equally well in Vero E6 cells, which lack an IFN-induced MxA response. Thus, delayed induction of antiviral MxA in endothelial cells after infection with HTNV could allow viral dissemination and contribute to the pathogenesis leading to HFRS.","['Kraus AA', 'Raftery MJ', 'Giese T', 'Ulrich R', 'Zawatzky R', 'Hippenstiel S', 'Suttorp N', 'Krüger DH', 'Schönrich G']",2004,78,12,J Virol,"Kraus AA, et al.

15156765,[Occupational bio hazards: current issues].,"Over the last decade, there was noted a large advancement of knowledge on living organisms and their products posing a potential occupational risk. Novel risk factors, often new to science, were identified, the role and significance of already known factors better comprehended, and occupational groups endangered by biological hazards more thoroughly recognized. Novel viruses and prions, emerging in different parts of the world, may pose a particular threat to health and life of health care workers, agriculture workers and veterinarians. A new coronavirus (SCoV) that evoked a rapid outbreak of disease described as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 may serve as an example. The disease was particularly common among health care workers. Previously discovered zoonotic viruses, Nipah virus in pigs and Hendra virus in horses, may be a cause of fatal encephalitis in animal farmers. Hantaviruses (Puumala, Hantaan, Sin Nombre and others) infecting field rodents may be a cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in farmers and laboratory workers. Prions responsible for inducing a zoonotic variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are considered to be a potential cause of work-related infections in agricultural and health care workers, however, this assumption has not as yet been supported by any conclusive evidence. In many countries, blood-borne occupational infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major epidemiological problem among health care workers, mostly because no vaccine against this virus has been produced to date. Vaccinations effectively restricted the number of occupational infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and work-related infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are very rare. Hazardous bioserosols, occurring in many work environments, pose an occupational health hazard of particular importance. Many new biological factors present in organic dusts that may induce work-related allergic and immunotoxic diseases among farmers and workers of the agricultural and wood industries have been identified. Droplet aerosols, which are generated from water, oils, oil-water emulsions and other liquids in various work environments, may contain infectious agents (Legionella spp.) as well as allergic and/or toxic agents. It has been shown that allergens and endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacteria occurring in oil mist from metalworking fluids may cause occupational respiratory diseases in workers of the metallurgic industry.",['Dutkiewicz J'],2004,55,1,Med Pr,Dutkiewicz J.

15146285,[Glomerular-type proteinuria in hantavirus nephritis].,"BACKGROUND: Infection with hantavirus of the Puumala type is known to cause severe illness, fever, loin pain and impaired vision. Tubulointerstitial nephritis leads to acute renal failure.
CASE REPORTS: In four patients presenting with hantavirus infection and acute renal failure, proteinuria was analyzed by microelectrophoresis to explore possible causes of renal protein loss in hantavirus nephritis. The patients (three men, one woman) presented with a short history of fever, headache, loin pain and acute renal failure (enlarged kidneys in ultrasonography, serum creatinine 7.7/3.4/3.2/7.8 mg/dl, urinary protein excretion 1.7/0.5/1.5/9.0 g/l, IgM antibodies against hantavirus positive in all patients, subtype Puumala). Microelectrophoresis of the urine revealed a major fraction of higher molecular weight proteins such as transferrin and immunoglobulins indicating unselective glomerular-type proteinuria in all four patients. In three renal biopsy specimens obtained, morphology of glomeruli and vasculature was normal as judged by light microscopy. The tubulointerstitium exhibited interstitial hemorrhage and round-cell infiltrates. After 2 weeks, renal function had completely recovered in all patients and no persistent proteinuria developed.
CONCLUSION: Hantavirus nephritis may lead to glomerular-type proteinuria. Glomerular morphology may be normal and proteinuria may cease within 2 weeks indicating a transient lesion of the glomerular filtration barrier. Transiently increased glomerular permeability may be caused by an immunologic response to virus infection.","['Matthaeus T', 'Fries J', 'Weber M', 'Schulze-Lohoff E']",2004,99,5,Med Klin (Munich),"Matthaeus T, et al.

15110529,A new model of Hantaan virus persistence in mice: the balance between HTNV infection and CD8(+) T-cell responses.,"We established a viral persistence model that involves the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from immunocompetent mice (H-2(d)) into Hantaan virus (HTNV)-infected severe combined immunodeficient (SCID, H-2(d)) mice. The infection is maintained despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, without apparent signs of disease, and there is a correlation between HTNV persistence and the lack of HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells. In addition, disseminated HTNV infection before the initiation of immune responses appears to be important for virus persistence. The suppression of HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the present model appears to occur at the periphery. The present study also demonstrates that CD8(+) T cells contribute to the clearance of HTNV. Thus, it seems that HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells play a key role in HTNV persistence in mice. This model of viral persistence is useful for studies of immune responses and immunocytotherapy against viral infection.","['Araki K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Lee BH', 'Kariwa H', 'Takashima I', 'Arikawa J']",2004,322,2,Virology,"Araki K, et al.

15108430,[Rehabilitation therapy of convalescents after hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in outpatient clinic].,"AIM: To assess clinical efficacy of mineral water and perindopril in convalescents after hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in outpatient setting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered 113 HFRS convalescents. HFRS was confirmed serologically. The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 50) received no rehabilitation care; group 2 (n = 32) drank mineral water ""varzi-yatchi""; group 3 (n = 31) drank mineral water and took perindopril (2 mg/day). After-treatment continued for 30-35 days. The effect was assessed by a complex of clinical-laboratory and functional tests for examination of renal functions (Reberg-Tareev, Zimnitsky tests, estimation of uric acid clearance and renal functional reserve, an 18-hour water deprivation test).
RESULTS: Mineral water varzi-yatchi and perindopril had a favourable effect on clinical condition and renal functions of HFRS convalescents. Compared to the controls (p < 0.05), they had less severe weakness, lumbar pains, edema of the lower limbs; positive changes in intraglomerular hemodynamics, renal transport of beta 2-microglobulin (MG), uric acid transport.
CONCLUSION: It is shown that HFRS convalescents have defective glomerular and tubulointerstitial systems of the kidneys. These disorders demand a differential therapeutic approach. Drinking mineral water improves some tubular functions. The addition of perindopril is necessary in detection of arterial hypertension, impairment of intraglomerular hemodynamics, hyperexcretion of beta 2-MG, osmoregulating renal dysfunction.","['Pimenov LT', ""Vasil'ev MIu""]",2004,76,1,Ter Arkh,Pimenov LT and Vasil'ev MIu.

Siblings or dam/offsprings was identified within the population based on the relatedness calculation with the microsatellite data. The pairwise relatedness values obtained could reveal kinship among all vole individuals within the population. Based on the assessment of kinship, we did not find a positive relationship between hantavirus transmission and close kinship. Males infected with the hantavirus carried a relatively uncommon mitochondrial haplotype. However, these infected males shared low relatedness values and were not considered closely related, i.e., they were not siblings or parent/offspring. These observations imply that hantavirus transmission in the vole population may not be related to close kinship but by random horizontal infection.","['Iwasa MA', 'Kariwa H', 'Cui BZ', 'Lokugamage K', 'Lokugamage N', 'Hagiya T', 'Mizutani T', 'Takashima I']",2004,149,5,Arch Virol,"Iwasa MA, et al.

For several hantaviruses, the nucleocapsid (N) protein has proven to be very immunogenic in humans and rodents and even can protect rodents against a virus challenge. To investigate the immunogenicity of DOBV N protein, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were immunized three times with a DOBV recombinant N (rN) protein expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae together with complete Freund's, with incomplete Freund's, and without adjuvant, respectively. Mice of both strains elicited N-specific antibodies with end-point titers being as high as 1:1,000,000 in C57BL/6 mice.

METHOD: Clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of HFRS were analyzed in four patients. Patient sera were analyzed for Puumala (PUU) and Hantaan (HTN) viruses by immunofluorescence test (IFT) and immunoenzyme test (ELISA).
RESULTS: Epidemiologic studies confirmed the source of infection to be out of the area in three patients, whereas in one patient it was near Zadar area. Mild symptoms pointed to the disease. Pathologic findings showed pathologic leukocyte values (leukocytosis), two- to four-fold alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and creatinine increase in serum, proteinuria and erythrocyturia. A significant PUU antibody titer was found by serum IF and ELISA.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of HFRS in the Zadar area was confirmed by clinical description and laboratory evidence.

15011473,[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: possible dilemma in differential diagnosis].,"UNLABELLED: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are classical diseases characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is also a part of clinical picture in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Some overlap in other elements of clinical picture between TTP and HFRS is possible, which could pose difficulties in differential diagnosis. Early treatment of patients with TTP is essential and significantly improves the outcome, whereas the treatment of HFRS is mainly supportive. In the last ten years, we treated 13 patients with TTP and 17 patients with HFRS. Two patients with HFRS were initially treated as TTP because it was not possible to exclude TTP on the basis of clinical picture. Further clinical course and serologic tests excluded TTP and suggested HFRS.
CONCLUSION: Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish HFRS from TTP because thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are present in both diseases and overlaps in other parts of clinical picture are possible. The serious consequences of delay in the efficacious treatment of patients with TTP could also influence the physicians' decisions.","['Radonić R', 'Gasparović V', 'Ivanović D', 'Merkler M', 'Gubarev N', 'Zlopasa O']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Radonić R, et al.

We analyzed ultrasound changes of abdominal organs in patients with serologically verified HFRS, in order to assess the value of this method in the diagnosis of acute renal failure (ARF).
METHODS: The study included 14 sporadic patients with ARF and suspicion of HFRS, treated in 2002. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, prostate and retroperitoneum was performed on a Toshiba 220 SSA.
RESULTS: Parenchymal edema with increased echogenicity, sinus narrowing and enlargement of both kidneys were found in all 14 (100%) patients. Hepatosplenomegaly was found in seven (50%), ascites in four (28.6%), and pleural effusion in two (14.3%) patients. Increased thickness of the bladder wall was found in two (14.3%), gallbladder enlargement in one (7%), and edema of the pancreas in one (7%) patient.

15011471,[Small rodents in the forest ecosystem as infectious disease reservoirs].,"Due to numerousness of populations and width of ecologic valence, small rodents are important parts of almost any forest ecosystem. The represent an important animal group, which connects primary makers with higher trophic levels. They transmit various infectious diseases dangerous for the health of people and domestic and wild animals (trichinosis, leptospirosis, tick encephalitis, Lyme disease, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, etc.). The following species of small rodents live in forest ecosystems of Croatia: Chletrionomys glareolus Schreib., Arvicola terrestris L, M. subterraneus de Sel., M. arvalis Pall., M. agrestis L, M. multiplex Fat., Apodemus agrarius Pall., A. sylvaticus L. and A. flavicollis Melch. Small rodents transmit causative agents of diseases in active (excretion products) of passive (ectoparasites and endoparasites) ways. Their multiplication potential is quite high. Transmission of certain disease sometimes takes place extremely fast due to the high number of rodents, their high movability and distribution, and the fact that they easily get in touch with men and domestic and wild animals. The number of population of each species is directly influenced by abiotic and biotic factors and changes during one year and in a several year period. In a year when the influence of ecologic factors is favorable, it is presumed that the number of these rodents will significantly increase, by which the danger of their damaging effect also increases. The following factors influence the increase of a small rodent population: number and physiologic condition of the population, meteorologic conditions, habitat, food sources, natural enemies, and diseases. The occurrence of an epidemic is closely connected to the number and infectivity of causative agents. Regular control of the number of rodent population and their infectivity can help in planning preventive epidemiologic and sanitary measures to preclude the occurrence of epidemics and individual cases of disease among animals and humans who come in contact with forest (forest workers, holiday makers, hikers, soldiers, tourists, etc.).",['Margaletić J'],2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,Margaletić J.

15011470,[Ocular changes in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-originating zoonotic disease caused by Puumala and Dobrava viruses, which belong to the genus Hantavirus. The most prominent ocular change in HFRS is transient myopia, which lasts for up to one week and is due to a forward movement of the ocular anterior diaphragm and thickening of the lens. Other ophthalmic manifestations of HFRS are eyelid edema, conjunctival injection with or without hemorrhages, chemosis, anterior uveitis, retinal edema with or without hemorrhages, and photophobia. Acute glaucoma attacks, which are rare, could be explained by the increased intraocular pressure (IOP) due to edema and hemorrhage in the ciliary body, causing anterolateral rotation, relaxation of the zonules, and anterior movement of the lens. They are treated with mydriatic-cycloplegic and corticosteroid eye drops and with furosemide. However, there are also controversial reports on decreased IOP during the acute phase of HFRS. Despite the fact that ocular symptoms in HFRS are common generally they do not require any medical therapy and the recovery of the patients is complete.","['Tedeschi-Reiner E', 'Mandić Z', 'Grgić D']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Tedeschi-Reiner E, et al.

15011469,[Immunopathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome].,"Hantaviruses (HTV) cause two serious human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), posing a considerable public health problem worldwide. Immunopathogenesis has been suggested to be involved in both HFRS and HPS. A common feature of hantavirus diseases is an increased microvascular bed permeability, suggesting that vascular endothelium is a prime target of virus infection. Although HTV infect numerous cell lines and primary cells, it was considered that they do cause no cytopathic effect. Recently, we found HTV to cause a cytopathic effect and apoptosis in 293 HEK cells. Monocytes/macrophages also represent the important target cells, which may also have an important role in the spread of HTV from the primary site of infection. Both endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages may act as a rich source of cytokines/chemokines during the infection with HTV and additionally contribute to the HFRS/HPS immunopathogenesis. The main reservoirs of HTV are small rodents which are infected but do not have manifest disease. However, some studies show that T-lymphocytes may play an important role in rodent resistance to infection with HTV. Some clinical studies indicate the important role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of HFRS/HPS. The efficient anti-hantaviral cell-immune response in patients is mainly due to the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Our study also pointed to a decrease in the percentage of total naive (CD45RA) cells and an increase in the percentage of memory cells (CD45RO). Specific IgM antibodies appear at the very beginning of the diseases followed by an increase in specific IgG. Additionally, IgE antibodies have been suggested to play a role in HFRS immunopathogenesis. Immune complexes have been detected in the sera, on the surface of red blood cells and platelets, in urine, glomerull and dermal capillaries of HFRS patients. They may be responsible for increased capillary permeability, vascular injury, platelet lysis and kidney damage. The immunopathologic disorders accompanying HFRS/HPS are complex. As there is no appropriate animal model to investigate HFRS/HPS immunopathogenesis, we mostly rely on in vitro and rare clinical studies. Additional efforts in the research of immunopathogenesis caused by HTV, may contribute to better understanding of HFRS/HPS characteristics and course of disease, and improve the treatment and prevention.",['Markotić A'],2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,Markotić A.

METHODS: We analyzed published data from obligatory infectious disease reports and notification of deaths due to infectious diseases, data on the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemics in Croatia, and our own data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: During the 1987-2002 period, 555 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were recorded in Croatia, 160 (28.8%) of them in soldiers. The mortality rate was up to 15.4% (mean 1.1%) (6/555). The highest number of cases (317) were recorded during 2002. The epidemic started in winter. The highest number of cases were recorded in June and July, i.e., during the warm season characterized by an increased activity of both animals acting as infection reservoirs and humans as hosts. The epidemic spread almost throughout Croatia. The known natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome are Plitvice and Slunj areas, Dinara mountain, Velika and Mala Kapela mountains, Zagreb area (Velika Gorica and Jastrebarsko), Gorski kotar area (Ogulin, Delnice), west Slavonia, and Novska area. The disease has not been recorded in the littoral area and on Adriatic Islands. The disease was also recorded in the neighboring countries of Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. The identified causative agents include Dobrava and Puumala viruses of the genus Hantavirus, whereas the rodents Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius and Apodemus sylvaticus serve as the main reservoirs of the infection in Croatia. Typical biotopes of the infection in Croatia are deciduous woods.
CONCLUSION: The 2002 epidemic confirms the presumption that almost all continental part of Croatia contains natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.","['Mulić R', 'Ropac D', 'Gizdić Z', 'Sikić N']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Mulić R, et al.

15011467,[Clinical picture of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia].,"Among many viral hemorrhagic fevers, only hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) occurs in Croatia. HFRS is a natural focus zoonosis with sudden onset, characterized by high fever and other clinical symptoms, renal insufficiency and hemorrhages. In Croatia, HFRS is caused by two types of hantaviruses--Puumala (PUU) and Dobrava (DOB). The basic pathologic and patophysiologic disorder in HFRS is capillary damage (vasculitis). Incubation of HFRS has not been precisely determined, it is most frequently around two weeks. The disease onset is usually abrupt. At the beginning, general symptoms include high fever and myalgias, especially in the lumbar region, and abdominal pain, as well as strong headaches, malaise and nausea, and often vomiting or diarrhea. In half of the patients respiratory symptoms occur. Later on, some patients may experience hypotension, oliguria and other signs of renal failure, and apart from petechial, severe hemorrhages may also occur in other organs. During typical clinical presentation of the disease, some characteristic symptoms are clearly distinguished in particular stages of the disease. Therefore, the course of HFRS is usually divided into five distinct stages (febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric and convalescent). Such a course of the disease is more commonly present in case of DOB virus than PUU virus infection. The febrile stage with sudden onset usually lasts from 3 to 7 days, when thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration, as well as albuminuria and hematuria are almost always recorded. The hypotensive stage lasts from one to 2 days on an average and is characterized by lower blood pressure and signs of renal failure. The oliguric stage usually starts at the beginning of the second week of the disease, when extensive hemorrhage may occur and urea and creatinine reach their highest values. The oliguric stage is followed by the polyuric stage which can last for up to two weeks, and is characterized by excretion of a large quantity of urine of low specific gravity (up to 15 liters during 24 hours). The convalescence (convalescent stage) is slower, may last for several weeks or months, but usually resolves without complications. During the infection caused by PUU virus, the course of disease is usually milder with only two stages. The first one is febrile, followed by the second stage with renal symptoms, and rare and mild hemorrhagic manifestations. This type of disease is mostly encountered during epidemics. The mortality in severe cases of the disease (DOB virus) is 5% to 10%, whereas in PUU virus infection it is less than 1%.",['Kuzman I'],2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,Kuzman I.

15011466,[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia--historical review].,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been known from ancient times as a disease with many names, which raised great interest during the Korean war (1951-1954), occurring as a large epidemic (Korean hemorrhagic fever). Therefore, the subsequently discovered causative agent was named after the Hantaan River which runs along the 38th parallel and divides North Korea from South Korea. A similar disease was described in 1934 in Scandinavian countries (epidemic nephrosonephritis or nephropathy). During the Second World War, the disease was also registered as wartime nephritis in several European south-eastern countries. Since 1982, similar clinical manifestations of the disease, differently named in various parts of the world, have been assigned one unique name--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, as recommended by the World Health Organization. In Croatia, the first patient with HFRS was diagnosed in 1952 and the paper describing the case was published in 1954 (Radosevic and Mohacek). Since then, the disease has been regularly occurring in our country, especially in sporadic form, with only two smaller epidemics recorded until 1995. The first epidemic with 14 forestry workers involved occurred in 1967 at the Plitvice Lakes, and the second with the same number of soldiers in 1989 around the Pieso-Airport near Zagreb. Simultaneously, in 1967 and 1989 two large-scale epidemics of HFRS occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 144 cases each. Until the first large epidemic of HFRS in Croatia during the Croatian War in 1995, occurring at several localities (Mala Kapela, Dinara mountain, west Slavonia), it was considered that there were only several natural foci of the disease in Croatia (around Ogulin and Slunj, Plitvice Lakes, Zagreb surroundings). A total of 125 cases were reported to the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in 1995. Fifty patients, 45 of them soldiers, were hospitalized at Dr. Fran Mihaljević University Hospital for infectious Diseases in Zagreb. In the same year, the largest epidemic also occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina with more than 300 cases. During the almost 50-year experience in HFRS surveillance, we have noticed two different clinical manifestations of the disease. The milder type of illness without hemorrhage is more common than the severe type with hemorrhages and extensive renal insufficiency. After the virus discovery and introduction of serologic testing, two causative agents have been detected during the 1970s and 1980s--Vranica and Fojnica, that were later serotyped as Puumala and Dobrava viruses.","['Petricević I', 'Kuzman I']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,Petricević I and Kuzman I.

METHODS: A total of 146 sera from 100 clinically suspected patients were tested. The sera were tested for the presence of specific IgM antibodies to Hantaan and Puumala antigens by Elisa IgM ""capture"" test, and for the presence of specific antibodies to Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava antigens by Elisa IgG test.
DISCUSSION: Most of the positive IgM reactions were recorded as cross reactions to Hantaan and Puumala antigens, and most of the positive IgG reactions as cross reactions to Hantaan and Dobrava antigens. The finding of antibodies in the sera of patients from Europe that react with Hantaan antigen are not associated with the infection with Hantaan, but with the infection with viruses that are genetically related with Hantaan. To date, HFRS caused by Puumala and Dobrava viruses has been verified in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
CONCLUSION: Using Elisa IgM ""capture"" test, acute hantavirus infection was serologically confirmed in 38% of clinically suspected patients with manifested symptoms from different areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002.

It has been recently discovered that hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is present throughout Croatia, not just in the previously well known epidemic foci. Because of the similar clinical presentation and epidemiology of the two diseases, it is important to know the exact etiology of the current disease. The aim of this study was to determine the presentation of HFRS in northwest Croatia and possible coinfection in patients with leptospirosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the 1988-2000 period, 42 patients with leptospirosis from northwest Croatia were analyzed. Leptospiral infection was confirmed in all 42 patients by microagglutination test. Serology for hantaviruses was done by ELISA test in a few patients with leptospirosis and severe renal failure.
RESULTS: In the majority of patients (37/42: 88%) acute renal failure was mild or moderate, with creatinine values below 500 mol/l. However, 12% of the patients developed severe acute renal failure, with creatinine values over 500 mol/l. The main therapeutic regime in all patients with leptospiral infection included body fluid replacement (electrolyte and glucose infusions) and antibiotic therapy. In patients with severe acute renal failure, it was necessary to introduce hemodialysis treatment. There was no fatal outcome in our patients. Over the last few years, antibody titers to hantaviruses were assessed by ELISA testing in five patients with leptospiral infection and severe form of acute renal failure, confirming HFRS persistence in northwest Croatia Testing for specific antibodies to hantaviruses has been suggested in all patients with leptospirosis and in whole Croatia, especially in northwest Croatia.","['Golubić D', 'Markotić A']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,Golubić D and Markotić A.

The major epidemiologic, clinical and serologic findings are presented.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the HFRS outbreak, serum samples were obtained from 31 men from the Community and analyzed by ELISA IgM and IgG tests for Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava (DOBV) viruses. The main epidemiologic and clinical data were analyzed.
RESULTS: At the beginning of March 2002, a-30-year-old male from the Community developed severe clinical picture of HFRS with fulminant systemic hemorrhage, acute renal failure and consecutive death. IgM antibodies to DOBV were detected. HFRS was serologically confirmed in 15 subjects in total. All others were infected with PUUV. During the mild and dry winter, the Community members cut bushes, collected trash, branches and dry leaves near the beech-wood forest border to prepare that part of the field as a garden. They observed a number of rodents, their nests and holes. Most of the patients developed mild to moderate clinical picture with fever, headache, backache, myalgia, abdominal pain, melena, oliguria, polyuria, epistaxis, and conjunctival injection. Hepatitis B (HBV) and/or C (HCV) infection was recorded in 58.1% of Community members. Interestingly, 86.7% of the HFRS patients were HBV and/or HCV positive.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first HFRS outbreak described among drug addicts in Europe, mostly caused by PUUV. Further studies are needed to identify additional risk factors that may contribute to hantavirus infection among drug addicts in HFRS endemic regions in Croatia as well as in Europe.","['Miletić-Medved M', 'Markotić A', 'Kuzman I', 'Marić Z', 'Avsic-Zupanc T']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Miletić-Medved M, et al.

15011460,[Grading the severity of disease in patients with Puumala or Dobrava virus infections from 1995 to 2000 in Croatia].,"AIM: The aim of our study was to evaluate the proposed Croatian scale for grading the disease severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The aim was also to determine whether the infection with Dobrava virus (DOBV) in Croatia was associated with a more severe illness than the infection with Puumala virus (PUUV).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the scale, case records of 62 HFRS patients hospitalized at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb from 1995 till 2000 were reviewed. ELISA IgM and IgG tests were used for the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to PUUV or DOBV.
DISCUSSION: HFRS caused by hantaviruses is a zoonotic disease spread worldwide, posing a major public health problem of global dimensions. Recent epidemiologic studies show that almost all parts of Croatia are endemic regions for two hantaviruses, Puumala and Dobrava. The disease severity ranges from subclinical infection to severe illness with fatal outcome. Clinical picture is predominated by fever, myalgia, vomiting, hemorrhagic manifestation, visual impairment and kidney affection. There is still a lack of knowledge concerning all the parameters involved in the disease severity. Besides the type of virus and genetic material, host genes are also associated with the variable clinical course. HLA alleles B8, DR3, and DQ2 are strongly associated with severe outcome of PUUV infection, white HLA B27 allele is associated with a mild course. Whether similar genetic factors also operate in DOBV infection remains to be determined. Recently, a Croatian scale for grading the disease severity was proposed. The disease severity is graded by a scoring system (points attributed to specific clinical symptoms and laboratory findings) as 1--mild, 2--moderate, 3--severe, and 4--very severe. We found 60% of HFRS patients to be infected with PUUV and 40% with DOBV. In our study, 65% of patients infected with PUUV had mild, and 24% moderate disease. Severe and very severe disease was recorded in 11% of PUUV infected patients. In contrast, only 44% of patients infected with DOBV had mild disease, whereas 40% of patients showed a moderate clinical picture. Severe and very severe clinical picture was recorded in 16% of patients with DOBV infection. Statistical analysis showed a significant number of pa (p < 0.01) with PUUV infection to have mild disease, whereas a significant number of HFRS patients infected with DOBV had moderate (p < 0.01) and severe or very severe (p < 0.01) disease.
CONCLUSION: Our results clearly indicate that in Croatia DOBV infection is associated with a more severe disease than PUUV infection. However, we confirmed previous findings that even PUUV infection could lead to a severe disease. Our initial experience in the evaluation of the proposed grading scale for disease severity demonstrated the proposed Croatian scale to be a useful tool in grading disease severity in patients infected with PUUV or DOBV. Moreover, the proposed scale may also prove highly useful for the prognostic purpose.","['Cebalo L', 'Dusek T', 'Kuzman I', 'Markotić A']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Cebalo L, et al.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with clinical diagnosis HFRS were treated at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb. In 110 of HFRS suspected patients, the clinical diagnosis was verified serologically in 94 patients and they were included in the retrospective study. In 93 patients the diagnosis was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and in one patient by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results were analyzed by the use of descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Puumala (PUU) virus infection was verified in 80 (85.1%), Dobrava (DOB) infection in 8 (8.5%) and cross-reactive antibodies to both PUU and DOB viruses in 5 (5.3%) HFRS patients. In one patient who was confirmed by IFA the hantavirus serotype causing HFRS could not be determined.

The majority of HFRS cases occurred between May and August (75.5%). A high proportion of HFRS cases were found in the general population from Zagreb and its surroundings (78.7%). The majority of patients were hospitalized in the febrile stage of the disease (70.2%). The main symptoms were: fever (100%), headache (88.3%) and backache (87.2%). Oliguria was recorded in 56.4% and, anuria in 7.5% of patients, however, only three (3.2%) patients required hemodialysis. Six patients developed hemorrhagic manifestations, especially petechiae on the skin and mucosa. One patient in the convalescent stage had subarachnoidal bleeding. Six patients had pathologic electroencephalogram (EEG) findings and two developed epileptic seizures. Lumbar puncture was performed in 12 patients without inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Pathologic ECG findings were recorded in 30/79 (38.0%) patients, primarily including mild and translent disturbances such as sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, nonspecific alteration of the final complex and incomplete right bundle branch block. Conventional chest radiography revealed abnormal findings in 23/84 (27.4%) patients. The abnormalities consisted of interstitial infiltrates and/or pleural effusions and atelectasis. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the disease severity: mild in 74 (78.7%), moderate in 15 (16.0%), severe in 4 (4.2%), and very severe in one (1.1%) patient. The latter developed multiorgan failure and died.
CONCLUSION: The largest outbreak of HFRS to date was recorded in Croatia in 2002. Ninety-four patients with clinical and serologically verified HFRS were treated at the Dr. Fran Mihaljević University Hospital for Infectious Disease, Zagreb. The majority of patients were hospitalized between May and August. Most patients had mild form of the disease primarily caused by PUU virus.","['Puljiz I', 'Kuzman I', 'Turcinov D', 'Markotić A', 'Celjuska E']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Puljiz I, et al.

15011458,[The biggest epidemic of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia].,"INTRODUCTION: The largest outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) to date occurred in Croatia in the year 2002. The epidemic started in winter, lasted throughout spring to summer months, ending not earlier than November.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate and analyze the basic epidemiologic and clinical features of HFRS in Croatia by uniform and standardized prospective-retrospective analysis of all patients affected by the epidemic.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: When the epidemic started, a patient questionnaire with questions on the basic demographic data, site of infection and other epidemiologic characteristics, clinical symptoms, disease severity and laboratory results was designed. Data on 401 patient with a clinical diagnosis of HFRS were collected. The etiologic diagnosis of the disease was confirmed by ELISA, and in some patients by indirect immunofluorescence test (IFT). The results were analyzed using a descriptive statistical method.
RESULTS: HFRS was clinically diagnosed in 401 patients from all over Croatia. A total of 320 (79.8%) cases were reported to the Epidemiology Service of the National Institute of Public Health. The majority of patients (n = 128) were registered in June. Males were three times more affected than females. Apart from its long duration, this epidemic was characteristic for the involvement of general population, with only a small number of the affected from the potential risk groups (forestry workers 28, soldiers 14, farmers 18). The epidemic spread almost throughout inland Coratia. At least 44 patients were infected in the Plitvice Lakes area, 32 in Slunj, 27 on Sljeme, 24 in Velika, and at least 19 in the area of Kutjevo. The youngest patient was aged 4 and the oldest 80 years. The majority of patients were treated in Zagreb (University Hospital for Infectious Diseases--110, Zagreb University Hospital Center--3), followed by Karlovac (71 inpatients and 39 outpatients), Pozega (n = 79), and Rijeka (n = 37). Serologic analysis (ELISA method) detected Puumala virus in 161 and Dobrava virus in only 17 patients. The disease was confirmed by immunofluorescence method in 53 patients (mostly in Kariovac). During the 2002 outbreak, HFRS clinically manifested mostly in a milder form with general symptoms and transitory renal insufficiency, while hemorrhages were rarely recorded. According to our disease severity score, a mild form of the disease was recorded in 65%, moderately severe in 28%, severe in 5% and extremely severe form in 2% of the patients. One patient died. Two thirds of the patients were hospitalized during the febrile stage of the disease. All patients had fever, whereas headache and pain in the lumbar region were recorded in more than 90% of cases, polyuria in 75%, oliguira and vomiting in approximately 50%, respiratory symptoms in 35%, and hemorrhages (mostly on the skin and mucous membranes), vision disturbances, conjunctivitis and diarrhea in approximately 25% of patients. ESR was elevated in 64% and CRP in 93% of patients. Leukocytosis was recorded in 25% and thrombocytopenia in 70% of patients. Increased values of urea and creatinine and signs of liver damage were recorded in approximately 50% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: The largest outbreak of HFRS occurred in Croatia in 2002, with more than 400 diseased throughout Croatia. This epidemic confirmed our previous assumption that the whole Croatia, apart from its narrow coastline area and islands, is a natural focus of HFRS with different causative types of hantaviruses. Efforts should be made to conduct a comprehensive ecologic and mammologic study on hantaviruses and their biologic characteristics in these areas.","['Kuzman I', 'Puljiz I', 'Turcinov D', 'Markotić A', 'Turković B', 'Aleraj B', 'Andrić Z', 'Petković D', 'Tutek V', 'Herendić B', 'Iskra M', 'Pandak N', 'Misetić Z', 'Perić L', 'Jelaska D', 'Majetić-Sekovanić M', 'Ledina D', 'Misić-Majerus L', 'Radonić R']",2003,57,5,Acta Med Croatica,"Kuzman I, et al.

Some drugs, including allopurinol, can also cause this histopathologic appearance but to our knowledge in this setting the lesions are not so massive. Here we report a case of a 41-year-old female who developed fever, pruritic skin rash, jaundice, eosinophilia, abnormal liver function tests, and acute renal failure 3 weeks after the beginning of allopurinol treatment, complicated with severe hepatocyte necrosis around most terminal hepatic venules suggesting Budd-Chiari syndrome.","['Mete N', 'Yilmaz F', 'Gulbahar O', 'Aydin A', 'Sin A', 'Kokuludag A', 'Yuce G', 'Sebik F']",2003,13,4,J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol,"Mete N, et al.

14972540,Bovine aortic endothelial cells are susceptible to hantavirus infection; a new aspect in hantavirus ecology.,"Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to the family Bunyaviridae. They are the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hantaviruses show a worldwide distribution with specific rodent species as natural hosts. It is known that rodents can transmit the virus via feces, urine, saliva, or bites to humans. Additionally, antibodies against different hantaviruses were also found in domestic animals, For example, Danes et al. documented hantavirus-specific IgG titers in 2% of examined cattle [Ceskoslov. Epidemiol. Mikrobiol. Imunol. 41 (1992) 15]. In order to clarify the possibility of a nonrodent and nonhuman hantavirus infection, the susceptibility of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to Hantavirus serotype Puumala infection was investigated. The hantaviral nucleocapsid protein was detected in 95% of infected BAEC at the fourth cell culture passage 12 weeks after initial infection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The presence of Puumala virus (PUU) nucleocapsid protein and the viral glycoproteins G1 and G2 in infected cells were additionally confirmed by Western blot analysis. The viral RNA genome was identified in infected BAEC cultures and in cell-free culture medium at the fourth passage by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), verified by cDNA nucleotide sequence analysis, showing a 98-100% homology to the input virus. The infected BAEC cultures were shown to express alpha(V)beta(3)-integrin surface receptors that are known to mediate virus entry in human cells and revealed no major cytopathic effects (CPEs) as assayed by immunofluorescence staining of the cytoskeletal components actin and microtubules. In the present study, we documented for the first time that a nonrodent and nonhuman aortic endothelial cell culture of bovine origin (BAEC) can be efficiently infected with a hantavirus. This finding is of particular importance because it adds new aspects to questions dealing with host species barrier, viral reservoir, virus transmission, and ecology of hantaviruses.","['Muranyi W', 'Kehm R', 'Bahr U', 'Müller S', 'Handermann M', 'Darai G', 'Zeier M']",2004,318,1,Virology,"Muranyi W, et al.

To evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of this disease, we studied 2,468 reported cases from a highly disease-endemic region in northern Sweden. We found that, in particular, middle-aged men living in rural dwellings near coastal areas were overrepresented. The case-patients were most often infected in late autumn, when engaged in activities near or within manmade rodent refuges. Of 862 case-patients confident about the site of virus exposure, 50% were concentrated within 5% of the study area. The incidence of nephropathia epidemica was significantly correlated with bank vole numbers within monitored rodent populations in part of the region. Understanding this relationship may help forestall future human hantavirus outbreaks.","['Olsson GE', 'Dalerum F', 'Hörnfeldt B', 'Elgh F', 'Palo TR', 'Juto P', 'Ahlm C']",2003,9,11,Emerg Infect Dis,"Olsson GE, et al.

14696782,Prevalence of rabies virus and Hantaan virus infections in commensal rodents and shrews trapped in Bangkok.,"Five hundred rodents and shrews (Rattus norvegicus: 458, Rattus rattus: 28, Rattus exulans: 5, Mus musculus: 4 and Suncus murine: 5) trapped from the fresh food markets around Bangkok area were investigated for rabies virus and Hantaan virus infections. No rabies viral antigens in the animals' brains were detected by direct immunofluorescence. On the other hand, antibodies to Hantaan virus were demonstrated in the sera of 7 (1.53%) R. norvegicus caught in various markets using a particle agglutination technique. Further determination of the viral genome in rat lung tissue was performed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR, 3 (0.66%) out of 7 were positive. HindIII and HifI restriction enzyme analyses showed the pattern of the Hantaan virus genome in 2 samples and that of the Seoul virus genome in the other. The results of the present study suggest that rodents from Bangkok's fresh food markets did not carry rabies. Thus, getting rid of rabies in dogs or cats in the Bangkok area may be easier than anticipated because there are no sources of asymptomatic reservoirs. This may result in the low incidence of rabies patients observed in Bangkok. On the contrary, the presence of antibodies and the Hantaan virus genome and Seoul virus genome in R. norvegicus will definitely provide evidence for physicians to be aware of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and other clinical settings of Hantaan/Seoul virus disease in patients with a history of having contact with rats or their excreta.","['Kantakamalakul W', 'Siritantikorn S', 'Thongcharoen P', 'Singchai C', 'Puthavathana P']",2003,86,11,J Med Assoc Thai,"Kantakamalakul W, et al.

14555823,Serum albumin level correlates with disease severity in patients with Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome.,"Hypoalbuminemia frequently occurs in Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), but clinical significance of hypoalbuminemia is not well known. This study was designed to evaluate hypoalbuminemia as a marker of severity of disease in patients with HFRS. We evaluated the relationship between the level of serum albumin and clinical parameters representing the severity of disease in 144 patients with HFRS. The patients were divided into three groups based on the level of serum albumin; Group I (normal serum albumin), Group II (serum albumin <3.5 g/dL and >/=3.0 g/dL), and Group III (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL). Of the total of 144 patients, 42 patients (29.2%) were categorized as Group I, 39 patients (27.1%) as Group II, and 63 patients (43.8%) as Group III. Group III had a higher rate of incidence in episode of hypotension, pulmonary edema than did Group I and Group II. The lowest level of serum albumin was positively correlated with platelet count (r=0.505, p<0.001) and was negatively correlated with leukocyte count (r=-0.329, p<0.001), BUN (r=-0.484, p<0.001), serum creatinine (r=-0.394, p<0.001), and AST (r=-0.251, p=0.002).

We established a Northern blot hybridization (NB) procedure using digoxygenin-labeled RNA probes, to quantitate the hantaviral plus- and minus-strand RNAs separately. Virus RNA replication was analyzed in infected Vero E6 cells. When the Vero E6 cells were infected with Seoul virus strain KI-83-262 (KI) at m.o.i. = 0.25, the plus-strand RNA was detected within 1 h post-infection (hpi), and the minus-strand RNA was detected subsequently. Using laser confocal microscopy, the nucleocapsid protein (NP) was detected within 2 hpi, and accumulated as scattered granules in the cytoplasm until 24 hpi. In contrast, the G2 protein first appeared at 8 hpi, was immediately transported to the Golgi, and accumulated in the Golgi until 24 hpi. Infectious virus particles were released into the medium at 24 h hpi. These findings indicate that hantavirus RNA replication starts with the appearance of NP at 2 hpi, glycoproteins then accumulate gradually in the Golgi, and virion formation is initiated once the viral RNAs and proteins have accumulated.","['Kariwa H', 'Tanabe H', 'Mizutani T', 'Kon Y', 'Lokugamage K', 'Lokugamage N', 'Iwasa MA', 'Hagiya T', 'Araki K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Takashima I']",2003,148,9,Arch Virol,"Kariwa H, et al.

On examination, she had a normal body temperature, flushing of the face, conjunctive congestion, pharyngeal congestion, bulbar conjunctive edema, severe jaundice, petechiae and ecchymosis at sites of venipuncture, deranged liver and renal function tests, heavy proteinuria and hematuria, and coagulation disturbance. The diagnosis of HFRS complicating pregnancy was made on account of the clinical picture and antihantavirus IgM titer of 1:20. The patient's condition quickly deteriorated, with frank hematuria, oliguria and finally anuria, together with shock. Hemodialysis was immediately commenced, and a stillborn, male infant, of 3,200 g, was delivered vaginally following combined induction 12 hours after hemodialysis. The fetus showed no obvious abnormalities, but the parents declined an autopsy. After hemodialysis and delivery, the patient recovered and was discharged 3 weeks later. The repeat titer for antihantavirus IgM was 1:80 10 days after presentation.
CONCLUSION: HFRS is a rare complication of pregnancy. The symptoms are nonspecific. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are necessary to improve the maternal and fetal outcome. Clinicians should include this condition in the differential diagnoses when a combination of hematologic, hepatic, renal and gastrointestinal problems presents in pregnancy.","['Ma RM', 'Xiao H', 'Jing XT', 'Lao TT']",2003,48,8,J Reprod Med,"Ma RM, et al.

12910756,Hantavirus antibody occurrence in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) during a vole population cycle.,"Puumala virus, genus Hantavirus, is the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the natural reservoir species of this hantavirus. We initiated sampling of bank voles at sites of recently identified human nephropathia epidemica cases and paired control sites in the fall of 1995 in coastal areas of northern Sweden. Sites were trapped annually in spring and fall until 1999. Prevalence of antibody to Puumala virus was similar among local bank vole populations in the two types of sites over time. During peak years, however, the absolute number of bank voles was higher in case sites than control sites. Consequently, the likelihood of Puumala virus exposure was increased at case sites during population highs. This would imply that the risk of Puumala virus exposure to conspecifics and humans is habitat and site dependent with a temporal component.","['Olsson GE', 'Ahlm C', 'Elgh F', 'Verlemyr AC', 'White N', 'Juto P', 'Palo RT']",2003,39,2,J Wildl Dis,"Olsson GE, et al.

12898330,Serological analysis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients in Far Eastern Russia and identification of the causative hantavirus genotype.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in East Asia and Europe. The disease is caused by several viruses belonging to the genus Hantavirus, including the Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava Belgrade virus (DOBV), and Puumala virus (PUUV). Recently, HTNV-related viruses, Amur (AMR) and Far East (FE) genotypes were identified as causative agents of HFRS in Far Eastern Russia. To investigate the epidemiology of HFRS and virus transmission, we collected sera from 17 acute and 32 convalescent patients who were clinically diagnosed with HFRS in the Khabarovsk region of Far Eastern Russia, and detected anti-hantavirus antibodies using an ELISA that can differentiate the infected virus serotype using truncated hantavirus nucleocapsid protein antigen. Sixteen of the 17 acute phase patients had antibodies to hantavirus, and all the positive sera had higher optical densities for HTNV-specific antigen than for SEOV-, DOBV-, or PUUV-specific antigens. The partial M segment of the viral genome was amplified from blood clots from three acute patients by PCR. The nucleotide sequences had closer identities to the FE genotype (>96%) than to the prototype HTNV (88 to 89%) or AMR genotype (81 to 83%). A phylogenetic analysis found that the virus sequences from the patients clustered with the FE type, and were distinct from the AMR type. Thirty-one of 32 convalescent patient sera had antibodies to HTNV-specific antigen. These data suggest that our ELISA system can detect HTNV-specific antibodies to the FE type, which may be responsible for most of the HFRS in Khabarovsk.","['Miyamoto H', 'Kariwa H', 'Araki K', 'Lokugamage K', 'Hayasaka D', 'Cui BZ', 'Lokugamage N', 'Ivanov LI', 'Mizutani T', 'Iwasa MA', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Takashima I']",2003,148,8,Arch Virol,"Miyamoto H, et al.

There are only a few reports available on hantavirus infections from Spain. Although the results of these earlier studies indicated the presence of hantavirus infections, no confirmative or serotype-specific analyses have been performed.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether hantaviruses cause human infection/disease in Spain.
STUDY DESIGN: Ten thousand, four hundred and eighteen serum samples from the general population and 599 sera from 492 patients with potential hantavirus infections (renal disease, pneumonia or hepatitis) were initially screened by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using Hantaan, Seoul and Puumala hantavirus antigens. Altogether 193 suspicious samples (165 from healthy people and 28 from patients) were selected for confirmation by quality-assured assays.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 165 pre-screened serum samples from healthy individuals, only five could be confirmed by IFA for hantavirus-reactive antibodies (using Dobrava, Saaremaa, Hantaan or Puumala virus antigens). In addition, one serum was found weakly positive for hantavirus-reactive IgG by ELISA using recombinant Saaremaa virus (SAAV) nucleocapsid (N) antigen, and subsequently confirmed by immunoblotting. Thus, the results indicated a low (0.06%) total antibody prevalence to hantaviruses in Spain. Of 28 pre-screened serum samples from hospitalized patients, eight reacted as positive or showed border-line reactivities for hantavirus-specific IgM by ELISA using recombinant Saaremaa and Puumala virus N antigens. The IFA/ELISA reactive/border-line samples were subsequently analyzed by a focus reduction neutralization test, which revealed low titers (1:80) against SAAV in two samples from a patient with hepatic disease.

12857910,Hantavirus-specific CD8(+)-T-cell responses in newborn mice persistently infected with Hantaan virus.,"The relationship between virus-specific CD8(+)-T-cell responses and viral persistence was studied in mice by using Hantaan virus (HTNV). We first established a simple method for measuring levels of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells by flow cytometry. Next, to produce a mouse model of persistent HTNV infection, newborn mice were inoculated subcutaneously within 24 h of birth with 1 or 0.1 50% newborn mouse lethal dose of HTNV. All mice that escaped lethal infection were persistently infected with HTNV until at least 30 days after virus inoculation and had no virus-specific CD8(+) T cells producing gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Subsequently, the virus was eliminated from some of the mice, depending on the appearance of functional virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, which have the ability to produce IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and have cytotoxic activity. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all mice, regardless of the presence or absence of virus. In the acute phase, which occurs within 30 days of infection, IFN-gamma-producing HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected on day 15 after virus inoculation. However, TNF-alpha production and the cytotoxic activity of these specific CD8(+) T cells were impaired and HTNV was not removed. Almost all of these specific CD8(+) T cells disappeared by day 18. These results suggest that functional HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells are important for clearance of HTNV.","['Araki K', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Lee BH', 'Kariwa H', 'Takashima I', 'Arikawa J']",2003,77,15,J Virol,"Araki K, et al.

METHODS: A set of database was set up using the information collected and linked to electronic maps of China in a software ArcGIS 8.01 from 41 HFRS surveillance sites during 1995 - 1998. A HFRS spatial distribution model was developed using inverse distance weighted interpolation of ArcGIS's spatial analysis method. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in each HFRS surveillance site was extracted from SPOT4 satellite vegetation imagery. Correlation analysis was performed through SPSS 10.0 to analyze the association between NDVI and HFRS incidence, HFRS risk areas were mapped under different colors.
RESULTS: Spatial distribution model from HFRS surveillance sites showed that HFRS foci mainly presented in the Heilongjiang River drainage, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Jinghang grant Canal-Huaihe River drainage. It was consistent with HFRS distribution map derived from national infectious disease reporting system. Correlation analysis indicated that HFRS incidence rates were significantly associated with NDVI (r = 0.417, P < 0.01). The HFRS risk areas was mapped according to NDVI of each surveillance site.

12715067,[Hantaviruses].,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic diseases that affect humans and have a worldwide distribution. The hemorrhagic fever associated with renal syndrome occurs endemically in the Asian and European continents affecting housauds of people every year. Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, recognized as a clinical entity since 1993, represents the prototype of emerging diseases and is distributed in countries of the American continent, including Brazil. Both diseases are transmitted to man through the inhalation of viral particles, which are shed in feces and urine of wild and domestic rodents. They comprise a group of febrile diseases that can affect many organs, particularly the kidneys in the hemorrhagic fever associated with renal syndrome and the lungs and heart in the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The lethality of American hantaviroses reaches 50%. The diagnosis of these diseases is performed using serological tests such as immunoenzymatic assays which detect specific antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes. There is no specific treatment. Therefore, special attention should be directed to restore and maintain fluid balance, timely indication of dialysis for renal failure and administration of vasoactive drugs during periods of hypotension and shock. The administration of corticosteroids and/or ribavirin are under evaluation. The number of cases of hantavirus infection has been increasing in Brazil year after year, and it is important to alert health personnel to the occurrence of these entities throughout the country. Awareness of their presence should improve the quality of medical care.",['Ferreira MS'],2003,36,1,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,Ferreira MS. [Hantaviruses].

12706671,Inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine derived from suspension culture of Vero cells.,"We have developed a cell culture-derived, inactivated vaccine against Hantaan virus for prevention of the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Hantaan virus was purified from a microcarrier culture of Vero E6 cells by ultrafiltration and density gradient centrifugation. Viral infection was inactivated by treatment of the viral stock with formaldehyde. Immunogenic properties of the vaccine were characterized in comparison with Hantavax, a mouse brain-derived, formalin-inactivated vaccine that has been in human use for a decade in Korea. Compared to the Hantavax, immunization of Balb/c mice with the cell culture-based vaccine resulted in a moderate difference in antibody response to the viral nucleocapsid protein but more than five-fold increase in neutralizing activity. Moreover, all six mice immunized with 5 microg of the cell culture-based vaccine were fully protected from challenge with infectious virus, whereas virus was detected in lung and spleen of all animals immunized with the same dose of Hantavax. Four times higher dose of the latter vaccine was needed for complete protection. In the analysis of the humoral immune response to the vaccines, we found that all three viral structural proteins, N, G1 and G2 were immunoprecipitated by sera from animals immunized with the cell culture-based vaccine. In contrast, N and some G1 but no G2 were precipitated by the sera from animals immunized with Hantavax. These results suggest that the cell culture-based vaccine can provide more effective immunity than the Hantavax.","['Choi Y', 'Ahn CJ', 'Seong KM', 'Jung MY', 'Ahn BY']",2003,21,17-18,Vaccine,"Choi Y, et al.

12706090,Human recombinant neutralizing antibodies against hantaan virus G2 protein.,"Old world hantaviruses, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), still present a public health problem in Asia and Eastern Europe. The majority of cases has been recorded in China. The aim of our study was to generate human recombinant neutralizing antibodies to a hantavirus by phage display technology. To preserve the structural identity of viral protein, the panning procedure was performed on native Hantaan (HTN) (76-118) virus propagated in Vero-E6 cells. In total, five complete human recombinant IgG antibodies were produced in a baculovirus expression system. All of them were able to completely neutralize HTN, and Seoul (SEO) virus in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Three of these antibodies could also completely neutralize Dobrava (DOB) virus but not Puumala (PUU) virus. All antibodies bind to Hantaan virus G2 protein localized in the virus envelope. The sequence areas within the HTN (76-118)-G2 protein detected by five selected antibodies were mapped using peptide scans. Two partial epitopes, 916-KVMATIDSF-924 and 954-LVTKDIDFD-963, were recognized, which presumably are of paramount importance for docking of the virus to host cell receptors. A consensus motif 916-KVXATIXSF-924 could be identified by mutational analysis. The neutralizing antibodies to the most widely distributed hantaviruses causing HFRS might be promising candidates for the development of an agent for prevention and treatment of HFRS in patients.","['Koch J', 'Liang M', 'Queitsch I', 'Kraus AA', 'Bautz EK']",2003,308,1,Virology,"Koch J, et al.

METHODS: Data on the incidence rate was collected from the whole province to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of HFRS. Data on the density of rats, proportion of rats with virus, index of rats with virus and the human inapparent infection rate were collected in special areas according to the standardised protocol in the project.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of HFRS reduced continuously in Jiangsu province, with a 42.17% reduction from 1996 to 2000. The ratio between the incidence rate of autumn-winter peak and spring peak had also reduced. The main host in spring was Rattus norvegicus (with a density of 3.07%), while that in autumn was Apodemus agrarius (with a density of 4.64%). The density of main hosts and mixed species of rats had all reduced during the five years of observation. The proportions of Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus agrarius, Mus musculus with virus were relatively high in spring and autumn. The index of Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus with virus in spring were 0.025 5 and 0.028 4 respectively, while that of Apodemus agrarius with virus in autumn was 0.030 2. The average human inapparent infection rate was 4.73% in the five years.
CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of HFRS in Jiangsu reduced significantly from 1996 to 2000, but the risk factors still widely existed.

12682619,Hantaviruses: a tale of two hemispheres.,"Infectious febrile nephropathies, initially described as epidemics during military campaigns in Europe and Asia at the turn of the 20(th) century, were eventually all unified under the rubric of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and ascribed to infection from rodent-borne hantaviruses. At the end of the century, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was described throughout the Americas as a consequence of infection with the New World hantaviruses. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these diseases are linked to the ecology of their associated rodent hosts. Murine rodents (Old World mice and rats) are associated with the severe forms of HFRS in Asia and the Balkans due to Hantaan, Dobrava, and Seoul viruses. Hantaan virus causes an estimated 50-100,000 infections a year in China alone. Arvicoline rodents (voles) are associated with a mild form of HFRS in Europe called nephropathia epidemica due to Puumala virus. Sigmodontine rodents (New World rats and mice) are associated with approximately 200 HPS cases per year throughout the Americas caused by over a dozen viruses. The viruses are mainly transmitted as small-particle aerosols of rodent excreta, and the subsequent infections share cardiovascular shock as a prominent feature, although HFRS causes predominantly renal disease, while HPS causes a predominantly non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema - hemorrhage involvement varies in the syndromes on the basis of virus subtypes. Efforts are underway to refine prevention strategies, understand the pathogenesis of the shock, and identify therapeutic modalities.","['Khan A', 'Khan AS']",2003,45,1,Panminerva Med,Khan A and Khan AS.

12680691,Expression of interferon inducible genes following Hantaan virus infection as a mechanism of resistance in A549 cells.,"Hantaan virus (HTN) is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Little is known of its pathogenesis or the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to HTN infection. In the present study, DNA microarray technology was used to monitor changes in mRNA levels after HTN infection, to elucidate resistance mechanisms to viral infection by understanding virus-host interactions. We found that several interferon (IFN)-inducible genes were up-regulated in host cells infected with HTN. According to previous available data, IFNs have been reported to be inhibitory, but their mode of action has not been yet clear. In this study, the 2',5'-oligoadenylated synthetase (OAS) and Mx1 genes, not a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), of the IFN response pathways are associated with antiviral activity during HTN infection. Furthermore, A549 cells treated with IFN-alpha were protected against HTN infection. Taken together, these results confirmed that IFN plays a role in cellular defenses against HTN infection at an early stage of the infection and revealed the resistance mechanism for HTN infection.","['Nam JH', 'Hwang KA', 'Yu CH', 'Kang TH', 'Shin JY', 'Choi WY', 'Kim IB', 'Joo YR', 'Cho HW', 'Park KY']",2003,26,1,Virus Genes,"Nam JH, et al.

The specificities and sensitivities of the Puumala-, Dobrava- and Hantaan virus -specific tests varied from 96 to 100%, whereas, the combination test showed 96% specificity and 80 to 93% sensitivity. Cross-reactions were observed commonly between the Dobrava and the Hantaan virus tests, but only rarely between the Puumala and the Hantaan virus, or the Puumala and the Dobrava virus, tests. Altogether, the rapid tests showed less cross-reactivity than the respective EIA tests. According to the results, the performance of these tests meets well the requirements for diagnostic use.

12521363,Hantaviruses. a short review.,"OBJECTIVES: Hantaviruses are rodent viruses that have been identified as etiologic agents of 2 diseases of humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). This article presents a concise review of hantavirus biology, the medical features of HFRS and HPS, and tests for the detection of hantavirus infections in humans.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is a disease found outside the Americas and denotes a group of clinically similar illnesses that vary in severity relative to the causative agent. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is associated with higher mortality than HFRS, was first recognized as a hantavirus disease in 1993, and occurs within the American continents. Recent genetic studies show that both Old and New World hantavirus species coevolved with specific rodent hosts. The list of distinct hantaviruses associated with HPS is growing. The burgeoning human population is causing disruption of natural habitats as more and more land is cleared for commercial and residential purposes. Many rodents readily adapt to life in human settlements, where they generally benefit from reduced predation and where they sometimes proliferate to high numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: Although often referred to as emerging pathogens, HPS-associated hantaviruses emerge through increased exposure of humans to rodents and their excreta, not through genetic drift or reassortment of the viral genome. Based on current human population growth and development trends, hantavirus diseases will become more common in the near future unless public health measures are taken to curtail or eliminate rodents from human communities.",['Lednicky JA'],2003,127,1,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Lednicky JA.

Autopsy findings typically reveal a common feature of increased permeability in microvascular beds, suggesting vascular endothelium is a prime target for virus infection. Endothelial cells are susceptible to hantavirus infection; however, virus does not cause cytopathic effects, to explain increased endothelium permeability. Therefore, immune mechanisms were suggested to play a crucial role in hantavirus pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize data on hantavirus-induced immune disturbances and discuss their implication in capillary leakage caused by hantavirus infection.","['Khaiboullina SF', 'St Jeor SC']",2002,15,4,Viral Immunol,Khaiboullina SF and St Jeor SC.

METHODS: Gamasid mites collected from the nests of wild rodents and chigger mites collected from the bodies of wild rodents and thick growth of grass in the field were raised. Two oligonucleotide primers were developed based on the gene fragments of cDNA of HV 76 - 118 strain to be used in RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from the suspension of the gamasid mites from the nests where rodents no HV had been found in whose lungs lived and from the unfed larvae of chigger mites, being formed groups of 5, 10, 30, or 50 individuals. RT-PCR was conducted to detect the HV-RNA in such suspension. The larvae, nymphs, and imagines of both kinds of mites were ground to make suspension at an interval of 20 days. Vero-E(6) cells were inoculated to measure the titer of 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml of HV. Frozen sections of larvae, nymphs, and imagines of both kinds of mites were made. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were conducted to detect the distribution of HV-positive particles. Monoclonal antigen technique was used to compare the antigenicity of the HV-RNA from the rodents, mites, and patients from the same epidemic areas.
RESULTS: HV-RNA was detected in gamasid mites and chigger mites. Except in the larvae of chigger mites 60 days after collection, titers of HV were detected and increased gradually in mites at different stages of life cycle. HV-RNA positive particles were detected in the epithelial cells of midgut and ovary, with the signal denser and more numerous in nymphs than in larvae. The genotypes of HV from rodents, mites and patients in the same endemic areas were identical: HTN type virus.
CONCLUSION: HV can be transmitted transstadially and proliferated in mites, gamasid mites and chigger mites play the role of vectors of transmission for HFRS.","['Zhang Y', 'Zhu J', 'Tao K', 'Wu G', 'Guo H', 'Wang J', 'Zhang J', 'Xing A']",2002,82,20,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Zhang Y, et al.

12502882,Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-associated hantaviruses contain conserved and functional ITAM signaling elements.,"Hantaviruses infect human endothelial and immune cells, causing two human diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We have identified key signaling elements termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the G1 cytoplasmic tail of all HPS-causing hantaviruses. ITAMs direct receptor signaling within immune and endothelial cells and the presence of ITAMs in all HPS-causing hantaviruses provides a means for altering normal cellular responses which maintain vascular integrity. The NY-1 G1 ITAM was shown to coprecipitate a complex of phosphoproteins from cells, and the G1 ITAM is a substrate for the Src family kinase Fyn. The hantavirus ITAM coprecipitated Lyn, Syk, and ZAP-70 kinases from T or B cells, while mutagenesis of the ITAM abolished these interactions. In addition, G1 ITAM tyrosines directed intracellular interactions with Syk by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. These findings demonstrate that G1 ITAMs bind key cellular kinases that regulate immune and endothelial cell functions. There is currently no means for establishing the role of the G1 ITAM in hantavirus pathogenesis. However, the conservation of G1 ITAMs in all HPS-causing hantaviruses and the role of these signaling elements in immune and endothelial cells suggest that functional G1 ITAMs are likely to dysregulate normal immune and endothelial cell responses and contribute to hantavirus pathogenesis.","['Geimonen E', 'LaMonica R', 'Springer K', 'Farooqui Y', 'Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Mackow ER']",2003,77,2,J Virol,"Geimonen E, et al.

The viral hemorrhagic fevers endemic in the Americas include yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, the South American hemorrhagic fevers, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Because these diseases are primarily zoonotic, the distribution of any given virus is generally restricted by the distribution of its natural reservoir or arthropod vector. A high index of suspicion, detailed investigation of the travel and exposure history of the patient, and a basic understanding of the incubation periods and distributions of the various reservoirs of hemorrhagic fever viruses are imperative, as are prompt notification and laboratory confirmation.

12480503,Neonatal sex steroids affect responses to Seoul virus infection in male but not female Norway rats.,"Previous studies illustrate that after inoculation with Seoul virus (i.e., the naturally occurring hantavirus found in Norway rats), adult male rats produce higher antibody responses, exhibit higher Th1 responses (i.e., IgG2a, IL-2, and IFN gamma), and shed virus longer than females, but these difference are not altered by manipulation of sex steroids in adulthood. To determine whether sex steroid hormones organize adult responses to hantavirus infection, at 2-4 days of age, male rats were gonadectomized and female rats were injected with testosterone. As adults, animals were inoculated with 10(4)pfu of Seoul virus. Neonatally gonadectomized males (NGM), control females (CF), and neonatal testosterone-treated females (NTF) had lower anti-Seoul virus IgG and IgG2a responses than control males (CM) 20, 30, and 40 days post-inoculation. Neonatal testosterone treatment had no effect on female antibody responses to infection. NGM, CF, and NTF shed virus in saliva and feces for a shorter duration than CM. There was no effect of neonatal hormone manipulation either on the percentage of animals with detectable virus or on the number of virus copies within each target organ. Genetic males, regardless of hormone manipulation, had higher virus replication in lung tissue than did genetic females.

We selected two G1 glycoprotein-specific clones and one nucleocapsid protein (N)-specific clone from the Fab library for further studies. The human Fab antibodies were converted to IgG form in baculovirus/insect cells system by using cassette vectors that we developed earlier. Characterization of the recombinant antibodies revealed that the two G1-specific IgGs, could bind to and neutralize HTNV but not Seoul virus (SEOV). The N-specific IgG did not neutralize either HTNV or SEOV. Sequence analysis revealed that the two G1-specific clones differed by only one predicted amino acid in their complementarity determining regions, CDR3. Epitope mapping studies were carried out with one of the two G1-specific clones and synthetic peptides representing portions of HTNV G1. Results indicated that the recombinant antibody recognizes the core amino acid sequence LTKTLVIGQ, which is found near the C-terminus of HTNV G1.

Among these MAbs, 13 were directed against viral nucleocapsid protein (NP), four recognized the viral envelope glycoprotein G2 and one reacted with both NP and G2. Only those MAbs that recognize the epitopes on G2 were positive in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and had in vitro virus-neutralizing activity and in vivo protective activity against HTNV infection of susceptible mice. Since all the mice were protected by administration of the virus-neutralizing MAbs one day before and two days after HTNV challenge, these neutralizing MAbs are potentially useful for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and for immunotherapy of HTNV infection.

Animal and bird migration as well as human travel and international trade have extended, to an alarming degree, the dissemination of other viral infections. Malaria is an increasing global challenge to human health, a reversal of the downward trend that was achieved in the latter half of the 20th century. Moreover, evidence is currently accumulating for the existence of a fifth species of Plasmodium in man. In the bacterial and protozoal fields, other novel organisms are being described. Powerful new tools of molecular biology are being deployed to probe parasite genetics, for example to reveal the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. These and molecular immunological techniques are also helping to resolve puzzling taxonomic questions, as well as aiding epidemiological studies that are revealing the unforeseen scale of human infection with a number of parasitic helminths in both tropic and temperate climatic areas.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative. Two weeks later, he developed HFRS caused by the Puumala virus. We performed two-color immunofluorescence cytometry with monoclonal antibodies identifying the activation markers on T cells. Serum samples were also examined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the presence of interleukins IL-2 and IL-6 and their soluble receptors (sR). The analysis of early and late activation markers during the period of incubation revealed a small increase in the percentage of helper (CD4+CD25+) T cells and no significant increase in total activated (HLA-DR+TCR+) and cytotoxic (CD8+CD71+) T cells as compared with healthy controls. In the serum, only the concentration of soluble IL-6 receptor was increased. However, when the patient developed HFRS, all activation markers on T cells increased. Concentrations of sIL-2Ralpha and IL-6 remained increased two and six days after HFRS onset, respectively, whereas sIL-6R increased six days after HFRS onset. IL-2 concentration did not change. Our case indicates that rapid, modern diagnostic tools are necessary in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and their differential diagnosis. Immunological tests, which provide information on the patient immune status and especially on early changes in immune parameters, may contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of HFRS.","['Markotić A', 'Gagro A', 'Dasić G', 'Kuzman I', 'Lukas D', 'Nichol S', 'Ksiazek TG', 'Sabioncello A', 'Rode O', 'Rabatić S', 'Dekaris D']",2002,43,5,Croat Med J,"Markotić A, et al.

12402401,Epidemiologic characteristics and military implications of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in croatia.,"AIM: To analyze epidemiologic characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia, including military implications of the disease and measures for its prevention.
METHOD: We analyzed data from obligatory infectious disease reports and notification of deaths due to infectious diseases, data on the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemics in Croatia, and data collected by survey of the population, serological findings, and studies of wild rodents serving as reservoirs of the infection.
RESULTS: During the 1987-2001 period, 235 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were recorded in Croatia, with 147 (62.6%) of them among Croatian Army soldiers. Mortality rate was up to 15.4% (mean 2.2%) (5/235). The highest number of cases was recorded in months of June and July, ie, during the warm season characterized by increased activity of both the animals acting as infection reservoirs and humans as hosts. The known natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have been Plitvice and Slunj areas, Velika and Mala Kapela mountains, Zagreb area (Velika Gorica and Jastrebarsko), west Slavonia, Novska area, and Dinara Mountain. The disease has not been recorded in the littoral area and Adriatic islands. The identified causative agents include Dobrava and Puumala viruses of the genus Hantavirus, whereas rodents Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius, and Apodemus sylvaticus serve as the main reservoirs of the infection. Typical biotopes of the infection in Croatia are deciduous woods. The measures of prevention in Croatia include pest control, disinfection, hygienic waste disposal, preventing rodent access to food and water, proper choice of camping sites, and health education.
CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome occurs predominantly in soldiers, in a sporadic or epidemic form. Because of the course of disease and potentially lethal outcome, the disease has a considerable impact on the field task performance and combat readiness of military units, and is of great importance for a military community. Accommodation in permanent buildings with appropriate common and personal hygiene standards is recommended.","['Mulić R', 'Ropac D']",2002,43,5,Croat Med J,Mulić R and Ropac D.

12376753,Pathogenic hantaviruses selectively inhibit beta3 integrin directed endothelial cell migration.,"Hantaviruses cause two diseases of man, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses use beta3 and beta1 integrins, respectively, to enter endothelial cells. Beta3 integrins were recently reported to bind receptors that regulate vascular permeability suggesting that hantavirus beta3 integrin interactions may regulate endothelial cell function and contribute to viral pathogenesis. In this study we investigated the ability of pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses to regulate beta3 and beta1 integrin directed endothelial cell functions. We found that pathogenic NY-1, SNV, HTN, SEO and PUU viruses blocked endothelial cell migration on beta3, but not beta1, integrin ligands. Migration is similarly inhibited by antibodies to beta3 integrins which selectively block vitronectin directed endothelial cell migration. As a result, the ability of endothelial cells to migrate on integrin ligands was selectively inhibited by only pathogenic hantaviruses. Infection by NY-1 virus inhibited endothelial cell migration as early as 24-48 h post-infection. In contrast, non-pathogenic PH and TUL viruses had no effect on the ability of endothelial cells to migrate on either beta3 or beta1 integrin ligands from 1 to 5 days post-infection. These findings indicate that only hantaviruses which use beta3 integrins, and are associated with HPS and HFRS diseases, functionally dysregulate endothelial cell migration. These findings further demonstrate that hantaviruses regulate only beta3 integrin directed endothelial cell functions and have no effect on beta1 integrin functions.

12368479,Pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses differentially regulate endothelial cell responses.,"Hantaviruses cause two human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hantaviruses infect human endothelial cells but cause little or no damage to the infected endothelium. We analyzed with Affymetrix DNA Arrays (Santa Clara, CA) the endothelial cell transcriptional responses directed by hantaviruses associated with HPS [New York-1 virus (NY-1V)], HFRS [Hantaan virus (HTNV)], or by a hantavirus not associated with human disease [Prospect Hill virus (PHV)]. Hantavirus infections induced 117 cellular genes and repressed 25 genes by >3-fold, 4 days postinfection (p.i.). Although >80% of cells were infected by each virus 1 day p.i., PHV induced or repressed 67 genes at this early time compared with three genes altered by HTNV or NY-1V. The early high-level induction of 24 IFN-stimulated genes by PHV (4- to 229-fold) represents a fundamental difference in the temporal regulation of cellular responses by pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses. Because all hantaviruses induced >23 IFN-stimulated genes at late times p.i., pathogenic hantaviruses appear to suppress early cellular IFN responses that are activated by nonpathogenic hantaviruses. At late times p.i., 13 genes were commonly induced by HTNV and NY-1V that were not induced by PHV. In contrast to NY-1V, HTNV uniquely induced a variety of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules (i.e., IL-8, IL-6, GRO-beta, ICAM), as well as two complement cascade-associated factors that may contribute to immune components of HFRS disease. NY-1V failed to induce most cellular chemokines directed by HTNV (3/14) or genes primarily activated by NF-kappaB. However, NY-1V uniquely induced beta3 integrin-linked potassium channels, which could play a role in HPS-associated vascular permeability. These studies provide a basic understanding of hantavirus-directed cellular responses that are likely to differentiate pathogenic and nonpathogenic hantaviruses, contribute to HFRS and HPS pathogenesis, and provide insight into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.","['Geimonen E', 'Neff S', 'Raymond T', 'Kocer SS', 'Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Mackow ER']",2002,99,21,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Geimonen E, et al.

12208874,Long-lived memory T lymphocyte responses after hantavirus infection.,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is an important public health problem in large parts of Europe. We examined the memory cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in 13 Finnish individuals who had HFRS between 1984 and 1995. In seven of these donors, we detected virus-specific CTL responses against the PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein after in vitro stimulation with PUUV. Six novel CD8(+) CTL epitopes were defined on the N protein and were found to be restricted by various HLA alleles including A2, A28, B7, and B8. This is the first demonstration of PUUV-specific CTL responses in humans, and the first identification of CTL epitopes on PUUV. In addition, this study provides one of the few characterizations of a human antiviral memory T cell response, without the complicating issues of virus persistence or reinfection. Interferon (IFN)-gamma ELISPOT analysis showed that memory CTL specific for these epitopes were present at high frequency in PUUV-immune individuals many years after acute infection in the absence of detectable viral RNA. The frequencies of PUUV-specific CTL were comparable to or exceeded those found in other viral systems including influenza, EBV and HIV, in which CTL responses may be boosted by periodic reinfection or virus persistence.","['Van Epps HL', 'Terajima M', 'Mustonen J', 'Arstila TP', 'Corey EA', 'Vaheri A', 'Ennis FA']",2002,196,5,J Exp Med,"Van Epps HL, et al.

Both factors have been associated with severe Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE). To examine which part of this extended haplotype might show the strongest association with the outcome of NE, the HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, and TNF-alpha(-308) alleles in 116 hospital-treated patients with NE were analyzed. The findings pointing to clinically severe NE were strongly associated with HLA-B8-DR3 haplotype. There was a trend toward severe disease in persons positive for TNF-2. This was probably due to strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B8-DR3, since there were no differences in the clinical severity of NE when TNF-2-positive/B8-DR3-negative persons were compared with TNF-2-negative/B8-DR3-negative persons. It is concluded that the HLA-B8-DR3 haplotype is an important contributor to the course of NE.

This analysis highlights the importance of population demography in the successful circulation of hantavirus. The chance of infection was greatest during the peak of the population cycle, implying that the likelihood of exposure to hantavirus increases with increasing population density.","['Olsson GE', 'White N', 'Ahlm C', 'Elgh F', 'Verlemyr AC', 'Juto P', 'Palo RT']",2002,8,9,Emerg Infect Dis,"Olsson GE, et al.

12183800,"[Epidemic nephropathy. An important differential diagnosis of acute renal failure in Reutlingen, an endemic area].","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hantavirus (""epidemic"") nephropathy (HN), or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (WHO nomenclature), is an infection caused by strains (e.g. Puumala) of Hantavirus, which is often accompanied by acute renal failure. Although its typical symptomatology has been fully reported, it is rarely included in the differential diagnosis of renal nephropathy. This study investigated whether, in the presence of typical symptoms, specific search for a certain constellation of laboratory values in association with a typical history can more often provide the diagnosis of HN.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 18 patients (4 females, 14 males; average age 41 years) fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: abnormal values for creatinine, LDH and C-reactive protein, proteinuria and hematuria, as well as thrombocytopenia in conjunction with fever, back- and headache. After the diagnosis had been confirmed by demonstrating antibodies against the Puumala strain of hantavirus, follow-up included laboratory tests and clinical observation.
RESULTS: All patients fully recovered without any sequelae. There was a clearly increased frequency of cases at the Reutlingen Clinic compared with the previous years (maximally 7 cases per year in 1995-1999). The incidence in the Reutlingen region was probably at least 6.5/100 000 inhabitants.
CONCLUSION: At least in endemic regions HN is one of the most common causes of acute renal failure. The increase of cases can, among other reasons, be explained by the described prospective diagnostic schema. But climatic factors with changes in the density of the vector (bank vole) cannot be excluded.","['Kunz A', 'Susset MA', 'Sczepanski B', 'Braun B']",2002,127,33,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Kunz A, et al.

12110713,Atypical low-signal-intensity renal parenchyma: causes and patterns.,"Certain renal diseases manifest as low signal intensity of the renal parenchyma on magnetic resonance images. Sometimes, the appearance is sufficiently characteristic to allow a specific radiologic diagnosis to be made. The causes of this finding can be classified into three main categories on the basis of the pathophysiology: hemolysis, infection, and vascular disease. The first category includes paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hemosiderin deposition in the renal cortex from mechanical hemolysis, and sickle cell disease. The second category includes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The third category includes acute renal vein thrombosis, renal cortical necrosis, renal arterial infarction, rejection of a transplanted kidney, and acute nonmyoglobinuric renal failure with severe loin pain and patchy renal vasoconstriction. These disease processes have different patterns of low signal intensity. PNH, hemosiderin deposition from mechanical hemolysis, and sickle cell disease involve the entire cortex including the columns of Bertin. HFRS involves the medulla, especially the outer medulla, whereas cortical necrosis involves the inner cortex including the columns of Bertin. In renal vein thrombosis, low-signal-intensity lesions involve the outer medulla, an appearance resembling that of HFRS. Wedge-shaped low-signal-intensity regions involving both the cortex and the medulla are seen in arterial infarction.","['Jeong JY', 'Kim SH', 'Lee HJ', 'Sim JS']",2002,22,4,Radiographics,"Jeong JY, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal US was undertaken in 23 hospital-treated NE patients during the acute phase of their disease (first study). The second US study was performed 3-6 months later.
RESULTS: The resistive index (RI) was abnormal in 12 patients and fluid collections (perirenal, pleural, pericardial, ascites) were found in 13 patients in the first study. Renal length decreased in every patient, cortical parenchymal thickness in 19 patients and RI in 18 patients from the first to the second studies. The mean change was significant in all parameters. Increased RI and presence of fluid collections in the first study as well as a greater change in length and RI between the first and the second studies were associated with high maximum daily urine excretion, substantial change in body weight between the anuric and polyuric phases, high maximum serum creatinine and urea concentration, high blood leukocyte count and low hematocrit value.
CONCLUSION: Renal US changes occurred in every patient with NE.

12093990,Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.,"BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity.
OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature.
DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol.
RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia.
DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response.
CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.","['Gavin PJ', 'Katz BZ']",2002,110,1 Pt 1,Pediatrics,Gavin PJ and Katz BZ.

METHODS: In the transmission experiments, about 100 O. bacoti per pool were isolated and placed in a jar, unfed for 4 d at 23 +/- 1 degrees C. Suckling Wistar rats inoculated with Hantavirus strain Z45 or Seoul virus strain UR were placed in each jar for free attack by the mites for 12 hours. After 14 d the normal suckling Wistar rats were bitten by the mites. Fifteen days later, the lung tissues and sera of the infected rats were collected and detected for Hantaviral antigen by indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT). For demonstration of the infection of O. bacti with Rattus-borne Hantavirus PCR technique was applied to detect Rattus-borne Hantaviral RNA.
RESULTS: Sukling Wistar rats inoculted Hantavirus strain Z45 or Seoul virus strain UR were bitten by O. bacoti and then these mites were fed on 4 and 5 of normal suckling rats in each jar, respectively. The antigens of Hantavirus strain Z45 were positive in all the lungs of the normal rats bitten by the mites, the sera titers of the rats were from 1:10 to 1:40. The antigens were positive in 3 of the 4 rats, the sera titers were from 1:20 to 1:40. Both of the viruses could be maintained in O. bacoti for 22 days. The blocking test showed when 1:30 Hantavirus immunosera were exposed to the lung samples and then reacted with the sera from the patients with HFRS, all the specific fluorescence reactions of the samples were blocked, whereas the control group including the normal rat lung tissues and sera were all negative (Fig. 1).

Among 20 Ornithonyssus bacoti detected 12 were positive on d10 after biting suckling mice inoculated with Hantaan virus, and the virus RNA was mainly found in the cells of genitalia (Figs. 1-13).
CONCLUSION: Both Eulaelaps shanghaiensis and Ornithonyssus bacoti could be infected with HFRSV by biting HFRSV-positive mice. E. shanghaiensis could be infected with both Hantaan and Seoul virus, and the two types of HFRSV were found to be maintained in the mites for 132 days and 102 days, respectively. These confirmed that E. shanghaiensis and O. bacoti are suitable vectors and reservoirs of both Hantaan and Seoul virus and might play an important role in the cross transmission of the two types of HFRSV.","['Wu J', 'Meng Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhou H', 'Zhuge H', 'Lai P', 'Wang J']",1998,16,6,Zhongguo Ji Sheng Chong Xue Yu Ji Sheng Chong Bing Za Zhi,"Wu J, et al.

12050380,Cross-protection against challenge with Puumala virus after immunization with nucleocapsid proteins from different hantaviruses.,"Hantaviruses are rodent-borne agents that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans. The nucleocapsid protein (N) is relatively conserved among hantaviruses and highly immunogenic in both laboratory animals and humans, and it has been shown to induce efficient protective immunity in animal models. To investigate the ability of recombinant N (rN) from different hantaviruses to elicit cross-protection, we immunized bank voles with rN from Puumala (PUUV), Topografov (TOPV), Andes (ANDV), and Dobrava (DOBV) viruses and subsequently challenged them with PUUV. All animals immunized with PUUV and TOPV rN were completely protected. In the group immunized with DOBV rN, 7 of 10 animals were protected, while only 3 of 8 animals were protected in the group immunized with ANDV rN, which is more closely related to PUUV rN than DOBV rN. Humoral and cellular immune responses after rN immunization were also investigated. The highest cross-reactive humoral responses against PUUV antigen were detected in sera from ANDV rN-immunized animals, followed by those from TOPV rN-immunized animals, and only very low antibody cross-reactivity was observed in sera from DOBV rN-immunized animals. In proliferation assays, T lymphocytes from animals immunized with all heterologous rNs were as efficiently recalled in vitro by PUUV rN as were T lymphocytes from animals immunized with homologous protein. In summary, this study has shown that hantavirus N can elicit cross-protective immune responses against PUUV, and the results suggest a more important role for the cellular arm of the immune response than for the humoral arm in cross-protection elicited by rN.","['de Carvalho Nicacio C', 'Gonzalez Della Valle M', 'Padula P', 'Björling E', 'Plyusnin A', 'Lundkvist A']",2002,76,13,J Virol,"de Carvalho Nicacio C, et al.

12044299,Identification of Tula hantavirus in Pitymys subterraneus captured in the Cacak region of Serbia-Yugoslavia.,"BACKGROUND: Atypical serum neutralizing antibody responses to prototype strains of Puumala viruses in some patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have long suggested the existence of other hantaviruses in the Balkans.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of arvicolid rodent-borne Puumala-like hantaviruses in Yugoslavia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction, Tula virus RNA was amplified from lung tissues of a European pine vole (Pitymys subterraneus) captured in 1987, following an outbreak of HFRS in the Cacak region of Serbia-Yugoslavia.
RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the S segment and a 948-nucleotide region of the G2 glycoprotein-encoding M segment revealed divergence of approximately 14% from Tula virus strains harbored by European common voles (Microtus arvalis) captured in Central Russia and the Czech Republic. However, nearly complete identity was found in the corresponding deduced amino acid sequences. Moreover, phylogenetic trees constructed by the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods indicated that this Pitymys-borne hantavirus shared a common ancestry with other Tula virus strains.
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that Pitymys subterraneus also serves as a rodent reservoir of Tula virus in Serbia-Yugoslavia. To what extent this represents virus spillover from Microtus arvalis warrants further investigation.","['Song JW', 'Gligic A', 'Yanagihara R']",2002,6,1,Int J Infect Dis,"Song JW, et al.

The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. 10 patients received recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) in a dose 250,000 IU/day for 5 days. rIL-2 was not given to 10 control patients. Both groups received intravenous prednisolone in a dose 90 mg/day. The response was assessed by minimal diuresis, maximal serum concentrations of urea and creatinine. No lethal outcomes occurred. Minimal diuresis was higher, creatinine and urea levels lower in patients on rIL-2 (647.0 +/- 268.6 mg/day vs 422.0 +/- 198.2 ml/day, p < 0.05; 221.8 +/- 98.1 mcmol/l vs 398.9 +/- 234.9 mcmol/l, p < 0.05; 14.9 +/- 5.1 mcmol/l vs 22.0 +/- 9.0 mmol/l, p < 0.05).

11860813,[Preventive effects of three kinds of inactive vaccines against epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) after 5 years of vaccination].,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the safety and the preventive effects of three kinds of vaccines as Mongolian gerbils kidney vaccine, mouse brains vaccine and hamster kidney vaccine inoculated 5 years ago.
METHODS: Field study and laboratory tests were carried out by random grouping and IFAT, MCPENT, ELISA, HI tests.
RESULTS: The antibody-dependent enhancement did not appear in all individuals who received vaccines after four or five years. The seroconversion rates of MCPENT were 8.97%, 11.76% and 18.75% while the seroconversion rates of IFAT were 20.73%, 30.22% and 23.40% respectively for Mongolian gerbils kidney vaccine, mouse brains vaccine and hamster kidney vaccine. The protection rates were 100% for all three kinds of inactive vaccines which showed good epidemiological efficacy.
CONCLUSION: The vaccines can protect clinical infection of EHF effectively after four or five years of the initial vaccination.","['Chen H', 'Tang L', 'Luo Z', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang Z', 'Hu M', 'Weng J', 'Liu W', 'Zhao T', 'Liu W']",2000,21,5,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Chen H, et al.

11860812,[A case-control study on the risk factors of epidemic hemorrhagic fever].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF).
METHODS: A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted to analyse EHF risk factors.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five matched pairs were investigated. Five factors were associated with risks of the disease, including rodent activity in house, farm working, travel, annual average income of an individual and ground material of the house, when chi(2) test and logistic regression model were processed respectively. The coefficients of rodent activity in house, farm working, travel, annual average income of an individual and ground material of the house in multivariable Logistic regression model were 1.377, 1.687, 1.630, -1.216 and -0.888, respectively, when P value < 0.05 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Factors as high average income of individuals, brick or cement used as material of the ground in the house, seemed to be protective factors of EHF, which were important to the control and prevention of EHF.","['Ruan Y', 'Liu W', 'Xu X', 'Weng S', 'Zhou W', 'Deng X', 'Gu H', 'Zhu Z', 'Xu Z']",2000,21,5,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Ruan Y, et al.

11860754,[A study on the epidemiology and preventive measure on epidemic haemorrhage fever in army barrack area in Shandong].,"OBJECTIVE: In order to guide the army and civilians to carry out the prevention on epidemic haemorrhage fever (EHF), it's necessary to elucidate the epidemic feature of natural epidemic foci and the risk factors of EHF in the army - stationed areas.
METHODS: Samples were tested by pathogenic and serologic means before data was collected and analyzed by case - control or family - control studies.
RESULTS: Cases belong to house - mouse type (91.48%), field - mouse type (7.21%) and unclassified (1.31%) coexist in the stationed area. In the two types of noticed cases, no significant difference in distributions of sex, profession and ages. Most house - mouse type cases occurred in the peak time from March to June and field - mouse type in November to next February. The type of EHF virus antigen of mice and the type of serum were both accordant with their host types. Dwelling in border area, living rooms with mice, dogs raising, injury of mouth tissue, eating food contaminated by mice, and household with mice living around were more frequently seen in cases themselves and in families of the cases than in controls of both groups (P < 0.05). The mice intensity could be under control to 1.0%, if comprehensive measure on mice control can be implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: The stationed area is an epidemic area mixed with both house - mouse and field - mouse types, with majority of house - mouse type. It was house - mouse type virus infection that caused the epidemic area expanded and the number of cases increased radically these years. EHF was epidemic in spring and summer season in the stationed area mainly because the infections were among family members. Food contaminated by mice or close contact with mice played an important role. Mice eradication and prevention were the leading measures to prevent EHF, from our more than ten years of experiences.","['Yang Z', 'Miao Z', 'Liu Y', 'Wu Q', 'Qiao Z', 'Peng Z', 'Yu X', 'Zhou J', 'Li L', 'Gao L']",2000,21,1,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Yang Z, et al.

11857535,Characteristics of Puumala and Dobrava infections in Croatia.,"In this study, two different hantaviruses, Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava virus (DOBV), were demonstrated for the first time to coexist and cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Croatia. Phylogenetic analysis showed some differences among the nucleotide sequences of PUUV originating from Dinara mountain, which was more closely related to Austrian PUUV than other Croatian PUUV from Mala Kapela mountain. More consistency was found among the Croatian DOBV. HFRS was verified in 85 of 201 suspected cases recorded in 1995 during the largest HFRS outbreak in Croatia. Most of these cases were soldiers. With the exception of the coastal region and islands, all of Croatia was found to be an area endemic for HFRS. A statistically significantly higher proportion of DOBV-infected patients had acute renal failure, visual disturbance, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of nonsegmented leukocytes, creatine, and total bilirubin. The prevalence of gastrointestinal and electrocardiography disorders also was greater in DOBV-infected patients. Interestingly, significantly more PUUV-infected patients had elevated systolic blood pressure on admission to the hospital. Further prospective studies are necessary to shed more light on differences in HFRS severity associated with PUU and DOB viruses.","['Markotić A', 'Nichol ST', 'Kuzman I', 'Sanchez AJ', 'Ksiazek TG', 'Gagro A', 'Rabatić S', 'Zgorelec R', 'Avsic-Zupanc T', 'Beus I', 'Dekaris D']",2002,66,4,J Med Virol,"Markotić A, et al.

METHODS: RT-PCR products were amplified from S85-46 virus infected cells, cloned into T vector, sequenced and analyzed using DNASTAR software.
RESULTS: The homology of M segment of S85-46 strain and HTN type strain varied from 84.1%-99.7%, compared to 70.4%-70.9% with SEO strains. This result indicated that S85-46 strain belonged to hantavirus. The nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that S85-46 strain, LR1 strain and 76-118 strain were highly homologous. The two latter strains were isolated from Shaanxi province of China and South Korea respectively, which were far from Sichuan province of China. The nucleotide sequence analyses of S segment was similar to M segment.

Approximately 200,000 cases are reported annually, and there is to date no specific treatment available. A major obstacle in studying the medical aspects of HFRS and HPS has been the lack of an adequate animal model. Here we show that infection of cynomolgus macaques by wild-type Puumala hantavirus resulted in typical signs of HFRS including lethargy, anorexia, proteinuria, and/or hematuria, in addition to cytokine (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), C-reactive protein, creatinine, and nitric oxide responses. Viral RNA was detected in plasma from days 3 to 7 postinoculation until days 24 to 28 postinoculation, infectious virus was recovered, and the virus-specific immune responses (immunoglobulin M [IgM], IgG, and neutralizing antibodies) mimicked those seen in humans.

By immunoblot analyses of the recombinant N proteins using human sera of the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), we have confirmed previous finding by other investigators of the presence of a highly antigenic region near the amino terminus of the HTNV N protein. We have further located the antigenic region within a short stretch of hydrophilic sequences between the 26 and the 46th amino acid residues. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing this region was expressed as a soluble form in a large quantity in Escherichia coli, and purified by a single-step affinity chromatography.

11715607,[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"Puumala hantavirus is the most common hantavirus infection in Western Europe. The causative agent, Puumala virus, is a member of the Hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. The natural hosts of hantaviruses are chronically, but asymptomatic infected rodents, which transmit the virus to human in their excretions. Puumala virus is carried by the bank vole, clethrionomys glareolus. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Puumala virus in France or Belgium is very similar to the previously described Nephropathia epidemica in Scandinavia. In most severe cases, the disease is clinically characterized by high fever of abrupt onset, headache, loin or abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally acute and transient myopia. Renal involvement results in transient proteinuria and hematuria and acute renal failure. Except for interstitial hemorrhage in the outer medulla, the renal histopathologic findings are unspecific and include prominent changes in the interstitium with interstitial oedema and inflammatory infiltrates. Thrombocytopenia, mild elevation of liver enzymes, and leukocytosis are typical laboratory findings. Spontaneous complete recovery is the rule. Laboratory diagnosis is primarily based on serology such as indirect immunofluorescence or capture enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays which detect IgM antibodies and an increased level of IgG antibodies against Puumala virus. Viral antigen may be demonstrated in the cytoplasm of renal tubular epithelial cells.","['Vanhille P', 'Binaut R', 'Kyndt X', 'Launay D', 'Thomas C', 'Fleury D']",2001,22,6,Nephrologie,"Vanhille P, et al.

11677760,Genotyping and preparation of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein antigen of hantavirus.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify new recombinant antigens with potential for diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and establish reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism (RT-PCR-RFLP) for genotyping of hantavirus.
METHODS: One group of primers was used to clone the full-length S genome segment and the partial S genome segment of the N-terminal. The two cloned genes were both fusionally expressed and non-fusionally expressed in the T7 system. The other group of primers was used to establish a RT-PCR method to detect RNAs in 37 virus isolates, 2 positive standard virus strains of hantavirus and 5 negative controls. The method for typing RFLP was set up by digesting the PCR products of 20 virus isolates with Ras I and Hind III.
RESULTS: The non-fusionally expressed products with a working concentration of 1:10,000 by chapping enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), presented good biological activity though yields were lower than that of the fusionally expressed products. The specific component of the hantavirus genome (299 bp or 577 bp) was seen in all viral samples. The genotyping of hantavirus showed that 9 out of the total were Hantann (HTN) viruses, 8 were seoul (SEO) viruses and 3 were not determined.
CONCLUSIONS: The good working titrer of expressed recombinant antigen showed that it has the potential to replace the natural antigen for detecting hantavirus antibodies. On comparison with cELISA, the detection rates for these two methods were 100% and 84.6%, and the coincidence rate was 84.6%. The former had a 15.4% higher sensitivity than the latter. The typing efficiency of RT-PCR-RFLP and sero-typing method was 85% (17/20) and 55% (11/20), respectively, showing that the former was 30% higher than the latter, while their results were highly consistent.","['Tang J', 'Cao M', 'Tang T', 'Wang C', 'Wei C', 'Lei W']",2001,114,10,Chin Med J (Engl),"Tang J, et al.

Coexpression of G1 and G2 from separate constructs seemed to be important for the optimal folding of the glycoproteins, as evaluated by a panel of MAbs detecting conformational epitopes. To evaluate the human antibody response against recombinant G1, G2 and N, several panels of sera were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Also human sera showed the best reactivity towards G1 and G2 coexpressed from separate transcripts (G1 + G2). Notably, only 2% of the acute sera (total number = 133) contained IgG antibodies against G1 + G2, whereas of old-immunity sera (total number = 100) 87% were G1 + G2 positive. Analysis of a panel of serial patient sera showed that as the immunity matured, IgG antibodies against the recombinant glycoproteins appeared and the titers increased in the course of time, while antibodies against the recombinant N were present already in the acute phase in high titers. The granular fluorescence pattern in PUUV IgG-IFA, associated with the acute phase of immunity, was linked to the presence of antibodies against N, whereas the diffuse fluorescence pattern associated with old-immunity, was linked to the development of antibodies against G1 + G2. The granular fluorescence pattern in PUUV IgG-IFA had a predictive value of 100% for acute PUUV infection. Weak cross-reaction with PUUV glycoproteins was observed in 36% of old-immunity DOBV-specific human sera.","['Kallio-Kokko H', 'Leveelahti R', 'Brummer-Korvenkontio M', 'Lundkvist A', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O']",2001,65,3,J Med Virol,"Kallio-Kokko H, et al.

DATA SOURCES: Reviews and papers published in Chinese journals, relevant to the objectives, written or collected by the author; and the research work of the author.
STUDY SELECTION: An outline was drafted according to the purpose given above, and the relevant materials and data were grouped together into different items outlined.
DATA EXTRACTION: All the materials and data extracted were published or specially assessed.
RESULTS: HFRS was first recognized in the northeastern China in 1931. It has been found prevalent also in many other parts of China since 1955, and presently, 28 out of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, or municipalities) have been proved to be its endemic areas. The total number of cases is 1,256,431 from 1950 to 1997, with 44,304 death (3.53%). 50-100 thousands of cases could be registered annually since 1981 when the presence of the Rattus-type HFRS was first identified serologically in China, with the highest peak in 1986 (115,985 cases). Three types of endemicity have been differentiated: the Apodemus-type, the Rattus-type and the mixed type of the two, by their peculiar seasonal distributions of cases and by methods of serotyping (HI, MAbs serotyping kits). The epidemiologic features of the Rattus-type HFRS are quite different from that of the Apodemus-type. 67 species of vertebrates were found to harbor hantavirus antigen or antibodies, but the chief or primary reservoir hosts are Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus only. Besides the commonly recognized enzootic mode of transmission (via contacts with the reservoir rodents or their excreta), mite transmission (including certain species of gamasid mites, and chigger mites) has been identified as the potential vectors and reservoir hosts with HFRS. Vertical transmission had been found in pregnant patients with HFRS, and in all three chief host rodents (Apodemus agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, the laboratory rats). The relatively high inapparent infection rates in the population of endemic areas of the Rattus-type HFRS after big outbreaks (8%-20%) are suggested to play a significant role in the gradual decline of the incidence of HFRS in that areas. Three kinds of inactivated vaccines against HFRS (the golden hamster kidney cell vaccine, the Mongolian gerbil kidney cell vaccine and the purified suckling mouse brain vaccine) have been successively developed and proved highly effective in the prevention of HFRS.
CONCLUSION: Chinese workers on the epidemiology and prevention of HFRS in China have accomplished great achievements since 1981. As the relatively high annual incidence of HFRS sustained in recent years, control measures have to be reinforced. Many problems of HFRS and hantavirus infections are still not well understood or unclear, such as the poly-host nature, and the multi-modes of transmission, the natural history of hantaviruses and their genetic variation occurred in nature etc. The task for effective control of HFRS and the research on its epidemiology in China should be held on a high priority.",['Song G'],1999,112,5,Chin Med J (Engl),Song G.

11569267,[Morbidity and prophylaxis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Republic of Bashkortostan].,"The brief retrospective analysis of morbidity, epizootological data and preventive measures with respect to haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) during the whole period of its registration on the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan along with the structure of HFRS morbidity during epidemic seasons of 1998 and 1999 is presented. The main causes of decreased HFRS morbidity in 1998, its rise in 1999 as well as prognosis for the year 2000 were detected. The level of HFRS morbidity among the population was found to be directly related to the number of rodents and their infection rate. The basic strategy of epidemic control interventions has been proposed.","['Korobov LI', 'Minin GD', 'Nurgaleeva RG', 'Stepanenko AG', 'Mustafin NM']",2001,,4,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Korobov LI, et al.

11550553,[Infectious diseases in natural reservoirs: epidemic situation and morbidity in the Russian Federation and prophylactic measures].,"The analysis of morbidity in infections with natural foci in Russia for the period of 1999-2000 indicates that a rise in the number of cases of hemorrhagic fever with the renal syndrome, tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean hemorrhagic fever and West Nile fever with a high proportion of urban population among the patients is registered annually. An increase in the epizootic activity of the natural foci of plague is noted in the absence of morbidity among humans. The appearance of the outbreaks of tularemia is linked nor only with the increased activity of the natural foci, but also with the reduced coverage of the population with prophylactic immunization in endemic regions. This analysis infers that morbidity prognosis in infections with natural foci for 2001 remains unfavorable. The growth of morbidity in these infections is mainly due to the reduction of measures for controlling their vectors both is open nature and in settlements, as well as to low coverage with prophylactic immunization. Urgent complex measures which may ensure effective antiepidemic and prophylactic work for controlling infections with natural foci are presented.",['Onishchenko GG'],2001,,3,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,Onishchenko GG.

11526193,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: diagnostic problems with a known disease.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by different hantaviruses, is a distinct clinical syndrome endemic in several parts of Asia and Europe. However, the clinical picture can sometimes be indistinguishable from that of other infectious or noninfectious diseases. In this report we describe a clinical case, which is a rare occurrence but is a prime example of the difficulties in the diagnosis of HFRS in areas with a low prevalence of the disease.","['Wichmann D', 'Slenczka W', 'Alter P', 'Boehm S', 'Feldmann H']",2001,39,9,J Clin Microbiol,"Wichmann D, et al.

Studied in HFRS patients during different stages of treatment were morphological-and-functional features of erythocytes (E). As many as 65 HFRS patients presenting with varying degree severity of their trouble were examined. The control group comprised 15 subjects. E volume was studied together with content and concentration of hemoglobin (Hb) in one E. There have been estimated parameters characterizing aggregation (percentage of minimum/maximum aggregation, deaggregation factor, second wave of aggregation). Trental and clivarin were prescribed for the trouble. In severe and moderately severe course a decrease in Hb content and concentration in the early period was revealed as was an augmentation of E volume, with Hb level and hematocrit value tending to be on the increase. Changes in rheological parameters were manifested by higher percentage of minimum and maximum aggregation and decrement in the deaggregation factor by 55 percent as compared with the control group.",['Ibragimova LA'],2001,,2,Lik Sprava,Ibragimova LA.

11510183,[Central hemodynamic disorders and rheological red blood cell properties in hemorrhagic fever patients with renal syndrome].,"The aim of this study was to detect a relationship between hemodynamic disorders in patients with hemorrhagic fever with the renal syndrome (HFRS) and erythrocyte aggregability and erythrocyte membrane ATPase activity. A total of 100 patients with HFRS of different severity were examined. Central hemodynamic parameters were studied: circulating blood volume, minute volume, cardiac index, stroke volume, and total peripheral vascular resistance during preoliguria, oliguria, and polyuria periods. Blood parameters were studied: percentage of minimum and maximum aggregation, disaggregation coefficient, activities of transport adenosine triphosphatases (Na, K, and Ca-activated ATPases and Mg-dependent ATPase). The main hemodynamic parameters were increased (p < 0.05) during early preoliguria and decreased during oliguria; during the polyuria period they again corresponded to the hyperkinetic circulation. The minimum erythrocyte aggregation increased by 110 and 130% in medium-severe and severe HFRS, respectively, the maximum erythrocyte aggregation by 20 and 28%, respectively (p < 0.05). Disaggregation coefficient decreased by 55%. The activities of Na, K(+)-ATPases decreased by 13% during preoliguria period, by 17.5% during oliguria, and by 11.7% during polyuria (p < 0.05) in patients with moderate disease. In severe disease these decreases were 14, 19, and 15%, respectively (p < 0.05). Similar changes were observed in the activities of Ca(++)-ATPase and Mg-dependent ATPase. Hence, the detected hemodynamic changes in patients with medium-severe and severe HFRS correlated with disorders in erythrocyte aggregability and decreased activity of transport ATPases, which can be used for evaluation of the severity of clinical condition and early diagnosis.",['Ibragimova LA'],2001,79,5,Klin Med (Mosk),Ibragimova LA.

11507192,DNA vaccination with the Hantaan virus M gene protects Hamsters against three of four HFRS hantaviruses and elicits a high-titer neutralizing antibody response in Rhesus monkeys.,"Four hantaviruses-Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava virus (DOBV) and Puumala virus-are known to cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. HTNV causes the most severe form of HFRS (5 to 15% case-fatality rate) and afflicts tens of thousands of people annually. Previously, we demonstrated that DNA vaccination with a plasmid expressing the SEOV M gene elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected hamsters against infection with SEOV and HTNV. Here, we report the construction and evaluation of a DNA vaccine that expresses the HTNV M gene products, G1 and G2. DNA vaccination of hamsters with the HTNV M gene conferred sterile protection against infection with HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV. DNA vaccination of rhesus monkeys with either the SEOV or HTNV M gene elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies. These are the first immunogenicity data for hantavirus DNA vaccines in nonhuman primates. Because a neutralizing antibody response is considered a surrogate marker for protective immunity in humans, our protection data in hamsters combined with the immunogenicity data in monkeys suggest that hantavirus M gene-based DNA vaccines could protect humans against the most severe forms of HFRS.","['Hooper JW', 'Custer DM', 'Thompson E', 'Schmaljohn CS']",2001,75,18,J Virol,"Hooper JW, et al.

METHODS: This virus temporally called FT14 detected by IFAT, RT-PCR. Partial sequence of M segment was determined by Sanger' a dideoxy chain termination method.
RESULTS: The antigenicity and PCR amplification of the newly isolated virus FT14 proved that it belongs to virus of HTN type. Antiserum to the virus can neutralize many strains of Hantaan virus from different areas. The partial sequence of M segment of FT14, as compared with other HTN strains, showed great differences among nucleotide sequences, while the deduced amino acid sequence is comparatively conservative. The titer of the virus reached its peak at 9 days post inoculation in vitro, then the peak titer could last for a long time.

11456392,Primary humoral immune responses to formalin inactivated hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome vaccine (Hantavax): consideration of active immunization in South Korea.,"The efficacy of a formalin-inactivated hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) vaccine and the effectiveness of a related vaccination program have not been previously evaluated. We measured the primary immune responses to Hantavax by plaque reduction neutralizing antibody test (PRNT), hemagglutination inhibition test (HAI), ELISA and high density particle agglutination test (HDPA) in order to confirm a possible biological efficacy through independent substantiation of experimental results and to compare the results with previous studies. Following two doses of primary vaccination, the seroconversion rate of PRNT and HAI antibody was 33.3% (10/30) [95% C.I. 17.3-52.5%] and 26.7% (8/30) [95% C.I. 12.3-45.9%], respectively. The correlation between PRNT and HAI antibody showed a statistical significance (r=0.58, p<0.01). The seroconversion rate of HDPA and ELISA were both 76.7% (23/30) [95% C.I. 57.7-90.1%], which correlated well with each other (r=0.58, p<0.01). In our study, Hantavax elicited low neutralizing antibody responses, at least in the volunteers samples that we tested. The vaccination program, including the vaccine itself, that has been adopted by the national immunization program to protect against HFRS in Korea should be re-evaluated and re-formulated to produce a higher protective immune response rate.","['Sohn YM', 'Rho HO', 'Park MS', 'Kim JS', 'Summers PL']",2001,42,3,Yonsei Med J,"Sohn YM, et al.

The truncated rNPs, which lacked 49 (rNP50) or 154 (rNP155) N-terminal amino acids of the NPs of HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV, were able to differentiate HTNV-, SEOV-, and DOBV-specific immune sera. Recombinant NP50s retained higher reactivities than rNP155s and were proven useful for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISAs based on the rNP50s of HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV successfully differentiated three groups of patient sera, previously defined by neutralization tests: 17 with HTNV infection, 12 with SEOV infection, and 20 with DOBV infection. The entire rNP of Puumala virus (PUUV) distinguished PUUV infection from the other types of hantavirus infection.

A genetic vaccination approach was conducted to investigate if the immune response could be modulated using different cellular secretion and/or localisation signals, and the immune responses were analysed in BALB/c mice and in a bank vole infectious model. Rodents vaccinated with DNA constructs encoding the antigen fused to an amino-terminal secretion signal raised significantly higher antibody levels when compared to using constructs lacking secretion signals. Furthermore, the ratios of the IgG subclasses (IgG2a/IgG1) were raised by the use of cellular localisation signals, indicating a more pronounced Th1-type of immune response. The majority of the mice, or bank voles, immunised with DNA encoding a secreted form of the antigen showed a positive lymphoproliferative response and were protected against challenge with Puumala virus (strain Kazan-wt).","['Bucht G', 'Sjölander KB', 'Eriksson S', 'Lindgren L', 'Lundkvist A', 'Elgh F']",2001,19,28-29,Vaccine,"Bucht G, et al.

In the laboratory colony, where Puumala virus persisted for three years, multiaberrant (""rogue"") cells were found in the bone marrow; the mean frequencies of both structural and numeral chromosome abnormalities were significantly enhanced. In the other laboratory colony, no Puumala virus was detected during all 30 years of its existence, but the mean frequencies of structural chromosome damage were increased to the same degree probably due to the prolonged breeding under laboratory conditions, which resulted in suppression of immunity and DNA repair. The voles from the natural populations were more resistant to the clastogenic viral effect, but they also had multiaberrant cells which served as indicators of viral infection. The data obtained support the hypothesis that viral infections increase mutation rate, contributing thereby to the evolution process.","['Gileva EA', 'Poliavina OV', 'Apekina NS', 'Demina VT', 'Osipova OV', 'Bernsteĭn AD']",2001,37,4,Genetika,"Gileva EA, et al.

The torsade de pointes was refractory to conventional medical therapy, including infusion of isoproterenol, MgSO4, potassium, lidocaine, and amiodarone. His past history, physical findings, and hormone study confirmed that QT prolongation was caused by anterior hypopituitarism that developed as a sequela of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The long QT interval with deep inverted T wave was completely normalized 4 weeks after starting steroid and thyroid hormone replacement. Hormonal disorders should be considered as a cause of torsade de pointes, because this life-threatening arrhythmia can be treated by replacing the missing hormone.","['Kim NH', 'Cho JG', 'Ahn YK', 'Lee SU', 'Kim KH', 'Cho JH', 'Kim HG', 'Kim W', 'Jeong MH', 'Park JC', 'Kang JC']",2001,16,3,J Korean Med Sci,"Kim NH, et al.

At least 277 cases of HPS have been documented in the United States. The full clinical spectrum has yet to be elucidated, and one outbreak suggested the possibility of person-to-person transmission. New research has identified the b-3 integrins as cellular receptors for hantaviruses and has determined the pivotal role of the immune system in pathogenesis. Rapid diagnosis has been facilitated by a new immunoblot assay to detect Sin Nombre virus infection. Treatment remains primarily supportive; however, a placebo- controlled trial of ribavirin is ongoing. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be a potential therapy in severe cases; inhaled nitric oxide needs further study.

11321961,[Geographical divisions of rat transmissible diseases].,"In order to prevent rat transmissible diseases, it is necessary to know the geographical distribution of rats, their external parasitic arthropod and rat-borne disease in human, and to make a graph of geographical division. Stratified sampling was conducted by county to capture rats, and to sort out flea for identification of their genus and species. A total of 55,064 rats sorting as 6 families, 17 genera and 21 species were captured, and a total of 34,733 flea sorting as 4 families, 25 genera and 53 species were picked. Three kinds of rat-borne diseases, namely plague, leptospirosis and epidemic hemorrhagic fever have been occurred and epidemic in Shanxi Province.

11285748,[Epidemiology of hantaviruses in Baden-Wurttemberg].,"Hantavirus, originally named after the Hantaan River in Korea, is the aetiologic agent for the Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in the asian region, in the Americas for the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). In Middle Europe hantaviruses are responsible for the ""Nephropathia Epidemica"" (NE), a mild form of HFRS. Hantaviruses belong to the family of Bunyaviridae. Like other members of this family their genome consists of three segments of single stranded RNA (ss-RNA) leading to various subtypes, strongly associated with different rodent hosts. There are two major groups, the hantaan lineage harbored by murine rodents and the Puumala lineage harbored by arvicolidae (""old world"") and sigmodontidae (""new world""). Infected rodents may develop chronic infections for months or even life-long and may shed infectious virus with urine and feces. The primary mode of infection of man occurs by inhaling contaminated aerosols or soil particles. The collection of epidemiologic data in the state of Baden-Württemberg was realized in three different steps: Collection and localisation of clinical cases (n = 62): A concentration of clinical cases in the middle of the state was found. The examination of the seroprevalence of exposed persons: By the examination of 4000 sera from forest workers, a seroprevalence with an average of 2.1% was found. In the districts of Reutlingen and Tübingen seroprevalences up to 9% were found. This leads to the assumption that there are endemic areas. Epidemiologic studies of reservoir hosts: Serologic surveys of rodents (n = 1150) in the described areas yielded to a seroprevalence up to 10-30%.

We retrospectively reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of HFRS at our institution from 1994 to 1998. The review included medical records, laboratory results, radiologic examinations, and one autopsy report. From 1994 to 1998, 13 patients received diagnoses of HFRS that were confirmed by serology. In 9 patients (69%), serum amylase, serum lipase, or both were assessed during hospitalization. Seven (78%) of the 9 patients had pancreatitis. Four (57%) of these 7 patients with HFRS and pancreatitis had associated pulmonary edema, and 1 patient had rhabdomyolysis. In our small retrospective case series, acute pancreatitis in patients with HFRS was much more common than previously recognized. Patients with HFRS and pancreatitis had increased morbidity. However, the treatment for the associated pancreatitis was conservative.","['Bui-Mansfield LT', 'Torrington KG', 'Kim T']",2001,166,2,Mil Med,"Bui-Mansfield LT, et al.

11246028,Hantavirus.,"Although hantaviruses have been known to exist for over 40 years, they were thought only to be the cause of hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. Rodents are the primary hosts of hantaviruses, and humans become infected mainly by inhalation of viral particles in the rodent excreta. The United States was thought to be spared from pathologic hantaviruses until the summer of 1993, when an outbreak of acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in the Four Corners region of the United States, which includes Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Through serological studies, the etiologic agent of this respiratory disease was found to be a heretofore-unknown hantavirus that was named the Sin Nombre virus. The resulting condition was renamed Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS begins as a febrile prodrome and quickly progresses to a life-threatening cardiorespiratory failure. A laboratory triad of thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis with bandemia, and immunoblasts is specific to HPS, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay remains the gold standard for diagnosis of hantaviruses. The management of both HFRS and HPS is mainly supportive, although ribavirin has been shown to be useful for HFRS. Eliminating exposure to rodents remains the key to prevention of hantavirus infection.",['Fernandez GE'],2001,8,2,Prim Care Update Ob Gyns,Fernandez GE. Hantavirus.

11217408,Cellular receptors and hantavirus pathogenesis.,"Hantaviruses cause two potentially lethal diseases, HPS and HFRS, and both diseases result in defects in vascular permeability and platelet function. Human beta 3 integrins confer cellular susceptibility to HPS- and HFRS-causing hantaviruses, a fact directly linking platelets, endothelial cells, and hantavirus diseases to the use of [figure: see text] cellular receptors that maintain capillary integrity and regulate platelet function. The role of vitronectin, PAI-1, uPAR, and complement cascades in hantavirus pathogenesis are unstudied but may contribute to specific disease syndromes effected by hantaviruses. The divergence of hantavirus surface glycoproteins and common beta 3-integrin usage provides further insight into the interaction of hantaviruses with cells. G1 and G2 glycoprotein variation is likely to contribute to additional interactions that determine pathogenic responses to individual viruses. beta 3-integrin usage also suggests that common elements exist on G1 or the more highly conserved G2 surface glycoprotein, which mediate viral attachment to integrins. Although there is currently no data defining the virion attachment protein, the development of antibodies that recognize the hantavirus attachment protein and block integrin interactions is of interest since it is likely to provide an additional point for therapeutic intervention and vaccine development. There are a plethora of effects that could be elicited by hantavirus regulation of cellular beta 3 integrins and their ligands that are consistent with hantavirus diseases. Since beta 3 integrins are critical adhesive receptors on platelets and endothelial cells and regulate both vascular permeability and platelet activation and adhesion, the use of these receptors by hantaviruses is likely to be fundamental to hantavirus pathogenesis. The lack of an animal model for hantavirus pathogenesis has prevented a systematic analysis of immune and cellular responses to hantavirus infections, and it impedes our ability to study protective or therapeutic approaches to hantavirus diseases. However, recent findings suggest that human beta 3 integrins within transgenic mice may provide animal models of hantavirus pathogenesis and have the potential to radically alter the ability to investigate hantavirus disease.","['Mackow ER', 'Gavrilovskaya IN']",2001,256,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Mackow ER and Gavrilovskaya IN.

11189727,Hantavirus infections.,"Hantaviruses are the causative agents of the zoonotic diseases known as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas. These pathogens are maintained in the wild by rodent reservoirs and are mainly transmitted via the aerosol route. The infection is chronic and apparently asymptomatic in host animals. Whilst HFRS is caused by Hantaan, Seoul, Dobrava and Puumala hantaviruses, HPS is associated with Sin Nombre-like viruses. Common clinical features of HFRS and HPS include fever, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and a capillary leak syndrome associated with shock in most severe cases. Outbreaks of HFRS and HPS are generally observed during years with dense rodent populations resulting from favourable climatic and environmental conditions. Human activities, such as rodent trapping, farming, cleaning rodent-infested areas, construction work, camping and hunting, are also implicated in the occurrence of hantavirus disease. Prophylactic measures in endemic areas rely essentially on information campaigns and rodent control.","['Escutenaire S', 'Pastoret PP']",2000,19,1,Rev Sci Tech,Escutenaire S and Pastoret PP.

11170053,Dobrava hantavirus causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in central Europe and is carried by two different Apodemus mice species.,"In central Europe, hemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans are caused by the hantavirus species Puumala (transmitted by voles) and a second, Hantaan-related species (transmitted by mice). The second virus could be identified as Dobrava virus. To date, 19 clinical cases of Dobrava infection have been found in Germany and Slovakia. All patients exhibited a mild/moderate clinical course and no case fatality occurred. Screening for infected rodents revealed that the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) represents the main reservoir for Dobrava virus in central Europe. Nucleotide sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis based on complete and partial genomic S segment nucleotide sequences placed the Slovakian A. agrarius-derived hantavirus strains within the Dobrava species, forming a cluster on the Dobrava phylogenetic tree. In east Slovakia, a single Dobrava virus-infected yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) was trapped in a locality that predominantly showed Dobrava-infected A. agrarius. Comparison of the S segment sequence (nucleotides 381-935) revealed that the Dobrava strain from A. flavicollis shows only 84.3% nucleotide homology to A. agrarius-derived strains from this location but 96.3% homology to A. flavicollis-derived Dobrava strains from the Balkans (southeast Europe). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial S segment placed the A. flavicollis-derived Dobrava strain from Slovakia on a distinct Dobrava lineage (DOB-Af) together with the south-east European A. flavicollis-derived strains. The results indicate that Dobrava strains from A. agrarius (DOB-Aa) vs. A. flavicollis (DOB-Af) could develop different degrees of virulence in humans.","['Sibold C', 'Ulrich R', 'Labuda M', 'Lundkvist A', 'Martens H', 'Schütt M', 'Gerke P', 'Leitmeyer K', 'Meisel H', 'Krüger DH']",2001,63,2,J Med Virol,"Sibold C, et al.

11160704,Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein oligomerization.,"Hantaviruses are enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses which can be lethal to humans, causing either a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or a hantaviral pulmonary syndrome. The viral genomes consist of three RNA segments: the L segment encodes the viral polymerase, the M segment encodes the viral surface glycoproteins G1 and G2, and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein is a 420- to 430-residue, 50-kDa protein which appears to direct hantavirus assembly, although mechanisms of N protein oligomerization, RNA encapsidation, budding, and release are poorly understood. We have undertaken a biochemical and genetic analysis of N protein oligomerization. Bacterially expressed N proteins were found by gradient fractionation to associate not only as large multimers or aggregates but also as dimers or trimers. Chemical cross-linking of hantavirus particles yielded N protein cross-link products with molecular masses of 140 to 150 kDa, consistent with the size of an N trimer. We also employed a genetic, yeast two-hybrid method for monitoring N protein interactions. Analyses showed that the C-terminal half of the N protein plus the N-terminal 40 residues permitted association with a full-length N protein fusion. These N-terminal 40 residues of seven different hantavirus strains were predicted to form trimeric coiled coils. Our results suggest that coiled-coil motifs contribute to N protein trimerization and that nucleocapsid protein trimers are hantavirus particle assembly intermediates.","['Alfadhli A', 'Love Z', 'Arvidson B', 'Seeds J', 'Willey J', 'Barklis E']",2001,75,4,J Virol,"Alfadhli A, et al.

11012905,Renal function and blood pressure five years after puumala virus-induced nephropathy.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus. Its long-term prognosis is considered favorable. Some reports suggest, however, that a previous hantavirus infection increases the risk of hypertension.
METHODS: We studied 46 previously healthy subjects (26 males and 20 females, mean age of 44 years) who had serologically confirmed NE three to seven years previously, and 38 healthy, seronegative controls (22 males and 16 females, mean age of 44 years). Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was monitored. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by 51CrEDTA and 131I-hippurate clearances, respectively. The filtration fraction (FF) was calculated. Quantitative 24-hour urinary protein excretion (UprotE) and timed overnight urinary excretion of alpha1-microglobulin were measured.
RESULTS: The NE patients had a higher mean ambulatory systolic BP than the controls (123 +/- 13 vs. 117 +/- 9 mm Hg, P = 0. 008). GFR and FF were increased in patients compared with controls (GFR, 120 +/- 20 vs. 109 +/- 14 mL/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.006; FF, 19 +/- 3 vs. 18 +/- 3%, P = 0.030), but ERPF did not differ between the groups. The patients also had higher UPE than the controls (median 0. 18 g/day, range 0.12 to 0.38 vs. median 0.14 g/day, range 0.09 to 0. 24, P < 0.001, respectively). The overnight urinary excretion rate of alpha1-microglobulin exceeded 7 microg/min in nine patients.
CONCLUSION: Three to seven years after NE, the patients had higher GFR and FF, more proteinuria, and higher ambulatory systolic BP compared with the healthy controls. NE may thus cause mild renal lesions and alterations in BP in some patients.","['Mäkelä S', 'Ala-Houhala I', 'Mustonen J', 'Koivisto AM', 'Kouri T', 'Turjanmaa V', 'Vapalahti O', 'Vaheri A', 'Pasternack A']",2000,58,4,Kidney Int,"Mäkelä S, et al.

11007826,Intestinal protein loss in patients with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: In haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) vascular dysfunction has been observed in various organs, but the involvement of the intestine has not yet been reported. This study was performed to evaluate the association of intestinal protein loss in this disease with other clinical parameters reflecting vascular permeability or disease severity.
METHODS: Twenty patients with HFRS were included in this study. Intestinal protein loss was measured by (99m)Tc-human serum albumin ((99m)Tc-HSA) scintigraphy in the acute stage, and quantitative analysis of protein loss was measured by the faecal clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin (C(AT)) in the acute and the recovery stages. C(AT) was then compared with clinical parameters reflecting disease activity and vascular permeability.
RESULTS: (99m)Tc-HSA scintigraphy was positive in 13 (65%) patients, and C(AT) in the acute stage was significantly increased as compared with C(AT) in the recovery stage (40.5+/-24.1 vs 9.2+/-4.2 ml/day, P<0.001). C(AT) was associated with serum albumin levels, frequency of hypotensive episodes, severity of acute renal failure, and degree of thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the increased vascular permeability of HFRS is associated with the increased intestinal loss of plasma proteins, which might represent one of the parameters of disease severity in HFRS.","['Kim YO', 'Yang CW', 'Yoon SA', 'Song HC', 'Kim YS', 'Kim SY', 'Choi EJ', 'Chang YS', 'Bang BK']",2000,15,10,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Kim YO, et al.

10996116,Evaluation of two commercially available immunoassays for the detection of hantavirus antibodies in serum samples.,"BACKGROUND: hantaviruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and the spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans may vary from sub-clinical to severe haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Several serotypes have been described from which at least five are pathogenic to humans. Each serotype has a different animal reservoir and geographical distribution. In the acute phase of the disease the clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by serology or by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR).
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate two commercially available immunoassays using sera from hantavirus suspected and non-hantavirus patients: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed by MRL Diagnostics, for the detection of immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) against several hantavirus serotypes and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) from Progen, based on slides coated with Hantaan virus (HNTV) and Puumala virus (PUUV), infected cells.
STUDY DESIGN: a total of 145 serum samples were used for this study. The serum panel included serum samples from patients suspected of mild (n=91), severe (n=10) HFRS and patients with other viral infections (n=44).
RESULTS: the agreement between the MRL EIA and the Progen IFA for the detection of IgM and IgG serum antibodies ranged from 87 to 91%, respectively. In the non-hantavirus group one out of 44 samples was positive by the Progen HNTV IgM IFA, none in the Progen PUUV IFA and two samples in the MRL IgM EIA, resulting in specificities of 98, 100 and 95%, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of the MRL EIAs compared to the Progen overall PUUV and HNTV IFAs were 90 and 91% for IgM, respectively, and 96% for IgG in both immunoassays.

10982372,Pathogenicity of Hantaan virus in newborn mice: genetic reassortant study demonstrating that a single amino acid change in glycoprotein G1 is related to virulence.,"Two Hantaan virus strains, clone 1 (cl-1), which is virulent in newborn mice, and its attenuated mutant (mu11E10), were used to examine the pathogenesis of Hantaan virus infection in a mouse model and identify virus factors relating to virulence. After subcutaneous inoculation of newborn BALB/c mice, cl-1 caused fatal disease with high viral multiplication in peripheral organs, but mu11E10 produced nonfatal infection with a low level of virus multiplication. Intracerebral inoculation of either strain caused fatal disease. Histopathological changes in the dead animals were prominent in the brain, indicating that the brain is the target organ and produces the fatal outcome. These results indicate that mu11E10 has a generally less virulent phenotype, and because of decreased multiplication in peripheral tissues, neuroinvasiveness is also decreased. An experiment with genetic reassortant viruses showed that in newborn mice the M segment is the most related to virulence and the L segment is partly related. Sequence comparison detected a single deduced amino acid change (cl-1 Ile to mu11E10 Thr) at amino acid number 515 in glycoprotein G1. One nucleotide change, but no amino acid substitution, was observed in the noncoding region of the L segment. In mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro, viruses possessing a cl-1-derived M segment grew more rapidly than viruses containing a mu11E10-derived M segment. These results suggest that the single amino acid change in the glycoprotein alters peripheral growth, which affects invasion of the central nervous system in mice.","['Ebihara H', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Ogino M', 'Araki K', 'Ami Y', 'Kariwa H', 'Takashima I', 'Li D', 'Arikawa J']",2000,74,19,J Virol,"Ebihara H, et al.

Hemorrhagic fever (HF) viruses are encapsulated, single-stranded RNA viruses that are associated with insect or rodent vectors whose interaction with humans defines the mode of disease transmission. There are 14 HF viruses, which belong to four viral families: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae and Flaviviridae. This review presents, in order, the following aspects of VHF: (1) epidemiology, (2) anomalies of platelets and coagulation factors, (3) vasculopathy, (4) animal models of VHFs, (5) pathogenic mechanisms, and (6) treatment and future studies. HF viruses produce the manifestations of VHFs either by direct effects on cellular functions or by activation of immune and inflammatory pathways. In Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever and Crimean-Congo HF, the main feature of fatal illness appears to be impaired/delayed cellular immunity, which leads to unchecked viremia. However, in HF with renal syndrome and dengue HF, the immune response plays an active role in disease pathogenesis. The interplay of hemostasis, immune response, and inflammation is very complex. Molecular biologic techniques and the use of animal models have helped to unravel some of these interactions.","['Chen JP', 'Cosgriff TM']",2000,11,5,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Chen JP and Cosgriff TM.

10923403,[Effect of the soluble immunocomplexes on the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the soluble immunocomplexes on the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: The soluble immunocomplex (IC) consisting of HFRS virus antigen and antibody was prepared previously in vitro, and was intravenously injected into BALB/c mice. The localization of IC in the tissues of mice was investigated by immunohistochemical method ABC.
RESULTS: The results showed that 24 hours after injection, ICs were localized mostly in the blood vessels, such as the liver sinusoids, the splenic sinuses, the blood vessels of the mucosa and submucosa of the intestine, and the capillaries of the renal glomeruli, etc. 48 hours later or more, IC localized primarily on the parachymal cells, e.g., the hepatocytes, the epithelial cells of the renal tubules as well as some epithelial cells of the ducts and alveoli of some glands (submandular glands, pancreas). The cells degenerated in the areas with IC, especially in the hepatocytes and epithelial cells of renal tubules. These lesions were very similar to the pathological changes of the HFRS' patients, and were not found in patients injected with other IC.
CONCLUSION: The soluble IC of HFRS can cause direct tissue injury in the HFRS.","['Huang X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Y']",1998,78,1,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Huang X, et al.

10914135,Natural foci of some viral zoonoses in Croatia.,"Results of several-year investigations into the epidemiology and virology of viral zoonoses with natural foci occurring in Croatia, with special reference to tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), are presented. The etiologic diagnosis of these diseases was made on the basis of virus isolation from patient blood and/or findings of specific antibodies in the serum. Several TBE and Bhanja virus strains were isolated from different species of ticks, and Calovo virus from mosquitoes, while the presence of Hantaan virus antigen was determined in the lungs of certain micromammalian species, the virus natural reservoirs, by direct immunofluorescence. For the largest HFRS outbreak in Croatia to date, which occurred in 1995 during the war, a detailed description is provided. The role of the geographic aspect is indicated, because an air corridor used by migratory birds which temporarily alight in some areas for a brief stop, whereby they may introduce viruses from other parts of the world, passes just above the territory of Croatia.","['Turković B', 'Brudnjak Z']",1999,53,4-5,Acta Med Croatica,Turković B and Brudnjak Z.

10882083,Hantaviruses.,"Since the recognition of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the USA in 1993, interest in hantavirus diseases has intensified worldwide. It is clear that hantaviruses have been historically responsible for a variety of human illnesses. Hantaviruses form a separate genus within the Bunyaviridae family. There are currently >20 recognised sero/genotypes and many others are under investigation. Each hantavirus type appears to be specific to a different rodent host. Virus phylogeny very closely reflects rodent phylogeny. The different hantavirus types are associated with different types of disease both in terms of target organs and disease severity. Two major diseases are recognised: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and HPS. HFRS is primarily a disease of the old world while HPS is only recognised in the Americas. Over the past few decades the understanding and recognition of hantavirus disease throughout the world have greatly expanded. The number of recognised virus types continues to grow, as does the spectrum of hantavirus disease. There is evidence of hantavirus causing human disease in the British Isles, but at present it remains a largely uncharacterised disease.","['McCAUGHEY C', 'Hart CA']",2000,49,7,J Med Microbiol,McCAUGHEY C and Hart CA.

10879661,Complement activation in nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala hantavirus.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus. There is considerable variability in the clinical severity of NE. Its pathogenesis is largely unknown and data on complement activation in NE are scant. We sought here to establish how the complement system behaves during NE and whether the variation in the clinical outcome is related to the activation of complement.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The complement component levels and complement activation products and the clinical course of 25 hospital-treated acutely ill NE patients were studied.
RESULTS: Complement activation was observed in 23 patients. In 10 patients the complement system was activated mainly through the alternative route, in 6 mainly through the classical route and in 5 through both the alternative and the classical route. An elevated soluble terminal complex SC5b-9 was the most sensitive indicator of complement activation (17 out of 25 patients). Two patients had only an elevated SC5b-9 value and 2 had no complement activation. The C4d/C4 maximal ratio was significantly higher in patients with clinically severe NE compared to the mild or moderate disease groups.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that complement activation is common in NE. Although both pathways are usually activated, the classical pathway activation by immune complexes or directly by viral components is associated with a severe clinical course of NE.","['Paakkala A', 'Mustonen J', 'Viander M', 'Huhtala H', 'Pasternack A']",2000,53,6,Clin Nephrol,"Paakkala A, et al.

10859380,Genetic analysis of wild-type Dobrava hantavirus in Slovenia: co-existence of two distinct genetic lineages within the same natural focus.,"Genetic analysis was performed of wild-type (wt) Dobrava hantavirus (DOB) strains from Slovenia, the country where the virus was first discovered and where it was found to cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), with a fatality rate of 12%. Two hundred and sixty mice of the genus APODEMUS:, trapped in five natural foci of DOB-associated HFRS during 1990-1996, were screened for the presence of anti-hantavirus antibodies and 49 APODEMUS: flavicollis and four APODEMUS: agrarius were found to be positive. RT-PCR was used to recover partial sequences of the wt-DOB medium (M) and small (S) genome segments from nine A. flavicollis and one A. agrarius. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the Slovenian wt-DOB strains revealed close relatedness of all A. flavicollis-derived virus sequences (nucleotide diversity up to 6% for the M segment and 5% for the S segment) and the geographical clustering of genetic variants. In contrast, the strain harboured by A. agrarius showed a high level of genetic diversity from other Slovenian DOB strains (14%) and clustered together on phylogenetic trees with other DOB strains harboured by A. agrarius from Russia, Estonia and Slovakia. These findings suggest that the DOB variants carried by the two species of APODEMUS: in Europerepresent two distinct genetic lineages.","['Avsic-Zupanc T', 'Nemirov K', 'Petrovec M', 'Trilar T', 'Poljak M', 'Vaheri A', 'Plyusnin A']",2000,81,Pt 7,J Gen Virol,"Avsic-Zupanc T, et al.

10850356,Implications of the analogy between recombinant cytokine toxicities and manifestations of hantavirus infections.,"The etiologic hantavirus of the 1993 emergence of an acute pulmonary failure syndrome in the area around northwestern New Mexico was quickly recognized as related to the Hantaan virus responsible for the outbreak of Korean epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) among UN troops in 1951. Discovery of the new disease which was named the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and its causative agent the Sine Nombre virus (SNV) inspired detailed comparisons between the two disorders. Major damage to the epithelial cells of the capillaries and arterioles throughout the body leading to extensive capillary leak and subsequent hypotension and shock was the common denominator. The lung capillaries and arterioles were the focus of attack that could lead to rapid pulmonary failure in HPS and the corresponding renal and retroperitoneal vessels that caused a more protracted illness in EHF, but both displayed remarkably similar peripheral blood abnormalities including abnormal mononuclear cells, immature neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration characteristic enough to make blood smear examination a useful tool in early diagnosis. There are evidences that a heavy virus presence in the involved endothelial cells is accompanied by various mononuclear cells capable of generating potent immune response in these areas. Relevant toxic effects of systemically-administered high-dose interleukin-2 for resistant cancers include fever, chills, diarrhea, renal dysfunction, capillary leak syndrome accompanied by hypotension requiring aggressive pressor support, and occasional pleural effusions with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia severe enough to require ventilatory assistance. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in vitro with IL-2 secrete secondary cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). TNF-alpha, implicated in the pathophysiology of septic shock, is capable of inducing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in experimental animals and humans. The strong similarity of these effects to the manifestations noted in the hantavirus diseases justifies the conviction that these and other cytokines involved in potent immune responses would constitute the pathogenic toxic substances predicted by perceptive early investigators of EHF. This concept is favored by clear indications that in both diseases active virus infection disappears the first few days and the ages of involvement correlate with periods of immunocompetence. The paradox of systemic injections of IL-2 that risk hantavirus-type toxicities for treating renal cell carcinoma and melanoma might be avoided by giving potentially more efficacious plant mitogens like PHA as previously reported. The expanded disclosure of a collaborator's method suggesting superior potential for cancer cure involves a unique application of pokeweed mitogen that delivers various cellular and cytokine responses directly to the tumor.",['Wimer BM'],1998,13,3,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Wimer BM.

10797384,Antigenic properties and diagnostic potential of recombinant dobrava virus nucleocapsid protein.,"Dobrava hantavirus (DOBV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Balkan region and has been detected recently also in Russia, Estonia, and Germany. DOBV nucleocapsid protein (N) was produced in insect cells, using the baculovirus expression system (bac-DOBV-N), and in E. coli as a truncated (aa 1-165) glutathione-S transferase fusion protein (DOBV-dN-GST). The antigenic properties of bac-DOBV-N were found identical to native DOBV-N when examined by a panel of hantavirus-specific monoclonal antibodies. Enzyme immunoassays for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies were set up using DOBV recombinant N proteins and compared with those based on recombinant Hantaan and Puumala virus N, using panels of sera collected from DOBV, Hantaan and Puumala virus-infected patients. Full-length N protein (bac-DOBV-N) was found to be a more sensitive antigen than DOBV-dN-GST. The sensitivity values for sera from DOBV-infected patients were 100% for bac-DOBV-N and 86% for DOBV-dN-GST by IgM assays, and 98% for bac-DOBV-N and 88% for DOBV-dN-GST by IgG assays. The specificity values were 100% for bac-DOBV-N and 99% for DOBV-dN-GST by IgM assays, and 100% for both antigens by IgG assays.","['Kallio-Kokko H', 'Lundkvist A', 'Plyusnin A', 'Avsic-Zupanc T', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O']",2000,61,2,J Med Virol,"Kallio-Kokko H, et al.

10761733,Serologic evidence of Puumala virus infection in wild moose in northern Sweden.,"Puumala (PUU) virus is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica, the Scandinavian form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The infection is acquired by airborne transmission of PUU virus from its rodent reservoir, the bank vole. Besides serologic data indicating that the virus may spread also to heterologous rodents, there is little information on the susceptibility of wild living animals to PUU virus. We studied the occurrence of antibodies to PUU virus in serum samples from 427 wild-living moose, of which 260 originated from the PUU virus-endemic northern and central parts of Sweden and 167 originated from the southern, nonendemic part of Sweden. Samples from 5 animals showed reactivity in an ELISA for recombinant PUU virus nucleocapsid protein, an immunofluorescent assay, and a neutralization test. These 5 animals all originated from the PUU virus-endemic northern part of Sweden. In conclusion, 5 of 260 moose from the endemic region showed convincing serologic evidence of past PUU virus infection. The seroprevalence was low, suggesting that the moose is subjected to endstage infection rather than being part of an enzootic transmission cycle.","['Ahlm C', 'Wallin K', 'Lundkvist A', 'Elgh F', 'Juto P', 'Merza M', 'Tärnvik A']",2000,62,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Ahlm C, et al.

10711409,Detection of Hantaan and Seoul viruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in renal syndrome patients with hemorrhagic fever.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), also called Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF), is the most common cause of acute renal failure in the Far East. Two serotypes of hantavirus, Hantaan and Seoul viruses are known pathogens for HFRS in Korea.
PURPOSE: To elucidate the diagnostic applicability for the serotype diagnosis in HFRS patients, we used nested reverse transcriptase-PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (nRT-PCR/RFLP) to screen 2 prototype viruses, 11 virus isolates from HFRS patients, and 69 specimens obtained from 31 HFRS patients.
METHODS: The nRT-PCR was performed using primers specific for the G1 segments of the Hantaan (HF3 1140-1163, HB14 1363-1342) and Seoul (SF2 809-832, SB3 1200-1177) viruses. The initial PCR products were then further amplified using nested primers for the Hantaan (HF4 1141-1164, HB13 1360-1339) and Seoul (SF7 863-884, SB1 1165-1142 ) viruses. Amplified segments were then digested with restriction enzymes specific for either Hantaan (C1a I) or Seoul (Sac I) virus sequences.
RESULTS: In all cultured viruses, the serotypes identified by nRT-PCR/RFLP were consistent with those of PRNT. nRT-PCR/RFLP results indicated the presence of Hantaan virus in 10 patients and of Seoul virus in 15 patients. In 3 patients, both Hantaan- and Seoul-specific amplified bands were visualized in serially collected samples, and in 4 patients no amplicon was detected. Among 69 specimens, 55 were positive; these positive specimens were obtained between days 3 and days 33 of illness. The positive rate was not affected by the clinical phase, day of illness, or severity of HFRS.
CONCLUSIONS: nRT-PCR/RFLP is a rapid and convenient method for serotype diagnosis in most HFRS patients. It could also allow detection of genetic variation of hantavirus within the same serotype.","['Ahn C', 'Cho JT', 'Lee JG', 'Lim CS', 'Kim YY', 'Han JS', 'Kim S', 'Lee JS']",2000,53,2,Clin Nephrol,"Ahn C, et al.

We report the behaviour of HFRs during haemopoietic recovery in two patients who were affected by severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) and treated with horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin A (CsA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A HFR value > 5% of the total reticulocyte count, a reticulocyte count > 30 x 10(9)/l, and a polymorphonuclear (PMN) count > 0.5 x 10(9)/l were found after 9 and 8, 20 and 46, and 16 and 22 days, respectively, after the end of ATG. HFR recovery to > 5% anticipated the rise of PMN > 0.5 x 10(9)/l by at least 7 and 14 days, respectively.

The results demonstrated that the infection naturally circulating in the voles is chronic (lasting for up to 15 months) and asymptomatic, with a peak of Puumala virus accumulation and release from the organism during the first month after infection. It was shown that the bank vole population includes young animals with maternal immunity, which remain resistant to the Puumala virus infection for 3-3.5 months. The infection rate in voles depended on the age and sexual maturity of animals. The greatest proportion of seropositive animals was observed among overwintered males.

10628132,Seroprevalence study of Hantavirus infection in the community based population.,"The genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae, comprise at least 20 distinct viruses. Ten of these have been linked to specific human diseases. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome has been recognized since the 1950s. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was recognized in the United States in 1993. Epizootiologic studies of Norway rats in the Baltimore area have shown that rodent infections with hantaviruses are common and geographically widespread with prevalence reaching 44% in tested rat populations. These viruses are antigenically related to the Seoul virus. Hantavirus infections in humans occur through transmission from a rodent reservoir, primarily by inhalation of virus laden rodent excreta. There is no evidence to support person-to-person transmission of any known Hantavirus. To establish the prevalence of Hantavirus infections in humans in the Baltimore area we collected sera from 1,212 persons attending a community based health care system. These were tested for antibodies against three reference Hantavirus strains: Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), and Convict Creek (HN017). HN017 was chosen to represent the SinNombre (SN-like) strains of Hantavirus. Sera from nine patients were positive to Hantavirus specific antibodies, HTN, and SEO by Enzyme Linked Imuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). No sera were positive for HN017 antigen. All sera that were positive for HTN and SEO were tested by western blot for HTN. All nine sera were confirmed positive by western blot. This suggests that unrecognized infections with Hantaan or Seoul-like viruses occur in the Baltimore area in humans, although the prevalence rate in humans is low (0.74%). Epidemiologic monitoring may be warranted to establish the health implications of these infections.","['Diglisic G', 'Rossi CA', 'Doti A', 'Walshe DK']",1999,48,6,Md Med J,"Diglisic G, et al.

A Phase I dose-escalation study in 16 volunteers divided into four groups demonstrated that subcutaneous inoculation of approximately 10(7) plaque-forming units of the recombinant virus was safe and immunogenic. Vaccination of a fifth group of 12 volunteers indicated that neutralizing antibody titers to both vaccinia virus and Hantaan virus were enhanced after a second inoculation. Comparing two routes of vaccination showed that scarification effectively induced neutralizing antibodies in vaccinia virus-naive volunteers but that subcutaneous inoculation was superior to scarification in vaccinia virus-immune individuals. A Phase II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 142 volunteers. Two subcutaneous vaccinations were administered at 4-week intervals. Neutralizing antibodies to Hantaan virus or to vaccinia virus were detected in 72% or 98% of vaccinia virus-naive volunteers, respectively.

10475080,A new Clethrionomys-derived hantavirus from Germany: evidence for distinct genetic sublineages of Puumala viruses in Western Europe.,"Puumala (PUU) viruses are the predominant etiologic agents of hantavirus infections in Europe. The most important reservoir is the bank vole, Clethrionomys glareolus (Cg), belonging to the subfamily Arvicolinae of the Muridae family. Here we report on the molecular characterization of the first rodent-derived sequence (PUU/Cg-Erft) from Germany. Comparison of the S and M segment coding regions revealed 92.5 and 92.8% identity, respectively, with PUU/H-9013, a human isolate from France. However, only 83.1% identity was found with the S segment of a previously reported PUU sequence from a German HFRS case (PUU/H-Berkel) indicating the co-existence of two distinct sublineages in Germany. Phylogenetic and alignment analyses of S and M segment coding regions enabled us to assign PUU viruses/sequences to at least six distinct genetic sublineages. Membership was defined by nucleotide sequence differences of < 8%, whereas a diversity of > 14% clearly outgrouped a virus/sequence. Based on S segment sequences the sublineage represented by Clethrionomys rufocanus-derived viruses from Japan diverged at a well supported node from the clade harbouring all Clethrionomys glareolus-derived European PUU viruses. A correlation between genetic relationship and geographic origin of PUU viruses was observed which may support a co-evolution of PUU viruses with distinct subspecies of their reservoir host.","['Heiske A', 'Anheier B', 'Pilaski J', 'Volchkov VE', 'Feldmann H']",1999,61,2,Virus Res,"Heiske A, et al.

To determine whether serological assays need to be based on the homologous viral antigen rather than on closely related hantavirus antigens, acute and convalescent sera from patients with HFRS collected in former Yugoslavia were examined for IgM and IgG to three hantavirus antigens; DOB, Hantaan (HTN) and Puumala (PUU). Focus reduction neutralization test was included for comparison and confirmation of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results. Although the results showed that the cross-reactivity was high between these three antigens during the acute phase of the disease, one of 155 patients serum samples reacted only in the DOB antigen-based IgM assay. The evaluation of IgG reactivities revealed that a DOB antigen-based IgG ELISA has to be used in sero-epidemiological studies; 7.1% (11/155) of the acute phase/early convalescent sera and 12.5% (2/16) of the late convalescent sera, respectively, reacted only with the homologous DOB antigen.","['Sjölander KB', 'Lundkvist A']",1999,80,2,J Virol Methods,Sjölander KB and Lundkvist A.

10461425,Expression of ICAM-1 on the Hantaan virus-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"OBJECTIVES: In HFRS, there is a varying degree of disseminated intravascular coagulation which was evident in the early phase of the illness. It is believed also that DIC would be the consequence, at least in part, of functional changes of endothelium resulting in kinin activation and clinical syndrome. This study investigated the role of adhesion molecule in the pathogenesis of Hantaan virus-related disease.
METHODS: The expression of ICAM-1 antigen on the cell membrane of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and ICAM-1 mRNA in the endothelial cells was assessed by in situ hybridization after Hantaan virus infection (2.6 x 10(4) PFU/mL) with the time course.
RESULTS: In immunohistochemistry, the number of ICAM-1 positive cells increased with time during the 12 or 24 hours after infection. 5 to 10% of HUVECs had been positive after 12-24 hours and the number of positive cells decreased abruptly after 24 hours. Hantaan antigen had been noticed after 12 hours focally on the HUVECs but continued to proliferate into day 7 post-infection when most of HUVECs were infected by Hantaan virus. In situ hybridization showed identical patterns of ICAM-1 mRNA expression after Hantaan virus infection.
CONCLUSION: It implies that the Hantaan virus infection on HUVECs would express more ICAM-1 on their surface and implicated in the pathogenesis of early clinical syndrome of HFRS.","['Song JS', 'Min CH', 'Kang E', 'Yu SH']",1999,14,2,Korean J Intern Med,"Song JS, et al.

Outbreaks occur in Belgium with a 3- to 4-year interval with an increasing number of cases. We describe the largest outbreak so far in Belgium with 217 serologically and clinically confirmed cases in the period between October 1995 and December 1996. We demonstrated that the use of viral antigen derived from a local PUU-strain was able to detect significantly more sera positive for IgM in an immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore, although in some cases SEO, HTN and DOB antibody-reactivities were detected by ELISA, only PUU infections could be confirmed by neutralization test.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A trial of SE enrolled 70 HFRS patients (58 males, 12 females aged under 30 years) compatible by the disease severity. They were divided into two groups. 42 patients of the control group received standard therapy, 28 patients of the study group received adjuvant 12% solution of SE in daily dose 1500-2000 mg in the course of HFRS oliguria period. Hemostatic parameters were measured before and after the cuff test to investigate the condition of vascular wall with calculation of the athrombogenicity index (the ratio of the relevant indices before and after the cuff test). SE effects on vascular endothelium was assessed by a blind method.
RESULTS: In oliguria, both groups had baseline antiaggregation indices significantly higher than in the control. After the cuff test, control patients' indices tended to an increase while in the study group there was a marked decrease. The trend in anticoagulant activity of microvascular endothelium did not differ much with the groups. This picture persisted also in polyuria. In convalescence hemostasis was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION: SE enhances antiaggregant activity of vascular endothelium in oliguria period of HFRS without affecting its anticoagulant properties. This is explained by a direct effect of SE on vascular endothelium.","['Davidovich IM', 'Sirotin BZ', 'Parshina TA']",1999,71,6,Ter Arkh,"Davidovich IM, et al.

10418904,Antibody responses in humans to an inactivated hantavirus vaccine (Hantavax).,"Hantaviruses cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and result in severe human morbidity and mortality. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently in order to reduce the incidence of human illness. Hitherto studies of hantavirus vaccine efficiency have been limited to individuals at low risk of infection. In this study the immune response to an inactivated hantavirus vaccine was measured in 64 human volunteers at high risk of infection by virtue of residence and occupation. 30 d after vaccination, 79% of subjects developed a significant hantavirus antibody titre as measured by immunofluorescence (IFA) and 62% by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroconversion rates increased to 97% one month after the booster dose. Neutralising antibody titres paralleled this trend with 13% of vaccine recipients producing neutralising antibody one month after the first dose and 75% of vaccine recipients responding one month after boosting. Antibody titres had declined by one year, however, with only 37% and 43% of sera positive by IFA and ELISA, respectively. Re-vaccination at this time produced a vigorous anamnestic response with 94% and 100% of vaccine recipients yielding positive antibody titres. Only 50% of the sampled population, however, produced neutralising antibodies following the booster dose one year later. The vaccine was well tolerated and there were no apparent differences in the responses of males and females. However, further improvement of this vaccine is necessary in order to induce a more longlasting humoral immune response.","['Cho HW', 'Howard CR']",1999,17,20-21,Vaccine,Cho HW and Howard CR.

10398496,Pathogenesis of puumala and other hantavirus infections.,"Hantaviruses are rodent/insectivore-borne negative-stranded RNA viruses which belong to the Bunyaviridae family. They do not cause any symptomatic disease in their adult carrier rodents, but in humans they are aetiologic agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), both associated with a significant mortality. In cell culture hantaviruses do not cause cytopathic effects and the mechanisms of disease in man are not well understood. Increased capillary permeability is a central phenomenon in the pathogenesis of hantavirus infections. Although the viruses have in vivo a predilection for endothelial cells, it is presumed that inflammatory mediators of the host immune response play a significant role in the capillary leak that may produce abrupt hypotension and shock in severely ill patients. Mediators released by activated macrophages including NO and TNF-alpha are considered important. The pathogenesis of renal failure in HFRS also awaits to be resolved. This review summarises what is known about these phenomena and discusses also the molecular basis of the putative virulence factors of hantaviruses. Finally, the genetic predisposition and HLA association with severe Puumala virus infection will be discussed.

10369509,Puumala virus infections in Finland: increased occupational risk for farmers.,"Puumala hantavirus, transmitted by bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), causes a mild-type hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The disease is common in Finland and is considered an occupational hazard for farmers, but the actual risk has not been assessed by analytical studies. Data on 5,132 serologically confirmed Puumala virus infections during 1989-1994 were analyzed, and cases among farmers and the population living in similar conditions were compared. The farmers contracted the disease earlier and more often than did the comparison group. In the province of Mikkeli with the highest incidence (70/100,000), the risk ratio was 5.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-8.4) for 20- to 29-year-old farmers; in the older age groups, the risk was still increased but the risk ratios were lower. The peak incidence in the comparison group was 10 years later (age group 30-39 years). For the whole country, the result was similar although less marked. The average risk ratio adjusted by age, sex, and geographic variation was 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-1.8) for the whole country and 1.9 (95% CI 1.5-2.3) for the Mikkeli province, where 80% of Puumala virus infections among young farmers could be estimated to be attributable to occupation.","['Vapalahti K', 'Paunio M', 'Brummer-Korvenkontio M', 'Vaheri A', 'Vapalahti O']",1999,149,12,Am J Epidemiol,"Vapalahti K, et al.

We examined the human memory T-lymphocyte responses of three donors who had previous laboratory-acquired infections with Hantaan virus. We demonstrated virus-specific responses in bulk cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from all donors. Bulk T-cell responses were directed against either Hantaan virus nucleocapsid (N) or G1 protein, and these responses varied between donors. We established both CD4(+) and CD8(+) N-specific cell lines from two donors and CD4(+) G1-specific cell lines from a third donor. All CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines recognized one of two epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein: one epitope spanning amino acids 12 to 20 and the other spanning amino acids 421 to 429. The CTL lines specific for amino acids 12 to 20 were restricted by HLA B51, and those specific for amino acids 421 to 429 were restricted by HLA A1. The N-specific CTL lines isolated from these two donors included both Hantaan virus-specific CTLs and hantavirus cross-reactive CTLs. Responses to both epitopes are detectable in short-term bulk cultures of PBMC from one donor, and precursor frequency analysis confirms that CTLs specific for these epitopes are present at relatively high precursor frequencies in the peripheral T-cell pool. These data suggest that infection with Hantaan virus results in the generation of CTL to limited epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein and that infection also results in the generation of cross-reactive T-cell responses to distantly related hantaviruses which cause the distinct hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. This is the first demonstration of human T-lymphocyte responses to Hantaan virus.","['Van Epps HL', 'Schmaljohn CS', 'Ennis FA']",1999,73,7,J Virol,"Van Epps HL, et al.

Aetiological, serological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were performed. Results showed that not only pigs could be infected with EHFV under natural or experimental conditions but susceptible to EHFV as well.

10196290,Cellular entry of hantaviruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is mediated by beta3 integrins.,"Hantaviruses replicate primarily in the vascular endothelium and cause two human diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). In this report, we demonstrate that the cellular entry of HFRS-associated hantaviruses is facilitated by specific integrins expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and Vero E6 cells by the HFRS-causing hantaviruses Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), and Puumala (PUU) is inhibited by antibodies to alphavbeta3 integrins and by the integrin ligand vitronectin. The cellular entry of HTN, SEO, and PUU viruses, but not the nonpathogenic Prospect Hill (PH) hantavirus (i.e., a virus with no associated human disease), was also mediated by introducting recombinant alphaIIbbeta3 or alphavbeta3 integrins into beta3-integrin-deficient CHO cells. In addition, PH infectivity was not inhibited by alphavbeta3-specific sera or vitronectin but was blocked by alpha5beta1-specific sera and the integrin ligand fibronectin. RGD tripeptides, which are required for many integrin-ligand interactions, are absent from all hantavirus G1 and G2 surface glycoproteins, and GRGDSP peptides did not inhibit hantavirus infectivity. Further, a mouse-human hybrid beta3 integrin-specific Fab fragment, c7E3 (ReoPro), also inhibited the infectivity of HTN, SEO, and PUU as well as HPS-associated hantaviruses, Sin Nombre (SN) and New York-1 (NY-1). These findings indicate that pathogenic HPS- and HFRS-causing hantaviruses enter cells via beta3 integrins, which are present on the surfaces of platelets, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Since beta3 integrins regulate vascular permeability and platelet function, these findings also correlate beta3 integrin usage with common elements of hantavirus pathogenesis.","['Gavrilovskaya IN', 'Brown EJ', 'Ginsberg MH', 'Mackow ER']",1999,73,5,J Virol,"Gavrilovskaya IN, et al.

10100354,[Hantavirus and pulmonary pathology].,"The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome recognized in the United States in 1993 quickly brought the formerly little known virus into the limelight. Contrary to what has been written almost everywhere, this is not a ""new"" virus causing new ""emerging"" disease. Hantaviruses have been harbored in their natural hosts, three subfamilies of murine rodents, for millions of years. The phylogenetic classifications of these viruses follows that of their hosts, proving close adaptation and contradicting short-term emergence of American serotypes in Eurasia. Certain hantaviruses are the causal agents of renal diseases of variable severity grouped together under the term of hemorrhagic fever with a renal syndrome in Eurasia. Others cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in North America. Most cases occur in adults and the sex-ratio always favors men, probably due to exposure to airborne rodent ejections. No interhuman contamination is observed. A few dozen cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are reported annually in North America and a few hundred cases in Europe. China is the only country were incidence has been high enough for hundreds of years to lead to an experimentation on vaccines. Hantaviruses are difficult to isolate and diagnosis in humans is based on serology. Improved diagnostic tools have led to a better assessment of the impact of this virus on public health. An epidemic in France in 1996 caused 230 cases while only 808 cases had been registered since 1977. Most of the cases occurred in Northeastern France and were focalized.",['Le Guenno B'],1998,54,6,Rev Pneumol Clin,Le Guenno B. [Hantavirus and pulmonary pathology].

The epidemiology of human diseases caused by these viruses is tied to the ecology of the rodent hosts, and effective control and prevention relies on a through understanding of host ecology.

These studies, which used mark-recapture techniques on 24 trapping webs at nine sites in the southwestern United States, were designed to monitor changes in reservoir population densities and in the prevalence and incidence of infection; quantify environmental factors associated with these changes; and when linked to surveillance databases for HPS, lead to predictive models of human risk to be used in the design and implementation of control and prevention measures for human hantavirus disease.","['Mills JN', 'Yates TL', 'Ksiazek TG', 'Peters CJ', 'Childs JE']",1999,5,1,Emerg Infect Dis,"Mills JN, et al.

10073292,Spectrum of hantavirus infection: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.,"Hantaviruses chronically infect rodents without apparent disease, but when they are spread by aerosolized excreta to humans, two major clinical syndromes result: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Both diseases appear to be immunopathologic, and inflammatory mediators are important in causing the clinical manifestations. In HPS, T cells act on heavily infected pulmonary endothelium, and it is suspected that gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor are major agents of a reversible increase in vascular permeability that leads to severe, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. HFRS has prominent systemic manifestations. The retroperitoneum is a major site of vascular leak and the kidneys suffer tubular necrosis. Both syndromes are accompanied by myocardial depression and hypotension or shock. HFRS is primarily a Eurasian disease, whereas HPS appears to be confined to the Americas; these geographic distinctions correlate with the phylogenies of the rodent hosts and the viruses that coevolved with them.","['Peters CJ', 'Simpson GL', 'Levy H']",1999,50,,Annu Rev Med,"Peters CJ, et al.

We vaccinated BALB/c mice with three doses of the M or S DNA vaccine at 4-week intervals by either gene gun inoculation of the epidermis or needle inoculation into the gastrocnemius muscle. Both routes of vaccination resulted in antibody responses as measured by ELISA; however, gene gun inoculation elicited a higher frequency of seroconversion and higher levels of antibodies in individual mice. We vaccinated Syrian hamsters with the M or S construct using the gene gun and found hantavirus-specific antibodies in five of five and four of five hamsters, respectively. Animals vaccinated with the M construct developed a neutralizing antibody response that was greatly enhanced in the presence of guinea pig complement. Immunized hamsters were challenged with SEOV and, after 28 days, were monitored for evidence of infection.

Results of double- and triple-colour immunofluorescence analysis showed an increased percentage of cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+) in seropositive patients compared with seronegatives and healthy controls. The majority of seropositive HFRS patients expressed activation and memory antigens on T and B lymphocytes. The percentage of CD23+ and CD21+ B lymphocytes was lower in seropositive patients. HFRS patients had elevated levels of sCD23 and five had elevated total IgE. The increased expression of both early and late T cell activation antigens, e.g. CD25, CD71 and HLA-DR, memory cells and sCD23 positively correlated with biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, urea, alpha2-globulin) during the acute phase of HFRS.

Antibodies from patients infected with one hantavirus cross-react to varying degrees with the nucleocapsid protein of other viruses of the genus. We studied the cross-reactivity in serially obtained blood samples from 17 patients with nephropathia epidemica, a European form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala virus. Recombinant truncated nucleocapsid protein (aa 1-117) of Puumala virus and four other hantaviruses, Hantaan, Seoul, Dobrava and Sin Nombre viruses, were used as antigens in an indirect ELISA. In most patients, an IgG response to the Puumala virus derived recombinant protein was detected within 2-8 days of onset of disease, remained high for 2-5 months, and declined gradually within 2-3 years. All patients had IgG antibodies cross-reacting with the nucleocapsid protein of Sin Nombre virus. The ratio of the ELISA values obtained with Sin Nombre vs. Puumala virus protein as antigen increased with time after onset of disease. To a lesser extent, cross-reacting IgG antibodies also occurred to Hantaan, Seoul, and Dobrava virus antigens. In the acute phase of the disease, two patients showed IgG antibodies to one or more of these viruses whereas 2-5 months later, 11 of 16 patients had IgG antibodies to all three viruses. IgM and IgA responses to the nucleocapsid protein of Puumala virus were transitory and cross-reactivities were weak. In conclusion, after onset of nephropathia epidemica the IgG response to the Puumala virus nucleocapsid protein was associated with a gradually increasing cross-reactivity to the nucleocapsid protein of heterologous hantavirus.

PATIENT AND METHODS: Comprehensive and repeated ophthalmic examinations of a previously healthy 35-year-old woman with acute Puumala virus infection were performed. Special attention was paid to ophthalmic A-scan ultrasound measurements and simultaneous blood chemistry tests.
RESULTS: The ocular manifestations of this patient's illness included transient myopia, low intraocular pressure, conjunctival hemorrhages and changes of intraocular dimensions. There was forward movement of the anterior diaphragm and thickening of the crystalline lens, which occurred simultaneously with prominent fluctuations in the electrolyte balance, especially potassium.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes in intraocular dimensions may have been caused by simultaneous fluctuations in electrolyte and osmotic balance, which could explain the myopic shift. The symmetry of the ocular measurements implied a systemic infection as the underlying reason for the ophthalmic symptoms and signs.","['Kontkanen M', 'Puustjärvi T']",1998,236,9,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Kontkanen M and Puustjärvi T.

Several reports have shown an association of hantavirus antibody titers and the occurrence of renal dysfunction. From these observations, it appears that the virus is widely distributed, and different strains prevail in various areas. In the present work we studied 81 patients with end-stage renal-failure under hemodialysis (HD) treatment, 55 with mild to moderate renal failure, and 50 healthy subjects for the presence of antibodies to Hantaan and Puumala viruses. We found that 12.3% of the hemodialysis patients and 9% of the mild to moderate renal failure patients had elevated IgG anti-body titers to Puumala virus compared with 2% of the controls. IgM antibodies to Puumala virus was principally elevated in patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) not on hemodialysis (14.5%) compared with the hemodialyzed (1.2%) and controls (0%) subjects. Hantaan virus IgG antibodies were detected in 3.7% of the HD patients, 5.5% of the CRF not on HD, and in none of the controls. IgM Hantaan antibodies were found only in the non-HD renal failure patients. None of the sera were found to contain antibodies to phospholipids or single-stranded DNA. These results emphasize the widespread nature of infection with hantaviruses and imply that elaborate testing for these serologies should be performed, especially in patients with unexplained renal failure.","['George J', 'Patnaik M', 'Bakshi E', 'Levy Y', 'Ben-David A', 'Ahmed A', 'Peter JB', 'Shoenfeld Y']",1998,11,2,Viral Immunol,"George J, et al.

Data of the patients were compared with those of 8 normal volunteers (NC). MA was observed in 6 of 8 patients in the oliguric phase, 5 of 7 in the early diuretic phase, 8 of 10 in the late diuretic phase and 2 of 9 in the convalescent phase. HFRS patients with MA had a higher plasma anion gap in the oliguric and early diuretic phases than NC and a higher plasma Cl/Na ratio in the late diuretic phase than NC. As compared with acid-loaded NC, HFRS patients had a higher urine pH in the oliguric, early diuretic and late diuretic phases, a higher urine anion gap (UAG) in the oliguric and early diuretic phases and a lower urinary NH4+ excretory rate in the oliguric, early diuretic and late diuretic phases.

All are negative-stranded RNA viruses, with genomes in two segments, three segments, or non-segmented, respectively. Acquisition of haemorrhagic fever in man generally requires close contact with a vertebrate vector species, usually rodents, for the arenaviruses and bunyaviruses. In the case of filoviruses, the vector is currently unknown, but these viruses may infect monkeys, and may contaminate cell cultures prepared from them. Both bunyavirus and arenavirus haemorrhagic fevers have arisen in humans following exposure to rodents, and in the case of Hantaan, a virus causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), there have been numerous laboratory-acquired infections among animal care workers. As the technology to differentiate virus species has improved, it has become clear that there are numerous potentially hazardous viruses capable of causing HFRS or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) within the feral rodent population. In many cases it would be desirable to introduce screening methods for such viruses before preparing cell cultures from these rodent or simian species that will be used to prepare biological products for human use.",['Mahy BW'],1998,93,,Dev Biol Stand,Mahy BW.

These adjacent farming communities have a population of about 100,000. Data were collected from the two communities in 1961-1977 and from Yingshang County in 1983-1995; information covered the incidence of HFRS, amount of precipitation, differences in the water level of the Huai River, density of Apodemus agrarius, autumn crop production, and areas of inundated farmland. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate the relation between seasonal rainfall, density of mice, occupational factors, and occurrence of the disease. Associations were observed between the incidence of HFRS and the amount of precipitation, the water level of the Huai River, and the areas of inundated farmland in Chuigang community. The smaller the water-level difference, the less farmland was inundated and the higher the incidence of HFRS. In Wanggang community, the density of A. agrarius (r1=0.63, p=0.02), the water-level difference in the Huai River (r2=-0.81, p=0.007), and crop production (r3=0.96, p=0.005) were correlated with the incidence of HFRS. The regression analyses based on Wanggang community suggested that these indexes could be used as predictive variables, and the results from the model were well calibrated with the actual incidence of HFRS in that community (R2=0.88, p < 0.01) and Yingshang County (R2=0.91, p < 0.01).","['Bi P', 'Wu X', 'Zhang F', 'Parton KA', 'Tong S']",1998,148,3,Am J Epidemiol,"Bi P, et al.

Although liver dysfunction has been reported in HFRS, hepatic manifestations of hantaviral infection have not been well described. We describe a case of autoimmune cholangitis in which an exacerbation of hepatitis was associated with hantaviral infection. Seroconversion of both IgG- and IgM-class antibodies to hantavirus was noted coincident with acute exacerbation of hepatitis, which was resolved promptly by treatment with corticosteroid. No extrahepatic manifestations were noted. This case suggests that hantavirus may trigger acute exacerbation of autoimmune liver disease without extrahepatic manifestations and that it may cause community-acquired hepatitis.","['Yotsuyanagi H', 'Koike K', 'Meng G', 'Yasuda K', 'Ogata I', 'Kimura S', 'Ohkubo A']",1998,30,1,Scand J Infect Dis,"Yotsuyanagi H, et al.

9661842,Retrospective serological and genetic study of the distribution of hantaviruses in Greece.,"A retrospective serological and genetic study of hantaviruses responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Greece during the last 17 years is presented. Fifty-one serum samples taken from 30 HFRS cases previously diagnosed by immunofluorescence assay were tested by ELISA for IgG (Hantaan, Dobrava, and Puumala) and IgM antibodies (Hantaan and Puumala). Results were compatible with the majority of infections being related to hantaviruses carried by rodents of the subfamily Murinae. RNA was extracted from 26 selected samples and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using primers specifically designed for the detection of hanta-viruses associated with murine (MS-N-specific, MM-G1-specific primers) or arvicoline rodents (PPT-N-specific primers). In addition, primers previously designed for the detection of the G2 coding region of the Murine-associated hanta-viruses were also used. Sequencing of the PCR products was then performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence differences. Eleven out of the 26 serum samples tested were found to be positive by PCR with the MS-N primers, whereas four were positive with the MM-G1 primers, and only two with the G2 primers. None of the samples was found positive with the PPT primers. The sequence analysis showed that the virus that was responsible for these 11 HFRS cases was the Dobrava virus, which is endemic throughout the Balkans.","['Papa A', 'Johnson AM', 'Stockton PC', 'Bowen MD', 'Spiropoulou CF', 'Alexiou-Daniel S', 'Ksiazek TG', 'Nichol ST', 'Antoniadis A']",1998,55,4,J Med Virol,"Papa A, et al.

There were 125 patients reported to the National Croatian Institute of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology. The disease occurred simultaneously in several localities, some of them close to the previously known natural foci (Mala Kapela, western Slavonia); the focus on Dinara was newly discovered. War circumstances in Croatia were closely related to this outbreak. There were 50 patients hospitalized in the University Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Zagreb; 5 of them were civilians from Zagreb area and 45 soldiers (Mala Kapela 33, Dinara 7, western Slavonia 5). In all patients the disease was serologically proven (in 6 by indirect immunofluorescence method and in 44 by ELISA-test). Both previously known types of viruses--Hantaan and Puumala were diagnosed in each locality. In general, the illness was more severe in patients with Hantaan virus infection. Two patients died, the illness was severe in 25, moderately severe in 11 and mild in 12 patients. For the first time inflammatory lung changes were recorded in 13 out of 37 (35.1%) patients who were examined by X-ray in the early stage of the disease.","['Kuzman I', 'Markotić A', 'Turcinov D', 'Beus I']",1997,119,11-12,Lijec Vjesn,"Kuzman I, et al.

9646005,Evaluation of Puumala virus IgG and IgM enzyme immunoassays based on recombinant baculovirus-expressed nucleocapsid protein for early nephropathia epidemica diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Puumala virus (PUU), a member of Hantavirus genus, is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Rapid diagnosis is essential for clinical management of NE.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of recombinant protein-based IgM (direct- and mu-capture) and IgG (direct-and antigen (Ag)-capture) enzyme immunoassays (EIA) in early diagnosis of NE in comparison to IgG immunofluorescence assay (IF), and to find out the time limit for PUU-specific antibody seroconversion.
STUDY DESIGN: The specific IgM and IgG antibody responses in serum were analyzed in 109 patients (235 serial sera) and 114 patients (233 serial sera), respectively. The serum panel used was selected from a larger material according to the availability of information concerning the date after onset of symptoms, the panel also containing NE patients who had been IgG-IF negative in their first (early) samples to find out the possible differences between sensitivities of the EIAs and IF.
RESULTS: All NE patients tested became IgM-positive at the latest on the 6th (mu-capture EIA) or 7th (direct-IgM EIA) day after onset of symptoms. Out of a panel of very early NE-patient sera (n = 38) that could not be detected by IgG-IF, 66% were already positive with both direct-IgM EIA and mu-capture EIA. When comparing IgG EIAs and IgG-IF, 98% of IF-positive sera from NE patients were also positive with direct-IgG EIA, and 99% with Ag-capture IgG EIA. Out of a panel of very early NE-patient sera (n = 37) that could not be detected by IgG-IF, 57% were positive with direct-IgG EIA, and 27% with Ag-capture IgG EIA.
CONCLUSIONS: The baculovirus-expressed PUU-N-based IgG and IgM EIAs were found most suitable for NE diagnosis, giving the opportunity in some cases for earlier diagnosis as compared with PUU-IgG IF.","['Kallio-Kokko H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Lundkvist A', 'Vaheri A']",1998,10,1,Clin Diagn Virol,"Kallio-Kokko H, et al.

9630057,Prevalence of antibodies specific to Puumala virus among farmers in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVES: The Puumala virus is the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica, a European form of hemorrhagic fever with a renal syndrome. From its reservoir in bank voles, the virus is spread by airborne transmission to humans. Occupational risks for the acquisition of nephropathia epidemica are not well defined. The prevalence of serum antibodies to Puumala virus was determined for Swedish farmers. From a comparison of the prevalence among farmers from various parts of the country, the assumption that Puumala virus occurs endemically only in the northern and central parts of Sweden was also tested.
METHODS: Serum samples from 910 farmers and 663 referents living in various rural parts of Sweden were tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of Puumala virus as the antigen.
RESULTS: North of a latitude of 59 degrees N, the prevalence of Puumala virus antibodies was significantly higher among farmers (12.9%) than among referents (6.8%). In the southern areas, antibodies to Puumala virus were rare, and altogether only 2 of 459 persons had antibodies. Seropositive persons did not differ from seronegative ones with regard to blood pressure, and they did not comprise cases of chronic renal disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Serological evidence confirmed that the exposure of humans to Puumala virus is firmly restricted to the northern and central parts of Sweden. In addition the evidence indicated that, in this region, farming is associated with an increased risk of contracting hantavirus infection.","['Ahlm C', 'Thelin A', 'Elgh F', 'Juto P', 'Stiernström EL', 'Holmberg S', 'Tärnvik A']",1998,24,2,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Ahlm C, et al.

When mice were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) twice at 2-week intervals with B-1 vaccine admixed with or without 100 micrograms mouse-1 of B30-MDP (B-1/B30-MDP) or MDP-Lys(L18) [B-1/MDP-Lys(L18)], mice immunized with B-1/B30-MDP as well as B-1/MDP-Lys(L18) showed significantly higher indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers against HFRS virus than mice immunized with B-1 vaccine alone. Both mice treated with B-1/B30-MDP and B-1/MDP-Lys(L18) also exhibited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against HFRS virus than mice immunized with B-1 vaccine alone during 3-9 weeks after the primary immunization. The evaluation of antibody-producing cells by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay on week 4 revealed that both MDP derivatives enhanced the number of HFRS virus-specific IgG1 and IgM antibody-producing cells. Furthermore, mice treated with B-1/B30-MDP as well as B-1/MDP-Lys(L18) showed a higher level of Th-2 type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-6, in sera than mice treated with B-1 alone. In an in-vitro analysis of T lymphocyte proliferation to baculovirus-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) of Hantaan 76-118 strain, the splenocytes of mice treated with B-1/B30-MDP and B-1/MDP-Lys(L18) on week 4 showed a significantly higher proliferating activity than those treated with B-1 vaccine alone. In addition, when mice were immunized once with B-1 vaccine admixed with or without B30-MDP and MDP-Lys(L18) and followed by intrafootpad (i.f.) injection of B-1 vaccine on day 7, mice immunized with B-1/B30-MDP and B-1/MDP-Lys(L18) induced a higher delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction than mice immunized with B-1 vaccine alone. These results suggest that B30-MDP and MDP-Lys(L18) are useful immunoadjuvants to enhance the ability of inactivated B-1 vaccine to induce a humoral and cellular response to HFRS virus.","['Yoo YC', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Koike Y', 'Hatsuse R', 'Yamanishi K', 'Tanishita O', 'Arikawa J', 'Azuma I']",1998,16,2-3,Vaccine,"Yoo YC, et al.

9569954,Evaluation of renal tubular functions in convalescent phase of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"To evaluate renal tubular functions and to investigate the causative factors of urinary-concentrating defects in the late stage of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), 11 HFRS patients in the convalescent phase were studied and compared with 8 acute renal failure (ARF) patients in convalescence (disease controls) and 9 healthy adults preparing for kidney donation (normal controls, NC). Minimal urine osmolality induced by water loading was higher (p < 0.05) in HFRS (89.5 +/- 22.1 mosm/kg) and ARF patients (84.8 +/- 14.7 mosm/ kg) than in NC (47.8 +/- 4.6 mosm/kg), but the solute-free water clearance of HFRS patients (9.0 +/- 1.3%), measured at maximal diuresis, was not different from that of ARF patients (6.7 +/- 1.2%) or NC (10.5 +/- 1.4%). After 12-hour water deprivation + vasopressin stimulation, HFRS had lower urine osmolality (433.7 +/- 31.1 versus 850.0 +/- 35.1 mosm/kg; p < 0.05), urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio (1.47 +/- 0.11 versus 2.91 +/- 0.11; p < 0.05), and solute-free water reabsorption (0.53 +/- 0.07 versus 0.91 +/- 0.12%; p < 0.05) than NC. As compared with ARF patients (1.09 +/- 0.16%) or NC (1.49 +/- 0.16%), HFRS patients (0.43 +/- 0.20%) had lower solute-free water reabsorption measured at maximal antidiuresis induced by water deprivation + vasopressin stimulation + hypertonic saline infusion (p < 0.05). In HFRS, the plasma vasopressin level and plasma vasopressin/osmolality ratio increased from 3.9 +/- 0.8 to 6.1 +/- 1.1 pg/ml and from 0.013 +/- 0.003 to 0.020 +/- 0.004 pg/ml/mosm/kg after 12-hour water deprivation, respectively (p < 0.01). However, neither basal nor stimulated values of the plasma vasopressin level or plasma vasopressin/osmolality ratio was different among the 3 groups. HFRS patients were not different from ARF patients or NC in lithium clearance, urinary-acidifying capacity, and fractional excretions of sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. We conclude that in the convalescent phase of HFRS, the urinary-acidifying ability is not disturbed, the urinary-diluting defect is mild, and the urinary-concentrating capacity is obviously impaired. This study suggests that the most important factor contributing to the urinary-concentrating defect in HFRS is the reduced collecting duct responsiveness to vasopressin.","['Kim GH', 'Han JS', 'Earm J', 'Jeon US', 'Kim YS', 'Ahn C', 'Kim S', 'Lee JS']",1998,18,2,Am J Nephrol,"Kim GH, et al.

9556168,Occupational risks of zoonotic infections in Dutch forestry workers and muskrat catchers.,"Lyme borreliosis (LymeB), Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HemoFRS), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LymphoCM), Tick-borne encephalitis (TickBE), Q Fever (QFever), and Weil's leptospirosis (Lepto) are known to be occupational diseases for rural outdoor workers. We investigated the occupational infection risks for these diseases in greater detail. Antibodies to these agents were assessed in 312 forestry workers and muskrat catchers, and in 356 matched office workers. Three levels of occupational exposure were distinguished: high for active forestry workers, low for supervisory forestry staff and muskrat catchers and zero for office workers. At high exposure the prevalence odds ratios (with 95% CI between brackets) were: LymeB 15 (5.5-42), HemoFRS 11 (1.3-501), LymphoCM 5.4 (1.0-50), TickBE 1.0 (0.3-3.0), QFever 1.0 (0.4-2.1), and Lepto 0 (0.0-33). No significant risk of infection was found at low exposure. Part of the present group had also been studied in 1989 and 1990. Within this cohort the conversion rates to Borrelia burgdorferi have been estimated for the periods 1989-1990 and 1990-1993 as 0.23 and 0.066 year(-1), respectively, and the reversion rate as 0.44 year(-1). The corresponding values for HemoFRS were 0.031, 0.018 and 1.42 year(-1). Active forestry workers in the Netherlands are at high risk of infection by LymeB, HemoFRS and LymphoCM.

The largest number of our patients got ill from HFRS from the middle of March till the end of May and during August when the other frequency elevation was noticed. Most frequently the disease has the course that is followed up by phases. Positive finding of antibodies to HFRS virus was noticed in all 116 patients (Hantaan 45%, Belgrade 35%, Puumala 20%). According to clinical symptoms, signs and syndromes that follow up HFRS, the most of our patients were with more severe disease type. The ARF treatment with dialysis was necessary in 45% our patients. The most severe clinical forms were caused by Belgrade strain. Very favorable effect of ""an early dialysis"" to the disease course and outcome was observed. By this approach in HFRS therapy, the patient's mortality was decreased to 0.86%.

Antibodies were measured by immunoassays using as antigen a crude human GBM preparation and the NC1 portion of type IV collagen (Goodpasture antigen), respectively. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had IgM antibodies against the non-Goodpasture glomerular basement membrane (non-GP GBM) in their acute phase serum samples as compared to only 4% seropositivity rate in convalescent phase samples. However, there was no correlation between the non-GP GBM IgM antibody levels and the decrease in GFR as measured by Cr EDTA clearance. None of the patients had antibodies against the Goodpasture antigen. In a control group of 10 patients with influenza and parainfluenza infections serum IgM against non-GP GBM could not be demonstrated, neither in acute phase nor in convalescent phase sera. The possible pathophysiological implications of these findings are discussed.","['Billheden J', 'Boman J', 'Stegmayr B', 'Wieslander J', 'Settergren B']",1997,48,3,Clin Nephrol,"Billheden J, et al.

9298732,Puumala and Dobrava viruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Bosnia-Herzegovina: evidence of highly cross-neutralizing antibody responses in early patient sera.,"Hantavirus infection was diagnosed serologically by mu-capture IgM and IgG ELISAs in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients admitted to Tuzla Hospital, Bosnia-Herzegovina. The results indicated that more than one hantavirus caused the outbreak. To address the question of which hantavirus serotypes were involved, sequentially drawn sera were analyzed by focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) for antibodies against Puumala, Hantaan, Dobrava, and Seoul hantaviruses. The data revealed that acute- or early convalescent-phase sera, even when drawn as late as 3 weeks after the onset of disease, could not be used for typing of the causative hantavirus; a significant number of these samples showed similar reactivity of neutralizing antibodies to several different hantavirus serotypes. Moreover, although several acute-phase sera showed the highest FRNT titer to Hantaan virus, convalescent sera from these patients in all cases showed high specificity for Puumala or Dobrava viruses. This phenomenon, interpreted as a cross-neutralizing primary antibody response, makes several earlier reports concerning causative agents of HFRS questionable. Serological examination of small rodents trapped in the endemic area identified Puumala- and Dobrava-like virus infections. RT-PCR and sequencing of rodent lung samples identified Dobrava virus in one yellow-necked field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Cross-FRNT data, using polyclonal rabbit antibodies, clearly confirmed Dobrava virus as a unique hantavirus serotype. In conclusion, the results revealed that both Puumala- and Dobrava-like viruses caused HFRS in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas no signs of Hantaan or Seoul virus involvement were found.","['Lundkvist A', 'Hukic M', 'Hörling J', 'Gilljam M', 'Nichol S', 'Niklasson B']",1997,53,1,J Med Virol,"Lundkvist A, et al.

9316733,A colorimetric PCR-enzyme immunoassay to identify hantaviruses.,"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses cause two serious human diseases: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. At least nine hantaviruses are known to be pathogenic for humans and numerous others, with unknown disease potential, have been detected in rodents. Assays to quickly identify specific hantaviruses would be useful both for clinical diagnosis and in risk assessment studies.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to develop and test a specific and sensitive PCR-based assay for identification and differentiation of hantaviruses.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed an assay that combined RNA-PCR amplification and colorimetric enzymatic detection to identify representative European, Asian, and north American hantaviruses. RNAs from 18 hantavirus strains of nine species were amplified in the presence of digoxigenin-dUTP by using a single pair of oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed by using rTth DNA polymerase. Digoxigenin-labeled PCR products were hybridized in solution to virus type-specific biotinilated probes, captured onto streptavidin-coated microtiter plates and detected by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies and a chromogenic substrate.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The assay correctly identified each homologous virus type tested. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 15 PFU or at least 50 copies of the viral genome. The assay is simple and strain-specific and is adaptable for automation, making it more practical than other available techniques for accurate and reliable diagnosis and typing of hantaviruses.","['Dekonenko A', 'Ibrahim MS', 'Schmaljohn CS']",1997,8,2,Clin Diagn Virol,"Dekonenko A, et al.

9283226,[Viral haemorrhagic fever].,"Viral haemorrhagic fever denotes various kinds of febrile illness caused by certain viruses which often presents with bleeding tendency and occasionally shock. Out of these, the four maladies, Lassa fever, Ebola haemorrhagic fever, Marburg haemorrhagic fever and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever which are endemically present in Africa or eastern Europe, are known to be such diseases with high man-to-man communicability. These four haemorrhagic fevers are, therefore, designated as special conditions requiring isolation during the period when the infected patients are shedding the viruses, not only in Japan but also in many other countries. We have so far only one such case of Lassa fever who returned to Japan from Sierra Leone in 1987. Some haemorrhagic fevers including dengue (haemorrhagic) fever and hantavirus infections (e.g. haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) are not known to be man-to-man transmissible and requiring no isolation. We have a number of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fevers here in Japan today among imported febrile cases from tropical or subtropical countries.

9278220,High prevalence of hantavirus infection in a group of Chinese patients with acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology.,"In southwestern China, small but substantial numbers of patients with acute hepatitis were found without known hepatropic viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C, D or E, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) and were receiving no hepatotoxic drugs. Prevalence of antibodies, both neutralizing and specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG, to Hantaan virus were evaluated in a cohort of 136 such patients: 83 were of unknown aetiology, 53 had known viral hepatitis and 59 healthy subjects acted as controls. The results showed that the incidence of neutralizing antibody to Hantaan virus in acute hepatitis patients with non-hepatitis A-E virus infections (13 of 83) was significantly higher than in those with A-E infections (0 of 53, P<0.01). Furthermore, the incidence of specific IgM antibody to Hantaan virus in acute hepatitis patients with non-hepatitis A-E virus infections (6 of 83) was significantly higher than in those with A-E infections (0 of 53, P<0.05) and in healthy subjects (0 of 59, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that Hantaan virus may be an important agent, contributing, at least in southwestern China, to a significant number of the cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology. This hantavirus infection resulted in an acute hepatitis, differing from the typical diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).","['Meng G', 'Lan Y', 'Nakagawa M', 'Maehara T', 'Mitani K', 'Tomiyama T', 'Che XG', 'Ohkubo A']",1997,4,4,J Viral Hepat,"Meng G, et al.

It was first described in 1983 in the United Kingdom in 10 infants. Subsequently, > 140 cases have been reported worldwide, although no cases have been previously reported in the forensic literature. Typically the child presents with fever, shock, encephalopathy with coma and seizures, evidence of hemorrhage, and diarrhea. Laboratory investigation reveals falling hemoglobin and platelet counts, renal impairment, evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, metabolic acidosis, and raised serum transaminases. Microbiological cultures are uniformly negative. The condition has a high mortality and morbidity. The etiology is unknown and may be multifactorial. However, hyperpyrexia appears to play a central role in pathogenesis. The diagnosis of HSES in the deceased child is one of exclusion and requires a careful antemortem history as well as a thorough autopsy with toxicological and microbiological investigations. A case of HSES is reported and the literature reviewed.","['Little D', 'Wilkins B']",1997,18,1,Am J Forensic Med Pathol,Little D and Wilkins B. Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome.

The SNV antigens included a full-length recombinant-expressed nucleocapsid (N) protein (rN), a recombinant-expressed G1 protein (residues 35 to 117), and synthetic peptides derived from N (residues 17 to 59) and G1 (residues 55 to 88). On the basis of the observed reactivities of hantavirus-infected patient and control sera, we determined that a positive assay requires reactivity with SNV or SEOV rN antigen and at least one other antigen. Isolated reactivity to either viral rN antigen is indeterminate, and any pattern of reactivity that does not include reactivity to an rN antigen is considered indeterminate but is unlikely to represent hantavirus infection. Fifty-eight of 59 samples from patients with acute SNV-associated HPS were positive according to these criteria, and one was initially indeterminate. Four of four samples from patients with HPS due to other hantaviruses were positive, as were most samples from patients with SEOV and Puumala virus infections. Of 192 control serum samples, 2 (1%) were positive and 2 were indeterminate. Acute SNV infection was distinguishable from remote SNV infection or infection with hantaviruses other than SNV by the presence of G1 peptide antigen reactivities in the former. The strip immunoblot assay shows promise for the detection of SNV antibodies early in the course of HPS.","['Hjelle B', 'Jenison S', 'Torrez-Martinez N', 'Herring B', 'Quan S', 'Polito A', 'Pichuantes S', 'Yamada T', 'Morris C', 'Elgh F', 'Lee HW', 'Artsob H', 'Dinello R']",1997,35,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Hjelle B, et al.

9812566,[The therapeutic effect of purified human leucocytic interferon-alpha on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"In order to know the therapeutic effect of purified human leucocytic interferon-alpha on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome diagnosed early (< or = 5 days). We treated 23 cases with clinical prognosis and antiviral effect significantly better than those of 21 cases in a random control group. The membrane protein (MP), nucleo protein (NP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and urine, the serum antibodies to MP and NP were determined before treatment and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 days after the beginning of the treatment. The results showed that in the treatment group, the expressin of MP and NP in PBMC were significantly depressed. The rate of negative turning of MP and NP in PBMC was 65.22% (15/23) and 69.57% (16/23) in 10 days, while in the control group, it was 19.05% (4/21) and 14.29% (3/21). The rate of negative turning of MP and NP in urine were 78.57% (11/14) and 90.91% (10/11) and that in the control group was 30.00% (3/10) and 16.66% (1/6). There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). The results indicated that IFN-alpha could attenuate the lesions caused directly by virus, improve patients condition and raise the cure rate through depressing the expression of the virus.","['Bai J', 'Zhu K', 'Zhou G']",1997,36,2,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Bai J, et al.

9208453,A major antigenic domain of hantaviruses is located on the aminoproximal site of the viral nucleocapsid protein.,"Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein has recently been shown to be an immunodominant antigen in hemorrhagic with renal syndrome (HFRS) inducing an early and long-lasting immune response. Recombinant proteins representing various regions of the nucleocapsid proteins as well as segments of the G1 and the G2 glycoproteins of hantavirus strains CG18-20 (Puumala serotype) and Hantaan 76-118 have been expressed in E. coli. The antigenicity of these proteins was tested in enzyme immunoassays and immunoblots. These studies revealed that human IgG immune response is primarily directed against epitopes located within the amino acid residues 1 to 119 of the amino terminus of viral nucleocapsid proteins. This fragment was recognized by all HFRS patient sera tested (n = 128). The corresponding enzyme immunoassays proved to be more sensitive than the indirect immunofluorescence assays. Furthermore, the majority of bank vole monoclonal antibodies raised against Puumala virus reacted specifically with this site. A recombinant G1 protein (aa 59 to 401) derived from the CG 18-20 strain was recognized by 19 out of 20 sera from HFRS patients.","['Gött P', 'Zöller L', 'Darai G', 'Bautz EK']",1997,14,1,Virus Genes,"Gött P, et al.

The HFRS morbidity rate and the antibody prevalence rate in man were viewed as a function and an argument of the function, respectively. An empiric model for one of the active HFRS endemic area (Saratov Province), characterizing the correlation between the immunity and morbidity rates has been elaborated. It calculates the theoretical morbidity level that corresponds to determine an immune portion of the population in each administrative area. The theoretical (counted) values were compared to the annually registered morbidity rates; their similarity has been estimated. Estimation of the adequacy of HFRS diagnosis in the examined region could have been admitted as satisfactory. However, various faults in the clinical identification of HFRS cases were found to occur in 14 of 44 districts of this region. Hyperdiagnosis was made in the most active HFRS natural foci (broad-leaved forests), but in the endemic areas being characterizes by moderate or low activity (forest-steppe and steppe districts). The results of the authors' calculations were shown to be generally in agreement with the data from the Regional Epidemiological Service reports which confirmed the adequacy of the proposed material.","['Malkin AE', 'Fedorova ZP', 'Korotkov VB', 'Tkachenko EA']",1997,,1,Med Parazitol (Mosk),"Malkin AE, et al.

9159038,Serum and urine soluble HLA class I antigen concentrations are increased in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"OBJECTIVES: In order to evaluate the association between the Hantaan virus-induced cellular-immune response and clinical severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: We serially measured the serum (n = 16) and urine (n = 6) concentrations of soluble HLA class 1 antigen (sHLA-l) and clinical powameters in patients with HFRS.
RESULTS: Serum sHLA-I concentrations in patients with HFRS were significantly higher than those in controls throughout all clinical phases (p < 0.01). The highly elevated Serum sHLA-I concentrations peaked in the oliguric phase and declined gradually through the phases of HFRS. Serum sHLA-l concentrations in patients with hypotensive episode were higher than in those without the episode (5,85 +/-2,184 vs. 2,389 +/- 860 ng/ml in oliguric phase, 4.11 +/- 1,952 vs. 1,502 +/- 592 ng/ml in diuretic phase, p < 0.05), and serum sHLA-l levels showed a significant correlation with blood WBC count (r = 0.75 in the febrile and hypotensive phase, p < 0.01) and serum creatinine concentrations (r = 0.64 in the oliguric phase, p < 0.01), respectively, Urine sHLA-I levels in the oliguric phase were significantly higher than those in the diuretic phase (390 +/- 155 vs. 214 +/- 45 ng/mg Cr, p < 0.05) and urine sHLA-I levels are associated with severe illness in patients with HFRS. The higher serum sHLA-I are associated with severe illness in patients with HFRS. The persistent elevation of serum sHLA-I during all phases of HFRS might be related to increased production due to prolonged cellular immunologic stimulation by the Hantaan virus rather than decreased excretion of sHLA-I through the kidney.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that the serum and urine sHLA-I concentrations can be used as a stable and objective parameter for monitoring clinical severity and renal dysfunction in patients with HFRS.","['Park CW', 'Yun SN', 'Yang CW', 'Kim TG', 'Han H', 'Choi EJ', 'Chang YS', 'Bang BK']",1997,12,1,Korean J Intern Med,"Park CW, et al.

9044447,Pathogenetic and clinical aspects of the renal involvement in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is the most common clinical manifestation of hantavirus infection. The main target organ is the kidney, resulting in an interstitial hemorrhagic nephritis and sometimes acute tubular necrosis. The pathogenesis is still largely unknown, but several recent studies indicate an important role for immune mechanisms including increased expression of cytokines, for example, tumor necrosis factor. Immunohistochemical studies of kidney biopsies have revealed deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3, but deposits were significantly less numerous than in chronic immune complex disease. Since hantaviruses are not cytolytic, a direct detrimental effect of the infecting virus is less likely. The long-term prognosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome seems to be favorable, but there are reports that previous hantavirus infection is associated with an increased risk of hypertensive renal disease. Prospective longitudinal studies addressing this issue are underway.","['Settergren B', 'Ahlm C', 'Alexeyev O', 'Billheden J', 'Stegmayr B']",1997,19,1,Ren Fail,"Settergren B, et al.

9017055,Ocular characteristics in nephropathia epidemica or Puumala virus infection.,"PURPOSE: We documented the largest series so far concerning the ocular characteristics of nephropathia epidemica.
METHODS: A total of 37 consecutive nephropathia epidemica patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination during hospitalization for systemic infection, and a control examination after recovery.
RESULTS: The most common ocular symptoms were: frontal headache or periocular pain (75.6%), blurred vision (54.1%) and photophobia (10.8%). The best corrected visual acuity of 7 patients (18.9%) was reduced during the acute phase as compared to the later control examination. Myopic shift was found in 15 patients (40.5%), three of whom (8.1%) developed real transient myopia. There were no attacks of angle closure glaucoma in this series. On the contrary, the intraocular pressure was decreased in 49 eyes (66.2%) during the acute stage of the disease. Lid edema was present in 28 eyes (37.8%), conjunctival injection in 20 eyes (27.0%), chemosis in 8 eyes (10.8%) and subconjuctival bleeding in 3 eyes (4.1%). Signs of acute anterior uveitis were found in 10 eyes (13.5%), however, this resolved without treatment. In one eye retinal edema with hemorrhages was detected. Ultrasonography revealed narrowing of the anterior chamber during the acute phase in 69 eyes (93.2%) and thickening of the crystalline lens in 64 eyes (86.5%).
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic findings in nephropathia epidemica are not uncommon.

8982552,Pulmonary involvement in nephropathia epidemica: radiological findings and their clinical correlations.,"Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) normally taking a benign clinical course. The etiologic agent, Puumala hantavirus is genetically closely related to Sin Nombre virus, which causes a frequently lethal febrile syndrome with pulmonary involvement (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HPS). HPS is characterized by acute respiratory distress, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and severe and hypotension, but usually no significant renal involvement. Pulmonary involvement and respiratory symptoms also occur in NE. To understand the mechanisms of pulmonary involvement in NE, we studied the clinical records and chest X-rays of 125 hospital-treated acutely ill NE patients. Twenty-eight percent of the patients had disease-related changes in their chest radiographs. Pleural effusion and atelectasis were the most common X-ray findings, whereas frank pulmonary edema was rare. The patients with pathologic X-ray findings had a more marked hypoproteinemia (lowest measured serum protein concentration 54 +/- 1 g/l) than those with normal X-ray (62.1 +/- 0.9 g/l, p < 0.001) and leukocytosis (highest measured blood leukocyte count 14.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(9)/l vs. 10.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(9)/l, p < 0.001) and more severe renal insufficiency (highest measured serum creatinine 590 +/- 60 mumol/l vs. 356 +/- 29 mumol/l, p < 0.05). Hypoproteinemia best predicted the occurrence of abnormal chest X-ray findings in NE. This suggests, that capillary leakage and inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of NE lung involvement, similarly as in HPS. Differently from HPS, the fluid volume overload associated with renal insufficiency seemed to contribute strongly to the chest X-ray changes in NE.","['Kanerva M', 'Paakkala A', 'Mustonen J', 'Paakkala T', 'Lahtela J', 'Pasternack A']",1996,46,6,Clin Nephrol,"Kanerva M, et al.

8950687,Seroepidemiology of Hantaan virus infection in Taiwan.,"In order to investigate the infection rate of Hantaan virus in Taiwan, a total of 6,536 human serum samples were collected from residents, selected by stratified random sampling, from 19 townships covering four different ethnic groups: Aborigines, Fukien Taiwanese, Hakka Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese. Serum samples were screened for Hantaan virus antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. The prototype Hantaan virus (76/118)-infected Vero E6 cells were used as the viral antigen for the antibody detection. Among 6,536 human serum samples, 403 (6.2%) samples had Hantaan virus antibodies. The seropositive rates for males and females were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively. A higher seropositive rate was found among Aborigines on the Orchid Islets (11.5%) and Fukien Taiwanese on the Penghu Islets (11.6%), while the lowest rate was observed among Hakka Taiwanese in the south of Taiwan (2.5%). In comparing with different ethnic groups, the highest prevalence was found among Fukien Taiwanese (8.1%) and the lowest among Mainland Chinese (4.9%). Among the different geographical areas, the highest positive rate was found in western Taiwan (7.1%) and the lowest in southern Taiwan (5.4%). Hantaan virus antibodies were also detected in 22 of 548 (4.0%) rat serum samples. The highest seropositive rate was found in rat sera collected from the Orchid Islets (21.4%). None of the rat sera collected from Hsinchu, Miaoli, Changhua, Nantu, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Penghu Counties were positive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four criteria were used to ascertain this mite as transmitting vector of disease: (1) epidemiological evidence; (2) natural infection of pathogen; (3) ability to transmit pathogen via biting; (4) ability to transfer pathogen via transovarian route.
RESULTS: The results indicated that L. scutellare was the dominant species of chigger mite on rats. Its seasonal distribution was correlated with the incidence of these two diseases. This mite could be naturally infected by HFRS virus (HFRSV) and Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) and the mite could transmit HFRSV and Rt to vertebrates by biting and to its offspring via transovarian transmission.

From day 3 of onset of disease the concentrations increased, peak levels being reached on days 5 to 7. Maximal plasma concentrations of nitrate plus nitrite were correlated to the degree of hypotension (r = -0.64, p = 0.02) and levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (r = 0.51, p = 0.05) and soluble TNF receptors p55 and p75 (r = 0.58, p = 0.03 and r = 0.54, p = 0.04, respectively) but not to levels of interferon-gamma or interleukin-10 (p > 0.05). The results are compatible with the well-known capacity of TNF-alpha to enhance production of nitric oxide, and suggest that nitric oxide may be of physiologic importance in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.","['Linderholm M', 'Groeneveld PH', 'Tärnvik A']",1996,24,5,Infection,"Linderholm M, et al.

Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA), reversed passive hemagglutination inhibition (RPHI), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and neutralization antibody (NA) assays were used to measure the antibody titers of the vaccinated people before and after three doses of vaccine. The results indicated that IFA and RPHI antibody titers were boosted significantly (P < 0.05) after the vaccination. Either Hantaan or Seoul virus could induce two-way cross-reactive neutralization antibody responses in humans. After HTNV vaccine immunization, the NA titers of people with natural infection increased significantly (P < 0.05) to both Hantaan and Seoul viruses, while the relative dominance between these two type responses was still similar to that of natural infection.

The patient also developed anterior hypopituitarism as a complication of HFRS. The patient's oliguric phase was very much prolonged for over 10 days before the diuresis began. The urine output during the oliguric phase was near anuric (< 50 ml/day). Interestingly, the patient began to diurese just after the institution of glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide went up to a smaller peak (150.0 pg/ml) at the onset of diuresis compared with 15 other patients (292.4 +/- 190.4 pg/ml) who did not develop anterior hypopituitarism.

Meanwhile we also determined plasma endothelin (ET), substance P (SP) and some sensitive markers of renal function with radioimmunoassay. The result showed that in HFRS patients, from the day of admission up to the thirteenth day of illness, the antigens of HFRS virus membrane protein (MP) and nucleocapsid (NP) could simultaneously be found in PBMC, though their expressive degree gradually decreased when the condition of the patients became better. Based on the external appearance and nucleus pattern of PBMC we recognized the MP and NP positive cells were mainly monocytes among which only a few presented faint IgM and C3 stain. On admission there was difference in expressive intensity between MP and NP. The MP expressive intensity was in parallel with plasma ET/SP ratio, the general condition and the severity of renal damage. These data suggest that HFRS virus can invade PBMC, replicate in them, and express their structural proteins. MP may be related with the pathogenesis of HFRS virus and the increase of plasma ET/SP ratio may be an important factor aggravating kidney injury.","['Sun Z', 'Huang X', 'Wang M']",1996,35,7,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Sun Z, et al.

We aimed to locate domains important in humoral immune reactivity and to use this information to develop a specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serological diagnosis of NE. Escherichia coli poly-histidine fusion protein expression vectors containing over-lapping gene segments encoding the PUU virus N (PUU rN) were constructed. The resulting gene products were examined by immunoblots and ELISA with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The dominating antigenic region of PUU rN was located between amino acids (aa) 7 and 94. A recombinant fusion protein containing aa 7-137 of PUU virus N (PUU rN delta 5) was used for the detection of specific IgG and IgM responses in NE. ELISA based on PUU rN delta 5 was found to have equal sensitivity and specificity as compared to the full length recombinant PUU rN by ELISA, for both acute serological diagnosis of NE and for seroepidemiological screening purposes.

Adequacy of the offered system in confirmed by five-fold increase of the correlation between HFRS epizootiological parameters and antibody prevalence rate in humans. The steady maximum of all parameters was registered in the province situated in broad-leafed oak-line forests. Minimal values are found to correspond to one located in forest-steppe (with birch and asp forests) which poor fodder potential for rodents is well known. Other provinces between these ones are characterized by consecutive decrease of all index values according to the landscape type. According to estimated natural activity rate all the provinces are divided to three groups. The first one (antibody prevalence rate is above 5%) unites the high activity HFRS natural foci. Their common geographical location is on the territories with highest rodent population rates.

Regions I [amino acids (aa) 1-103], II (aa 104-204) and III (aa 205-402) were mapped on NP by examining the reactivity of truncated gene products. Those that corresponded to region I reacted with immune mouse serum, indicating that the region contained major linear epitopes as reported with Four corners virus (FCV) and Puumala virus (PUU) NP. At least one MAb to each region inhibited viral growth when they were introduced into cells by scrape-loading. In addition, they conferred protection from a lethal HTN challenge to newborn mice. A PEPSCAN assay localized the epitope of MAb E5/G6 between aa 166-175. Since E5/G6, which had the highest inhibitory effect both in cells and in mice, showed no virus neutralization activity by ordinary neutralization test, this region is suggested to be important for the virus growth after entry into the cells.","['Yoshimatsu K', 'Arikawa J', 'Tamura M', 'Yoshida R', 'Lundkvist A', 'Niklasson B', 'Kariwa H', 'Azuma I']",1996,77 ( Pt 4),,J Gen Virol,"Yoshimatsu K, et al.

The assay was based on binding human serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the solid phase by use of goat anti-IgM antibodies. The captured IgM antibodies were present in the acute phase serum from two patients: one infected in Sweden and the other in Bosnia. Antigens being bound to the solid phase by the human anti-PUU and anti-DOB/HTN IgM antibodies were detected by a broadly reacting polyclonal rabbit anti PUU-recombinant nucleocapsid protein antiserum. The IgM isotype was proven to be at least five times more efficient than IgG when used as the capturing antibody. The sensitivity of the PUU antigen ELISA was approximately 0.5 ng/ml, as measured by titration with a PUU recombinant nucleoprotein antigen. Cell-associated PUU antigen in tissue culture was seen after 48 hr by the PUU-ELISA and after 96 hr by immunofluorescent assay. When tested for capacity to discriminate between PUU, DOB, and HTN viruses, significant differences were found: the Swedish serum detected PUU antigen at high titers, whereas no reactivity was found against DOB and HTN; the Bosnian serum detected both DOB and HTN at high titers but had a low reactivity to PUU. The method was also tested for its usefulness in detecting PUU antigen in bank vole (clethrionomys glareolus) lungs. Of 59 animals captured from the surroundings of patients with nephropathia epidemica, three became positive with a high activity in the PUU-ELISA, but with low reactivity in the DOB/HTN-ELISA. It is concluded that a sensitive ELISA has been developed to detect different hantaviruses in cell culture and lungs of bank voles.","['Alexeyev OA', 'Elgh F', 'Ahlm C', 'Stigbrand T', 'Settergren B', 'Wadell G', 'Juto P']",1996,54,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Alexeyev OA, et al.

The classic hantaviral illnesses hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and nephropathia epidemica are indistinguishable from the hantaviral pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in early symptoms and laboratory data, but HPS goes on to produce the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and usually spares the kidney. HPS is the first hantaviral disease reported in humans in the Western Hemisphere and has a tenfold higher mortality than its Eurasian counterparts. The predominant serogroup causing the Four Corners epidemic of the summer of 1993 is the Sin Nombre virus, previously called the Muerto Canyon virus. It is a unique virus but shares some genetic similarity to the nonpathogenic Prospect Hill serogroup, which has been found in North American rodents for decades.

8599211,Bacterial expression of neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody Fab fragments to Hantaan virus.,"We amplified by polymerase chain reaction the heavy and light chain antibody genes of two mouse hybridomas secreting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the G1 or G2 envelope proteins of Hantaan virus, cloned them into the phagemid vector pComb3, and expressed them in bacteria to yield Fab fragments. Expressed Fab fragments had the same antigenic specificities for Hantaan and Seoul viruses as the complete parent MAbs and were able to neutralize Hantaan virus in plaque-reduction neutralization assays. The authentic MAb to G2 (HCO2) could passively protect hamsters from challenge with Hantaan virus when neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:10 were detected in the animals' sera just prior to challenge. In contrast, although 1:10 neutralization titers were also detected in hamsters receiving passively transferred, Escherichia coli-expressed HCO2 Fab, these animals were not protected from infection with Hantaan virus. Similarly, passive transfer of the HCO2 Mab on Days 1 through 4 after infection prevented antigen deposition in hamster lungs and kidneys but passive transfer of the recombinant HCO2 Fab did not. The results suggest that although neutralization by IgG antibodies correlates with protection in hamsters, the same may not be true for neutralizing Fab fragments.","['Liang M', 'Chu YK', 'Schmaljohn C']",1996,217,1,Virology,"Liang M, et al.

Many soldiers involved in the deblocade developed a clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic fever indicating a possible epidemic.
METHODS: Suspected patients were treated in the war hospital Igman-Fojnica. Blood samples of all the patients were processed on IgM and IgG antibodies with ELISA test, using ""the double sandwich"" technique.
RESULTS: IgM and IgG were performed on Puumala (PVV), Hantaan (HTN) and Dobrava antigens. 38 out of 45 treated serums had high antibody titres. Sera of 28 patients had high titres of specific IgM antibodies on Hantaan antigen (12,800). A ten patients had a same titre level for specific antibodies of Puumala antigen. A 20 patients had specific IgG antibodies on Dobrava antigen with the titre 400. Our results confirmed the epidemic for which were responsible two serotypes of HFRS-PVV and HTN.

Sera of nephropathia epidemica patients react specifically with PUU nucleocapsid (N) protein. In order to safely provide large quantities of antigen for diagnostic purposes, PUU Sotkamo strain N protein was expressed by using the baculovirus system in Sf9 insect cells to up to 30 to 50% of the total cellular protein. The recombinant N protein (bac-PUU-N) was solubilized with 6 M urea, dialyzed, and purified by anion-exchange liquid chromatography. In an immunoglobulin M mu-capture assay purified and unpurified bac-PUU-N antigen showed identical results compared with the results of a similar assay based on native PUU antigen grown in Vero E6 cells. An immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody-capture assay based on unpurified bac-PUU-N also showed results identical to those of an assay with native PUU-N antigen. Moreover, a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with eight different epitopes showed identical reactivity patterns with both natural and bac-PUU-N antigen, while two epitopes in PUU-N expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli were not recognized. Puumala hantavirus N protein expressed by the baculovirus system offers a safe and inexpensive source of specific antigen for large-scale diagnostic and seroepidemiological purposes.","['Vapalahti O', 'Lundkvist A', 'Kallio-Kokko H', 'Paukku K', 'Julkunen I', 'Lankinen H', 'Vaheri A']",1996,34,1,J Clin Microbiol,"Vapalahti O, et al.

In this study, we retrospectively investigated hantavirus infections among Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) cases notified between 1987 and 1994, without virological confirmation. IgG and IgM antibodies to hantavirus were tested by ELISA. Among 1028 patients included in the study, we found 13 recent infections (1.26%) and 13 remote infections (1.26%). IgG antibodies determined in 745 healthy persons living in the same localities of recent infection cases, gave only one positive result (0.13%). Nine of the 13 recent infections had the clinical presentation of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) while the other four were in the form of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). We performed a clinical and epidemiological comparison between the nine patients with FHSR and two paired control groups: one with confirmed AHF and the other with Febrile Syndrome of Undetermined Etiology (FSUE), which were negative for hantavirus, Junin and LCM. There were no differences between clinical signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, normal or high leucocyte counts, with thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, high creatinine levels and proteinuria in HFRS cases resulted useful for differential diagnosis. These results showed the coexistence of Junin virus and hantaviruses in the endemic area of AHF, and indicate the importance of including the infection with these viruses in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fevers and respiratory distress syndromes of unknown etiology.

A prospective study of 37 patients with acute systemic Puumala virus infection.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathia epidemica is a zoonose in the group of hemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome and is caused by Puumala virus in Hantavirus genus. The purpose of this study is to find out how the intraocular pressure (IOP) is affected by the acute phase of this disease and how it relates to the previous case reports on angleclosure glaucoma attacks.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospective study documents IOP and anterior chamber depth measurements in 37 patients during the winter epidemic of nephropathia epidemica from 1992 to 1993. Ocular examinations were performed during the acute systemic infection and after clinical recovery.
RESULTS: The IOP was lower and the anterior chamber shallower in the acute phase than after the clinical recovery of nephropathic epidemica. The mean differences in IOP were 1.8 mmHg in the right eye and 1.9 mmHg in the left (P < 0.001) and the mean differences in the anterior chamber depth were 0.22 mm in the right eye and 0.20 mm in the left (P < 0.001). No acute angle-closure attacks with highly elevated IOP were encountered in this study. The mean IOP did not rise higher than 14.3 mmHg in both eyes after the clinical recovery of systemic infection.
CONCLUSION: In contradistinction to earlier assumptions, Puumala virus infection decreases the IOP. Shallowing of anterior chamber and narrowing of the anterior chamber angle in the acute phase of nephropathia epidemica did not lead to angle-closure attacks in this series.","['Kontkanen MI', 'Puustjärvi TJ', 'Lähdevirta JK']",1995,102,12,Ophthalmology,"Kontkanen MI, et al.

Newborn mice were inoculated with 4 LD50/mouse of Hantaan virus strain 76-118 (HTN) one day after birth. Mice given 100 micrograms/mouse of MDP-Lys(L18) before infection exhibited significantly higher survival rates than those of non-treated mice. The effect of MDP-Lys(L18) was also restorative when given to the mice 4 or 7 days after infection. The titers of virus isolated from the lungs and spleens 12 days after infection, were about 30-times lower in MDP-Lys(L18)-treated (lung: 1.0 x 10(3) FFU; spleen: 6.8 x 10(1) FFU/mouse), than those of non-treated mice (lung: 3.4 x 10(4) FFU; spleen: 1.9 x 10(3) FFU/mouse). Furthermore, the virus was undetectable in the brains of MDP-Lys(L18)-treated mice, whereas viruses were isolated from 3 of 6 non-treated mice. MDP-Lys(L18) augmented the number of peripheral leukocytes and splenocytes, as well as mitogenic responses of the cells from bone marrow and spleen of newborn mice. These results suggest that MDP-Lys(L18) enhanced the resistance of newborn mice against HTN virus in a systemic infection model, and that this mechanism is involved in the enhancement of hematopoiesis and responsiveness of immune-related cells to mitogens.","['Yoo YC', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Hatsuse R', 'Tamura M', 'Yoshida R', 'Tono-oka S', 'Arikawa J', 'Azuma I']",1995,13,14,Vaccine,"Yoo YC, et al.

S. Schmaljohn, S. E. Hasty, and J. M. Dalrymple, Vaccine 10:10-13, 1992) to elicit a protective immune response against other hantaviruses, we vaccinated hamsters with the recombinant vaccine and challenged them with HTN, Seoul (SEO), or Puumala (PUU) virus. Neutralizing antibodies to HTN virus were found in all vaccinated hamsters both before and after challenge. Neutralizing antibody titers to SEO virus were present at low levels or were undetectable after two immunizations with the vaccine but were positive in all vaccinated hamsters after challenge with SEO virus and were also positive in control animals that were not challenged. Neutralizing antibodies to PUU virus were observed only in hamsters previously challenged with PUU virus. To assay for virus in the blood and tissues of the hamsters, we developed a nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR with cross-reactive outer primers and serotype-specific inner primers. The RT-PCR specifically detected as little as 1 PFU of virus in serum containing high-titer neutralizing antibodies and was more sensitive than immunofluorescent antibody staining for detecting virus in lung and kidney specimens of infected hamsters. By using the RT-PCR, we found that vaccinated hamsters, challenged with HTN or SEO virus, neither were viremic nor had evidence of virus in their lungs or kidneys. In contrast, vaccinated hamsters challenged with PUU virus were viremic and had PUU virus-specific nucleic acid in their organs.","['Chu YK', 'Jennings GB', 'Schmaljohn CS']",1995,69,10,J Virol,"Chu YK, et al.

7632694,Structural and functional analysis of the human KB cell folate receptor gene P4 promoter: cooperation of three clustered Sp1-binding sites with initiator region for basal promoter activity.,"The human folate receptors (hFRs) are important in the cellular accumulation of folates and antifolates. We described the structure of the human KB cell FR (hFR-KB) gene and identified two discrete promoter regions (P1 and P4) upstream from exons 1 and 4, respectively (Elwood et al., 1993). To further understand the molecular basis of hFR expression, we have now analyzed the basal transcription of the P4 promoter localized upstream of a major transcription start site. The sequence upstream from exon 4 contains several potential transcriptional factor-binding sites and a consensus initiator region sequence at the transcription start site but does not contain canonical TATA or CAAT boxes. While deletion of a 5' flanking sequence from nt -1023 to nt -605 of P4 promoter region decreases the luciferase reporter gene expression in KB cells to 54-70% of control construct, the removal of the sequence between nt -292 and nt -46 markedly decreases the activity to 3%. DNase I footprints and competitive mobility shift and supershift mobility assays indicate that Sp1 or Sp1-related nuclear protein(s) bind to three clustered GC-rich regions within the sequence between nt -292 and nt -46 of the hFR-KB P4 promoter. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses of the expression of promoter constructs containing site-specific mutation(s) of these three Sp1-binding sites and initiator sequence demonstrate that each of three Sp1 sites and the initiator sequence are required for optimum promoter activity and that they interact cooperatively in this P4 promoter of the hFR-KB gene.","['Saikawa Y', 'Price K', 'Hance KW', 'Chen TY', 'Elwood PC']",1995,34,31,Biochemistry,"Saikawa Y, et al.

Eight patients were male and 2 were female, aged 37.5 +/- 4.8 years. The diagnosis of Hantaan virus infection was proven by an indirect immunofluorescent and ELISA test with a significant increase of the titer after a week to ranges from 1:512 to 1:2,048. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed in 3 cases using standard procedures for optical and immunofluorescent microscopy. Fever, weakness, headache, conjunctival injection, hematuria, and lumbar pain were clinical features all patients had in common. Complete anuria was noted in 7 out of 10 and oliguria in the other 3 of the 10 cases with serum levels of creatinine 967 +/- 152.6 mumol/L. Other following laboratory findings were leukocytosis in 10 out of 10 patients, with neutrophylia, and reduction of serum sodium and potassium in 8 out of 10, and a decrease in serum complement C3 in 3 out of 10 patients. Percutaneous renal biopsy confirmed interstitionephritis in 2 out of 3 biopsied patients and acute diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis in the third. Interstitial mononuclear infiltration with dominant T cells proven with monoclonal antisera (direct immunoperoxidase method) was present in all 3 cases. The outcome of the disease was good in 8 of the 10 patients with a development of polyuric phase and complete recovery of renal function later. One patient with interstitial lesions on biopsy developed chronic renal failure, and the other with a concomitant brucellosis died during the polyuric phase of the disease.","['Polenaković M', 'Grcevska L', 'Gerasimovska-Tanevska V', 'Oncevski A', 'Dzikova S', 'Cakalaroski K', 'Masin G']",1995,19,8,Artif Organs,"Polenaković M, et al.

7583920,Development of monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein.,"Forty-five hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, were generated by fusion of P3-X63-Ag8.V653 myeloma cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine. Among these, 38 antibodies were identified as binding to the 48-kDa nucleocapsid protein by immunoblot assay or radioimmunoprecipitation. Twenty-six of them were of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), nine were of the IgG2a, and three were of the IgA isotype. According to cross-reactivities with other serotypes of the genus Hantavirus, the antibodies were classified into three groups: 6 antibodies specific to the Hantaan serotype (group I), 20 antibodies cross-reacting with Hantaan and Seoul serotypes (SR-11, Tchoupitoulas, and R22) (group II), and 12 antibodies cross-reacting with Hantaan, Seoul, and Prospect Hill serotypes (group III). None of the antibodies cross-reacted with the Puumala serotype. With a panel of antibodies of different cross-reactivities, serotypes of Hantavirus could be differentiated. Thirty-eight monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein which have different cross-reactivities between serotypes were developed. These results confirmed the presence of multiple serotype-specific epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein of Hantaan virus, which can be utilized in differentiation of serotypes.","['Ha IS', 'Choi Y', 'Park YS', 'Cheong HI', 'Koo JW', 'Kim IS', 'Kim EC', 'Kim S', 'Lee JS']",1995,2,4,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,"Ha IS, et al.

Blood samples were collected and plasma ET level was measured with radioimmunoassay and its dynamic change noted. It is shown that plasma ET level of the EHF patients was higher in febrile, hypotensive or shock, oliguric and transitional stages than that of controls. However, the level returned to normal in polyuric stage. Plasma ET level was also highly positively correlated with that of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and beta 2 microglobulin. The higher the level of plasma ET, the poorer the ontcome. It is suggested that ET plays an important role in the epidemiology of EHF and monitoring of plasma ET level will be of help not only in predicting the prognosis, but also in guiding the clinical therapy.","['Yang B', 'Ma Y', 'Liu C']",1995,34,6,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Yang B, et al.

These pathogens are maintained in nature as not clinically apparent, persistent infections in roden reservoirs, varying with each virus, and are shed via rodent feces, urine, and salivary excretions. Human exposure to hantaviruses principally occurs through the respiratory tract route and is focal and discontinuous, paralleling the distribution of virus in reservoir species and the likelihood of human-rodent interactions. Prior to 1993, hantaviruses were established etiologic agents of human febrile nephropathies and hematologic abnormalities on several continents, exclusive of North America. An episode of severe respiratory tract illness developed in association with a group of novel hantaviruses in the United States during 1993-1994, resulting in at least 98 confirmed cases of disease from 21 states and 51 deaths.

Quinine was used as curative treatment of malaria before admission in a significant greater proportion (p < 0.01) of patients with BWF compared to patients with uncomplicated malaria, suggesting that this drug might have played a triggering role in the genesis of BWF. However, quinine was usually administered at inadequate doses to malaria patients non responding to chloroquine and belonging to a population of whom 50% are non immune. It may thus also be hypothesized that BWF in our patients could result from a hyperparasitemic state that remained undetected because of an unusual synchronous lysis of infected erythrocytes. In the latter case BWF would correspond to a major complication of falciparum malaria only coincidentally related to the use of quinine.","['Delacollette C', 'Taelman H', 'Wery M']",1995,75,1,Ann Soc Belg Med Trop,"Delacollette C, et al.

The injury mechanism is that the immuno complexes (IgG) are deposited in testis tissues from HFRS autopsies.","['Wang Z', 'Xing S', 'Li P']",1995,75,3,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Wang Z, et al.

Several combinations of bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) monoclonal antibodies with various N-epitope specificities were used for the development of two double-antibody sandwich forms of ELISA; PUU virus AG-ELISA for an exclusive detection of Puumala-related viruses, and Hantavirus AG-ELISA for a more extensive detection of all serotypes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) viruses. The biotin-streptavidin system, in combination with horseradish peroxidase, rendered the assays' sensitivities similar to or even higher than immunoblotting. Calculated detection limits for the PUU virus and the Hantavirus AG-ELISAs were 405 and 50 focus forming units or 80 and 10 infected Vero E6 cells, respectively. The assays were evaluated and found to be suitable for convenient and routine detection of hantaviruses in cell cultures and in infected animal tissue.","['Lundkvist A', 'Hörling J', 'Björsten S', 'Niklasson B']",1995,52,1-2,J Virol Methods,"Lundkvist A, et al.

7694967,A serotypic study of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in rural China.,"Apodemus agrarius was trapped in the fields and Rattus norvegicus was trapped within the houses in the villages of Jiande County, a region in the Zhejiang Province of China endemic for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Antibodies to hantaviruses were detected in three (16.7%) of 18 A. agrarius and 12 (13.5%) of 89 R. norvegicus, whereas hantavirus antigens were detected in the lung tissues of four (22.2%) of 18 and nine (10.1%) of 89 of these rodents, respectively. Three hantaviruses, one from A. agrarius and two from R. norvegicus, were isolated and found to be antigenically similar to Hantaan and Seoul serotype viruses, respectively. A serologic study of 437 clinically defined HFRS patients conducted in Jiande County in 1988 revealed that the ratio of Hantaan (72.5%) to Seoul (26.8%) serotype virus infections was 2.7:1. Two epidemic seasons were found, with a major peak in November and a minor peak in June, and both were associated with Hantaan serotype virus infections that coincided with two seasonal peaks of the A. agrarius population and local agricultural activities in the fields. Seoul serotype virus infections occurred with a small peak during the months of December through May, in which in-house activities were dominant. All data suggested that Jiande County was an area endemic for HFRS, predominantly of the Hantaan virus serotype, combined with Seoul serotype virus infections.","['Li YL', 'Ruo SL', 'Tong Z', 'Ma QR', 'Liu ZL', 'Ye KL', 'Zhu ZY', 'McCormick JB', 'Fisher-Hoch SP', 'Xu ZY']",1995,52,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Li YL, et al.

7831843,Effect of interferon-alpha and cell differentiation on Puumala virus infection in human monocyte/macrophages.,"Pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is poorly understood. Puumala virus (PUU) is the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica, a form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome common in Europe. We have studied PUU infection in primary human monocyte/macrophages and specifically the role of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and cell differentiation in it. PUU infection proceeded at a low level in monocyte/macrophages, and nucleocapsid (N) protein accumulation started 2 days postinfection. IFN-induced antiviral MxA protein was detected 3 days postinfection, suggesting IFN-alpha production in culture. IFN-alpha titers remained low, proposing that PUU is a poor IFN inducer. However, the PUU-induced IFN had an inhibitory effect on virus production as was shown by the effect of anti-IFN-alpha. Pretreatment of cells with IFN-alpha caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PUU N accumulation and reduced the yield of infectious virus. Monocytic U-937 cells overexpressing MxA protein were susceptible to PUU, suggesting that, unlike in some other negative strand RNA virus infections, MxA does not mediate resistance to PUU infection. Differentiation of monocyte/macrophages in culture and treatment of THP-1 promonocytic cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate made the cells more susceptible to PUU. The increased susceptibility of mature macrophages to PUU suggests that after differentiation to tissue macrophages they might function in the spread of the virus during PUU infection.","['Temonen M', 'Lankinen H', 'Vapalahti O', 'Ronni T', 'Julkunen I', 'Vaheri A']",1995,206,1,Virology,"Temonen M, et al.

Bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a negative-sense, tripartite RNA genome. Hantaviruses are etiologic agents for two acute and severe illnesses of man, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Each hantavirus is primarily associated with a single rodent host species or genus, and is transmitted to man through accidental inhalation or ingestion of virus-contaminated rodent excreta. The distribution of hantaviruses is worldwide. HFRS is caused by infection with Hantaan, Seoul, Dobrava/Belgrade, and Puumala hantaviruses, all of which are enzootic in murid rodents of Old World origin. HPS is caused by any of several hantavirus species associated with indigenous New World rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae, family Muridae. HFRS and HPS have numerous common epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics. Common features include fever, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and a profound capillary leak syndrome associated with hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and shock.

7711347,Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: the Four Corners disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hantavirus infections, focusing on the recent outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the US.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966 to present) of English language literature pertaining to hantaviruses was performed. Additional literature was obtained from reference lists of pertinent articles identified through the search.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were considered for possible inclusion in the review. Pertinent information, as judged by the authors, was selected for discussion.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has long been recognized in Eurasia and is the predominant disease manifestation of hantavirus infection worldwide. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) recently has been described in the US and exhibits greater pulmonary involvement and mortality than HFRS. Historically, 4 hantavirus serotypes (Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, Prospect Hill) are recognized; however, additional serotypes have been proposed as distinct serogroups, including the serotype responsible for HPS in the Four Corners area: the Four Corners virus (FCV). Phylogenetic analysis shows that FCV is most closely related to Prospect Hill virus, another hantavirus previously isolated in the US that has not yet been identified with human disease. Additional hantavirus serotypes isolated in the US may provide insight into the prevalence of hantavirus infection and disease in this country. Inhalation of aerosolized virus is the predominant mechanism of hantavirus infection. Diagnosis is based primarily on clinical findings and serologic evidence of hantavirus antibody or direct evidence in clinical tissue specimens. Limited clinical studies evaluating ribavirin as a therapeutic modality demonstrated that the agent improves clinical outcome in HFRS. However, the role of ribavirin in the treatment of HPS remains to be determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Hantavirus infections are becoming increasingly recognized as a cause of disease worldwide. Recognition of hantavirus disease in the US suggests enzoonosis of pathogenic hantaviruses. In the absence of a well-established cure, early diagnosis is imperative so that aggressive supportive care can be initiated.","['Morrison YY', 'Rathbun RC']",1995,29,1,Ann Pharmacother,Morrison YY and Rathbun RC.

7784996,[Acute kidney failure caused by Hantaviruses].,"Hantavirus-induced acute renal failure is a worldwide occurring disease and rarely known and diagnosed in Germany and in Western Europe. Its various clinical features are embraced by the term Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal Syndrome (HFRS). Cardinal symptoms of the mild European form called Nephropathia epidemica (NE) leading to diagnosis are: abrupt onset, fever, pain (abdominal, loin-, or headache), acute renal failure, proteinuria and/or hematuria, polyuria, and thrombocytopenia. Etiologic agent of NE is the vole transmitted Puumula-serotype of Hantaviruses. Severe courses of HFRS characterized by hemorrhagic complications occur in Asia and Southeast Europe and are caused by the serotypes Hantaan (Korean Hemorrhagic Fever), Seoul (rat associated) and Belgrade (both Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever). Serological evidence of IgG and/or IgM-antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or mu-capture-ELISA proves the diagnosis and allows distinction of the infecting virus type. Transmission occurs primarily through inhalation of virus contaminated aerosols or dust. Transmission between humans has never been observed. The incubation period ranges between four days to four weeks. All persons who have much outdoor activities in forests, open fields, farms, and nearby waters are at risk to be infected. Practical exposure prophylaxis seems rarely possible. Therapy of NE is only symptomatic, confined to the treatment of pain, diuretic therapy in oliguric patients, and volume and electrolyte substitution in volume depleted or polyuric patients. Sometimes temporary hemodialysis is needed. Renal history reveals commonly the pattern of acute interstitial nephritis with typical focal interstitial microhemorrhages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kulzer P', 'Heidland A']",1994,51,12,Ther Umsch,Kulzer P and Heidland A.

7810123,Emergence of hantaviral disease in the southwestern United States.,"Hantaviruses are parasites of small mammals, predominantly peridomestic and commensal rodents. They have a worldwide distribution. Hantavirus-related illness occurs in rural areas where humans come into contact with rodents. In most cases human infection is manifested by one of a variety of acute illnesses involving hemorrhagic fever and renal disease. In May 1993, a cluster of patients with an acute pulmonary disease with high mortality was noted in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. Serologic and genetic studies indicated that the etiologic agent was a novel hantavirus. The uncertainty engendered by the emergence of a new disease with high mortality forced a rapid response by state and federal agencies and by the University of New Mexico Medical Center, Albuquerque, where most patients from this region were referred. Considerable progress has been made in identifying infected cases on clinical and laboratory grounds and in ensuring that appropriate supportive care is made available to patients as soon as they are suspected of having hantaviral infection. Cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome--both new and retrospectively diagnosed--are still being recognized throughout the western United States. Many important questions remain unanswered.","['Hjelle B', 'Jenison S', 'Mertz G', 'Koster F', 'Foucar K']",1994,161,5,West J Med,"Hjelle B, et al.

7943563,Isolation of a strain of a Hantaan virus from a fatal case of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Slovenia.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been serologically confirmed in Slovenia during the last seven years. There is evidence that three hantaviruses (Hantaan, Puumala, and a newly described form termed Dobrava) circulate simultaneously in this area. Recently, a hantavirus was isolated from the urine and brain tissue of a fatal case of HFRS. Positive immunofluorescent reactions with reference human sera and monoclonal antibodies were first recognized after the second cell culture passage. Extensive cross-reactivity between our isolate and prototype Hantaan virus, strain 76-118, and Hantaan-like isolates from the former Yugoslavia, Fojnica and Plitvice, was revealed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with specific rat antisera. The reaction pattern of the isolate was similar to the prototype Hantaan virus by indirect immunofluorescent assay with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the specificity of the isolates was confirmed by analysis of polymerase chain reaction products of this virus with five restriction endonucleases. This appears to be the first isolation of a strain of prototype Hantaan virus from a fatal case of HFRS in Europe.","['Avsic-Zupanc T', 'Poljak M', 'Furlan P', 'Kaps R', 'Xiao SY', 'Leduc JW']",1994,51,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Avsic-Zupanc T, et al.

Korean Society of Pediatric Nephrology.,"Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute disease caused by Hantavirus and clinically characterised by abrupt onset of fever, various haemorrhagic manifestations and transient renal and hepatic dysfunction. We retrospectively reviewed 63 cases of HFRS in children from 13 different hospitals in Korea who presented over a 15-year period. The age of the patients ranged from 7 to 15 years, with a male to female ratio of 8 to 1. Fifty-four (86%) patients were 10 years or older. On admission, 24 (38%) were in the febrile phase and 35 (56%) were in the oliguric phase. Fever (100%) abdominal pain (91%), headache (76%) and vomiting (73%) were the most common symptoms. Backache, subconjunctival haemorrhage and hypertension were also noted in about one-third of patients. Hypotension was documented in only 7 (11%) patients. Leucocytosis (> 10,000/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (< 150,000/mm3) were noted in more than two-thirds of patients. Elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine was observed in 94% by the 7th (median) day of illness. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase were found in more than two-thirds of patients. Renal biopsy was performed in 12 patients and revealed various stages of acute tubular necrosis with occasional interstitial cell infiltration and oedema. Only 2 showed evidence of interstitial haemorrhage. Eleven patients required 1-3 days of dialysis and the remaining patients required only conservative management. Three (5%) patients died of shock, respiratory failure and pulmonary haemorrhage. All other patients recovered without sequelae. Although childhood cases were much less common than adults, clinical and laboratory findings were in general similar between children and adults.","['Yoo KH', 'Choi Y']",1994,8,5,Pediatr Nephrol,Yoo KH and Choi Y.

7991812,MR imaging of hemorrhage and iron deposition in the kidney.,"Hemoglobin and its degradation products result in signal intensity changes at T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging that can either facilitate or obstruct diagnosis of renal lesions. These substances are deposited in the kidney by means of hemorrhage or systemic intravascular hemolysis. Hemorrhage commonly occurs into a renal cyst, resulting in an appearance that cannot be reliably distinguished from that of renal cell carcinoma without use of contrast material. Hemorrhage may also occur diffusely in the renal medulla, and the resulting low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images is characteristic of the rare disease hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Systemic intravascular hemolysis results in low signal intensity in the renal cortex on T2-weighted images, owing to hemosiderin deposition; this occurs in severe hemolytic anemias. Familiarity with the spectrum of findings in the kidney resulting from hemorrhage or iron deposition is necessary for accurate diagnosis of renal disease.",['Roubidoux MA'],1994,14,5,Radiographics,Roubidoux MA.

There was also no evidence of vertical transmission. One year later, 2.3% (30/1325) of seronegative subjects had seroconverted including 2 who had hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Peak incidence of infection occurred in those 15-39 years old. Hantaan was the dominant serotype; Seoul serotype was less common (5:1). Host reservoirs were Apodemus agrarius in agricultural fields and Rattus norvegicus in houses. Risk factors for infection were traces of rat-contaminated food, travel to other areas for farm work, direct rodent contact, camping in grain fields, living in a house on the periphery of a village, stacking straw stacks outside houses, and keeping cats. All may provide exposure to infectious rodent reservoirs.","['Ruo SL', 'Li YL', 'Tong Z', 'Ma QR', 'Liu ZL', 'Tang YW', 'Ye KL', 'McCormick JB', 'Fisher-Hoch SP', 'Xu ZY']",1994,170,3,J Infect Dis,"Ruo SL, et al.

7979621,Hantavirus: an increasing problem?,"Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses and members of the Bunyaviridae family. They are transmitted from various rodent hosts by inhalation of infected urine, saliva or faeces. Infection in rodent hosts is inapparent but persists for life. Person-to-person spread of hantavirus has not been described. Two main presentations of the disease occur. Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is due to Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, Porogia and Belgrade viruses. In general HFRS due to Hantaan, Porogia and Belgrade viruses is more severe and has higher mortality than that due to Puumala (nephropathia epidemica) or Seoul viruses. Hantaan is predominant in the Far East (Korea, Japan, China), Porogia and Belgrade in the Balkans, and Puumala in Western Europe; Seoul has a world-wide distribution. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a recently described infection with high mortality (60%) due to adult respiratory distress syndrome. The virus (Muerto Canyon Virus) is a hantavirus but different genotypically from previous strains. Management of hantavirus infections may require bed-rest, sedation, circulatory and ventilatory support and renal dialysis. Ribavirin if administered early in the illness may be of benefit.","['Hart CA', 'Bennett M']",1994,88,4,Ann Trop Med Parasitol,Hart CA and Bennett M. Hantavirus: an increasing problem?.

7931185,Rapid differentiation between Hantaan and Seoul viruses by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis.,"The majority of causative strains of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are known as Hantaan and Seoul viruses in Korea. The clinical manifestations may be indistinguishable between both viruses, although the clinical course of Hantaan virus infection is more severe than that of the Seoul virus. Therefore, the differentiation of Hantaan or Seoul virus may be important for predicting the prognosis. The primers were selected from the published sequences of the S segments of Hantaan virus strain 76-118 and Seoul virus strain SR-11, which made it possible to obtain the same size of 403 bp amplified product by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR from both viral strains. The differentiation of the amplified products was carried out by restriction enzyme digestion. With HindIII, the 403 bp amplified product from Hantaan virus strain 76-118 was cleaved into two segments of 175 bp and 228 bp. By contrast, the 403 bp product from Seoul virus strain SR-11 was not cut by HindIII. With HinfI, the 403 bp amplified product from Hantaan virus strain 76-118 was divided into two bands of 280 bp and 60 bp on the electrophoresis. In the case of the digestion of 403 bp PCR product from Seoul virus strain SR-11 with HinfI, more than four bands (155 bp, 115 bp, 60 bp, and 32/29 bp) were observed on the 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

7916033,Serological evidence of Hantavirus disease in Northern Ireland.,"Since, to our knowledge, no clinically documented cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been reported in Northern Ireland, a sero-epidemiological study was carried out to assess the degree of Hantavirus immunity in a group of 627 Northern Irish patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HFRS and 100 healthy controls. IFA screening for IgG Hantavirus specific antibodies was carried out with a panel of up to 9 different Hantaviral antigens. IgM screening was performed using a commercially available mu-capture ELISA based upon two recombinant Hantaviral nucleocapsid antigens. A seropositivity of 2.1% (15/727) was recorded, with an almost exclusive reaction against a rat-derived R22VP30 strain of the Seoul serotype. Sole reliance upon non-rat-derived classic screening antigens Hantaan (HTN 76-118) and Puumala (CG 18-20) would have resulted in the detection of only 2/15 (13.3%) of cases in IgG IFA, and 8/14 (57.1%) of the cases in IgG ELISA. The findings indicate that for the first time in Europe, and more specifically in N. Ireland, non-laboratory outbreaks of HFRS may be caused by wild rats acting as a reservoir for a Seoul-like Hantavirus. Conventional Hantavirus serology using Hantaan and Puumala as screening antigens does not appear sufficient for the detection of such cases of HFRS. Hence, we propose the addition of a rat derived Hantaviral antigen to the antigen screening panel as a means of improving the specificity of the detection methods.","['McKenna P', 'Clement J', 'Matthys P', 'Coyle PV', 'McCaughey C']",1994,43,1,J Med Virol,"McKenna P, et al.

Results showed five-ID50/ml of EHF virus (EHFV) suspension could infect rats through their damaged skin. Both gamasid mites and mower's mites collected from epidemic areas could naturally infect and transmit EHFV by biting and stinging, or transmit transovarially. EHFV excreted from the experimentally infected animals could be transmitted to normal ones by aerosol. Experimental rats could be infected with EHFV via damaged mucous membrane of the digestive tract. The above results suggested the main route of transmission of EHFV was via damaged skin. Mite-borne transmission played an important role in perpetuating natural foci of EHF in rats. Respiratory transmission of EHFV via aerosol also was a possible route of transmission under specific conditions. In general, EHFV could hardly be transmitted via digestive tract. All those mentioned above provided an important scientific basis for prevention of EHF.","['Zhang Y', 'Tao KH', 'Zhao XZ']",1994,28,3,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Zhang Y, et al.

7496961,Elevated levels of total and Puumala virus-specific immunoglobulin E in the Scandinavian type of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"In a previous study, it was reported that the total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was increased in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether specific IgE is synthesized during the course of the disease. For this purpose, an epsilon-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed. A total of 72 patients with HFRS caused by Puumala virus were studied. Three different control groups were included: 20 blood donors, 20 patients with other viral diseases (influenza A and B virus, acute Epstein-Barr virus, and acute cytomegalovirus infections), and 5 subjects with high levels of total IgE (median, 1,070 kU/liter; range, 773 to 5,740 kU/liter). The levels of total IgE were significantly higher during the acute phase of HFRS than those of blood donors (P < 0.01) and of patients with other viral diseases (P < 0.001). All patients developed a specific IgE response (median, 55 arbitrary units; range 24 to 123 arbitrary units) in the acute phase of the disease, whereas in the different control groups no specific IgE was detectable. Both total and specific IgE levels decreased during convalescence compared with those during the acute phase of HFRS (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, we have shown that both total and specific IgE levels are increased in patients with HFRS compared with levels in patients with other viral diseases. The possible pathogenetic role of the specific IgE response in HFRS is discussed.","['Alexeyev OA', 'Ahlm C', 'Billheden J', 'Settergren B', 'Wadell G', 'Juto P']",1994,1,3,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,"Alexeyev OA, et al.

OBJECTIVE--To identify the human infection caused by Hantavíruses, which are the etiological agents of Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. METHODS--Sera from 1063 persons were tested by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) to Hantaan, Seoul and Puumala antigens. Plaque reduction neutralization test to the same antigens and indirect immunofluorescent test to Hantaan antigen were performed in the positive sera. RESULTS--Antibodies to Hantaan, Seoul or Puumala viruses were detected in 32 persons by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent test. Plaque reduction neutralization test performed in these 32 sera were positive in 5 (3 for Puumala and 2 for Seoul viruses). One serum reacted with high titer to Seoul virus in all tests. It was from a male resident in the rural area of Ribeira Valley, State of São Paulo, where he was born and has always lived. He had only travelled inside the State of São Paulo. CONCLUSION--There are serological evidences of Hantavírus infections in residents of the rural areas of the Amparo Island, Paranaguá Bay, State of Paraná and the Ribeira Valley, State of São Paulo; in employees of the port of Paranaguá, State of Paraná and in patients of the Emílio Ribas Hospital, São Paulo, State of São Paulo, who had a presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis.","['Iversson LB', 'da Rosa AP', 'Rosa MD', 'Lomar AV', 'Sasaki Mda G', 'LeDuc JW']",1994,40,2,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),"Iversson LB, et al.

These rat McAbs were characterized by radio-immunoprecipitation and western blotting methods, 2 directed against glycoprotein G2, 9 against nucleocapsid protein (NP) of HFRSV. The results of neutralization (NT) and hemagglutination inhibition(HI) test showed that most of the McAbs specific for NP had neither NT nor HI activities, but 2 had obvious NT and/or HI activities. It was suggested that there may be some neutralizing and hemagglutinating determinants on NP of HFRSV. Two McAbs to G2 had HI or/and NT activities. These date indicated that distinct neutralizing and hemagglutinating epitopes were located on the G2. Comparative antigenic analysis of 20 strains of HFRSV was carried out by immune horseradish peroxidase technique using 11 anti-HFRSV rat McAbs. It was found that these McAbs can be classified into group, subgroup, apodemus type and subtype specificity to HFRSV.","['Xu HF', 'Yang WS', 'Liang Z']",1994,74,4,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Xu HF, et al.

The results showed the ratio of activated antigen (CD25, TLiSA1, CD71, and Ia)-positive lymphocytes of PBMC in the acute phase of HFRS was higher than that in convalescent phase. Moreover, there was much higher expression of heteromorphologic lymphocytes than of small lymphocytes. Decreases in T lymphocytes and CD4:CD8 ratios were seen with increases in B lymphocyte ratios and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression on PBMC surfaces in the acute phase of HFRS. IFN-gamma-positive lymphocytes included CD4, CD8, and CD56 subsets. sIL-2R levels were much higher in sera and plasma in the acute phase, especially the oliguric phase. These findings suggest that patients with HFRS are in a state of high-level cellular immune response, which may be involved in the development of inflammation and pathologic lesions.","['Huang C', 'Jin B', 'Wang M', 'Li E', 'Sun C']",1994,169,4,J Infect Dis,"Huang C, et al.

In 86 cases, renal biopsy was performed. The severity of renal failure correlated slightly with blood inflammatory parameters and the degree of hematuria but not with the amount of proteinuria. The degree of hematuria correlated inversely with the level of thrombocytopenia. The most common histopathologic lesion was acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltrations were most usually present, followed by tubular epithelial and luminal alterations. Slight glomerular mesangial changes were present in 25% of the biopsy specimens. Except for hemorrhage in the outer renal medulla, the histologic lesions were relatively mild and unspecific. Interstitial hemorrhage should remind a pathologist of the possibility of NE. Tubular, interstitial and glomerular histologic damage were but vascular lesions were not associated with the clinical severity of renal failure. Glomerular alterations did not relate to the amount of urine protein excretion. Correlations, however, were so weak that in clinical work renal biopsy is usually not indicated for determination of the severity of renal failure in NE. Intrinsic renal events are probably important in the development of renal failure in NE.","['Mustonen J', 'Helin H', 'Pietilä K', 'Brummer-Korvenkontio M', 'Hedman K', 'Vaheri A', 'Pasternack A']",1994,41,3,Clin Nephrol,"Mustonen J, et al.

Although the serum specimens of virus carrier rats neutralized the infectivity of all the KI isolates, no apparent antigenic change in the isolates was detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) regardless of isolation years. However, neutralization test showed slight difference of antigenicity among KI strains.

7909976,Antigenic and molecular characterization of hantavirus isolates from China.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by certain viruses in the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae, and is a major public health problem in China. By using molecular and serological tests, we characterized 15 hantaviruses isolated either from patients with HFRS or from rodents captured in endemic areas of China. By cross plaque-reduction neutralization tests performed with rabbit immune sera, we identified two serologically distinct groups of viruses, comprised of those related to Hantaan virus, and those related to Seoul virus. To study the genetic relationships among these viruses, we amplified a 330 base pair region of the medium (M) genome segment of each isolate by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and compared the nucleotide sequences to those of other, well-characterized hantaviruses. In addition, we PCR-amplified and analyzed the entire coding region of the small (S) genome segment of each isolate by restriction enzyme digestion with a battery of enzymes. The results of our genetic analyses of both the M and S segments of these isolates confirmed our serological data, indicating that Hantaan and Seoul viruses co-circulate in endemic disease regions of China. We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on multiple alignment of the partial M segment sequences. The resulting dendrogram distinguished three genetic subtypes of Hantaan viruses and one type of Seoul virus.","['Liang M', 'Li D', 'Xiao SY', 'Hang C', 'Rossi CA', 'Schmaljohn CS']",1994,31,2,Virus Res,"Liang M, et al.

This study describes 3 cases of domestically acquired hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the United States. Infection was due to a local strain of Seoul virus (Baltimore rat virus). A review of the clinical features indicated a mild illness characterized by nausea, vomiting, renal and liver failure similar to HFRS described elsewhere for rat-borne viruses. Follow-up of 2 patients identified persistent hypertension and renal disease providing further evidence of an association between past hantaviral infection and hypertensive renal disease.","['Glass GE', 'Watson AJ', 'LeDuc JW', 'Childs JE']",1994,68,1,Nephron,"Glass GE, et al.

This review was made in three internal and a nephrology department in Bordeaux hospital. Most cases occurred by indirect contact with infected animals or by occupational exposures. Onset was brutal with fever often associated with painful syndrome and sometimes conjunctival suffusion. Jaundice (70%), acute renal failure (67%), meningitis (50%) and hemorrhagic signs (50%) were among the major visceral manifestations. Diagnosis was always confirmed by micro-agglutination test. Leptospira ictero-hemorrhage was the predominant serogroup found. The outcome was favorable in 22 patients; reversible complications were seen in six cases (five acute renal failure with hemodialysis myocarditis and pulmonary edema in two hemodialysed patients, polyradiculoneuritis). Two patients died (acute respiratory failure and meningo-encephalitis with diffuse hemorrhagic syndrome). The characteristic of our series is the high frequency of hepatorenal syndrome due to the importance of our nephrologist recruitment. Furthermore our study confirm the vital prognostic characters of the pulmonary, renal, hemorrhagic and neurologic complications. No absolute relationship was found between the clinical and laboratory findings and the serotype of leptospira.

An assay for strand-specific detection and quantitation of Hantaan virus RNA was developed based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A protocol for the efficient detection of both genomic RNA and its transcript is presented, in which a reverse transcriptase reaction (RTR) followed by PCR with two common primers was used to distinguish between positive- and negative-stranded RNA. Using this method, the growth characteristics of Hantaan virus, strain 76-118, were studied in Vero E6 cells. Positive-stranded RNA was detected on the next day after infection, and the amount increased remarkably beginning from 3 days after infection. The negative-stranded RNA (genomic), was detected at 2 days after infection which predominated over the transcript RNA. Three days after infection, the amount of viral RNA attained 80% of the maximum amount which was detected by 6 days after infection, while, 4 days after infection the amount of the positive-stranded RNA became over 80% of the maximum amount of 6 days after infection and reached the amount of viral RNA. Both RNAs reached plateaus at 6 days after infection and after that the amounts of synthesized viral RNA and its transcripts were constant.","['Isegawa Y', 'Ohshima A', 'Sokawa Y', 'Yamanishi K']",1994,38,11,Microbiol Immunol,"Isegawa Y, et al.

On the basis of clinical observation, the illness is divided into five sequential stages: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. Because interferons can be induced by viruses, and because their stimulating effects on immune cells can alter the course of viral infections, we examined the presence of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in 276 serum samples collected from 110 patients during the Korean Conflict. We tested these sera for IFN-alpha by bioassay with bovine kidney MDBK cells, and for IFN-gamma by a sandwich ELISA with antibodies specific for human IFN-gamma. We found variable, but persistently elevated levels of IFN-gamma throughout the various phases of the disease, which suggested persistent immune activation through convalescence.

The disease was diagnosed in 4 children and 1 adult, and 1 of the children died. Rodents were captured from the same area and virus isolation attempted. A hantavirus, POZ-M1, was isolated from lung tissues of hantavirus antigen-positive Mus musculus. Serology and restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction-amplified segments from this virus showed that it was a strain of Puumala (PUU) virus, the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica. While Clethrionomys glareolus is the major rodent host for PUU virus, these results suggest that M. musculus may also play an important role in harboring and transmitting PUU-like viruses.

8258753,High frequency of antibodies to Hantaan virus and hepatitis C virus in chronic haemodialysis patients. Coincidence or cross-reaction?,"OBJECTIVES: To address the question of whether there is any coincidence or cross-reaction between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Hantaan virus (both RNA arboviruses), as well as to assess the frequency of antibodies to the above viruses amongst chronic haemodialysis patients in our region.
DESIGN: Collection of serum samples from consecutive unselected chronic haemodialysis patients.
SETTING: A tertiary referral center (University Hospital).
SUBJECTS: One hundred and fourteen chronic haemodialysis patients were investigated for the presence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and Hantaan virus disease (anti-HVD). Eleven unselected non-haemodialysis patients with well-defined haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were also investigated for the anti-HCV antibodies comprising the disease control group.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The utility of an anti-HVD positive test in chronic haemodialysis patients.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients (14.9% 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-21.4%) were anti-HCV positive, whereas 15 (13.2%, 95% CI 6.9-19.3%) were anti-HVD positive. An anti-HCV positive test was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA II) in 88.2%. The presence of anti-HCV antibodies was not associated with transfusions but with the longer duration of haemodialysis (62.8 +/- 29.8 vs. 31.2 +/- 29.3 months, P < 0.001). Anti-HVD antibodies were not associated with transfusions or with the duration of haemodialysis. Three patients were positive for both anti-HCV and anti-HVD antibodies. None of the 11 patients with well-defined HFRS had anti-HCV antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic haemodialysis patients are a high risk group for HCV infection in association with the duration of haemodialysis and, at least for our geographical area, these patients have to be examined for anti-HVD antibodies especially when a definite causative agent for chronic renal failure is not found. The HVD and HCV infection are not exceptional amongst haemodialysis patients in our region, whereas the possibility of a cross-reaction between these two RNA arboviruses is rather excluded as there was no evidence of HCV infection amongst the patients with well-defined HFRS.","['Tsianos EV', 'Dalekos GN', 'Elisaf M', 'Zervou E', 'Siamopoulos KC']",1993,234,6,J Intern Med,"Tsianos EV, et al.

Infected infants that initially acquired high levels of maternal antibodies by either route survived lethal doses of the virus and did not show any signs of disease. Furthermore, 15 weeks later, these animals had no evidence of remaining antibodies or viral infection.

7907972,[Functional changes of hypothalamic-pituitary target gland axes and their clinical significance].,"We examined the function of hypothalamic-pituitary target gland axes in 88 cases with epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF). It was found that all the three endocrine axes i.e. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis showed some functional impairment. In acute phase there were increased plasma ACTH, FSH and LH levels, which might be attributed to stress reaction in EHF patients. Most cases showed low or weak response of TSH to TRH and delayed response of LH to LHRH; some of the cases did not respond to 1mg of glucagon. These manifestations might be related with poor reserve of anterior pituitary or to disordered regulation of endocrine axes. The increased plasma cortisol and estradiol and the decreased plasma T3, T4 as well as testosterone during acute phase may have important clinical significance. Hence we suggest that in any case glucocorticosteroids should not be abused and that in severe patients thyroxine and durabolin should be administered to improve immunity and hepato-renal function.","['Sun ZJ', 'Huang XH', 'Wang MX']",1993,32,11,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Sun ZJ, et al.

We found that the major pathologic finding in gastric mucosa is hemorrhage of squamous shape. EHF virus antigen exists in epithelial cytoplasm of the superficial layer and lamina propria of gastric mucosa and the virus is dissociated from gastric mucosa. The virus is identified as of field-rat serotype with electronmicroscopy and monoclonal antibody techniques. These results suggest that it is necessary to start antivirus therapy early and to give prophylactic measures to prevent gastric mucosa damage and upper digestive tract bleeding.","['Huang YX', 'Dong J', 'Lu QY']",1993,32,11,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Huang YX, et al.

7907616,Hantavirus: an old bug learns new tricks.,"Hantaviruses are a diverse group of RNA arboviruses in the Bunyaviridae family. Although their role as the causative agents of HFRS has been well established, the recent outbreak of a new disease in the Southwest clearly demonstrates the protein clinical manifestations that this pathogen can produce. Furthermore, whereas hantaviruses have been characterized largely as focal agents in the production of geographically delimited diseases, recent trends indicate that endemic areas for the virus are expanding. Outbreaks often occur in clusters as a result of the epizoology of rodent hosts, but isolated cases of hantavirus-related disease also may be observed. Although hantaviruses have proven their pathogenic capability in other areas of the world, it was perceived widely that they were of little consequence to public health in the United States. However, as more is learned about the nature of this truly global infectious agent, its potential danger to mankind becomes increasingly apparent. It is hoped that continued research will elucidate all the facets of hantavirus-induced disease.","['Sinnott JT', 'Greene JN', 'Kim E', 'Gompf S']",1993,14,11,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Sinnott JT, et al.

The effective inhibition usually began at the concentration of 0.002 mol/L of selenite in vitro, and 20 micrograms/25 g BW intravenously in vivo. The inhibitory effect was found evident on alternative pathway. This inhibitory effect was further identified in cases of epidemic haemorrhagic fever (EHF) treated by multiple dosages of 2 mg selenite per day in the first 9 days of hospitalization other than general management of 80 severe cases, including fulminant and moderate grade EHF cases. C3 activation was inhibited accordingly and the mortalities also dropped markedly from 100% of the non-treated group to 36% of the selenite treated group of fulminant type, and from 22% to zero of severe type group.","['Hou JC', 'Jiang ZY', 'He ZF']",1993,73,11,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Hou JC, et al.

7692720,Localization of Hantaan viral envelope glycoproteins by monoclonal antibodies in renal tissues from patients with Korean hemorrhagic fever H.,"The role of viruses in several renal diseases is not documented clearly. The authors attempted to localize envelope glycoproteins of Hantaan virus in biopsy specimens from patients with Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF) as evidence of direct viral invasion of renal tissues. The authors studied sequential sections of kidney biopsy specimens from 23 of 35 patients with serologically confirmed KHF diagnosed between June 1985 and December 1989. The sections were stained with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with monoclonal antibodies to G1 and G2 envelope glycoproteins. Control antibodies of the same isotype were used to rule out nonspecific staining, and hyperimmune rabbit sera or convalescent sera of patients with KHF were used for blocking tests. Normal renal tissues and kidney biopsy tissues from minimal-change nephrotic syndrome were used as negative control sections. The kidney biopsies were performed between the fifth and thirtieth days after onset of fever. The authors detected viral glycoproteins in renal tissues from 22 of the 23 patients. The viral glycoproteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the tubular epithelial cells, and the distribution of viral glycoproteins in the tubules was focal. Glycoproteins also were localized in the cytoplasm of the sloughed renal tubular epithelial cells, where tubular degenerative changes were prominent. These findings suggest the direct invasion of renal tubules by the virus and may partly explain the pathogenesis of acute renal failure in KHF.","['Kim S', 'Kang ET', 'Kim YG', 'Han JS', 'Lee JS', 'Kim YI', 'Hall WC', 'Dalrymple JM', 'Peters CJ']",1993,100,4,Am J Clin Pathol,"Kim S, et al.

8104972,Liver involvement in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is an acute febrile nephropathy caused by several viruses of the genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae. During the past 8 years, 32 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have been diagnosed. Nine out of the 32 patients (28%) had raised (twofold upper normal limits) transaminases during hospitalization. Four out of the nine patients (44%) died. In contrast, only three out of the 23 patients (13%) without raised transaminases died. Five patients had slightly increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, whereas six patients had prolonged prothrombin time. Liver histology showed midzonal necrosis in hepatic lobules with extravasation of red cells and mild mononuclear infiltrate. Liver involvement seems to be an ominous prognostic factor in such patients and is correlated with severe renal failure and thrombocytopenia.","['Elisaf M', 'Stefanaki S', 'Repanti M', 'Korakis H', 'Tsianos E', 'Siamopoulos KC']",1993,17,1,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Elisaf M, et al.

Blood specimens were obtained from 915 persons representing 190 study households. Enzyme immunoassay testing showed that the overall prevalence of IgG antibody was 4% to sand fly fever Sicilian (SFS), 2% to sandfly fever Naples (SFN), 15% to RVF, 20% to West Nile, and 4% to Hantaan (HTN) viruses. Antibody was demonstrated among 32% of the same study subjects to Coxiella burnetii, 58% to Rickettsia typhi, and 32% to R. conorii. The prevalence of agent-specific antibody tended to increase with age. Particularly notable was the low prevalence of RVF infection in children born after the height of the RVF outbreak. No detectable antibodies were found in the population less than seven years of age and in only 3% of those 7-12 years old. In contrast, 26% of the study population 13-19 years old, who were young children and infants at the time of the outbreak, were found to have RVF antibodies, suggesting that the level of intensity associated with transmission decreased considerably following the documented 1977-1978 outbreak. Geometric mean titers (GMT) ranged from 139 for C. burnetii to 1,305 for RVF, and did not vary significantly by age, except for high titers for RVF in the 20-49-year-old age group. A significant upward trend in GMT was also noted when antibody was detected in the specimen for more than one phlebovirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Corwin A', 'Habib M', 'Watts D', 'Darwish M', 'Olson J', 'Botros B', 'Hibbs R', 'Kleinosky M', 'Lee HW', 'Shope R']",1993,48,6,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Corwin A, et al.

We expressed the entire coding region of the small (S) genome segments of three serologically distinct hantaviruses as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli and evaluated the expressed nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) as antigens for diagnosis of HFRS. We also prepared novel diagnostic antigens by expressing truncated genes from which we deleted amino acid coding regions that were highly conserved among the three viruses. These antigens were analysed for their potential to detect and differentiate between antisera to various hantaviruses by ELISA. ELISA results obtained with HFRS patient sera or with sera from naturally or experimentally infected animals indicate that homologous antigens and antisera reacted to high titre. The truncated NPs were more specific than the complete NPs in distinguishing between possible aetiological agents of HFRS. Our findings demonstrate that prokaryotic expression of portions of the NPs of specific hantaviruses can be used to generate, readily and efficiently, large quantities of antigen that is both sensitive and specific in diagnostic assays for HFRS.","['Wang M', 'Rossi C', 'Schmaljohn CS']",1993,74 ( Pt 6),,J Gen Virol,"Wang M, et al.

In Bashkirtostan, 10% of the women and 15% of the men were found to be antibody positive. The corresponding figures for Sweden were 8% and 16% for women and men, respectively. The annual incidence of HFRS in Bashkirtostan was 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with a male:female ratio of 4.6:1. The incidence in the endemic area of Sweden was seven cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with a male:female ratio of 1.8:1. A similar age distribution of cases, with a peak in the middle age groups, especially in men, was found in both Bashkirtostan and Sweden. The incidence of HFRS in humans and the abundance of bank voles varied with time in both Bashkirtostan and Sweden, but the study failed to find any significant correlation between the two variables. The study showed that HFRS causes significant human morbidity in the areas studied but that both incidence and possibly bank vole abundance was higher in Bashkirtostan than in northern Sweden.","['Niklasson B', 'Hornfeldt B', 'Mullaart M', 'Settergren B', 'Tkachenko E', 'Myasnikov YuA', 'Ryltceva EV', 'Leschinskaya E', 'Malkin A', 'Dzagurova T']",1993,48,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Niklasson B, et al.

RESULT: The Syndrome displayed as Excess-Heat type accompanied with Blood Stasis in febrile phase of EHF, both the level of serum cortisol and the U 17-OH increased to meet the stress. But the Syndrome converted from the Excess-Heat type to the Cold-Deficiency type in hypotensive and shock phase and the secretion of HPA axis began to reduce.

It was therefore considered to be a suitable antigen for the development of rapid and reliable immunodiagnostic assays. Genes encoding the nucleocapsid proteins of two Hantavirus strains, one of the Puumala serotype [nephropathia epidemica virus (NEV)] and the other of the Hantaan serotype were expressed in E. coli, and the expression products were used as diagnostic antigens in solid-phase enzyme immunoassays. The assays were used to detect IgG- and IgM-antibodies in sera of HFRS patients originating from different geographic regions (China, Germany, Greece, Yugoslavia, Scandinavia). ELISA was highly sensitive and proved to be superior to the indirect immunofluorescence assay. Both antigens were necessary to diagnose all HFRS cases originating from the different countries. Most of the sera revealed a predominant reactivity with either 1 of the 2 antigens, allowing the characterization of the etiologic virus as Hantaan-like or NEV-like. The results of the analysis of sera obtained from China and Greece suggested that the Hantaviruses prevalent in these countries are closely related to the Hantaan serotype. In contrast, an NEV-like reactivity was observed in Central and Northern European patients.

The recombinant protein was purified by cutting the protein band from an agarose gel, melting the agarose, and removing the protein by freezing, incubation on ice, and centrifugation. The recovery was about 1 to 5 mg/200 ml of bacterial suspension, sufficient for coating 100 to 500 enzyme immunoassay microtiter plates. In a study of 312 IF-positive and 233 IF-negative serum samples from NE patients, the recombinant-N-protein enzyme immunoassay detected immunoglobulin G antibodies to Puumala virus with 97.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity compared with the IF test results. In addition, an immunoglobulin G avidity enzyme immunoassay was developed and used successfully to diagnose acute NE from a single serum sample.

Eight of ten serially bled patients developed specific IgG4. The IgG4 responses showed similar patterns against all three viral proteins with very low optical density values in the acute- and convalescent-phase samples, followed by higher optical densities in the sera drawn 2 years after infection. Seven of nine 10-year sera contained virus-specific IgG4.

8431556,"The effects of hybridoma growth factor in conditioned media upon the growth, cloning, and antibody production of heterohybridoma cell lines.","Interleukin 6 (IL-6)/hybridoma growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be the requirement for growth of murine hybridomas in vivo or in vitro. In this paper, two kinds of conditioned media (CM) from the culture supernatants of a human fibroblast cell line CRL1506 and a cloned Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) N23 were found to have IL-6 activity by strongly promoting the growth, antibody secretion (increase of one- to three-fold), and cloning efficiencies of heterohybridomas secreting human monoclonal anti-hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome virus antibodies and LCL. Since these CM contained no detectable IL-2, and IL-4 had no effects on the growth of the cell lines, IL-6 was considered to be the main active component of the CM responsible for promoting hybridoma growth. This effect was further confirmed by IL-6-dependent cell line 7TD1 bioassay (IL-6 activity in the CM ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 units/ml). Moreover, we successfully established four EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines at single-cell level by adding an equal volume of CRL1506-CM to 10% FCS-RPMI1640 in limiting dilution. Finally, it is worth noting that the sensitivity of the heterohybridomas to the two kinds of CM was not the same and was not consistent with that of their parental myeloma cell lines. Thus, it suggests that the CM might contain more than one factor, and the choice of proper conditioned media should be very useful for human monoclonal antibody production.","['Zhu Y', 'Jin B', 'Sun C', 'Huang C', 'Liu X']",1993,4,1,Hum Antibodies Hybridomas,"Zhu Y, et al.

8104397,IgG avidity assay for estimation of the time after onset of hantavirus infection in colonized and wild bank voles.,An immunoglobulin G avidity assay was used to determine recent and past hantavirus infection in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). Sera of experimentally infected bank voles were studied at different time intervals. The avidity of specific IgG increased over time after infection. This experimental data were used to estimate the time after onset of hantavirus infection in naturally infected bank voles caught in an endemic area. The possibility to discriminate between recently infected animals and animals infected some time ago is important since the proportion of recently infected bank voles represents the intensity of the epizootic which in turn correlates to the risk of humans to contract the disease.,"['Gavrilovskaya I', 'Apekina N', 'Okulova N', 'Demina V', 'Bernshtein A', 'Myasnikov Y']",1993,132,3-4,Arch Virol,"Gavrilovskaya I, et al.

The assays were proven to be entirely restricted for each viral structural protein by biotin-labelled monoclonal antibodies. Sera from sequentially bled nephropathia epidemica patients (acute, convalescent, and 2-year sera) and sera from 10-20 year convalescents were examined for antibody specificity. All but one (n = 19) acute phase sera were shown to contain IgM antibodies directed to all three viral proteins. In the convalescent specimens the proportions of IgM to the different viral components were similar, but lower, when compared to the acute samples. Low levels of IgM against N and G2 were found in two out of ten 2-year sera. No virus-specific IgM were detected in sera drawn 10-20 years after infection. IgG antibodies to all three viral proteins were detected in all except one acute phase serum. The IgG response initially increased more rapidly to N, as compared to the anti-glycoprotein responses. The levels of glycoprotein-specific IgG were considerably increased 2 years after the disease, when compared to the levels detected in the convalescent specimens. The levels and specificities of IgG in very late convalescent sera (drawn 10-20 years after disease) resembled those detected 2 years after infection.","['Lundkvist A', 'Hörling J', 'Niklasson B']",1993,130,1-2,Arch Virol,"Lundkvist A, et al.

In the mountainous areas of northeastern Italy, the prevalence of antibody to hantaviruses, as detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, was 7.1%, 4.8%, 4.3%, and 4% in 265 forestry workers, 82 rangers, 395 farmers, and 75 hunters, respectively. Among 299 Alpine soldiers, the prevalence was lower (0.7%). Of those with Hantaan antibody, the reactivity pattern using Hantaan, Puumala, and Fojnica viruses suggested a prevalence of antibody to Hantaan virus, with titers reaching levels of 128. The presence of leptospiral antibodies (by microagglutination test), which included the prevalence of antibodies to Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, L. bratislava, and L. saxkoening serotypes, was observed in 10-12% of the farmers and forestry workers in these Alpine mountain regions. Only a few sporadic clinical cases of leptospirosis have been reported from these regions. Antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi (by IFA) were observed in 19% of the rangers and forestry workers, with lower values in farmers (10%) and hunters (8%). These data suggest the presence of a large number of asymptomatic infections with B. burgdorferi and the leptospires in the densely wooded areas of the Alpine Italian regions. Furthermore, the recent identification of a case of Hantaan acute nephropathy in a man living in the mountainous northeastern area of Italy confirms the presence of hantavirus in the Italian Alpine zones, especially those near the Slovenian border.","['Nuti M', 'Amaddeo D', 'Crovatto M', 'Ghionni A', 'Polato D', 'Lillini E', 'Pitzus E', 'Santini GF']",1993,48,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Nuti M, et al.

Infections of both strains were lethal in newborn mice. However, inoculum required to cause lethal infection was about 4,000 times higher for strain HTN (1.65 x 10(3) PFU/mouse/LD50) than for strain SR-11 (0.36 PFU). Thus, both strains were considered pathogenic to newborn mice but they possessed different levels of virulence. The assay system used for these strains in newborn mice proved to be useful in the study of hantavirus virulence. Growth curves of the two strains in CV-7 cell cultures were compared. Strain SR-11 was shown to have higher activity of virus replication and virus release into the culture fluids than strain HTN.

The proteins expressed by RNV and RMV9 were identified by radioimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence assay using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal immune sera, and were found to be antigenically indistinguishable from authentic R22 viral proteins. Both RNV and RMV9 elicited an anti-R22 antibody response in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) with titers ranging from 6,400 to 12,800 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but only RMV9 produced neutralizing antibodies to R22 virus (titer 1:200) and Hantaan (HTN) virus (titer 1:20). The ability of these recombinants to protect Mongolian gerbils against challenge with R22 and HTN viruses was examined. The RMV9 recombinant induced a complete protective immune response against challenge with 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) of both R22 and HTN viruses, while RNV induced partial protection against a challenge with the homologous R22 virus and the heterologous HTN virus at a dose of 10(3) PFU. Our data show that the common antigenic sites responsible for eliciting a protective response are located mainly on hantavirus glycoproteins, and that the nucleoprotein may also confer partial cross-protection that presumably involves cell-mediated as well as humoral mechanisms.","['Xu X', 'Ruo SL', 'McCormick JB', 'Fisher-Hoch SP']",1992,47,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Xu X, et al.

Pretreatment of HUVEC with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not with IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), increased their ability to bind IgG of sera from patients with NE and acute febrile illnesses. We conclude that, although AECA can be demonstrated in NE, they occur also in other acute viral illnesses and, unless cytopathic by a mechanism not shared by the AECA of these other illnesses, are unlikely to be casually related to the capillary leak in HFRS.","['Wangel AG', 'Temonen M', 'Brummer-Korvenkontio M', 'Vaheri A']",1992,90,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Wangel AG, et al.

1356160,Hantaan virus infection of human endothelial cells.,"The primary pathophysiologic finding of the viral disease known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, the etiological agent of which is Hantaan virus (HTV), is vascular instability. To investigate whether HTV was able to infect cells derived from human vascular tissue and alter their behavior, we infected in vitro primary adult human endothelial cells from saphenous veins (HSVEC). We were able to detect the presence of viral antigens in infected cells both by immunofluorescence and by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis as early as day 1 postinfection. HSVEC infected with HTV produce infectious virus during the first 3 days of infection but, at later times (days 4 to 8), show decreasing yields of virus. This contrasts with the HTV growth pattern observed for the permissive simian CV-7 cell line, which generates infectious virus up to day 12 after infection. Further investigation showed that the late decrease in viral production in HSVEC is the result of the induction of beta interferon and can be reversed by the addition of anti-beta interferon serum to the culture medium. At no time during the course of infection of HSVEC with HTV was any obvious cytopathic effect observed. When tests for changes in mRNA levels of other cytokines and endothelial cell gene products following HTV infection of HSVEC were done by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction methods, no significant changes were observed in the levels of interleukin 1, interleukin 6, or von Willebrand factor mRNA. We hypothesize that, while HTV can replicate in human vascular endothelial cells, the mechanism of microvascular damage seen with Korean hemorrhagic fever is not likely to be a direct effect of virus replication but may conceivably be the consequence of an immune-mediated endothelial injury triggered by viral infection.","['Pensiero MN', 'Sharefkin JB', 'Dieffenbach CW', 'Hay J']",1992,66,10,J Virol,"Pensiero MN, et al.

Normal renal function was restored in all patients. Follow-up examination of 15 patients 6-7 years after the acute illness revealed normal blood pressure, normal serum creatinine, absent proteinuria and normal inulin clearance in all, thus confirming the favourable prognosis of the infection in Western Europe.

LOU rats, as well as immunocytomas, which were requested by laboratories in the U.K. and The Netherlands, were supplied at a time when the infection was unknown and unsuspected in Europe. Hantavirus-infected laboratory rats were rendered free of virus through re-derivation by caesarian section and suckling by virus-free foster mothers. Immunocytomas were tested for the presence of hantaviruses by implantation into seronegative laboratory rats. The strain of hantavirus causing the laboratory infection was clearly different from the one circulating in free-living bankvoles in Belgium. The exchange of laboratory rats and rat tumours in relation to the potential risk of laboratory-acquired hantavirus infection, is discussed.","['McKenna P', 'van der Groen G', 'Hoofd G', 'Beelaert G', 'Leirs H', 'Verhagen R', 'Kints JP', 'Cormont F', 'Nisol F', 'Bazin H']",1992,25,2,J Infect,"McKenna P, et al.

EHFV was isolated from both larvae of free mites collected from the grassland of endemic areas and larvae of filial mites hatched in the laboratory. The suckling mice bitten by these larvae were infected by EHFV. Because only the larvae of chigger mite can bite vertebrate hosts and only take a full meal in its entire life cycle, the pathogen carried by it can only be originated from its parent mite via transovarial route. Thus it can be confirmed that the natural infection of EHFV in these mites is transferred via transovarial transmission. The results demonstrate that L (L.) scutellare can naturally be infected by EHFV; EHFV can be transmitted to the vertebrate host by biting of the larvae and can be transferred via transovarial transmission in mites; and therefore, L (L.) scutellare can serve as a transmitting vector of EHF.",['Wu G'],1992,72,8,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Wu G.

This assay was used to study the kinetics of the development of serum antibodies after natural infection with Puumala-like virus in humans. To this end a panel of 34 serum samples collected from individuals at different times after natural infection was tested by the ELISA. The samples were also tested for specific IgM and IgG levels against Puumala-like virus, which provided confirmatory data about the presumed timing of infection. It was shown that serum antibodies against the G1 epitope were present in the acute and early convalescent period just before antibodies to the NP epitope could be demonstrated. In contrast, antibodies to two G2 epitopes were present not earlier than in the convalescent and late convalescent period. Since all these categories of antibodies seem to persist for long periods, antibodies against the G1 epitope and the NP epitope may be of specific diagnostic value. Furthermore, levels of G1-specific antibodies and antibodies to either NP or G2 may allow estimation of the time elapsed following initial infection.","['Groen J', 'Dalrymple J', 'Fisher-Hoch S', 'Jordans JG', 'Clement JP', 'Osterhaus AD']",1992,37,4,J Med Virol,"Groen J, et al.

The clinical course of NE is mostly benign, complications are uncommon, and deaths are rarely observed. We report the cases of three patients who developed serious complications in the course of NE caused by the Puumala-virus. One patient died within 24 h after admission, another developed progressive neuromuscular dysfunction (Guillain-Barré syndrome) which required auxiliary ventilation for several weeks before a slow recovery, and a third patient developed empty sella syndrome with pituitary gland insufficiency. In the first two cases the diagnosis of NE was confirmed by a rapid avidity assay for IgG antibody against Puumala-virus. In the third case the clinical course, and demonstration of NE immunity 16 years later, suggested that NE might have caused the hypopituitarism. Some patients with NE caused by the Puumala-virus may require intensive-care treatment, and the development of late complications such as empty sella syndrome and hypopituitarism should be taken into consideration.","['Forslund T', 'Saltevo J', 'Anttinen J', 'Auvinen S', 'Brummer-Korvenkontio M', 'Korhonen A', 'Poutiainen M']",1992,232,1,J Intern Med,"Forslund T, et al.

The results showed: (1) The manifestations of microvascular damage, proteinuria and thrombocytopenia can be found at the first day of the onset in 80.0%, 72.2% and 33.3% respectively. In a word, the characteristic features of HFRS appear at the onset of the disease. (2) In 446 early cases the initial severity of the disease corresponded with the final severity at a rate of 89.2%; it indicated that the damage of HFRS may result from the first attack. (3) The time of the onset, peak and persistence of all the characteristic features were similar; it is suggested that the course of HFRS may be self-limited. (4) Based on the clinical understanding and the effective results in the 446 early cases treated with fluid therapy alone, we consider that the effective treatment of HFRS is early and reasonable fluid therapy.","['Yu DP', 'Wang GQ', 'Liu MC']",1992,31,3,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Yu DP, et al.

The viruses causing HFRS all belong to the Hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. At least three of the different hantaviruses are associated with human disease: Hantaan, Seoul, and Puumala viruses. HFRS is endemic in a belt from Norway in the west, through Sweden, Finland, the Soviet Union, China, Korea to Japan in the east. The clinical severity of HFRS varies throughout this belt. A severe form with haemorrhagic manifestations and significant lethality (Korean haemorrhagic fever--caused by Hantaan and Seoul virus) occurs in Asia, while a milder form (nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala virus) with less haemorrhagic manifestations and no or low lethality is found in Europe. All hantaviruses are spread by rodents where the major route of transmission to man is via aerosol from rodent urine, saliva and faeces. Although HFRS occurs with the same clinical picture in children as in adults both incidence rates and antibody prevalence rates are very low in children under 10 years.

A genus-reactive oligonucleotide primer pair, flanking a 365 bp region of the G2 glycoprotein gene, was chosen for genus-reactive PCR. DNA products were digested with 20 restriction endonucleases and cleavage patterns were analysed. For strains of known sequence, the restriction patterns observed were consistent with those predicted from sequence data, demonstrating that the amplified products originated from target virus RNA. Further analyses suggested that all amplified viruses could be easily typed into one of five restriction patterns using only five enzymes. The categories identified by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified cDNA corresponded with serogroups established by plaque-reduction neutralization tests.

Analysis of the immune structure of the population revealed that the share of immune males was higher than that of immune females, but the difference was less than the difference between males and females among the registered HFRS patients. Among children immune persons were almost completely absent. The immune stratum increased rather slowly among persons under 40 years, and only from this age the considerable increase of the immune stratum was observed (up to 16.2%). High risk groups included persons of such professions as forestry workers, truck and tractor drivers, oil workers and prospectors, livestock breeders, builders. These data may be used for the formation of groups to be vaccinated against HFRS in foci with different degrees of activity.

These liver biopsy specimens were examined with immunofluorescence assay and cell cultural technique, showing the presence of active viral replication in liver cells. Electron microscopy observation of the infected liver cells showed that ultrastructural distortions was accompanied by the existence of inclusion bodies of EHF virus in vacuoles of rough endoplasmic reticulum, endotheliocyte and microvilli.

1381818,Detection of activated platelets using activation-dependent monoclonal antibody (SZ-51) in clinical disorders.,"Platelets may become activated in a number of clinical disorders and participate in thrombus formation. A direct test for activated platelets in whole blood has been developed by radioimmunoassay with 125I labelled SZ-51, an antibody specific for an alpha-granule membrane protein (GMP-140) that associates with the platelet surface during secretion. The assay with sufficient sensitivity can be applied satisfactorily to detect as few as 2% activated platelets. In 50 normal subjects, minimal GMP-140 molecules per platelet were expressed on the surface of circulating platelets. The expression of GMP-140 molecules was increased transiently in 10 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, especially at the end of bypass. Evaluation of 18 patients with epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) showed that the number of GMP-140 molecules on the platelet surface increased significantly, particularly at the shock phase, and closely related to the four different phases of EHF. In 9 patients suffered from acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the number of GMP-140 molecules changed with the procession of AMI and the highest occurred at the 48th h after AMI. The GMP-140 molecules were also increased in patients with asthma attack (n = 14), but not in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 11). Considered together, these results suggest that activated platelets can be measured reliably in whole blood using radiolabeled SZ-51 antibody and the detection of activated platelets is potentially useful in identifying patients with certain thrombotic disorders.","['Wu G', 'Li F', 'Li P', 'Li J', 'Ruan C']",1992,34,1,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol (1978),"Wu G, et al.

Among high risk subjects in the Rome area, Hantaan antibody was found in mammalogists (10%) and dialysis patients (6%), while none of the trappers, oarsmen, river policemen and firemen studied tested positive for antibodies to hantaviruses. In occupationally-exposed subjects (farmers, rangers, lumbermen, hunters) from rural and densely forested areas of northern Italian regions, the prevalence of Hantaan antibody ranged from 3.3% to 8.8%. In the positive cases the comparative antibody titration using different hantaviruses showed a predominance of Hantaan virus (titer 1:128) compared to Puumala virus (titer 1:32); no reactivity was observed with Seoul or Prospect Hill viruses. In Rome, leptospiral antibodies were found in trappers (21%) and oarsmen (5%) at a titer of 1:50 or more, with a predominance for the L. icterohaemorrhagiae serotype (85%). In the Alpine areas the leptospiral antibody prevalence was 12% and L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. bratislava were the predominant serotypes. The presence of hantavirus infections, suspected after the first epidemiological survey conducted in central Italy, is now supported by the new data obtained in northern Italian regions. Furthermore, the recent observation of one case of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in the Udine area, not far from the Yugoslavian border, strongly confirms the presence of one or more hantaviruses in Italy.","['Nuti M', 'Amaddeo D', 'Autorino GL', 'Crovatto M', 'Crucil C', 'Ghionni A', 'Giommi M', 'Salvati F', 'Santini GF']",1992,8,1,Eur J Epidemiol,"Nuti M, et al.

A monovalent GHKC vaccine (lot 88-17) was prepared with L99 strain of the rat-type hantavirus, adapted in suckling mouse brain, cultivated in GHKC, and inactivated with 0.025% formalin, and a preliminary trial of the vaccine was carried out in a small number of human volunteers with the approval of the Ministry of Public Health, PRC, in order to identify safety and antibody response of the vaccine. Three inoculations were made on days 0, 7 and 28 respectively, by the intramuscular route with 1 ml vaccine each time for every volunteer. No obvious side effect was observed in vaccinees within 3 days after each inoculation. All 12 vaccinees (10 received three inoculations, and two received two inoculations of the vaccine) showed positive seroconversion of IgG antibody (by IFAT and ELISA) and neutralizing antibody (by enzyme focus reduction neutralization test, EFRNT), and 10 of them were still seropositive 180 and 360 days after the first inoculation. These results suggest that this vaccine would be safe for human use, and could effectively induce IgG and neutralizing antibody responses.","['Song G', 'Huang YC', 'Hang CS', 'Hao FY', 'Li DX', 'Zheng XL', 'Liu WM', 'Li SL', 'Huo ZW', 'Huei LJ']",1992,10,4,Vaccine,"Song G, et al.

In the single recombinant, the M segment was placed under control of the vaccinia virus 7.5 kDa promoter. In the double recombinant, the M and S segments were placed under control of the vaccinia virus 7.5 kDa and 11 kDa promoters, respectively. An immunoplaque assay technique was developed to select recombinants without the need for expression of irrelevant genes or use of potential mutagens. Proteins indistinguishable from authentic viral envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid protein were observed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Hantaan virus.

1346088,Identification of Hantaan virus-related structures in kidneys of cadavers with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"The etiologic agent of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Hantaan virus, was first isolated in 1976. Since then numerous Hantaan-like viruses have been isolated and five serotypes of Hantavirus have been recognized. Serological studies indicate that these viruses are globally distributed, with each serotype occurring in specific areas. Hantaan virus has been intensively studied antigenically, biochemically, and genetically. However there is still a paucity of information on the pathogenesis of Hantaan virus in the human host. In this paper, we report the detection by thin section immune electron microscopy of the occurrence of numerous dense precipitates, typical inclusion bodies, a surface antigen layer, as well as Hantaan virion-like structures in the kidneys of patients that died during the acute phase of HFRS. These findings may shed some light on understanding the pathogenesis of HFRS in target organs most affected by the disease, such as the kidneys.","['Hung T', 'Zhou JY', 'Tang YM', 'Zhao TX', 'Baek LJ', 'Lee HW']",1992,122,1-2,Arch Virol,"Hung T, et al.

There was marked thrombocytopenia (minimal level of 48,000/microliters), moderate anaemia and a slow rise in serum lipase concentration to maximally 1352 U/l. Marked sinus bradycardia (to as low as 34 beats/min) occurred in the further course of the disease, as well as upper abdominal pain (endoscopically diagnosed as antral gastritis), subileus and splenomegaly. Two haemodialysis treatments were needed because of acute renal failure. An IgG antibody titre of 1:512 and an IgM titre of 1:80 against hantavirus antigen confirmed that this virus was responsible for the haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. This infection, transmitted by wild rodents and frequently observed in Asian countries, has a rising incidence in Central Europe.

The clinical course was divided into two parts: the febrile stage and the polyuria stage. Symptoms such as lumbago, muscular pain, general malaise and anorexia disappeared along with a fall of fever. The incubation period of this disease was estimated to be about three weeks. Polyuria, proteinuria, gastric complication and impairment of liver function seemed to be some of clinical features of this disease. There was no HFRS patient with severe renal failure in our cases. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was confirmed in 3 of these 11 cases. Therefore, it was suggested that hemorrhagic tendency of this disease might be attributed to DIC. From our experiences, the most important factor for the treatment of the severe case was the earliest detection whether they were complicated by DIC or not. If they were suspected of DIC, it could be necessary to start treatment for DIC as soon as possible. Prophylactic measures for HFRS in our animal facility could contribute to the prevention of this disease.","['Takeuchi T', 'Yamamoto T', 'Itoh M', 'Tsukada K', 'Yasue N', 'Lee HW']",1991,35,,Kidney Int Suppl,"Takeuchi T, et al.

The authors collected 80 biopsies from 65 patients taken after the onset of NE from various hospital files in Finland. Light microscopic, morphometric, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical methods were applied in studying these samples. There was slight tubular dilatation and interstitial edema best evidenced during the first month after the onset of the disease. There was limited electron microscopic evidence of endothelial cell damage or reaction, also in the glomeruli. Occasional tubular necrotic cells or mitoses were found. About half of the cases were positive for IgG or IgM, and C3 and fibrin in the tubular basement membrane. Samples of the recovery phase showed interstitial fibrosis. Medullary interstitial hemorrhages were seen in 60% of samples of the first two weeks after onset. Interstitial inflammatory changes were diffuse in the early phases and often focal thereafter. During the first two weeks there was congestion and mild hypercellularity of the glomeruli. There was also slight prominence of mesangium, and evidence of endothelial cell damage or reaction. Osmiophilic glomerular deposits were scanty. Focal immunoglobulin (usually IgG) and complement deposits were present in the glomeruli, but less intense than in classical glomerulonephritis. Without medullary hemorrhages in the biopsy, the suggestive diagnosis could rest on interstitial edema, diffuse but sparse inflammatory infiltrate, dilatation of occasional tubules, changes suggestive of tubular cell death, and congestion and slight hypercellularity of the glomeruli.","['Collan Y', 'Mihatsch MJ', 'Lähdevirta J', 'Jokinen EJ', 'Romppanen T', 'Jantunen E']",1991,35,,Kidney Int Suppl,"Collan Y, et al.

Serodiagnosis of NE relies on conventional indirect immunofluorescence to detect IgG against Puumala virus. However, in conventional serology, most patients with acute NE have raised but stable non-diagnostic antibody titres. For better serodiagnosis of NE, we have developed a test that measures the avidity (functional affinity) of IgG antibodies against Puumala virus. This new assay was highly specific and sensitive; a diagnosis of NE could be confirmed or excluded rapidly from an early single serum sample. With this test we have now verified the diagnosis of NE in more than 1300 Finnish patients during 22 months in 1989-91.

1684621,Antibodies to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses in a barrier island white-tailed deer population.,"From 1981 through 1989, serum samples from 855 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from Ossabaw Island, Georgia (USA), were tested for antibodies to bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). During this period, prevalence of precipitating antibodies to BTV and EHDV as determined by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests decreased from 74% to 3% and from 34% to 1%, respectively. Antibodies were detected in serum samples from 0.5-yr-old deer only during 1981, 1982, and 1983, and with few exceptions, positive serological results after 1983 were restricted to older age classes. A decrease in prevalence of precipitating antibodies to BTV and EHDV in age classes exposed during 1981 indicates that AGID results from white-tailed deer populations underestimate the extent of previous exposure to these viruses. Serum neutralization test results from AGID-positive deer indicated that BTV 11 was the principal serotype responsible for infections during 1981. Since 1983, this serotype has been replaced by BTV 13; however, there has been a low level of transmission within the herd. Infection with EHDV 2 appeared most prevalent during 1982; as with BTV 13, there has been limited transmission in this high density deer population since 1983.","['Stallknecht DE', 'Kellogg ML', 'Blue JL', 'Pearson JE']",1991,27,4,J Wildl Dis,"Stallknecht DE, et al.

1688294,[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia: incidence of infection in human and wild animal reservoirs].,"On the territory of Lika and Gorski Kotar a group of 300 forest workers and 260 persons from the general population were screened for Hantavirus antibodies (by the indirect immunofluorescence test). In the first group of examenees a mean of 1.6% were found positive, ranging from 0% (Gospić) to 3.2% (Ogulin). In the second groups a mean of 5.4% were positive, ranging from 4.4 to 8.9% (Delnice and Slunj, respectively). It is concluded that the Hantavirus infection rate in our natural foci of HFRS is higher than officially registered. Screening of micromammals for the presence of Hantavirus in their organs (lungs), using the direct immunofluorescence test, was undertaken on three locations: Planina Gornja (hillsides of the mountain Medvednica), a case of HFRS having been registered there previously, and Plitvicka Jezera and Velika Gorica (village of Kobilić) selected because of two previous epidemics of HFRS (1967 and 1989, respectively). On the first location, all 126 animals examined (10 different species) were Hantavirus negative. On the second location, 9 of the 165 animals examined (three species) were Hantavirus positive (5.4%), namely 6 bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and three yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis). On the third location, where 141 animals was caught and examined (7 different species), 7 animals were positive (4.9%): 3 striped field mice (A. agrarius), 3 wood mice (A. sylvaticus) and 1 bank vole (Cl. glareolus). The findings suggest that in our natural foci of HFRS the circulation of the Hantavirus is sustained by several species of micromammals.","['Borcić B', 'Turković B', 'Aleraj B', 'Tvrtković N']",1991,113,9-10,Lijec Vjesn,"Borcić B, et al.

It was found that HFRSV might infect different subpopulations of lymphocytes. The infection rate of B cells (31.3%) was significantly higher than that of T cells (8.5%), and the infection rate of CD8+ subpopulation (10.5%) was significantly higher than that of CD4+ subpopulation (6.1%). The infection rates of HLA-DR+ cells and Tac+ cells were 2.5% and less than 0.5%, respectively. From febrile to oliguric stage, the number of CD8+ cells increased gradually, leading to a decrease and reverse of CD4/CD8 ratio, while the number of CD4+ cells remained almost unchanged. The appearance and disappearance of HFRSV in lymphocytes were closely associated with the dynamic changes of CD4/CD8 ratio and HLA-DR and Tac expressions. The results suggested that there were certain differences in HFRSV infectivity of different lymphocyte subpopulations, which might be due to the disorders of immunoregulation and immunopathology of HFRS.","['Tang YM', 'Yang WS', 'Zhang WB', 'Bai XF']",1991,104,8,Chin Med J (Engl),"Tang YM, et al.

The clinical picture of NE in Scandinavia is similar to that of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in other parts of the world, although NE generally has a milder course. The case-fatality rate is approximately 0.2%. The most common clinical findings in NE are an acute onset of symptoms, fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C), oliguria, headache, back pain, and polyuria. Hemorrhagic manifestations are seen in about one-third of cases, and up to 5% of patients have gastrointestinal bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

SETTING: General hospital, Twente area.
PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective selection of patients, hospitalised between 1970 and 1989 with renal failure due to biopsy-proven or clinically probable acute interstitial nephritis of unknown aetiology. Sera from the acute phase of the disease, if still available, or sera taken in 1989 were tested for anti-Hantavirus antibodies. Red bank voles, trapped in the area were tested for Hantaviral antigen and specific antibodies.
RESULTS: Out of 12 patients, 10 could be investigated. Anti-Hantavirus antibodies were detected in 5 patients. All patients had very probably acquired the infection in the Twente area. In 4 of 10 red bank voles Hantaviral antigen and specific antibodies were found.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that Hantavirus infections have been occurring in this area over a long period of time and are underdiagnosed.","['Jordans JG', 'Groen J', 'Clement J', 'Lefevre A', 'Haraldsdòttir V', 'Osterhaus AD']",1991,135,18,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Jordans JG, et al.

A more rapid but equally specific method is needed. We used a reverse transcriptase-directed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect hantavirus genomic sequences and compared its sensitivity with conventional virus isolation. RNA, extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method from hantavirus-infected Vero E6 cells and from tissues of infant mice inoculated intracerebrally with 100 LD50 of hantavirus, was initially reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The resulting complementary DNA (cDNA) was used as template to amplify the glycoprotein 2-encoding region of the hantavirus M segment. With this method, Vero E6 cell cultures infected with Hantaan virus strains 76-118 (prototype) and HV114 (an isolate from the urine of an HFRS patient in China) were positive, while control cultures were negative. Brain, lung, and heart tissues from hantavirus-infected mice were positive by RT-PCR at 5, 8, and 11 days after intracerebral inoculation. The specificity of the positive results was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion of the amplified fragments with AluI and HpaI. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR was equal to cell culture amplification but required less time. This method is being adapted for detection of hantavirus genomic sequences in clinical specimens and postmortem tissues from patients with HFRS.","['Xiao SY', 'Yanagihara R', 'Godec MS', 'Eldadah ZA', 'Johnson BK', 'Gajdusek DC', 'Asher DM']",1991,33,4,J Med Virol,"Xiao SY, et al.

The complete HTV and NEV nucleocapsid proteins and two truncated versions of the NEV nucleocapsid proteins were expressed as fusion proteins. Unexpectedly, all products accumulated as insoluble aggregates. Most of the ompA signal peptide remained uncleaved. However, nucleocapsid fusion proteins could be purified from the insoluble fraction by extraction with 8 M urea followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Rabbits were immunized with the eluted proteins and the resulting antibodies reacted specifically with authentic viral nucleocapsid proteins of HTV and NEV. The recombinant nucleocapsid proteins were found to react specifically with various hantavirus-immune sera, but not with human control sera, indicating their suitability as potential diagnostic antigens.

1673261,Mechanisms of disease in Hantavirus infection: pathophysiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia. Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome. The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality. The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability. The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure. Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis. Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets. Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients. Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS.",['Cosgriff TM'],1991,13,1,Rev Infect Dis,Cosgriff TM.

1982474,[Spontaneous rupture of the kidneys in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"During the recent 5 years we had 29 patients with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome complicated by a spontaneous kidney rupture. This complication occurred during an anuric period in 18 patients and within the first 24 hours of restored diuresis in 11 patients. Major clinical presentations of the kidney rupture were deterioration of lumbar and abdominal pains, meteorism and symptoms of an internal bleeding. Palpation revealed hematoma at the site of the ruptured kidney, tension of the anterior abdominal wall and symptomatic peritoneal irritation. Diagnosis of spontaneous kidney rupture in hemorrhagic fever with the renal syndrome (HFRS) relies on clinical, laboratory and ultrasound studies. Additional studies are plain urography and retroperitoneal diagnostic puncture of the affected site. Conservative therapy was given to 11 patients with erythrocyte counts of 3 x 10(12)/l or higher. The treatment was operative in 18 patients. Indications for surgery were progressive anemia, a palpable retroperitoneal hematoma and symptomatic peritoneal irritation. All patients underwent evacuation of blood clots and ligation of the renal ruptures. In the authors' opinion, renal decapsulation and pyelostomy are useful in this condition. Bilateral involvement and severe renal failure are contraindications for nephrectomy in HFRS. It may be used only as a last resort in life-threatening bleeding.","['Valiakhmetov RZ', 'Gafarov AI', 'Memkhes VS', 'Galimzianov VZ']",1990,,6,Urol Nefrol (Mosk),"Valiakhmetov RZ, et al.

1982371,Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: evaluation of ELISA for detection of Puumala-virus-specific IgG and IgM.,"IgM and IgG ELISA to Puumala virus were evaluated using sera from patients with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) from different geographical regions: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and the European USSR. IgM ELISA proved useful in the diagnosis of HFRS in patients from all the regions mentioned above. Specific IgM could be detected as early as day 1 post onset of disease, and patients remained IgM-positive for several months. Specific IgG ELISA antibodies were also frequently detected in acute sera, and acute-convalescent serum pairs often failed to show a significant titre rise or increase in optical density (OD) values. This limits the use of IgG ELISA in patient diagnosis. Sera collected 2 years after infection revealed higher IgG ELISA OD readings than convalescent sera, and very high values were still detectable 10 to 20 years postinfection. IgG ELISA is therefore useful for the testing of immunity and in seroepidemiological studies. Acute and convalescent sera from HFRS patients in Korea and the Asian USSR showed no or only very weak reactivity in the Puumala virus IgG and IgM ELISA. These results are consistent with the ""one-way"" crossing described earlier.","['Niklasson B', 'Tkachenko E', 'Ivanov AP', 'van der Groen G', 'Wiger D', 'Andersen HK', 'LeDuc J', 'Kjelsson T', 'Nyström K']",1990,141,6,Res Virol,"Niklasson B, et al.

These sera were tested for IgM- and IgG-specific antibodies to Hantaan virus by enzyme immunoassay and for hantaviral antigen by immunoassay; one serum from each patient was tested by plaque reduction neutralization using both Hantaan and Seoul viruses. Only 15 patients failed to develop antihantaviral antibodies; most sera contained high titered IgM antibody on admission, and all were IgM-seropositive by day 7 after onset. Attempts to detect hantaviral antigen were unsuccessful. All seropositive patients had highest plaque reduction neutralization titers to Hantaan virus, suggesting that this virus was responsible for the disease seen. These results confirm that hemorrhagic fever of the Korean Conflict was due to Hantaan virus and demonstrate that measurement of specific IgM antibody is the method of choice for diagnosis of acute disease.","['LeDuc JW', 'Ksiazek TG', 'Rossi CA', 'Dalrymple JM']",1990,162,5,J Infect Dis,"LeDuc JW, et al.

Alberta between January 1982 and December 1988 was undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal manifestations of the syndrome. The children (mean age of 4.0 +/- 3.1 years) presented primarily during the summer months with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (Hgb 94 +/- 26 g/L), thrombocytopenia (platelets 87 +/- 83 X 10(9)/L), and acute renal failure (oligoanuria with a BUN of 26 +/- 15 mmol/L, and a creatinine of 294 +/- 90 mumol/L). Forty-three children required dialysis for 10 +/- 17 days. The duration of hospitalization was 17 +/- 17 days. Four children died of complications attributable to HUS. The following symptoms and gastrointestinal manifestations of HUS were noted: fever (33%), vomiting (80%), abdominal discomfort/tenderness (59%), diarrhea (100%), hemorrhagic colitis (79%), rectal prolapse (13%), colonic stricture (3%), colonic perforation (1%), intussusception (1%), indirect hyperbilirubinemia (49%), and elevated hepatocellular enzymes (58%). Of the last 29 children studied, 19 (66%) had elevated levels of amylase and lipase in the presence of acute renal failure, and six (21%) had a marked elevation of lipase (more than four times normal) with additional supportive evidence of pancreatitis. The additional supportive evidence included persistent elevation of lipase after the resolution of acute renal failure in four children, a marked increment in lipase in association with abdominal pain and an abnormal ultrasound of the pancreas after the initiation of oral feeding in a fifth child, and pancreatic exocrine and endocrine necrosis at autopsy in a sixth child.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Grodinsky S', 'Telmesani A', 'Robson WL', 'Fick G', 'Scott RB']",1990,11,4,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Grodinsky S, et al.

1974404,The protean manifestations of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. A retrospective review of 26 cases from Korea.,"Twenty-six cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from 1981 to 1986 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the scope of clinical presentation and the unique complications of the illness. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of Hantaan virus antibody in 25 cases and by characteristic autopsy findings in 1 case. The illness could be classified into three distinct clinical subgroups. Fever was universally present. Two patients presented with intractable shock and diffuse hemorrhage and died within 6 days from multi-organ system failure, mimicking the clinical picture of overwhelming sepsis. Eighteen patients presented with acute renal failure with an illness lasting a mean of 21 days (range, 10 to 36 days). Resolution of thrombocytopenia heralded recovery of renal function. At discharge, the serum creatinine level was normal in 13 patients; 5 patients had evidence of minimal renal dysfunction. Acute pulmonary edema requiring hemodialysis and retroperitoneal hemorrhage were the major complications in this subgroup. Six patients had an undifferentiated febrile illness with normal renal function. Fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal urinalysis, hypertransaminasemia, and a benign clinical course characterized the third clinical pattern. The recent availability of serodiagnostic methods to detect Hantavirus group antibody facilitates the diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Application of this test in the described clinical settings will identify unsuspected cases, broaden the knowledge of the geographic distribution of Hantavirus infection, and increase physician awareness of its protean manifestations.","['Bruno P', 'Hassell LH', 'Brown J', 'Tanner W', 'Lau A']",1990,113,5,Ann Intern Med,"Bruno P, et al.

Expression of the complete S or M segments yielded proteins electrophoretically indistinguishable from Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein or envelope glycoproteins (G1 and G2), and expression of portions of the M segment, encoding either G1 or G2 alone, similarly yielded proteins which closely resembled authentic Hantaan virus proteins. The expressed envelope proteins retained all antigenic sites defined by a panel of monoclonal antibodies to Hantaan virus G1 and G2 and elicited antibodies in animals which reacted with authentic viral proteins. A Hantaan virus infectivity challenge model in hamsters was used to assay induction of protective immunity by the recombinant-expressed proteins. Recombinants expressing both G1 and G2 induced higher titer antibody responses than those expressing only G1 or G2 and protected most animals from infection with Hantaan virus. Baculovirus recombinants expressing only nucleocapsid protein also appeared to protect some animals from challenge. Passively transferred neutralizing monoclonal antibodies similarly prevented infection, suggesting that an antibody response alone is sufficient for immunity to Hantaan virus.","['Schmaljohn CS', 'Chu YK', 'Schmaljohn AL', 'Dalrymple JM']",1990,64,7,J Virol,"Schmaljohn CS, et al.

No subclinical infections were identified through a post-deployment screen of sera obtained from 2,053 exercise participants. Analysis of questionnaires identified no environmental, occupational, or temporal factors as risks for developing disease. However, 13 of the 14 cases occurred among individuals housed at 1 of the 2 base camps used during the exercise. This outbreak represents the largest cluster of HFRS cases among U.S. personnel in the Republic of Korea since the Korean conflict.","['Pon E', 'McKee KT', 'Diniega BM', 'Merrell B', 'Corwin A', 'Ksiazek TG']",1990,42,6,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Pon E, et al.

1976488,Isolation of a strain of Hantaan virus from peritoneal exudate cells of a patient with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"A new strain of Hantaan virus (HTNV), GH716, was isolated from the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of a patient with severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The isolate was propagated in Vero E6 cells. At each passage the virus-infected cells were examined for HTNV with immunofluorescence technique using monoclonal antibodies (McAb) 25-1 and 84-1 against HTNV. From passage 5 on, fluorescent intensity tended to stabilize at (+++) and infectivity titer reached 10(5) TCID50/ml. Using 14 McAb to 76-118 and BI strains of HTNV, we found that strain GH716 was antigenically similar to strain 76-118 (Apodemus type) and different from strain R22 (Rattus type), suggesting that GH716 may fall into the Apodemus type of HTNV. This is the first isolation of an HTNV from human PEC collected on the tenth day of illness. The successful isolation of strain GH716 may provide an alternative source of obtaining HTNV during the later stages of HFRS.","['Gu XS', 'Song ZB', 'Jin ZW', 'Meng GR', 'Zhang CA', 'Yan DY', 'Gu T', 'Yang SQ', 'He JR', 'Luo FJ']",1990,103,6,Chin Med J (Engl),"Gu XS, et al.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of renal assessment with MR imaging in HFRS. Three MR imaging studies were done while patients were in the oliguric phase, 19 were done during the diuretic phase, and three were done during the convalescent phase. The authors differentiated the cortex and the medulla in all 21 T1-weighted examinations and all 25 T2-weighted examinations. Seven T1-weighted examinations (33%) and 20 T2-weighted examinations (80%) showed low signal intensity along the outer portion of the medulla, which thus enabled differentiation from the inner medulla. Low signal intensity along the medulla (especially the outer medulla) on T2-weighted images, possibly representing medullary hemorrhage, is fairly constant and characteristic on MR images of the kidneys in patients with HFRS.","['Kim SH', 'Kim S', 'Lee JS', 'Choi BI', 'Kim YG', 'Han JS', 'Park JH', 'Han MC', 'Kim CW']",1990,175,3,Radiology,"Kim SH, et al.

Three antigenically distinct hantaviruses have been isolated from Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Microtus pennsylvanicus captured in the United States, and serologic evidence of a hantavirus enzootic has been found in several other indigenous rodent species. In residential districts of port cities such as Baltimore, nearly 50% of Norway rats are infected with viruses that are serologically indistinguishable from disease-causing Hantavirus strains isolated from rats in the Far East. Despite the widespread distribution of Hantavirus-infected rodents, confirmed cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have not been recognized in the United States. Moreover, the overall risk of hantavirus infection in humans in the United States is low, even among individuals who have frequent exposure to commensal and wild rodents. Studies are needed to define the clinical spectrum of hantavirus infection in humans in the United States.",['Yanagihara R'],1990,12,3,Rev Infect Dis,Yanagihara R.

1970443,Coding properties of the S and the M genome segments of Sapporo rat virus: comparison to other causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Three serologically distinct groups of hantaviruses have been associated with severe, moderate, and mild forms of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). To gain a better understanding of the genetic variation among these viruses, we cloned and sequenced the M and the S genome segments of Sapporo rat virus, an etiologic agent of moderate HFRS, and compared the predicted gene products to those of Hantaan virus, and the Hällnäs strain of Puumala virus, which are etiologic agents of severe and mild HFRS, respectively. The SR-11 S segment consisted of 1769 nucleotides and had an open reading frame (ORF) in the virus-complementary sense RNA with a coding capacity of 429 amino acids. Deduced amino acids from the SR-11 S segment ORF displayed 83% homology with those of Hantaan nucleocapsid (N) protein. Comparison of the S segment ORFs of all three viruses revealed 58% homology. No evidence for additional nonstructural protein(s) encoded by the SR-11 S segment was obtained. The SR-11 M segment consisted of 3651 nucleotides and had an ORF in the virus-complementary sense RNA with a coding capacity of 1134 amino acids. Amino acid sequences predicted from the SR-11 M segment ORF were 75% homologous with those encoding Hantaan G1 and G2 envelope glycoproteins. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the M segment ORFs of SR-11, Hantaan, and Hällnäs viruses revealed a 43% homology for amino acids constituting the G1 proteins and a 55% homology for amino acids constituting the G2 proteins of the three viruses. The envelope proteins of SR-11 virus were localized within the M segment ORF by amino-terminal sequence analysis of purified G1 and G2. G1 initiated at amino acid 17 and G2 at amino acid 647 within the ORF. Five potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the SR-11 G1 coding sequences, four of which were conserved between Hantaan and SR-11 viruses and three of which were conserved among all three viruses. One potential glycosylation site was identified in the SR-11 G2 coding sequences and was conserved among Hantaan, SR-11 and Hällnäs viruses. Cysteine residues were highly conserved within the M segment ORFs of all three viruses, suggesting a similar structure and function of the G1 and G2 proteins.","['Arikawa J', 'Lapenotiere HF', 'Iacono-Connors L', 'Wang ML', 'Schmaljohn CS']",1990,176,1,Virology,"Arikawa J, et al.

1969457,Glomerular filtration rate and tubular involvement during acute disease and convalescence in patients with nephropathia epidemica.,"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular involvement were studied in 74 patients with serologically verified nephropathia epidemica (NE). Increased levels of serum creatinine and serum beta 2-microglobulin were documented in 96% and 99% of the patients, respectively. The mean of the lowest estimated GFR was 26 ml/min. Proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity was assessed by urinary loss of beta 2-microglobulin and cell damage by urinary activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Both of these parameters were elevated in most of the patients during the acute phase of the disease. Increased serum levels of Tamm-Horsfall-specific IgG and/or IgA occurred in 72 of 74 patients. No patient required dialysis and there was no mortality. Six months after discharge only three patients had a GFR less than 80 ml/min as estimated by [51Cr]EDTA clearance; two of these had underlying chronic diseases and one had suffered clinically severe NE. Desmopressin tests showed decreased urine osmolarity in three patients 8 months after discharge. These three had chronic diseases, which may have contributed to the impaired tubular function. Thus, there was a markedly decreased GFR and a tubular dysfunction in the acute phase of NE. Most patients recovered within a few months and none showed evidence of chronically impaired renal function due to NE.","['Settergren B', 'Trollfors B', 'Fasth A', 'Hultberg B', 'Norrby SR']",1990,161,4,J Infect Dis,"Settergren B, et al.

It was found that the levels plasma TXB2 significantly increased and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha decreased in EHF patients as compared with those in controls. The more severe the patient's condition, the higher the level of TXB2 and the lower the level of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The ratio of TXB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha was parallel with the severity of the patient's condition. Plasma TXB and TXB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha ratio increased significantly in the hemorrhagic and shock group, while 6-keto-PGF1 alpha decreased significantly in the shock group.

1967859,[Nephropathia epidemica. Hantavirus and acute renal insufficiency].,"Puumala virus belongs to the hantavirus group and as other members of the group it can cause acute renal insufficiency. Other hantaviruses are responsible for Korean hemorrhagic fever and other hemorrhagic fevers with renal involvement. In Scandinavia, hantavirus nephropathy is better known as nephropathia epidemica. Hantavirus cause asymptomatic infections in mice and rats and the virus is thought to be transmitted to man via inhalation of desicated saliva, urine or feces from infected animals. In the other Nordic countries, the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the commonest natural host. Laboratory infections from rats have been reported from all over the world. The disease presents with fever, back and/or abdominal pain, acute renal insufficiency and a bleeding tendency. The latter is usual less pronounced in the European than in the Asian forms of hantavirus infection. The disease is commoner in men and is endemic in forested areas. The greatest incidence is seen in those years when the numbers of mice are greatest. The mortality in nephropathia epidemica appears to be less than 0.5% in contrast to a mortality of about 10% in Korean hemorrhagic fever. Diagnosis is made by demonstration of a significant increase in antibody titer to hantavirus. Treatment is symptomatic and consists primarily of restitution of fluid and electrolyte balance, at times with dialysis. After recovery from hantavirus infection renal function returns to normal. The incidence and prevalence of nephropathia epidemica in Denmark are unknown. The first two cases of Puumala virus infection in Denmark are reported.","['Foged N', 'Spencer ES', 'Andersen HK']",1990,152,2,Ugeskr Laeger,"Foged N, et al. [Nephropathia epidemica.

2392837,The frequency characteristics of accommodative microfluctuations for central and peripheral zones of the human crystalline lens.,"Temporal variations in the nominally steady-state accommodation response can be characterized approximately by two principal regions of dominant activity: a low frequency region (LFR less than 0.6 Hz) and a high frequency region (HFR greater than 1.0 Hz). The observed changes of activity in the LFR induced by varying stimulus conditions has led to the proposal that this region may be utilized as an error detector in the accommodation feed-back loop. The role of fluctuations in the HFR is, however, equivocal particularly as several reports have shown their magnitude to be positively correlated with pupil size. The implication is that HFRs are a consequence of the mechanical and elastic properties of peripheral rather than central zones of the crystalline lens and hence do not contribute to the accommodation control process. The aim of the study was to compare the incidence and magnitude of microfluctuations in LFRs and HFRs for central and peripheral lens zones when viewing a near target. Accommodation was measured continuously with a modified Canon Autoref R1 infra-red optometer on five young emmetropic subjects. We show that although the total power of the microfluctuations is reduced in the periphery, the form of the power spectra is similar for central and peripheral zones. Thus rather than being spurious effects caused by the periphery of the lens HFRs are present for both central and peripheral lens zones.","['Winn B', 'Pugh JR', 'Gilmartin B', 'Owens H']",1990,30,7,Vision Res,"Winn B, et al.

In all the disease periods, the majority of the patients (n-52) demonstrated a rise of vascular permeability for protein and liquid part of the plasma, with this being marked in particular in the oligoanuric period. Besides, significant perivascular and intravascular changes in microcirculation were noted in the oligoanuric and polyuric disease periods. It was established during examination of biologically active substances that the greatest shifts were experienced by the kinin system. Sometimes the content of kallikrein surpassed the control values more than 7-fold. Less pronounced changes were seen in blood plasma serotonin and histamine. A direct correlation was established between vascular permeability, microcirculation and the content of all biologically active substances explored by the authors. The strongest correlation was found to exist between the above parameters and the kinin system of blood plasma.","['Fedorchenko IuL', 'Sirotin BZ', 'Rozhkovskaia EN']",1990,62,6,Ter Arkh,"Fedorchenko IuL, et al.

It was revealed that within the first year after the disease onset, 37.5 per cent of patients had increased levels of sodium excretion as part of the salt-loss syndrome developed due to decreased sodium reabsorption in the distal part of the nephron. Later the status was featured by moderately pronounced disorders of distal sodium reabsorption in 6.25 per cent of the patients only, mostly in those with HFRS-induced pyelonephritis. Increased excretion of potassium noted in the first months after HFRS only was the result of an increase in sodium excretion.

HV cl-1 increased the mortality of the mice whereas HV cl-2 did not. Furthermore, virus of high titre was isolated from various organs of mice infected with HV cl-1 and high titres were maintained, whereas after infection with HV cl-2, virus was isolated from various organs only in low titre and only temporarily. HV cl-1 strongly induced cell-to-cell fusion, but the cell fusion activity was at a minimum level in cells infected with HV cl-2. However these two clones induced similar titres of antibodies in mice. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays against macrophages infected with homologous and heterologous virus showed that cytotoxic T cell activity was induced in mice infected with HV cl-2, but suppressed in mice infected with HV cl-1. These results suggest that an alteration in the cell fusion function and the cytotoxic T cell activity are important in the pathogenesis of Hantaan virus infection in newborn mice.","['Tamura M', 'Asada H', 'Kondo K', 'Tanishita O', 'Kurata T', 'Yamanishi K']",1989,70 ( Pt 11),,J Gen Virol,"Tamura M, et al.

Expansion of a world-wide zoonosis.,"We report the clinical, biological and serological characteristics of 76 cases of Hantavirus-induced acute interstitial nephritis diagnosed in Belgium and France between 1977 and 1986. The disease is characterized by a fever of sudden onset promptly accompanied by pain in the loin or abdomen, nausea and vomiting, myalgias and occasionally with acute myopia and conjunctival injection. Within a week acute renal failure develops, necessitating haemo- or peritoneal dialysis in up to 10 per cent of patients. Transient proteinuria, microscopic haematuria and leukocyturia are observed simultaneously. Thrombocytopenia and mild elevations of hepatic enzymes, LDH and CPK, as well as biological signs of acute inflammatory reaction are observed, lasting for a few days. Spontaneous complete recovery is the rule. This picture is virtually identical with that of nephropathia epidemica, a Hantavirus nephropathy observed in northern Europe. This conclusion is supported by the observation of elevated antibody titres against the Puumala virus, the agent of nephropathia epidemica. This rodent-borne infection is markedly milder than that caused by other Hantaviruses such as the Hantaan or the Seoul virus in Asia. Acute interstitial disease due to Hantavirus should be included in the differential diagnosis of febrile acute renal failure.","['van Ypersele de Strihou C', 'Méry JP']",1989,73,270,Q J Med,van Ypersele de Strihou C and Méry JP.

Virus isolates were more readily recovered from plasma early in the course of the illness and less frequently after day 7. The use of PBMCs rather than plasma enabled isolates to be recovered at a rate nearly twice that permitted by plasma and allowed the isolation peak of HTNV (days 4-7 after onset of disease) to extend an additional 2 or 3 d, thus prolonging the period of detectable viremia until days 8-11.

Prolongation of bleeding time, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time was noted, with decreases in coagulation factors II, V, VIII, IX, and X. Levels of fibrinogen were decreased, and those of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products in serum and urine were increased. Concentrations of plasminogen, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, and antithrombin III in plasma were depressed. Procoagulant activity was present in plasma. Circulating immune complexes were found, whereas serum levels of C3 were decreased. In the early stage of HFRS, thrombocytopenia, defects in platelet function, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may play central roles in the pathogenesis of bleeding manifestations. Vasculopathy and immunologic aberrations also may play a role.","['Lee M', 'Kim BK', 'Kim S', 'Park S', 'Han JS', 'Kim ST', 'Lee JS']",1989,11 Suppl 4,,Rev Infect Dis,"Lee M, et al.

2568676,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Korea.,"Several clinical variants of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are caused by Hantaan and related viruses. Since 1951, 500-900 patients with HFRS have been hospitalized annually in Korea. Although HFRS is associated primarily with rural areas, it is now being recognized as an urban problem and a particular hazard to laboratory staff using rodents for research. Recently, epidemic outbreaks of leptospirosis and scrub typhus have occurred during the HFRS season, leading to confusion in diagnosis. Serologic diagnosis of HFRS is based on the demonstration of IgM antibodies to Hantaviruses by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specific Hantavirus causing infection can be identified on the basis of titers of plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody. Results of studies with monoclonal antibodies suggest that viral subtypes exist for each Hantaviral serotype presently recognized. While infection with Hantaviruses is known to be a problem of worldwide dimensions, present evidence indicates that it occurs over a wider area than previously recognized. Vertical transmission of Hantaan virus in a pregnant woman has been documented.",['Lee HW'],1989,11 Suppl 4,,Rev Infect Dis,Lee HW. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Korea.

In human cases of Lassa fever, it significantly reduces mortality when administered before day 7 of illness to persons at high risk. In rodents and monkeys infected with Rift Valley fever virus, ribavirin therapy resulted in reduced mortality; prophylactic administration to volunteers infected with sandfly fever virus, Sicilian strain, prevented development of illness. Ribavirin increased the number of survivors and the mean time to death in suckling mice infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and in suckling mice infected with Hantaan virus. In the People's Republic of China, ribavirin significantly reduced mortality in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.

These results and our previous findings with cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) suggest that some epitopes recognized by CTLs might be common among the hantavirus genus, while the epitopes related to NT activity were mainly specific to each virus of this genus. Next, to evaluate the cross-reactive immunities demonstrated by in vitro study, we investigated the effect of transferring T lymphocytes and sera from BALB/c mice immunized with PH or Pu virus into nude mice before HV inoculation. Transferring T lymphocytes primed by PH or Pu virus reduced HV titres in lungs and spleens of nude mice, corresponding with the results of the in vitro CTL assays. Transferring anti-Pu immune serum also decreased HV titres in nude mice, which seemed to reflect complement-dependent NT activity. Moreover ICR mice previously immunized with PH or Pu virus showed resistance to challenge with a lethal dose of the HV KHF strain, indicating that cross-reactive immunity induced by PH or Pu virus could protect ICR mice against pathogenic HV infection.","['Asada H', 'Balachandra K', 'Tamura M', 'Kondo K', 'Yamanishi K']",1989,70 ( Pt 4),,J Gen Virol,"Asada H, et al.

2566711,[Pathogenesis of water-electrolyte imbalance in acute renal failure in patients with hemorrhagic fever with nephrotic syndrome].,Changes in blood plasma content of hormones which are observed in the different periods of hemorrhagic fever and the attendant renal syndrome are directed to the maintenance of significantly deranged water-electrolyte homeostasis. Adequate secretion of vasopressin and aldosterone in response to the changes in sodium concentration and plasma osmolality point to the absence of significant functional disorders of the corresponding glands. Pronounced hypernatremia in fatal cases is evidence of the deranged processes of osmoregulation associated primarily with kidney areactivity to vasopressin and prognostically is an unfavourable sign. The presence of pituitary necrosis in deceased subjects does not rule out the role of vasopressin deficiency in the pathogenesis of pronounced hypernatremia.,['Bystrovskiĭ VF'],1989,67,2,Klin Med (Mosk),Bystrovskiĭ VF.

2566619,Comparison of immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the serology of Hantaan virus infections.,"Three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems based upon different principles were developed for the serology of Hantaan virus infections and compared with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The indirect IFA was carried out with gamma-irradiated Hantaan virus-infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells fixed with ethanol (-70 degrees C) or acetone (20 degrees C) on drop slides and a FITC-coupled sheep anti-human Ig preparation. Atypical staining in the IFA was avoided by using ethanol (-70 degrees C) instead of acetone (20 degrees C) fixation. In the first ELISA ('cell-assay'), Hantaan virus-infected or uninfected Vero E6 cells were used as antigens, which after gamma-irradiation were seeded into microtiter ELISA strips. Serial dilutions of human sera were incubated and specific antibodies were demonstrated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated sheep anti-human Ig preparation. In the second ELISA ('competition-assay') an affinity-purified human Ig preparation was used as a capture antibody for Hantaan virus antigen. After incubation of serial dilutions of human sera with this coat, the reactivity of the affinity purified anti-Hantaan virus Ig coupled to HRPO was determined. In the third ELISA ('complex trapping blocking [CTB]-assay') the same capture antibody was used to react with a mixture of the antigen and serial dilutions of human sera. The reactivity with the same HRPO conjugate was then determined. The results obtained in the respective assay systems with sera from people at risk or suspected of Hantaan virus infection coincided well. The CTB-ELISA proved to be faster and more sensitive than both the other ELISA systems, without giving more non-specific reactions: it detected almost all the IFA positive samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Groen J', 'van der Groen G', 'Hoofd G', 'Osterhaus A']",1989,23,2,J Virol Methods,"Groen J, et al.

It has become clear that it is more prevalent than leptospirosis or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Accurate diagnosis of the disease is necessary for the selection of effective antimicrobial agents which can prevent fatalities and shorten the course. For the diagnosis, various serologic tests are used. Sensitivity and specificity of a test depend on various factors. In this report, microbiological aspects of the infection were briefly described and the Weil-Felix, indirect immunofluorescence and indirect immunoperoxidase tests were compared for their applicability in routine use and usefulness in the diagnosis.

Almost half of the patients who suffered this disease manifested a decrease in the capacity of the kidneys for osmotic concentration of urine under the conditions of deprivation for 36 hours, and in acid-secretory function of the kidneys under induced acidosis and clearance of uric acid. Ultrasonic studies demonstrated that part of the patients had uni- or bilateral indurations in the renal parenchyma. In 16% of the examined, these alterations may be related to superaddition of pyelonephritis after HFNS. The nature of tubulointerstitial lesions remains unknown in other cases and thus requires a further study. The recovery of tubular functions of the kidneys following HFNS continues for 3 years. In view of this fact patients with a history of this disease need prolonged follow-up.","['Sirotin BZ', 'Shapiro IA', 'Maneshin VN']",1989,61,12,Ter Arkh,"Sirotin BZ, et al.

2573914,Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hantaviruses, the causative agents of HFRS, have become more widely recognized. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that these pathogens are distributed worldwide. People who come into close contact with infected rodents in urban, rural and laboratory environments are at particular risk. Transmission to man occurs mainly via the respiratory tract. The epidemiology of the hantaviruses is intimately linked to the ecology of their principal vertebrate hosts. Four distinct viruses are now recognized within the hantavirus genus and that number is likely to increase to six very soon; however, further investigations are necessary. Much more work is still needed before we fully understand the wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms of HFRS as well as the pathogenicity of the different viruses in the hantavirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. HFRS is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone and serological evidence is often needed. A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer in a 1-week interval, and the presence of the IgM type of antibodies against hantaviruses are good evidence for an acute hantavirus infection. Physicians should be alert for HFRS each time they deal with patients with acute febrile flu-like illness, renal failure of unknown origin and sometimes hepatic dysfunction. Especially the mild form of HFRS is difficult to diagnose. Acute onset, headache, fever, increased serum creatinine, proteinuria and polyuria are signs and symptoms compatible with a mild form of HFRS. Differential diagnosis should be considered for the following diseases in the endemic areas of HFRS: acute renal failure, hemorrhagic scarlet fever, acute abdomen, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, spotted fevers, non-A, non-B hepatitis, Colorado tick fever, septicemia, dengue, heartstroke and DIC. Treatment of HFRS is mainly supportive. Recently, however, treatment of HFRS patients with ribavirin in China and Korea, within 7 days after onset of fever, resulted in a reduced mortality as well as shortened course of illness.","['Lee HW', 'van der Groen G']",1989,36,,Prog Med Virol,Lee HW and van der Groen G.

In these rats, no virus was detected in the peritoneal macrophages, lung, kidney, and brain. The immune serum infusion before the virus challenge also conferred protection to rats against an intramuscular or subcutaneous challenge of strain SR, but did not protect the rats against intracerebral challenge of the virus. In the rats which received the immune serum after the challenge, infection was not prevented, although some of the animals were protected from the death. Virus titers in the lung, kidney, and brain of the rats were reduced by the transfer of the immune serum even as late as 72 hr after the challenge. Cross-protection in the rats which received the immune serum was strong between strains SR and KI-262 within the same serotype, but very weak between strains SR and Hantaan 76-118 of different serotypes.","['Zhang XK', 'Takashima I', 'Hashimoto N']",1989,105,3-4,Arch Virol,"Zhang XK, et al.

Comparing with normal controls, there was statistical significance (P less than 0.05) with the exception of fibrinogen. The degree of abnormality corresponded with the severity of the disease. With the observation of serial curves of these processes and renal function, we found out that there was correlation between them. Correlation analysis suggested that pathological coagulation and fibrinolysis could cause renal lesion or exacerbate it (P less than 0.05). The lesion affects mainly the glomerular filtration; whether it affects the tubular function or not is uncertain.","['Gong ZJ', 'Wu ZO', 'Guan MY']",1989,28,1,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Gong ZJ, et al.

Wistar newborn rats inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with SR-11, which was isolated from a laboratory rat associated with an outbreak of HFRS, developed clinical signs such as ataxia and limb paralysis and died at about 18 days after inoculation. The LD50 of SR-11 in 1-day-old rats was 10(1.2) focus-forming units (FFU). In contrast, the animals inoculated i.p. or intracerebrally with 10(4) FFU of KI-262, which was from a wild rat in a dumping-ground area--an enzootic focus where no human cases have been recorded--did not show any significant clinical signs. The susceptibility of rats to SR-11 fatal infection was age-dependent. Virus titers in brains, lungs, kidneys, and livers of the rats inoculated with SR-11 were significantly higher than those in the same organs of the animals infected with KI-262.

Elevations of irANP and PRA were not correlated in each group. Also systemic blood pressure as well as heart beats were significantly increased in the oliguric phase.

A serological survey of laboratory white rats and of laboratory personnel for antibodies to hantaviruses was conducted in Singapore. Forty-four per cent (143/329) of rats were seropositive by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test but none had hantaviral antigens in lung tissues. Two of 74 laboratory personnel were seropositive but neither had a history of clinical illness. The high seropositivity rate among laboratory rats led to their replacement with Hantaan virus-free strains. To eliminate the hazard of laboratory-acquired HFRS, regular serological screening of laboratory rats and replacement of infected animals with seronegative stocks should be implemented. High risk techniques with laboratory rats, which are likely to generate aerosols, should be performed in biological safety cabinets. Serological surveillance of laboratory personnel and reporting of suspected HFRS cases are useful in the early detection of hantavirus infection.","['Wong TW', 'Chan YC', 'Yap EH', 'Joo YG', 'Lee HW', 'Lee PW', 'Yanagihara R', 'Gibbs CJ', 'Gajdusek DC']",1988,17,4,Int J Epidemiol,"Wong TW, et al.

2902191,Antigenic relationship between hantaviruses analysed by immunoprecipitation.,"Antigenic relationships between seven hantaviruses isolated in Sweden, Belgium, Korea, European U.S.S.R. and Asian U.S.S.R. were studied by radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA) and indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFT). Animal immune sera and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patient sera from the above countries were used. The strains fell into three antigenic groups by both RIPA and IFT: nephropathia epidemica (NE)-type, Korean haemorrhagic fever (KHF)-type and urban rat-type. This antigenic grouping conforms to the clinical grouping of the respective HFRS patients. The major cross-reactive antigen between the antigenic groups was the nucleocapsid protein. Of the two viral glycoproteins, the G2 exhibited weak cross-reactivity between the groups, while the G1 protein appeared to be the least cross-reactive. Patient sera collected at different intervals after the onset of disease showed a marked difference in their capacity to immunoprecipitate the homologous viral glycoproteins, although by IFT all sera had high titres. Host species-related antibody response differences were found by both RIPA and IFT. Using patient sera, a one-way cross-reactivity was seen between the NE-type and the KHF-type viruses. However, animal immune sera clearly demonstrated a reciprocal cross-reactivity between the two virus groups.","['Sheshberadaran H', 'Niklasson B', 'Tkachenko EA']",1988,69 ( Pt 10),,J Gen Virol,"Sheshberadaran H, et al.

3410155,Development of cardiac beat rate in early chick embryos is regulated by regional cues.,"The mesoderm of each of the paired lateral heart-forming regions (HFRs) in the stage 5-7 chick embryo includes prospective conus (pre-C), ventricle (pre-V), and sinoatrial (pre-SA) cells, arranged in a rostrocaudal sequence (C-V-SA). With microsurgery we divided each HFR into three rostrocaudally arranged segments. After 24 hr of further incubation, each segment differentiated into a spontaneously beating vesicle of heart tissue to form a multiheart embryo. The cardiac vesicles in these embryos expressed left-right and rostrocaudal beat rate gradients: the left caudal pre-SA mesoderm produced tissue with the fastest beat rate of the six while the rostral vesicle formed from right pre-C was the slowest. In another operation, we prevented the HFRs from fusing in the midline by cutting through the anterior intestinal portal at stage 8, to produce cardia bifida (CB) embryos with an independently beating half-heart on each side. In these cases, the left half-heart of 87.2% of CB embryos beat faster than the right, confirming the left-right difference in intrinsic beat rate. To assess whether the future beat rate of each region is already determined in the st 5-7 HFR, we exchanged rectangular fragments of left pre-SA mesoderm and attached endoderm with right pre-C fragments to yield a left HFR with the sequence C-V-C and a right HFR with the sequence SA-V-SA. A CB operation was subsequently performed on these exchange embryos to prevent fusion of the lateral HFRs. Preconus mesoderm, transplanted to the pre-SA region, differentiated into tissue with a rapid beat rate, while pre-SA mesoderm relocated to the preconus region formed heart tissue with a slow spontaneous rate typical of the conus. In 73% of the exchange CB embryos, the left half-heart beat faster than the right, despite the origins of its mesoderm. The exchanged mesoderm developed a rate that was appropriate for its new location rather than the site of origin of the mesodermal fragment. In a third set of operations, we implanted a fragment of st 15 differentiated conus tissue into a site lateral to the left caudal HFR in st 5, 6, and 7 embryos, and subsequently performed CB operations on them. The implant caused the adjacent half-heart to develop with a slower beat rate than in unoperated or sham-operated controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Satin J', 'Fujii S', 'DeHaan RL']",1988,129,1,Dev Biol,"Satin J, et al.

These cytotoxic effector cells, with Lyt2+ L3T4- markers on their surface, demonstrated H-2 restriction. CTLs induced by Hantaan virus (76-118 strain) or Seoul virus (B-1 strain) showed cross-reactivity with infected target cells. Hantaan virus infection induced a higher CTLs response than Seoul virus infection, although the antibody responses to these two viruses and the replication of the two virus strains in athymic nude mice were not significantly different. Viral antigen detected with a monoclonal antibody reacting with nucleocapsid antigen was observed mainly in the cytoplasm of macrophages infected with Hantaan virus, but in the nucleus of cells infected with Seoul virus. The major viral antigens recognized by CTLs are discussed on the basis of these findings.","['Asada H', 'Tamura M', 'Kondo K', 'Dohi Y', 'Yamanishi K']",1988,69 ( Pt 9),,J Gen Virol,"Asada H, et al.

This communication reports the development of a mu-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to PUU virus in human sera. Acute- and early-convalescent-phase sera (collected 1 to 41 days after disease onset) from 29 Swedish patients with clinical NE were tested for PUU virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence test and ELISA, respectively. Late-convalescent-phase serum was also collected from 18 of these patients 3 to 24 months postinfection and assayed. The IgM ELISA values were strongly positive in sera collected during the first 2 months; at 3 to 9 months, they were negative or in the lower range of significance, and at 24 months all sera were negative. Paired sera from NE patients often fail to show seroconversion or a significant titer rise when tested by indirect immunofluorescence. Since all acute- and early-convalescent-phase sera were positive by IgM ELISA, this test could become an important tool for early diagnosis of acute human NE infections.","['Niklasson B', 'Kjelsson T']",1988,26,8,J Clin Microbiol,Niklasson B and Kjelsson T.

2898848,[Effect of weather conditions in an epidemic season on the nature of the morbidity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome].,"The epidemic manifestation of the most active natural foci of HFRS in the USSR on the territory of Bashkiria is described. The authors compare two epidemic seasons of 1975-1976 and 1977-1978. Besides the number of rodents, the rise of morbidity is influenced by their early multiplication and weather conditions. The early appearance of the stable snow cover facilitates a rapid drop in the number of NFRS cases as early as in October, while prolonged autumn with rains, snow, periods of thaw and ice-covered ground leads to a rise in NFRS morbidity occurring in autumn and winter and ending only in March. Weather conditions also influence the epidemiological structure of morbidity.","['Nurgaleeva RG', 'Mustafin NM', 'Stepanenko AG', 'Savinova TI']",1988,,3,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Nurgaleeva RG, et al.

In the sera of the newborn, IgG titers of maternal antibody ranged from 1:64 to 1:256 just after birth, reached a peak titer around 1:2,048 at 2 weeks after birth, then declined and disappeared at about 8 weeks of age. No IgA and IgM antibodies were detected in the sera of fetuses and newborns. After intraperitoneal challenge by strain SR-11 (10(2.2) LD50), death and infection of 2-day-old rats from immune dams were prevented by the presence of maternal antibody.

High levels of IgG antibodies to HV were common, even in the acute phase of illness. Over a 5-year period, a total of 35% of the NE suspected patients revealed antibodies to HV, but this varied considerably in the different years. In 2 endemic areas the serological confirmation of the NE diagnosis was 60%. 82% of the seropositive NE patients lived in 4 endemic areas. The bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) was common in all areas and predominant in 2. The wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) was abundant in the other 2. In years with high bank vole population, the number of seropositive NE cases increased, with a peak in October/November. When the bank vole population was low, the relatively few seropositive NE cases occurred more regularly throughout the year. Subclinical infections were common.

3151765,Coagulopathy in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Korea (Korean hemorrhagic fever) is an acute viral disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal failure. In Korean patients, the disease manifests more distinctive bleeding tendencies than those of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome found in western countries. To investigate the nature and role of the coagulation, fibrinolysis, kinin and immune system in the pathogenesis of such a hemorrhagic manifestation, alterations of these systems were assessed from the early phase of the disease. Decreased platelet count and shortened platelet survival were observed with giant platelets in the peripheral blood. The marked prolongations of bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were noticed with the decreased plasma activities of coagulation factors II, V, VIII, IX and X. Shortened half life of fibrinogen, increased fibrinogen-fibrin degradation product, with decreased plasma levels and activities of plasminogen, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and antithrombin III were found. On thrombelastogram, the existence of procoagulant activity was confirmed, and prolonged reaction time and clot formation time with decreased maximum amplitude were observed. The appearance of circulating immune complexes was found along with decreased C3 and normal C4 in the serum. Significant decrease of serum C3 was evident in the patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings of coagulopathy were normalized within ten days of the illness in most cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombocytopenia in the early phase, and azotemia developing later might play an important role in the pathogenesis of bleeding tendency in Korean hemorrhagic fever.",['Lee M'],1987,2,4,J Korean Med Sci,Lee M.

In addition, sera from persons with unidentified illnesses were collected from state public health laboratories in Washington state and Virginia. One of 85 sera (1.2%) from Forestry Service personnel in Mississippi and one of 79 sera (1.3%) from Forestry Service personnel in Virginia, and nine of 360 sera (2.5%) from Forestry Service and Geological Service personnel in Alaska were tested by immunofluorescent assay and were found to have antibody to Hantaan, Tchoupitoulas, or Prospect Hill viruses, ranging in titer from 1:32 to 1:512. Those persons questioned revealed no renal disease, hemorrhagic phenomenon, or unidentified febrile illnesses. Sera from two persons in Virginia, collected at the time of an illness, had antibody titers of 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, to Prospect Hill virus.

2891308,"Prospective seroepidemiology of hantaviruses and population dynamics of small mammal communities of Baltimore, Maryland.","We used a prospective seroepidemiological study, in conjunction with a mark-release-recapture protocol, to investigate the transmission of hantaviruses in four rodent species from Baltimore, Maryland, from June 1984 to June 1986. A total of 1,208 captures of 762 rodents provided 984 individual blood samples. The antibody prevalence, as determined by frequency of reciprocal indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers greater than or equal to 32, was 33.9% in rats (Rattus norvegicus, n = 466), 28.3% in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus, n = 67), 1.4% in house mice (Mus musculus, n = 146), and 1.2% in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus, n = 83). Populations of all rodents were maximal during the fall and winter months, but population trends were not clearly associated with periods of virus transmission. The mean incidence of seroconversion to a Hantavirus for rats was 12.06/100 rats/month, but incidence rates could not be established for other species. Rats which seroconverted were generally sexually mature animals, and there was evidence of transmission throughout the year. Animals which seroconverted to a Hantavirus achieved high IFA titers, and remained seropositive for the duration of the study.","['Childs JE', 'Glass GE', 'Korch GW', 'LeDuc JW']",1987,37,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Childs JE, et al.
